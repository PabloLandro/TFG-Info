Mayo Clinic endorsed acupuncture By Astara on January 11, 2009 12:49 AM | Permalink | Comments (0) Ronald Reimer, M.D., Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Fla, in Mayo Clinic's Medical Edge Newspaper column of December 26, 2008, stated that "at Mayo Clinic, acupuncture has been used successfully for pain
management, postoperative nausea, anxiety relief, drug addiction,
insomnia and headaches, to name a few." He tells how acupuncture is becoming more mainstream and insurance coverage is becoming more common as insurers see that acupuncture can help reduce health care costs. Case studies on acupuncture's efficacy in tennis elbow, cancer recovery and post surgery nausea back up his statement that a growing body of research confirms the benefits of acupuncture.
