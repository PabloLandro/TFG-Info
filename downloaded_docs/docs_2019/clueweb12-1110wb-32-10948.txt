September 28, 2010 By Natalia Real, Contributing Columnist and Susan Callahan, Health Editor Unsightly earwax (cerumen) has a noble purpose: its perpetual slow flow is created by our bodies to protect, lubricate and clean our ear canals. If you relish the thought of sticking a cotton swab in your ear, twisting it, and pulling ear wax out (like I used to), be forewarned -- the ear canal inside our ears is so delicate that inserting a simple cotton swab in it can cause myriad problems.  As the adage goes, "you shouldn't put anything smaller than your elbow into your ear.” For instance, Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and Attending Physician at Packard Children's Hospital Alan Greene M.D. F.A.A.P. says this action can cause an infection in the ear canal or an injury to the skin lining the ear canal or the eardrum. Perforations to the eardrum could either heal on their own or require surgery. And Dr. Rod Moser, P.A., Ph.D. explains that hearing loss and a dry, itchy ear canal can also occur as a result of swabbing. The odds a person will visit an emergency room in the U.S. due to an accident caused by first-aid equipment (including inserting a cotton swab in one’s ear) in a year are a hefty 1 in 7,163, according to the Book of Odds. Some 4,000 cases of sudden deafness occur each year in the United States, and only 10-15% of these patients can pinpoint the cause, which may be cotton swab use. The Wrong Ways to Clean Your Ears Deep swabbing of the ear can be dangerous for three reasons. First, if you have a lot of wax in your ear canal, inserting the swab into it may compact the wax, which can transform a partial blockage into a complete blockage. Second, you could harm your ear drum if you unwittingly insert the swab too deeply (it’s not like we can see in there as we swab, after all). Finally, you could cause a painful infection of the canal called "swimmer's ear" if you scratch or abrade your ear canal skin, says Douglas Hoffman, M.D., Ph.D. The Right Way to Clean Your Ears - a Step by Step Guide 1) Let Your Ears Clean Themselves- The safest way to clean yours ears is to wait for the hairs within the canal plus our jaw movements to transport the wax out to the surface of the ear, where it becomes visible. 2) Wipe Where the Wax Is Visible Only -Now it can be wiped away with a washcloth or a finger without inserting anything into the canal. Ear swabs can also be used -- if used correctly. This means swabbing the outer portion of the ear (called the pinnea), or the opening of the ear, but never the ear canal itself. Another option is washing the outer ear and behind the ear using soap and water, being careful to not allow much water to enter the canal. In general, try to keep water out of your ear canal. This is especially true when you are washing your hair. If you use dye, cover your ears with plastic ear cups before you dye your hair to keep the harsh chemical dyes from entering your delicate ear canal. 3) Be careful to dry your ears gently – again, without entering the ear canal. If water does get stuck in the canal, tilt your head to allow the water to drain out on its own. 4) Soften wax with ear drops - If there is too much wax in your ear canal or the wax is too thick, you can soften it with ear drops that thin the wax.  You can also gently apply a few drops of warmed olive or almond oils to each ear and let it set for several minutes to allow the oils to soften the wax and help lubricate the canal to aid the wax’s exit. If this does not work, do not try harsher methods. See your doctor or if you are in the UK, your GP or Practice Nurse. You're just getting started.
