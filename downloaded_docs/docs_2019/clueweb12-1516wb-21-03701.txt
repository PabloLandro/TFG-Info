  /resolutions/pitandFissure.htm AAPHD Resolution on Pit and Fissure Sealants Approved October 17, 1984 Background: There has been a growing body of scientific evidence that pit and fissure sealants are a safe and effective primary prevention clinical procedure. In December, 1983, a National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference unanimously endorsed the placement of dental sealants as a highly effective and safe means of preventive dental caries on the surfaces of noncarious teeth that contain pits and grooves. On April 19, 1984, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service endorsed the measure and urged health agency directors and practitioners to incorporate the use of sealants into their programs and practices, and to increase public awareness. The Department of Defense also implemented a policy supporting the use of sealants. The American Public Health Association has prepared a statement. Other leading national professional organizations, such as the American Dental Association, are also considering adopting similar policies.
