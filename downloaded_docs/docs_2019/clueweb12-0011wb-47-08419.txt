                Asthma Acupuncture for Asthma By Theresa Hi! my name is Theresa and I have had my serious problems most of my life. I went to talk and have
acupuncture done. I also am an advocate of chi kung. I can tell you there are no words to discribe how I am
honored to have such a wonderful dr. on my side. She has many degrees in other fields of medicine. My
own doctor just dopes me up. Anyway for the problem I went to see her for she also has stopped my cronic
asthyma. I have been two days with out using my nebulizer or inhalers or medicines. I have read many
articles on acupuncture and researched everything I can possibly find. This is the way to go. I do hope
others with cronic pain or diseases work on their chi. Your inner body is also important as well as your
outer body. I am so grateful to this women. I live in New Hampshire and if anyone needs a doctor for
medical reasons what so ever she is the best. I have been suffering for twenty or more years. Featured Products Wheezing Formula Calms
