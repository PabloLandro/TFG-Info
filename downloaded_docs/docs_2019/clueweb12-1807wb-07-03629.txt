This paper is well documented, full of statistics, and complete with charts.  The reader is easily guided from the beginning of the paper with the definition of a biomaterial right to the heart of issues such as the utilization of human tissue prompting intense ethical concerns regarding the ownership of human biomaterials, eugenics, discrimination, and medical confidentiality.  13.5 pgs.  20 f/c. 19b.

Toxoplasma gondii is a sporozoan parasite, and its definitive host is the cat. The organism was first identified in 1908 in the mononuclear cells of a North African rodent.  Toxoplasmosis is a disease transmitted to humans and animals by toxoplama gondii, often in cat excrement, or in undercooked meat. It causes flulike symptoms and damages the central nervous system, eyes, and visceral organs. Congenital toxoplasmosis, transmitted from an infected mother to her unborn child, can lead to blindness and retardation. Although toxoplasmosis is a rare disease, its incidence has increased since the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic.  Toxoplasma gondii belongs to Apicomplex parasite family. Research has recently shown that this family of parasites contains an intracellular structure more commonly associated with plants. This may allow for the formulation of new strategies for finding a cure for toxoplasmosis.  9.5 pgs.  22 f/c.  13b.

It often occurs in areas rife with malaria, and may be linked to an increased protection from severe malaria.  Also discussed: symptoms of SCD, treatments and gene therapies, and demographics.  6 pgs.  Bibliography lists 8 sources.
