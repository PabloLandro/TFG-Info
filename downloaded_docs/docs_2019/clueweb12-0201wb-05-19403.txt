However, studies concluding the opposite, that male circumcision offers some protection against heterosexually transmitted HIV, were presented at the conference today. One study that was rejected showed that condom distribution is 95 times more cost-effective than male circumcision in preventing the same number of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. “We are deeply concerned by the biases and one-sided view being given to AIDS experts around the world,” states study co-author and ICGI advisor, John Travis, MD, MPH. “Data showing circumcision is not cost-effective and that circumcision may cause serious harm in the HIV battle have been ignored.  Before the world health community spends millions, if not billions, of dollars on male circumcision programs, AIDS policy makers need to carefully consider all data on the risks and potential benefits of the use of male circumcision, not just selective data.” The published results of three African randomized clinical trials, conducted in optimal conditions with free condoms and extensive counseling, show that male circumcision was associated with lower rates of heterosexual HIV transmission during the 21 month to 24 month study periods. All three studies were cut short, and there have been no follow-ups. Other studies published since the trials have shown that male circumcision is not associated with lower HIV rates in the general population.
