        pressure Urge incontinence Part of the overactive bladder symptom syndrome Patients experience frequency, urgency and incontinence Due to detrusor muscle overactivity Overflow incontinence Occurs in both sexes Symptoms are often relatively few Patients tend to dribble urine Men often have a full and palpable bladder Women often have abnormal anatomy or a vesicovaginal fistula Investigation The following investigations should be considered Mid stream urine specimen Renal function PSA in men Renal ultrasound Flexible cystoscopy Urodynamic assessment evaluates the function of the bladder Results must be interpreted with the clinical presentation Assessment can involve Frequency-volume chart Pad test Flow rates Residual volume by ultrasound Conventional cystometry Videocysturethrography - filling and voiding Management Management of incontinence should start with general support This involves specialist nurses using appliances, pads, catheters 
        etc Specific treatment will depend on the underlying cause Urge incontinence Overactive bladder syndrome can be managed by Behaviour change Drugs - anti-muscarinic agents, desmopressin Surgery Surgical options include: Injection of botulinum toxin Neuromodulation Clam cystoplasty Detrusor myectomy Urinary diversion Stress incontinence Stress incontinence can be managed by: Physiotherapy Biofeedback Electrical stimulation Drugs - duloxetine Surgical options include: Burch colposuspension Anterior colporrhaphy Marshall-Marchett-Kranz procedure Needle suspension of bladder neck Pubovaginal slings Periurethral bulking agents Implantation of artificial sphincters Complications of urinary diversions Renal and intestinal reservoir stones Urinary tract infections Metabolic derangements Hyperchloraemic acidosis Bone demineralisation Gallstone Reservoir rupture Neoplasia Post-prostatectomy incontinence Is a transient phenomenon in many men Becomes a persistent problem in about 5% men Risk factors include Preoperative incontinence Neurological disease Previous pelvic or prostatic surgery Large benign prostate 75% cases due to sphincter damage 15% due to detrusor abnormality Conservative management improves symptoms in 50% patients Bibliography Bezerra C A,  Bruschini H,  Cody D J.  Traditional
