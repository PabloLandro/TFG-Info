                      Treatment For Migraines Acupuncture Treatment for Migraines Acupuncture is known as a traditional 

                                  Chinese medicine. Migraines are often a result 

                                  of reduced energy and or blood flow causing 

                                  pain to one or both sides of the head. The reduced 

                                  blood flow to the brain causes tension and lack 

                                  of oxygen to the brain. Many migraines start 

                                  as tension headaches, and grow stronger until 

                                  they are full-blown migraines. Acupuncture treats migraines by 

                                  relieving the tension. This is done by maximizing 

                                  the blood flow to the brain and giving the brain 

                                  the oxygen needed. During a 15 to 30 minute 

                                  acupuncture treatment the brain senses normalization 

                                  of blood flow, and as seen in numerous treatments 

                                  the blood vessels will constrict back to their 

                                  normal size, ending the migraine headache. Basically acupuncture approaches 

                                  migraines by reducing vasodilatation, which 

                                  is where the blood vessels from the brain widen 

                                  due to the relaxation of the smooth muscles 

                                  within the vessels wall; since there is now 

                                  more room for blood your blood pressure drops. 

                                  The reduction of the vasodilatation gives the 

                                  brain more blood, which is what the brain needs. The Chinese believe rather than 

                                  feeding the brain drugs to help with the pain 

                                  due to the lack of blood, why not give the brain 

                                  the blood it needs? Not only does it save you 

                                  from putting chemicals into your body, but it 

                                  helps solve the problem and gives the migraine 

                                  patient the relief from the bodys own 

                                  constriction of blood vessels. This approach prevents migraine 

                                  sufferers from having to deal with the side 

                                  effects of prescribed medications and reduces 

                                  chances of reoccurrences of migraines. It is
