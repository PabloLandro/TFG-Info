This treatment mechanism is for individuals with high alcohol dependence and it involves abrupt stop of alcohol intake allied with with the substitution of alcohol. This substitution is combined with certain drugs which pose similar effects so that there are no withdrawal symptoms. The reason why the term detoxification is a misnomer is that the detox process do not involve removing the toxic substances from the body as the name suggests. Detoxification may or may not be necessary depending upon an individual’s age, medical status, and history of alcohol intake. There are lot of alcohol drug detox available in the market. Some of these drugs include the Benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan) or oxazepam (Serax). These mentioned varieties are most commonly used drugs whcih are used to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. What are some of the withdrawal symptoms? Withdrawal symptoms in the case of Alcohol Detox include: feeling sick, trembling, sweating, craving for alcohol and just feeling awful. Sometimes, convulsions occur in a small number of cases. As a result, you drink alcohol regularly and depend on it to prevent these symptoms. Delirium tremens (DTs) is a more severe reaction after stopping alcohol. It occurs in about 1 in 20 people who have alcohol withdrawal symptoms about 2-3 days after their last drink. Symptoms include: marked tremor (the shakes) and delirium (agitation, confusion and seeing and hearing things that are not there). There are several alcohol treatment patterns in which Benzodiazepines can be used to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The first option takes into consideration the varying degrees of tolerance. In it, a standard dose of the benzodiazepine is given every half hour until light sedation is reached. Once a baseline dose is determined, the medication is tapered over the ensuing 3–10 days. Other option is to give a standard dose of benzodiazepine based on history and adjust based on withdrawal phenomenon.
