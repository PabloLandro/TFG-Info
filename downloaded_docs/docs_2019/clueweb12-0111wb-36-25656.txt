Sexual health experts claim there is overwhelming evidence to support the notion that male circumcision significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection between heterosexual couples. Trials in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa have revealed that circumcised men are 60 per cent less likely to catch HIV from a woman than men who have not had the snip. Indeed, the results were so conclusive that the trials were ended early so that the international organisations could be notified. Catherine Hankins of UNAIDS emphasised that male circumcision only helped to cut the risk of infection and that it is not a preventative measure. "Male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV," she said. "Men and women who consider male circumcision as an HIV preventive method must continue to use other forms of protection such as male and female condoms, delaying sexual debut and reducing the number of sexual partners." However, the studies found no link between circumcision in men and a reduced risk of HIV infection in women.
