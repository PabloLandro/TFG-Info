Hooping cough is a common misspelling of whooping cough. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a bacterial infection of the respiratory system. The bacteria that cause this disease are spread through direct contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions, which can be passed either through the air or by touching a contaminated surface. Whooping cough is typically characterized by severe coughing spells that may end in a "whooping" sound when the person inhales. Treatment may involve antibiotics and supportive care; an immunization is also available to help prevent the condition. (Click Whooping Cough for more information about this condition, including what causes it, how it is diagnosed, and what specific treatments are available. You can also click any of the links in the box to the right for specific information.)
