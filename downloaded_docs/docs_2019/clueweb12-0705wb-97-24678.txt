Providing the right micro environment for the wound bed removes barriers to healing and stimulates the healing process. Melcare's Manuka Wound Gel  can be used for the treatment of traumatic/acute and surgical wounds, chronic wounds and malodorous and sloughy wounds. Melcare's Manuka Wound Gel low pH and high osmotic potential also helps protect the wound from contamination and colonisation by bacteria. It also rapidly deodorises wounds to help protect them from fly strike. Melcare's Manuka Wound Gel is made from Leptospermum sp. honey (80%), contains natural oils to protect wound margins and seaweed derived hydrocolloids to enhance honey's properties as a wound dressing. The medical honey used is minimally heat treated to preserve its natural properties and irradiated to destroy bacterial spores. DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Apply a generous quantity (approx. 3 mm layer) directly onto the wound or an appropriate dressing. Precautions: Serious, infected or non-responding wounds should be managed under professional advice.
