"> What is Asthma? ← RAD Asthma Treatment Without Drugs – Natural Remedies and Sensible Advice – 5 Tips For Effective Therapy Posted on February 25, 2012 by 0 With the reawakened interest in natural treatment of disease, and with the desire to avoid medications, many asthmatic patients are looking to natural or non-pharmaceutical treatments of asthma. Here are 5 proven tips to treat your asthma without drugs: 1. Rid your house and environment of all possible allergens . Many patients have on-going asthma symptoms because they have chronic exposure to a pet, dust, mold, fumes, pollen, or other irritants. Just because you don’t suffer an acute asthma attack when you are around your dog does not mean that your pet is not contributing to your asthma. There are many factors involved in asthma, some of which contribute to an acute attack, and others which worsen the disease on a chronic basis. The only way to know for sure is to rid your environment of the potential irritant long enough for your lungs to settle down. This would take at least a matter of weeks, and sometimes as long as a few months. Allergy desensitization shots are another route to better breathing, for those unwilling to take a prolonged vacation from their pets. 2. Stop smoking . It seems like this should go without saying, but smoking is absolutely one of the worst lung irritants. Yet many patients continue to smoke, believing their symptoms are unrelated. While it’s true, smoking is probably not the only factor, it IS a factor, whether you admit it or not. Strange, that some people interested in natural therapies still smoke, but then again, I suppose nicotine is a “natural” substance as well. So are hemlock, and botulism, and cyanide. 3. Avoid contracting respiratory infections. Many asthma exacerbations (attacks) are caused by underlying infection. Though if you are seeking natural remedies for asthma you may not believe in flu shots either, the annual flu vaccine is a great idea for asthma and COPD patients. Most respiratory infections are spread via hand contact, rather than through the air. Avoid shaking hands when infection rates are high in your community, watch out for doorknobs and bannisters, wash your hands after handling money, and avoid public places with lots of people. 4. Consider caffeine. Usually doctors are advising patients to avoid caffeine, but in the case of asthma, it may actually help. Caffeine is a methylxanthine, similar to the drug theophylline, an old-time asthma prescription. This class of drugs does open the airways, but has the potential side-effects of insomnia, anxiety, and palpitations. But many people tolerate caffeine just fine, and may find they breathe better after a cup or two of java. 5. Consider complementary or alternative medicine . The National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine offers up-to-date research on complementary medicine. Studies have shown that magnesium citrate (340 mg. daily) helps many asthmatic patients breathe better when taken regularly. Likewise, traditional Chinese herbs have shown benefit in preliminary studies, specifically Radix glycyrrhizae and Sophora flavescens. As a family physician I have seen the first 4 suggestions work time and time again. I have not yet prescribed magnesium nor Chinese herbal medicine. Do not discard your rescue inhaler or other medications without checking with your doctor. Although being able to live a healthy life drug-free is a worthy goal, assuring adequate breathing is vital, even if it requires medication. Copyright 2010 Cynthia J.
