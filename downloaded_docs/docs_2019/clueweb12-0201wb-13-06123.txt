The Colitis may be an acute or chronic membrane inflammation. Individuals with colitis may experience stomach pains, diarrhea, and other abdominal disturbances.  To understand colitis, one must be know what the colon is all about.  The colon is the part of the large intestine extending from the cecum to the rectum.  The colon is largely responsible for maintaining water balance in the intestine.  Another function of the colon is the absorption of some vitamins such as vitamin K. When a colon is healthy, stools have enough liquidity to be soft and pass on the intestines.  When the liquidity reaches a high level, dehydration may occur.  A injury on the colon, or instances that necessitate the removal of the colon, would mean that stools would have have high liquidity or would be so watery. In individuals who have colitis, the colon will appear read and swollen when viewed through a scope exam.  The stomach pain is partly caused by the frequent ejection of stool or diarrhea since the colon cannot absorb water.  The result brought about by the malfunctioning colon may result into the damages on the lining of the large intestine.  With this damage, the release of surface cells occur with the passage of stools with blood and mucus.  The kind of white blood cells that are in the lining of the intestine determines some reasons of the inflammation in the intestine itself.   An examination of the stool may reveal the presence of white blood cells.  The very fact of the presence of white blood cells indicate an infection somewhere in the body. There are some natural remedies that may help in the reduction of inflammation associated with some forms of colitis, particularly ulcerative colitis. Colloidal Silver, and Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish oil and flaxseed, are available in pill form or as enemas. To reduce the risk of contracting colitis, a balanced diet that focuses on fiber and protein are important.   Protein is especially important since adequate amounts of protein affects healing and reduces the possibility of muscle loss. (Note that the intestine if a kind of muscle.)  Fiber is broken down in the colon into short chain fatty acids. The colon uses these short chain fatty acids as an energy source.   Adequate fluid intake also helps in reducing the risk of contracting the disease. Peter Salazarâ€™s source for quality supplements is www.utopiasilver.com. To read more information on Colitis Free!
