Orthotic Insoles That Address the Forefoot! Traditional running shoe insoles and custom orthotic insoles have relied on an over-the-counter, one-shape-fits-all approach, focusing on the arch for temporary pain relief. However, orthotic insoles are a complex piece of equipment. Foot orthotics use multiple moving parts that act as "shock absorbers" for the foot, legs, hips and the entire body. Traditional orthotic insoles only block the arch as a means of control designed to merely displace the body's impact-- in ways that can lead to increased foot pain, poor performance and even permanent injury. Foot orthotics that incorporate an arch-centered approach to the foot are often unsuccessful, because these types of low quality custom orthotic insoles do not properly address common foot injuries caused by an imbalance of the forefoot. Feel the difference that biocorrect orthotic insoles and custom orthotic insoles can make.  Biocorrect custom orthotic insoles are great for orthotic insoles running shoe, orthotic insoles tennis shoes and orthotic insoles dress shoes.
