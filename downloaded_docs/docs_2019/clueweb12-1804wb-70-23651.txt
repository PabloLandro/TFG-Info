Women’s  feet  tend  to  be  physically  dissimilar  from  those  of  men.  For  instance,  the  quadriceps  angle  (or  Q  angle)  in  a  woman’s  foot  is  commonly  larger,  which  means  that  the  mutual  foot  or  foot-related  injuries  for  men  and  women  will  tend  to  be  be  different,  even  if  they  carry out  similar  activities.

This  type  of  pain  may  go  all  the  way  up  to  one’s  spine,  so  it  is  no  surprise  that  supporting  the  feet  improves  the  condition  of  other  body  parts,  as  well. 2.

Spenco  insoles  are  also  designed  for  versatility.  Their  use  is  not  confined  to  sports  shoes.  You  may  use  them  with  work  shoes  or  boots,  as  well.  However,  shoes  with  strange  styles  or  shapes  might  cause  some  difficulty. 3.  There  are,  of  course,  a  few  negative  points  regarding  this  foot  care  product.
