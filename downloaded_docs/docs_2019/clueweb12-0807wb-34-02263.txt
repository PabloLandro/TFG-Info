Dr. Michael Clary, a family doctor and an associate professor for the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, says the Center for Disease Control recommends children up to six years of age to be vaccinated, and adults to be vaccinated every ten years. "It can be dangerous. With children, it could rupture their lungs and in some reports they have had bleeding in the brain," said Clary. Clary tells us the infection can spread quick, but if you are vaccinated, there is a very slim chance you will contract 'whooping cough'. He says the symptoms begin very similar to those of a common cold, and afer a few weeks the coughing gets worse, having a deeper sound. The infection is typically treated with antibiotics.
