                                  Those Suffering From: Severe Migraines Minor Headaches Arthritis Dizziness Tinnitis Heart Disease Fibromylagia Diabetes What Are Migraine Headaches? There are headaches, and then there are migraine headaches . And anyone who has ever experienced a true migraine headache, can tell you that they are in a completely different league . A headache occurs when muscle contractions cause mild to moderate head pain that may come and go over time. And granted, although there are many different types of headaches, they can range from uncomfortable to darn right miserable. On the other hand, a migraine headache involves blood vessel contractions that can produce severe, excruciating and often debilitating pain . They are often experienced as a type of almost unbearable throbbing, pounding pain that can be accompanied by sensitivity to light, noise, and smells; loss of appetite; upset stomach to the point of nausea or even vomiting; dizziness and blurred vision, among other symptoms. Who Gets Migraine Headaches? The National Headache Foundation reports that roughly 45 million Americans suffer from headaches each year. And more than 28 million of these Americans suffer from actual migraine headaches. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incidence of migraine headaches has increased by nearly 60 percent in all age groups in recent years. Furthermore, three times more women than men get migraines. An estimated 8.7 percent of females and 2.6 percent of males in the United States suffer from migraines. One factor behind the higher incidence of migraines in women may be hormone imbalances , as women typically get migraines around the time of menstruation or ovulation when hormones can fluctuate greatly. What Triggers Migraine Headaches? Certain situations are well known as triggers for migraine headaches . Particular lights, sounds or odors may bring on an attack. Changes in humidity or barometric pressure may be triggers, as well. Alterations in eating habits, or eating certain foods such as chocolate or foods with nitrate preservatives, and even drinking alcohol may bring on a migraine. Other triggers include stress and estrogen therapy - 30% of women have increased attacks when taking birth-control pills, for example. Though it is important to be aware of possible trigger events that could cause migraines, changing your behavior does not always work to reduce the frequency and intensity of your migraine, which is why there is MigroSol . Especially in those situations that may be out of your control , such as the weather, MigroSol can be there to help you. Editor's Note : Here's a tip: Migraine headaches can be temporaily alleviated by having someone massage the muscles in the back of your neck and your shoulders. Plus, simply drinking plenty of water will also help reduce the pressure in your head. By following these simple tips and taking our all natural migraine remedy - MigroSol , you can lessen your migraine headaches. Don't Continue Suffering - MigroSol Can Help! The Problem With Pharmaceutical Migraine Treatments Over-the-counter or prescription medicines may be temporary and provide a quick solution when a migraine comes on.  However, as is the case with all medications, over-the-counter pain medications can have side effects , especially stomachaches in some patients. Furthermore, they may cause complications with drug interactions . Worse yet, over-use of such medications can actually lead to more frequent headaches , a phenomenon known as rebound headache. When over-the-counter medications are not helpful, the next step is often the use of more powerful prescription medications or alternative therapies. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including those available without a prescription, work by reducing the inflammation of the cerebral blood vessels. Because pills tend to be absorbed more slowly during migraine attacks, you will have to take these when you suspect an onset of migraine or use it in a faster acting form such as injections, nasal sprays, or suppositories. Some of the most effective NSAIDs include indomethacin given as a rectal suppository and ketorolac, which is an injection that requires a doctor’s prescription. In many cases, the success ratio for using drug treatments are very small and since many drugs are diuretics and can reduce fluids , a trip to a hospital emergency room for a shot and I.V. replenishment of potassium can be needed. In such cases, vomiting can contribute to low potassium levels. All in all, pharmaceutical drugs can only manipulate the body to temporarily relieve symptoms. They do not solve the root of the issue and can be deleterious for health ! Don't subject your body to harmful drugs that don't help to solve the problem! Can Migraines Be Stopped? Although there's still no "cure," migraine pain management has improved dramatically in the last decade. Recent developments in brain chemistry and pain management offer hope of relief for people that suffer from migraines. However, many times, the medications doctors prescribe cannot fully relieve the debilitating pain of a migraine, or they simply quit working after a while because they don’t address the fundamental problem of the disorder. Luckily, MigroSol picks up where the leading pain medication and prevention methods leave off. MigroSol is a natural remedy , not a drug, that works to address the root cause(s) of the condition. By combining the best tested and proven natural ingredients known to combat migraines, our exclusive all natural formula cannot be matched by any others! You Can Use MigroSol for: Frequent and Severe Migraine Attacks Associated Symptoms of Migraines Migraines Caused by Food, Hormonal Imbalance, Hypoglycemia Migraines Caused by Magnesium Deficiency Migraines Caused by Stressful and Hectic Lifestyles Migraines Caused by General Unhealth - Emotional and Physical "I use it 100 percent of the time with my patients for migraines because it usually works. It’s a good alternative for people who have tried everything else." - Jennifer Brett, N.D., a naturopathic doctor in Stratford, Connecticut. How Can MigroSol Help Relieve My Migraines? MigroSol is a standardized herbal supplement often used for effective relief of migraine headaches . One of the main ingredients of MigroSol is an extract from the butterbur root (Petasites hybridus), which used in conjunction with the other active ingredients, inhibits the synthesis of certain leukotrienes, substances that can cause spasms and inflammation . It is the antispasmodic effect that seems to provide effective support against migraines. So MigroSol works to combat your migraine by attacking the symptoms AND underlying cause - it is both an 'Abortive' and 'Preventive' therapy. In a study of the purified form of butterbur root extract , in patients with migraines, the extract appeared to be effective at reducing the frequency of migraine attacks . In a supervised study, patients who took the extract twice a day for up to 12 weeks had a 50% reduction in migraine frequency after 12 weeks. By comparison, patients taking a placebo experienced reductions in the frequency of their migraines by only 10%. Patients in the treatment group also reported shorter duration and intensity of pain , but these effects were less obvious and therefore less conclusive - Alexander Mauskop, MD, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. Another powerful ingredient in MigroSol is Feverfew . It has regained its deserved reputation as a primary remedy in the treatment of migraine headaches . It may also help arthritis when it is in the painfully active inflammatory stage. Dizziness , nausea and tinnitus may be eased, as well, especially if it is used in conjunction with other remedies. Depression , painful periods and sluggish menstrual flow can also be relieved by Feverfew. It is the only herb used in European phytotherapy known to be specific for the treatment of migraine . It is also the best example of a remedy well known to medical herbalists that has recently been accepted and used by allopathic medicine . Part of the herb's action appears to be an inhibition of certain secretions  from platelets and neutrophils in the blood. This may be relevant to the therapeutic value of Feverfew in migraine and other conditions such as osteo-arthritis . Through wide media coverage in recent years, the herb has gained a well deserved reputation as a supposed "cure" for migraine . For best results, combine MigroSol with a daily dose of Mega Factor to ensure that your body is receiving its daily dose of all necessary nutrients to keep healthy and free from Migraines.
