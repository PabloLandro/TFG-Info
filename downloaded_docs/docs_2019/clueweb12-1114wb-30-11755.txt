Eight years later, the London-based hypnotherapist Valerie Austin published a book in which she listed other published scientific studies going back as far as 1968, one of which reported a 94% success rate for hypnotherapy after a follow-up period of eighteen months. In Contrast: NHS methods fail 93% of smokers when the results are reviewed one year from the start of treatment. In late 2005, the U.K. Department of Health finally decided to assess the long-term outcomes of its NHS Stop Smoking programme, which began in 2001.  Previously, all NHS “success rates” were based on the number of smokers who had reported not smoking for four weeks - they were never previously monitored after that point, and as it turns out, nearly all of them relapsed. So if you ever tried any of those methods and they did not work, or you only quit smoking temporarily, you did not fail - the method fails nearly everyone.  They just didn’t tell you that. This four-week model of assessing performance closely mirrors the original trials of nicotine replacement products, in which the results after only six weeks were accepted as the official “success rate” of the products.  If the approval bodies had only assessed those results over a one-year period, N.R.T. products would never have been approved in the first place.  Why? Because: Willpower Alone The independent Iowa study - which was described by New Scientist at the time as being the “largest ever scientific comparison of ways of breaking the habit” - looked at all methods available then, including willpower.  The success rate arrived at for willpower alone was only 6%, which proves that willpower is simply a poor quitting method (see the Willpower Myth page on this site).  The recent Borland Report into the long-term outcomes of NHS Stop Smoking Services discovered that 93.5% of smokers using those services would still be smoking at the one year follow-up, which puts the success rate at 6.5%… almost exactly the same as willpower! The Hypnotherapy Solution Success with hypnotherapy is completely different from other quitting attempts, which largely rely on willpower to resist the urge to pick up a cigarette.  Those urges - often called cravings - are signals from the brain which prompt the repetition of habitual behaviour.  Humans will experience lots of craving signals, they are not all about tobacco.  The impulse to buy or eat chocolate, repeatedly snort cocaine, drink alcohol, play slot machines or eat fast food… these are all Compulsive Habitual behaviours, which often get called “addictions” when in fact they are not!  They just look like addictions - they are really all compulsive habits that can be quite easily shut down with expert hypnotherapy, provided the person really wants to ditch the habit. Hang on - isn’t tobacco addictive? Actually no, but it certainly appears to be… as do cocaine and also alcohol.  However, it would be true to say that the vast majority of people who drink alcohol sometimes are NOT ‘problem drinkers’.  Most adults who have been drinking alcohol for years do not believe they are addicted to it, which seems odd if the substance itself is ‘addictive’.  Likewise there are occasional cocaine-users who never develop a habit, just as there are those who sometimes drink tea or coffee but they can take it or leave it, whilst others drink ten cups a day, every day.  Are they addicted?  And if so, why isn’t everyone? “Addiction” doesn’t explain it - “Compulsive Habit” does! It is often suggested that sugar is ‘addictive’, as an attempt to explain the chocoholic’s behaviour - but what about gambling and fast food?  Gamblers aren’t even consuming anything, yet that gets called an addiction too - as does playing computer games for hours on end - so does the word ‘addiction’ equally apply to anything you apparently can’t stop doing?  If so, how would that differ from breathing, going to sleep or using toilet facilities?  We certainly feel compelled to do those things too, and indeed seem unable to stop! Natural v Unnatural The difference can be easily demonstrated with hypnotherapy, provided the client would prefer to be rid of the problem.  A real drug addiction - heroin is a classic example - cannot be simply shut down with a single session of hypnotherapy.  Not in any case, so far as I am aware.  All the other unnecessary habits can, and I have done that many times with tobacco, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, various forms of gambling, chocoholics, fast food and computer gaming.  In smokers, we also make sure we prevent the weight gain or overeating that many smokers fear when they contemplate quitting.  So don’t worry, even if you have gained weight  in previous quitting attempts, you won’t have that problem if you come to Central Hypnotherapy. How it works Hypnotherapy shuts down the impulse to reach for tobacco, which really has nothing to do with nicotine or anything else in the smoke.  These impulses (sometimes called cravings) are signals from the brain which prompt you to repeat the usual habitual action in the usual situations.  When smokers try to quit with willpower, they are attempting to just ignore or resist those impulses.  This usually drives the smoker up the wall, because the signals only become more insistent if you do not respond at first.  The brain assumes you didn’t notice the signal, so it sends a stronger, more insistent one! And it will usually keep doing that until you finally respond by lighting up. Instead of fighting a battle using willpower, in hypnotherapy we explain to the Subconscious mind (which sends these signals) that the smoking matter is under review, requesting that the reminder signals be shut down.  In fact, they shut down at regular intervals anyway: when you go to sleep, or whenever you go into a situation in which smoking is not possible such as a cinema or hospital, or if you board a plane.  Few smokers are bothered by cravings whilst they are in these situations.  Even the few smokers that do struggle with those restrictions only suffer because they have not really accepted the restriction, so they feel resentful about being told they are not allowed to smoke there! Beliefs, Feelings and Concerns In addition to requesting that the craving signals be shut down, it is important for the therapist also to explain the reasons for the change to the Subconscious mind - and take into account the feelings and concerns of that particular smoker - all of which may have a bearing on their response to the therapy process.  Preventing over-eating or weight-gain is probably the most common example of an associated issue which may be a concern to some clients, and they will be very relieved to discover that they will not be gaining weight after the smoking habit is shut down - even if that did happen before when they tried to quit with other methods. Quick and Easy In most cases we can do all this in a single session, which takes about two hours from start to finish. The great thing about hypnotherapy from the client’s point of view is that they spend the whole time relaxing in a comfy chair and do not need to contribute anything else to the process apart from looking forward to being rid of the problem.   This makes hypnotherapy by far the easiest, as well as the most effective method of stopping smoking. N.B. Clients sometimes have mixed feelings about stopping smoking, and feel uncertain about the hypnotherapy process if they have not had hypnotherapy before.  We take care of all those issues within that session, this is all quite normal.  So if you have doubts, don’t let that put you off - some doubts are only to be expected and they do not get in the way of the process because the response comes from the Subconscious mind, not the skeptical conscious mind.  Your Subconscious mind is blissfully unaware of any doubts that may be bothering your conscious mind about what the Subconscious mind can or cannot do.   Let your conscious mind be pleasantly surprised by the outcome!  Your Subconscious already knows what it can do, and it shuts down the craving signals regularly anyway, purely for your convenience.  Of course it can shut them down forever, it only needs to hear a sound case for doing so.  That’s my job, so you can leave that part to me!

But it’s amazing what you CAN get used to.  Professional boxers get used to being smashed in the face with a fist, but that doesn’t make it pleasant or a good idea, it’s just that if you experience the same sensation over and over and over again, it ceases to register much at all.  So it is with tobacco smoke.  The ‘pleasure’ is in the moment, it isn’t coming from the cigarette.  Smoke is.  Over 4000 chemicals in that smoke, more than 400 of them poisonous to humans, 40-odd cancer-causing agents.  Lovely! The idea that any of this is pleasant can be examined carefully during the hypnotherapy process and it is quite easy to return to our original perception, which for most people is that tobacco smoke is rather nasty actually.  For we were quite correct in our initial impression: smoke is unpleasant and so is the effect of inhaling it.  You just become accustomed to it, and then it becomes a compulsive habit. Not to worry!  All compulsive habits can be shut down with hypnotherapy, usually in a single session.  Cravings shut down and everything. Why not call and find out more?

Chris Holmes has been Director of Central Hypnotherapy, Stockport, England UK since August 2000 Cocaine Monday, September 22nd, 2008 This one is coming up more and more these days, there’s a lot of cocaine out there in the pubs and clubs and so more people are using it than ever before.  When I first launched Central Hypnotherapy in August 2000 no-one ever came to me to get rid of a cocaine habit, but over the last two or three years that has changed completely.  Now it not unusual to be seeing a two or three cocaine clients in the same month.   This is, of course, the tip of the iceberg. Cocaine habits (and crack habits) are often referred to as “addictions”, but in truth there is no physical dependency.  It is a Compulsive Habit based on a pleasure principle, and often it is linked with increased alcohol use and sometimes other drugs like cannabis too. Getting rid of this habit with willpower alone can be very difficult, so it is not surprising that users start to fear that they are stuck with it.  Ditching the coke with hypnotherapy is actually quite easy provided the client is looking forward to being rid of it, and just wants to go back to normal really. ‘Euphoric recall’ Before we do the hypnotherapy session, the idea attached to cocaine in the Subconscious is simply that it makes you feel good, but during the therapy we can adjust that, so that the principle feeling associated with it is then much more negative - more to do with how low and stressed you feel later, so that the thought of taking it no longer seems appealing.  We can also shut down the compulsive urge (craving signal) and the combination of these two adjustments will get rid of the habit for anyone who has pretty much had enough of the expensive and exhausting coke routine. This change will be permanent for any client who adheres to the hypno-success formula: 1). Book a session 2). Actually turn up for it, and 3). Come back if you need to. When people don’t succeed with the cocaine issue, it is usually because they skipped number 3.  So don’t do that - don’t assume hypnotherapy should always work in one session just because it often does.  Needing more than one session is not failure, and neither is relapse - both are a normal part of achieving success for some people.  Just call Central Hypnotherapy to get a session organised, and you can leave the rest to me! Office: 0161-474-8120 Monday-Friday 8.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., or call/text 07748 838 644 any day, any time.

Before you go Joining A.A… Monday, September 22nd, 2008 I’m not having a go at Alcoholics Anonymous, it’s just that most habitual drinkers  - even heavy drinkers - don’t really need A.A., although there might be a few that will.   What most habitual drinkers really need, if they just want to cut down their intake  of alcohol, is to come and see me. You see, if you go to A.A. the good people there will probably soon have you thinking that you have “an addictive personality”, when all you really have is a compulsive habit.  They will certainly tell you that you are “addicted to alcohol”, when actually no-one is - not even the guys who sleep on the streets and drink Tennants Super.  They certainly have problems, and it might look for all the world like a drug addiction, but in reality it is still a compulsive habit of drinking alcohol.  The people at A.A. will also assure you that your only hope is to quit forever, and go to A.A. meetings for the rest of your natural life. To be fair to them, the A.A. approach to drink problems was developed over a century ago, when very few people knew anything about the Subconscious mind.  Many people still don’t, but we hypnotherapists certainly do!  By the way, your Subconscious mind controls all your habitual behaviours, compulsive or otherwise.  That’s why your conscious decisions - and conscious efforts - to stop doing those things usually makes no difference, however well-meant.  Your Subconscious mind knows nothing about those conscious resolutions, or any of the good reasons for them, until I explain it all to the Subconscious mind during the course of the hypnotherapy session. Of all the issues I help people with, this is fast becoming one of the most popular.  More and more folk have been buying alcohol from supermarkets where it is cheapest, and drinking it at home.   At first it’s just weekends, then it becomes most nights and before you know it,  you have a daily habit of drinking.  Tolerance levels go up because you get so used to it, and what was once an occasional indulgence has become a daily ritual which is poisoning you too much and costing money you can no longer afford!  Still, you don’t want to give it up completely… At A.A. they will explain that you must give it up completely and go through the Twelve Steps, whereas I propose only three: 1). Book a session, 2). actually turn up for it, 3). if you need further help, come back. Some people don’t need to come back for further help, but some do.  No-one can seriously claim to have “tried hypnotherapy” if they skipped number three, by the way.  At A.A. they expect you to devote the rest of your life to their method!   We don’t, but for some people it might take more than one session, obviously. Nevertheless, you can expect clear results from the first session anyway, so you’ll know you aren’t wasting your time. You can leave the rest to me - but please read the post that follows this one before calling 0161-474-8120. Home | Conta
