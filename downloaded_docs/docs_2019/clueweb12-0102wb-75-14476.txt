  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. © 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
