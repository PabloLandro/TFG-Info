Athletes May Suffer From Low Back Pain Back and Neck Pain Constant Back Pain Search Treating Back Pain With Spinal Decompression Therapy Spinal decompression therapy is a non-surgical procedure used to treat back pain and injuries involving the spinal disc. This therapy has been approved by the FDA as an alternative treatment for back pain . Spinal decompression therapy is a great choice for those who are dealing with back pain as a result of bulging discs, herniated discs, pinched nerves and sciatica. How does it treat back pain? In many cases, back pain is a result of the spine asserting excessive pressure on the discs. There are several factors that can cause the spine to exert greater pressure. Some of these factors include poor posture, acute stress and bad body mechanics. These factors can cause the vertebrae to compress your discs. This in turn leads to increased pressure on your discs, which eventually results in back pain. Spinal decompression therapy deals with these compressed discs to alleviate back pain. It gently decompresses the discs, which eases out the pain. The process Since spinal decompression therapy is a non invasive therapy, the process involved is pretty much simple. Here in, the patient is strapped to a table. As this table moves, a distraction force is applied to the targeted area of the spine. This distraction force can be easily increased or decreased using a computerized control. The force is applied on the spine between periods of relaxation. As a result of the force applied, the spine is slightly pulled up, which elongates the spine. The elongation of the spine creates vaccum between the vertebrae, which puts the disc back into shape. In some cases, spinal decompression therapy may be accompanied by pain. Here in, heat or cold therapy may also be used along with the therapy to offer immediate relief from the pain. A single session of spinal decompression therapy lasts for about 30 to 40 minutes. The number of sessions required may vary from one person to another depending upon the severity of the condition. However, ideally 28 sessions are required that are spread across a period of one to two months. Pros and cons Perhaps, the most prominent advantage of using the spinal decompression therapy is that it is safe. Since it is a non-surgical procedure, the risk of side effects is relatively lesser. On the downside, this treatment can be quite time consuming. This means that you will have to wait for a considerable amount of time before you actually get to see the results. If you are considering this treatment to get rid of back pain, then make sure that you opt for a professional practitioner only. Related Articles Cervical Disc Replacement...
