The good news is that the outlook  has greatly improved for many people with newly diagnosed (detected) RA. Of course, RA remains a serious disease, and one that can vary  widely in symptoms (what you feel) and outcomes. Even so, treatment advances  have made it possible to stop or at least slow the progression (worsening) of  joint damage. Rheumatologists now have many new treatments that target the  inflammation that RA causes. They also understand better when and how to use  treatments to get the best effects. Fast facts RA is  an autoimmune disease. A faulty immune system (the body’s defense system)  triggers it. RA is the most common type of autoimmune arthritis. At  least 1.3 million U.S. adults have RA. Treatments have improved greatly and help many  of those affected. Rheumatologists are doctors who have the  expertise to correctly diagnose this disease and to offer patients the most  advanced treatments. The normal joint structure appears on the left. On the right is the  joint with rheumatoid arthritis. RA causes synovitis, pain and swelling of the synovium  (the tissue that lines the joint). This can make cartilage (the tissue that  cushions between joints) and bone erode, or wear away. What is rheumatoid arthritis? RA is a chronic (long-term) disease that causes pain, stiffness,  swelling and limited motion and function of many joints. While RA can affect  any joint, the small joints in the hands and feet tend to be involved most often.  Inflammation sometimes can affect organs as well, for instance, the eyes or  lungs. The stiffness seen in active RA is most often worst in the morning.  It may last one to two hours (or even the whole day). Stiffness for a long time  in the morning is a clue that you may have RA, since few other arthritic  diseases behave this way. For instance, osteoarthritis most  often does not cause prolonged morning stiffness. Other signs and symptoms that can occur in RA include: Loss of energy Low fevers Loss of appetite Dry eyes and mouth from a related health  problem, Sjogren's  syndrome Firm lumps, called rheumatoid nodules, which  grow beneath the skin in places such as the elbow and hands What causes rheumatoid arthritis? RA is an autoimmune disease. This means that certain cells of the  immune system do not work properly and start attacking healthy tissues — the joints  in RA. The cause of RA is not known. Yet, new research is giving us a better idea  of what makes the immune system attack the body and create inflammation. In RA,  the focus of the inflammation is in the synovium, the tissue that lines the  joint. Immune cells release inflammation-causing chemicals. These chemicals can  damage cartilage (the tissue that cushions between joints) and bone. Other things likely play a role in RA as well. For instance, genes  that affect the immune system may make some people more prone to getting RA. Who gets rheumatoid arthritis? RA is the most common form of autoimmune arthritis, affecting more  than 1.3 million Americans. Of these, about 75% are women. In fact, 1–3% of  women may get rheumatoid arthritis in their lifetime. The disease most often  begins between the fourth and sixth decades of life. However, RA can start at  any age. How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed? RA can be hard to detect because it may begin with subtle symptoms,  such as achy joints or a little stiffness in the morning. Also, many diseases  behave like RA early on. For this reason, if you or your primary care physician  thinks you have RA, you should see a rheumatologist. A rheumatologist is a  physician with the skill and knowledge to reach a correct diagnosis of RA and to  make the most suitable treatment plan. Diagnosis of RA depends on the symptoms and results of a physical  exam, such as warmth, swelling and pain in the joints. Some blood tests also can  help confirm RA. Telltale signs include: Anemia (a low red blood cell count) Rheumatoid factor (an antibody, or blood  protein, found in about 80% of patients with RA in time, but in as few as 30%  at the start of arthritis) Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides  (pieces of proteins), or anti-CCP for short (found in 60–70% of patients with  RA) Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a blood  test that, in most patients with RA, confirms the amount of inflammation in the  joints) X-rays can help in detecting RA, but may not show anything  abnormal in early arthritis. Even so, these first X-rays may be useful later to  show if the disease is progressing. Often, MRI and ultrasound scanning are done  to help judge the severity of RA. There is no single test that confirms an RA diagnosis for most  patients with this disease. (This is above all true for patients who have had symptoms  fewer than six months.) Rather, a doctor makes the diagnosis by looking at the  symptoms and results from the physical exam, lab tests and X-rays. How is rheumatoid arthritis treated? Therapy for RA has improved greatly in the past 30 years. Current  treatments give most patients good or excellent relief of symptoms and let them  keep functioning at, or near, normal levels. With the right medications, many  patients can achieve “remission” — that is, have no signs of active disease. There is no cure for RA. The goal of treatment is to lessen your  symptoms and poor function. Doctors do this by starting proper medical therapy  as soon as possible, before your joints have lasting damage. No single treatment  works for all patients. Many people with RA must change their treatment at  least once during their lifetime. Good control of RA requires early diagnosis and, at times,  aggressive treatment. Thus, patients with a diagnosis of RA should begin their treatment  with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs — referred to as DMARDs. These drugs  not only relieve symptoms but also slow progression of the disease. Often,  doctors prescribe DMARDs along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs  and/or low-dose corticosteroids, to lower swelling, pain and fever. DMARDs have  greatly improved the symptoms, function and quality of life for nearly all  patients with RA. Ask your rheumatologist about the need for DMARD therapy and  the risks and benefits of these drugs. Common DMARDs include methotrexate ( brand  names include Rheumatrex®  and Folex®), leflunomide ( Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine).  Older DMARDs include gold , given  as a pill — auranofin (Ridaura) — or more often as an injection into a muscle (such  as Myochrysine). The antibiotic minocycline (e.g.,  Minocin, Dynacin and Vectrin) also is a DMARD, as are the immune suppressants azathioprine (Imuran)  and cyclosporine (Sandimmune  and Neoral). These  three drugs and gold are rarely prescribed for RA these days because other  drugs work better or have fewer side effects. Patients with more serious disease may need medications called  biologic response modifiers or “biologic agents.” They can target the parts of  the immune system and the signals that lead to inflammation and joint and tissue  damage. These medications are also DMARDs. FDA-approved drugs of this type include abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept  (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi) infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan)  and tocilizumab (Actemra).  Most often, patients take these drugs with methotrexate, as the mix of  medicines is more helpful. The best treatment of RA needs more than medicines alone. Patient  education, such as how to cope with RA, also is important. Proper care requires  the expertise of a team of providers, including rheumatologists, primary care  physicians, and physical and occupational therapists. You will need frequent  visits through the year with your rheumatologist. These checkups let your  doctor track the course of your disease and check for any side effects of your medications.  You likely also will need to repeat blood tests and X-rays or ultrasounds from  time to time. What is the broader health impact of rheumatoid arthritis? Research  shows that people with RA, mainly those whose disease is not well controlled, have  a higher risk for heart disease and stroke. Talk with your doctor about these risks  and ways to lower them. Living with rheumatoid arthritis It is important to be physically active most of the time, but to  sometimes scale back activities when the disease flares. In general, rest is  helpful when a joint is inflamed, or when you feel tired. At these times, do gentle  range-of-motion exercises, such as stretching. This will keep the joint flexible. When you feel better, do low-impact aerobic exercises, such as  walking, and exercises to boost muscle strength. This will improve your overall  health and reduce pressure on your joints. A physical or occupational therapist  can help you find which types of activities are best for you, and at what level  or pace you should do them. Finding that you have a chronic illness is a life-changing event.  It can cause worry and sometimes feelings of isolation or depression. Thanks to  greatly improved treatments, these feelings tend to decrease with time as  energy improves, and pain and stiffness decrease. Discuss these normal feelings  with your health care providers. They can provide helpful information and  resources. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the wrist and the small joints of the  hand, including the knuckles and the middle joints of the fingers. Points to remember Newer  treatments are effective. RA drugs have greatly improved outcomes for  patients. For most people with RA, early treatment can control joint pain and  swelling, and lessen joint damage. Seek an expert in arthritis: a  rheumatologist. Expertise  is vital to make an early diagnosis of RA and to rule out diseases that mimic  RA, thus avoiding unneeded tests and treatments. A doctor who is an expert in  RA also can design a customized treatment plan that is best suited for you.  Therefore, the rheumatologist, working with the primary care physician and  other health care providers, should supervise the treatment of the patient with  RA. Start  treatment early. Studies show that people who receive early  treatment for RA feel better sooner and more often, and are more likely to lead  an active life. They also are less likely to have the type of joint damage that  leads to joint replacement. The rheumatologist's role in the treatment of
       rheumatoid arthritis RA is a complex disease, but many advances in treatment have  occurred recently. Rheumatologists are doctors who are experts in diagnosing  and treating arthritis and other diseases of the joints, muscles and bones.  Thus, they are best qualified to make a proper diagnosis of RA. They can also  advise patients about the best treatment options. To find a  rheumatologist For a list of rheumatologists in your area, click here .
