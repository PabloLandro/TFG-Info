Alcohol is very effective at dulling the pain. It is quick acting and makes us feel better very quickly. However, for many people, the use of alcohol or opiates is like putting a dirty band-aid on a festering wound. Emotional pain, including grief, rejection, and sadness are natural and humanistic. The loss of a loved one, or the rejection by a lover, spouse, or family member can be devastating. Disappointment in others or disappointment in ourselves is sometimes too much to bear. And we don’t like to feel this natural feeling. We would rather dull the feeling and numb out. The use and abuse of alcohol, opiates, and benzo’s help us to numb out. They are very effective anesthetics. While these substances are effective anesthetics, while they dull or eliminate the feeling, they don’t eliminate the cause of the feelings. So, once the numbing agent wears off, we are left to manage our feelings, that are now compounded by our use and abuse of substances. Alcohol, opiates, and benzos are very effective anesthetic agents, they are not effective coping agents. If you are using alcohol and/ or drugs to anesthetize your pain, and your sick of it.
