Please see your health professional if you're worried about any injuries or pain, before doing any exercise. We'll focus on how to do this exercise with the best technique possible. To avoid injury always start off slow and progress from there. Lower Back Extension Exercise Start by doing 10 reps. You can include this in your circuit workouts, but make sure you don't rush it, always keep the quality in the exercise. Lie front down on an exercise mat, with your arms down by your sides. Brace your core (abs, back and hips) and squeeze your legs together for added stability. Start with your head down, eyes pointed at the mat. Using your lower back muscles, slowly lift your chest up as far as you can comfortably go. Hold it for a count of 2. Then slowly return to the starting position. Complete your reps and sets with slow, steady movements. Tips: Keep breathing steadily. Exhale going up, inhale coming down. Keep your core muscles braced throughout. Make sure you don't use your neck to lift your head. Your eyes should be pointing towards the mat throughout, not straight ahead. This will ensure your neck doesn't take any of the tension, your lower back should be doing the work. Keep your shoulders down throughout. Don't let them shrug up during the exercise. You may only be able to move very little at first, that's totally fine! As you progress, you'll be able to lift your chest higher. Want more back exercise workouts to relieve back pain? Click here .
