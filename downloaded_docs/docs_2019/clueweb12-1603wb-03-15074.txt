Natural Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Pills Doctor recommended UTI Formula. Scientifically Formulated Based on Clinical Research to: Relieve and prevent UTI Infections Prevent UTI attacks 100% safe. No side effects Feel great all day every day Naturally Balance Your Body's Chemistry Stop Urinary Tract Infection! Natural antiseptic that kills UTI bacteria User Ratings 4.9 / 5 Ideally, the habit of frequent urination or bladder training, including cleanliness, should be instilled right from childhood, especially in the case of female children. Above all, once the subject is made clear to the sufferers/others, it becomes routine. We do hope that you find the information here something worth recommending others to read and think about once you complete reading all there is about Urinary Tract . (i) Perineal hygiene   The perineum is the area where the openings of the anus, the urethra and the vagina are situated (of course, the scrotum and the penis in the male). It is the most dangerous area, especially in females, as all the three openings are lying close together (Fig.  , and there is always a threat of infection to the urinary tract from anal-faecal organisms, which invade the urinary tract through the urethral opening. Hence if proper hygiene is maintained after each defecation, the infection from the anus to the urethra can be stopped/prevented since UTI is caused mostly by E. coli organisms present in the faeces. Of course, the various predisposing/associated factors responsible for UTI , if present, have to be simultaneously investigated and treated. What we have written here about Uti can be considered to be a unique composition on Uti . Let's hope you appreciate it being unique. Further, women who are more prone to UTI, or get recurrences of UTI as a result of intercourse, are advised to take a single dose of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotic like norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin or ofloxacin, etc., after sexual intercourse/ coitus. This is an important step in the prevention of UTI in such patients, and has shown promising results. . It is only if you find some usage for the matter described here on Urinary Tract that we will feel the efforts put in writing on Urinary Tract fruitful. So make good usage of it! (ii) Passing of ur'ine after sexual intercourse (postcoital voiding) Since during sexual activity, the organisms may gain entry through the urethral opening into the urinary bladder, it is advisable for all women to pass urine after each sexual intercourse, so that the bacteria, in case they have entered the urinary bladder, are washed out. It is safer if urine is also passed before sexual intercourse. (v) Plenty of fluids   It is obvious that the intake of plenty of fluids is required, so that there is frequent urination, and the bladder is constantly kept clean. At least about three litres of water/fluids must be taken daily to achieve the desired results. Looking for something logical on Uti, we stumbled on the information provided here. Look out for anything illogical here. The above step for the prevention of UTI is very important and calls for an urgent need to impart sex education at the appropria te age. Physicians / obstetricians / gynaecologists / paediatricians can also guide their patients as and when an opportunity arises. Mothers can also advise their children in this matter. There are universal applications on Urinary Tract everywhere. However, it is up to us to decide the way used for these applications to get the best results from them. Natural Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Pills Doctor recommended UTI Formula. Scientifically Formulated Based on Clinical Research to: Relieve and prevent UTI Infections Prevent UTI attacks 100% safe. No side effects Feel great all day every day Naturally Balance Your Body's Chemistry Stop Urinary Tract Infection! Natural antiseptic that kills UTI bacteria User Ratings 4.9 / 5 In any case, urination should not be postponed, as this will increase the rise of UTI .   (iv) Passing of urine at bedtime   Similarly, urine must be passed at bedtime, so that the minimum quantity of urine remains in the urinary bladder during the night. Since the duration of the night is long, there should be as little urine as possible in the bladder, and one should pass urine even during the night, if he or she happens to wake up. So after reading what we have mentioned here on Uti, it is up to you to provide your verdict as to what exactly it is that you find fascinating here. A simple cleansing with water, and preferably with soap and water after passing stools, and urine in the case of females, is strongly recommended at all ages, more so in children, girls, both married and unmarried women. However, those using toilet-paper, after passing stools, should be more careful, and see that the area has been thoroughly cleaned, especially in the case of females. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to always keep the perineal area clean, and thus it has been rightly said that 'cleanliness is next to godliness.' As you progress deeper and deeper into this composition on Infection Urinary Tract , you are sure to unearth more information on Infection Urinary Tract. The information becomes more interesting as the deeper you venture into the composition. Various guidelines are mentioned below, and all individuals, irrespective of age and sex, are required to carefully follow them in their everyday life. Writing on Urinary Tract proved to be a gamble to us. This is because there simply seemed to be nothing to write about in the beginning of writing. It was only in the process of writing did we get more and more to write on Urinary Tract. (vi) Immediate treatment of predisposing factors   As soon as some predisposing/ obstructive lesions happen to occur, e.g. urinary stones, benign enlargement of prostate, etc., immediate attention should be paid, and surgery, if required, should not be delayed, so that UTI does not develop at all, and there is absolute prevention. Saying that all that is written here is all there is on Urinary Tract would be an understatement. Very much more has to be learnt and propagated bout Urinary Tract . (vii) Control of high blood pressure and diabetes   Control of high blood pressure and diabetes is an essential requirement to prevent the kidneys from contracting an infection, since a damaged kidney, as a result of high blood pressure and/or high blood sugar, is always prone to get infection. The infection in such kidneys can only be avoided/ prevented if it is protected from damage by these diseases. That is, a strict control of both high blood pressure and diabetes is required. This aspect has also been emphasized earlier.
