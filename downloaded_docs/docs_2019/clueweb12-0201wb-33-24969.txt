Flavored Sublingual Melatonin Because sublinguals dissolve under the tongue, they enter the bloodstream directly via the oral blood vessels, resulting in rapid delivery into the system. MELATONIN is a neurohormone produced in humans by the pineal gland.  A favorite of travelers, it governs the body's circadian rhythms.  Melatonin is also a potent antioxidant. Recommended Use: One tablet dissolved under the tungue at bedtime.  Do not take more than two tablets daily, unless recommended by your physician. What can Melatonin do for you? Melatonin may be most effective as a sleep aid.  Various studies of young and elderly adults indicate that in some people melatonin shortens the time needed to fall asleep and improves sleep quality by decreasing the number of times they awaken during the night.  It may be beneficial when chronic pain or stress causes sleep disturbances.  Melatonin can also help restore normal sleep patterns in people who do night shift work or in those suffering from jet lag as a result of crossing time zones.  Moreover, it works without producing the addictive effects of conventional sleep medications. A study of 52 airline employees showed melatonin to be a very effective remedy against jet lag, significantly shortening the normal one-week adjustment period.  Other studies with more than 400 people determined that the hormone reduces symptoms of jet large by about 50%, on average, on both eastward and westward flights. Preliminary studies at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland found tiny doses of melatonin may be effective for wintertime blues.  Depressed patients who received several doses of 0.1 mg of melatonin in the afternoon showed significant mood improvements, compared with those who received no melatonin or a larger single dose in the morning.  Scientists speculate small afternoon doses may better mimic the way melatonin is naturally released by the body, but caution against drawing conclusions until further studies are completed. Dosage: For insomnia: Take 1 to 3 mg before bedtime. For jet lag: Take a 3 mg dose on your day of travel, followed by 3 mg before bedtime for the first three or four nights at your final destination. For shift work: Take a 3 mg dose at your desired bedtime (at 8 A.M., for example) after working a night shift. Guidelines for use: To combat insomnia, stick to a precise schedule, taking supplements at the same time every evening.  Begin with the lowest dose and increase it as needed. Suggested Usage: One tablet at bedtime; one-half tablet may be sufficient for some people.  Do not take more than two tablets daily unless recommended by your health care professional.  Place tablet under the  tongue.  While it is slowly dissolving, alter its position so as to avoid prolonged contact with the same area. The above statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
