Newsletter 2007 : by Ray Sahelian, M.D., free health newsletter Newsletter 2007 - Supplement Research 
Update Newsletter 2007 See Newsletter 2006 back 
issues. See Newsletter 2008 issues. See Newsletter 
2009 newer issues. Feedback from readers Just want you to know that I appreciate the sense of integrity and truthfulness 
of your articles. Thanks for a year of great newsletters in 2006. I just want to thank both Dr. Sahelian and his hard 
working staff for their honesty, integrity and all their hard work promoting 
natural medicine. I not only love your books and products, but I also love your 
web site. Please keep up the great work. I just wanted to say how much I enjoy your newsletters. 
They are a source of such interesting and important information. Thanks for 
putting it together for us on a regular basis. I don't know where else I would 
find such great information in one place. Thanks for your ongoing research and 
products as well. You do a great job. The health information from a physician of Dr. 
Sahelian's stature is priceless. Your website is a work of art and I commend you for its 
superior content. I am a teacher in esthetic sciences at a college in Washington 
state. ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 15 -- December 10, 2007 =================================== The holiday season is here and it is quite likely that some of us will add a 
few extra pounds over the next few weeks. The winter cold and short 
daylight hours will keep many people indoors and reduce energy 
expenditure. Add to this the many family gatherings and dinner parties, 
the sweets, alcoholic drinks and such, and you may wake up one morning in 
January and realize the belt buckle needs to be loosened by a notch or two 
or you have just been expanded to a larger dress size. Many of you will 
make a New Year's resolution to go on a diet. Unfortunately, most weight loss diets involve a way of 
eating that is unpleasant or difficult to maintain. That is why most 
people go off them and  gain the weight back rather quickly. 
Prescription weight loss drugs are not very effective, nor are they safe. 
Below I discuss  recent findings that found these medications to be 
less than stellar performers regarding permanent weight loss. In this issue I discuss new research regarding Crohn's disease, 
isoflavone treatment for menopause, honey as a cough treatment, and noni 
for energy boosting. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas -- For the

probiotics for Crohn's disease Researchers at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo, Japan. used a combination 
of probiotic and 
prebiotic supplements in the treatment of active Crohn's disease in ten young Crohn's disease patients who had not benefited from aminosalicylates and prednisolone. Patients were 
started on both probiotics (75 billion colony forming units daily) and prebiotics (psyllium 10 grams 
daily). Probiotics were mainly in the form of Bifidobacterium and 
Lactobacillus bacteria. After about a year, six patients 
had a complete response, one had a partial response, and three were 
non-responders. Two patients were able to discontinue their prednisolone 
therapy, while four patients decreased their dosage. The researchers says. 
"A high dose of a probiotic 
and prebiotic combination can be safely and effectively used for the 
treatment of active Crohn's disease ." Comments: This was a small study of only 10 people, but it is 
encouraging and hopefully studies with larger groups of patients will be 
done soon. The probiotic dosage was quite high, and perhaps lower amounts 
would also be helpful. I have recently updated the web page on Crohn's 
disease. See http://www.raysahelian.com/crohnsdisease.html . You will find a link to 
probiotic and prebiotic web pages. =================================== 2. Isoflavone treatment for  menopause symptoms Soybean have compounds called isoflavones which can influence estrogen 
receptors in the body.Â  Scientists at the Karolinska 
Institute in Sweden looked into the effects of isoflavone treatment in postmenopausal women. 
Sixty healthy postmenopausal women were randomly assigned into two groups 
to receive 60 mg isoflavones or placebo daily for 3 months. The women 
receiving isoflavone supplements had reduced hot flashes and night sweats. 
There were no side effects. The researchers say, " isoflavones could be used to relieve acute menopausal 
symptoms." Comments: Common isoflavones include genistein and daidzein. Over 
the years many studies have been conducted to determine the role of 
various herbs and natural supplements in the treatment or easing of 
menopausal symptoms. The results have been mixed. There does not appear to 
be one treatment that helps all women. It may take trial and error to find 
a natural supplement that helps you, or at least lowers the dosage of 
estrogen required to reduce hot flashes or other symptoms of menopause. 
For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/isoflavones.html =================================== 3. O besity 
drugs - are the risks worth the minor benefits? Long-term treatment with the anti obesity drugs orlistat (Xenical or over the 
counter Alli), 
sibutramine (Meridia) or rimonabant (Acomplia) produces only minor weight loss 
while increasing the risks for heart disease and other side effects. Although 
patients taking these anti obesity drugs may lose a few pounds, in a review of 
long term studies, orlistat reduced weight by 3 kg, sibutramine by 4 kg, 
and rimonabant by 4.7 kg. Not only are these weight loss drugs expensive, but 
the side effects counter any potential weight loss benefit. Orlistat prevents the absorption of fat. It improves blood pressure and blood 
sugar 
control in patients with diabetes but increases gastrointestinal side 
effects, lowers HDL cholesterol levels, and lowers the absorption of fat soluble 
vitamins. Some claim that it may increase the risk for colon cancer.
Sibutramine is chemically related to amphetamines. It lowers HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels but raises blood pressure and 
pulse rate. Rimonabant 
improves HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as 
blood pressure and blood sugar control in diabetic patients but increases mood 
disorders, such as depression or anxiety. and increases the risk for suicide. Comments: In my opinion, natural supplements for weight loss are 
much safer and many of them are significantly more effective. Diet Rx is a 
potent and safe appetite suppressant and, in my opinion, far superior to 
pharmaceutical diet pills. For more information on weight loss, see http://www.raysahelian.com/weightloss.html =================================== 4. Noni for energy enhancement Noni 
fruit has been used by Polynesians to improve energy levels. Researchers in 
China gave aged mice Tahitian Noni 
Juice and then compared them in the forced swim test to with young and aged mice 
who did not drink the noni juice. The mice drinking noni juice were able to swim 
longer and had more endurance, similar to the young mice. The researchers 
conclude, "These results confirm the reported use of noni juice to 
combat fatigue, improve endurance and increase overall physical performance." Comments: Perhaps noni supplements provide the same benefits as 
noni juice, however we need studies to compare a noni supplement to noni juice 
to see if there is a difference. One advantage of noni capsules is that they 
don't have the calories in the form of fructose that noni juice has. See http://www.raysahelian.com/noni.html =================================== 5. Honey for cough in children Dr. Ian M. Paul of 
Pennsylvania State University in Hershey compared buckwheat honey, a 
honey-flavored dextromethorphan preparation (dextromethorphan is found in over 
the counter cough syrups), and no treatment in 105 children 
who had sought treatment for nighttime coughs due to colds. Among the three 
groups, children given honey had the greatest reduction in cough frequency and 
severity, and the most improved sleep. The dosage was half a teaspoon for 
two- to five-year-olds, a teaspoon for six- to eleven-year-olds, and two 
teaspoons for children twelve and older. Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent 
Medicine, December 2007. =================================== Emails SAM-e antidepressant side effects Q. I took SAM-e 400mg a day for 2 years and now have had acute anxiety attacks. 
Since I didn't have any side effects for the first two years, I still didn't attribute 
the anxiety attack to the SAM-e and thought I was developing generalized anxiety 
disorder. After several small attacks over the months, I had a huge panic attack 
10 months after the first one. I finally figured from reading your info on SAM-e 
that it might be the culprit. I stopped and have been getting better ever since. 
My symptoms were dizziness and vertigo, tingling, numbness in extremities 
followed by panic, racing heart and high blood pressure, lasting three or more 
hours. During the first attack I was extremely nauseas. Thank you. A. SAM-e is a powerful supplement. In low dosages in can help with 
depression, but higher amounts cause insomnia, anxiety and can lead to panic 
attacks. See http://www.raysahelian.com/sam-e.html What herbal extract 
potency is the best option? Q. I  read in an article on rhodiola 
extract in Science News which states that in 1989 the then Soviet 
government standardized the supplement to contain 3% rosavins. I then 
looked at a couple of rhodiola extract supplements on-line and found that 
many of them claim to contain 4% rosavins (and something called salidroside,
usually at 1%). The rhodiola product available at Physician Formulas web 
site contains only 0.8% rosavins as well as 0.8% 
salidrosides. The recommended dosages on the PF site also differs, although they sound 
more conservative, they may be a more informed and cautious approach. 
Could you please explain the discrepancies I have found between this 
rhodiola 
product and others. A. In the past herbs used to be available only as regular 
powder or leaf form, or as tinctures. Now, many herbs are available in 
different extract concentrations and potencies. Since human 
research with these various extract potencies is limited, it is difficult 
to claim that one extract percentage or potency is better than another. 
Sometimes if an herbal extract is too concentrated and of too high potency, it 
can cause more side effects at a lower dosage. Just because one organization or one country 
has chosen a particular extract percentage as a standard does not mean 
that particular extract is the best option for you. Different scientists, 
organizations, and medical doctors can have different viewpoints on this 
topic. The bottom line is that the ideal extract potency is what works for 
any particular person rather than what is recommended or chosen by an 
organization. And the only way for a consumer to tell is to try a 
particular herb in various dosages and extract potencies to see which amount works best for their unique 
condition. See http://www.raysahelian.com/rhodiola.html ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 14 -- November 15, 2007 =================================== =================================== The more I learn about the influence of omega-3 fatty 
acids, such as fish oils, on various aspects of health, the more I realize 
how important these fatty acids are in relation to a number of chronic 
health conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, high blood pressure, 
age related vision decline, mental function decline, and certain skin 
disorders. Even mood is influenced by fish oils. Below I discuss new 
research regarding the influence of fish oils on depression and also the 
possibility that glaucoma may be influenced by the types of fats we 
consume. Speaking of diet, many medical conditions are due to overeating. 
Last month I mentioned to you my newest formulation called Diet Rx for 
appetite suppression. I don't think there's any formula that I have 
introduced that has been so appreciated as this diet pill. Just 
about everyone who has tried it has noticed reduced appetite without any 
significant side effects. In fact, most people notice better mood balance 
and more natural energy. Diet Rx has many health benefits. When a person 
eats less, their blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure are not 
likely to rise as much. If you have been looking for a natural, effective 
and safe appetite suppressant, Diet Rx may just be the right formula 
for you. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas 
-- For the next few days, the following items are heavily discounted: Eyesight Rx can be used for long term vision support, it can also be used 
for a quick improvement in vision within a few days. Many, but not all, 
people notice colors becoming brighter and the act of seeing can be more 
pleasurable. Objects become sharper and in better focus. Paintings, 
artwork, or nature becomes more enjoyable to look at. For long term use, 
take it 2 days on, one day off. 
Taking one to three fish oil capsules a day may also help with vision. Cinnamon 6 is a combination of several herbs to help with blood sugar 
management;
Grape seed extract has compounds called procyanidolic oligomers (PCOs) ; Indole 3 Carbinol is an extract from cabbage, cauliflower, and brussels 
sprouts. Indole-3-carbinol is converted in the gut to diindolylmethane 
(DIM).
Rhodiola is used for energy and stamina. Rhodiola extract is also found in Mind 
Power Rx and Passion Rx. Vitamin C ester is on sale. =================================== 1. What you eat may influence your mood Many people do not realize the crucial role diet plays in mood disorders. 
If a patient goes to their doctor and reports feelings of depression, it 
is quite unlikely that their physician will do a dietary history. Most 
likely the prescription pad will be taken out and 
the words Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, or another antidepressant will be jotted 
down before you can even spell 'd e p r e s s i o n.' There are many causes for 
depression, and diet is one  cause that is often overlooked. As we 
understand the complexity of brain biochemistry, scientists are realizing 
that inflammation in the brain plays a role in depression. Certain chemicals called 
cytokines cause inflammation in the brain which influences mood. If you 
ever had low mood or felt depressed during or after a bad case of the flu, 
then you realized first hand how these cytokines released by the immune 
system effected your brain. It is interesting to note that this is a 
typical case of a body-brain influence. The body, in this case the immune 
system, releases chemicals called cytokines into the bloodstream. These in turn enter brain 
tissue cause inflammation,  leading to low mood. In 
addition to depressed mood cytokines also cause loss of appetite, altered sleep patterns and fatigue. Fortunately cytokines, and other substances that cause 
inflammation, are influenced by diet. When you eat lots of fish or foods 
with omega-3 fatty acids, your body will make fewer inflammatory 
cytokines. For details, see http://www.raysahelian.com/depression.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/cytokines.html =================================== 2. Fish oil 
supplementation in pregnancy leads to babies with healthier brains University of Western Australia researchers gave women fish oil supplements that had 2.2 grams docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 1.1 grams eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from 
20 weeks of gestation until delivery. Compared to the  group who 
receive olive oil, breast milk from women who received fish oil had 
proportionally higher DHA and EPA levels the first few weeks after delivery. 
Babies breastfed from mothers who had taken the fish oil supplements were found 
to have better hand and eye coordination. See http://www.raysahelian.com/fishoils.html =================================== 3. Glaucoma and  omega-3 fatty acids Researchers at the University of Melbourne,  
Australia wanted to know whether there was an association between dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake 
and glaucoma. Rats were fed either 
omega-3-sufficient or omega-3-deficient diets from conception.  The omega-3 diet contained safflower, flaxseed, and 
tuna oils, and the omega-3 deficient diet contained 
safflower oil only. Animals raised on high omega-3 diets had 
a  decrease in intra ocular pressure when they got older, meaning that the 
inclusion of tuna oil in their diet reduced their risk of developing glaucoma. 
See http://www.raysahelian.com/glaucoma.html =================================== 4.Â  Risk of SSRI and NSAID drug combination Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
-- such as Prozac, Zolofta, Paxil, and others -- 
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) -- such as aspririn, 
ibuprofen, naproxen -- when combined, can interact 
to increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. For more info see http://www.raysahelian.com/SSRI.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/nsaid.html =================================== 5. Smoking increases risk 
for psoriasis skin disorder Nicotine and other toxic substances in cigarette smoke such as peroxynitrite and 
free radicals of organic compounds, trigger an overly aggressive immune system 
response. Fortunately, the risk and severity of psoriasis decreases when people 
quit smoking. See http://www.raysahelian.com/psoriasis.html =================================== 6. Energy drinks side effects Certain energy drinks increase blood pressure and heart rate, most likely due to 
the high amount of caffeine in the drinks. For natural energy enhancement, 
consider MultiVit Rx or for mental enhancement consider Mind Power Rx. =================================== Emails about Diet Rx Dr. Sahelian says: I don't know of a dietary supplement formula that has been 
appreciated as much as Diet Rx. Just about everyone who has tried this product 
has noticed a sharp decrease in appetite without side effects of any 
significance. Here are some emails that we have received: Ever since I started taking Diet Rx, I don't have cravings for ice cream. Ice 
cream has been my downfall over the past few years and the major cause of the 
extra few pounds around my waist. For the past two weeks I have been taking 
2 Diet Rx capsules daily. Diet Rx curbs my appetite more than anything else I 
have ever used. Another important benefit is that I don't experience any of the 
uncomfortable side effects, such as the jitters, that other supplements with 
harmful stimulants always do. I feel comfortable using this product because I 
know that it contains a lot of beneficial ingredients. I just ordered 2 more 
bottles. I have been taking Diet Rx for one week now. 
I have noticed that I do not feel hungry. The biggest difference that I 
noticed though is no night time snacking. I never go to bed before 2:00am 
and usually start my evening snacking around 10:00pm I must clarify that 
what I call a "snack" other people call a meal. I am not fond of sweets so 
therefore my "snack" is something meaty (pork chop, chicken breast or 
steak) or a sandwich or two with all the trimmings. I have not even 
thought about having something to eat in the evenings since starting Diet 
Rx. I tried a diet pill once before in my life but did not like it because 
it gave me an awful nervous feeling and fast heart beat. I don't feel 
anything like that with this diet product. =================================== Q. Dr. Sahelian, what supplements do you take? First of all thank you for your news letter. I 
find it very informative and believable. Those qualities 
set it apart from 95% of the others. Please tell me a good overall regimen 
to take for optimum antioxidant protection and overall general good 
health. What do you take? A. There is no regular supplement regimen that I take because I am 
usually experimenting with different herbs or supplements to see what 
effect they have on me. For instance, while formulating Diet Rx in the 
last few months, I was trying out different herbs and ingredients one at a 
time to see if they had appetite suppressing effects. When I am 
experimenting with a single herb or product, I don't take other 
supplements during this time. I often 
revise some of my formulas such as Passion Rx and Eyesight Rx  to make them 
more effective. So I take the new pills, when they are made, to experiment on 
myself, and I also get feedback from friends, patients, and users of these 
products. If I were to take a regular regimen, I would probably take 1 to 3 
fish oil capsules a day, one MultiVit Rx a few times a week, CoQ10 30 or 
50 mg a few times a week, alpha lipoic acid 50 mg once or twice a week, 
and I would also occasionally take Mind Power Rx and Passion Rx. In 
addition, I may at times take a capsule of mangosteen, resveratrol, 
curcumin, pomegranate, acai, goji, cranberry, bilberry, artichoke, green 
tea, asparagus, or another herbal extract (there are many interesting 
ones). I may also at times try 
acetyl-l carnitine or carnosine. There are lots of great supplements and 
it is not easy to determine which to take. As a general rule, I would not 
advise taking more than 5 to 10 different products a day. It is also a 
good idea to take a day off each week and a few days off each month unless 
the supplements are necessary in the treatment of a medical condition. Sometimes I 
also take Good Night Rx to get a deeper sleep. Since I don't have prostate problems, I 
rarely take Prostate Power Rx except occasionally for sexual enhancement. Q. DHEA and pregnenolone side effects. Thank 
God I found your web site. I have been taking DHEA 30mg daily for 5 years. 
2 years ago i developed heart palpitations. Adrenal exhaustion they said. 
I lived with it. Then i became angry, easily agitated, sleep problems 
appeared. Two weeks ago I ordered pregnenolone 25mg, and adrenal cortex 
250mg, wanting to address the adrenal problem. On the 5th day of taking 
the new tablets, plus the usual DHEA, i developed extreme dizziness. On 
the 6th 
day I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance, placed in cardiac intensive care. ECG showed erratic heart rhythms, they thought my electrolytes were out of 
whack, and said the electrics of my heart was irregular. They thought i 
was going to have a heart attack. I have never had high blood pressure, 
always good cholesterol levels, not overweight, generally very healthy - 
they were confused because tests all came out normal, and said my symptoms 
were not typical. After reading your web sight, I now know the new 
pregnenolone tablets were the straw that broke the camel's back. Your web 
site is so easy to follow, and packed with vital information. I feel so much 
better already, and am going to take plenty of hormone holidays. Like everything 
in life, moderation is the key. P.S. I am a 56 year old female from Australia. 
Thank you. ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 13 -- October 22, 2007 =================================== My research staff and I get more than forty emails each day and the 
numbers continue to increase. It's getting hard to keep up with and answer 
all of them. In this issue I will focus on some interesting questions that 
we have recently had that would actually be of interest to a large number 
of supplement users. Natural, herbal diet pills have been promoted for a long time. 
Early in my medical career I was quite skeptical of the claims made by 
these weight loss pills. Most of the diet pills on the market focus on 
increasing metabolism for a "fat burning" effect. I am not thrilled with 
these types of diet pills since they increase body temperature, speed 
heart rate, and have other unpleasant side effects. Recently hoodia became 
available as an appetite suppressant and some people have found it to be 
helpful. Others have been disappointed with hoodia. Many people are also 
using green tea extract, garcinia cambogia with hydroxytric acid, 
different forms of fiber such as pectin, psyllium and glucomannan, Other 
ingredients found in natural diet pills include guggul extract, banaba 
extract, choline, carnitine, acetylcarnitine, inositol, spirulina, apple 
cider vinegar, CLA, chitosan, and others. After years of research and experimentation, I have developed Diet 
Rx, a product that includes 24 herbs and nutrients that work 
synergistically to reduce appetite. I find that herbal combinations work 
better than single ingredients since each herb and nutrient approaches the 
whole process of metabolism from its own important angle. Eating less has 
a number of benefits -- not just feeling better, looking better, and 
reducing the food budget. By ingesting fewer calories, it is quite likely 
that cholesterol and blood sugar levels will not rise as much. Below I 
discuss the best way to use Diet Rx as an appetite suppressant. Diet Rx is 
new on the market and thus far the reports have been quite positive and no 
significant or unpleasant side effects have been mentioned. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas 
-- For the next few days, the following items are heavily discounted: Diet 
Rx appetite suppressant with 25 herbs and nutrients including green tea 
extract, hoodia extract, garcinia cambogia extract, ginger, spirulina, 
cinnamon, pectin fiber, glucomannan, and carnitine. CoQ10 is a nutrient involved in energy metabolism in mitochondria and 
could be in short supply in those who are vegetarian or on statin 
cholesterol drugs, the 100 mg dosage is on sale and one capsule with 
breakfast a few times a week is usually enough;
Fish oils are one of our favorite supplements.Â Fish oils are always popular and a great addition to those 
whose diets lack adequate intake of fish or omega-3 fatty acids; Chrysin is a potent flavonoid extracted from plants and bee propolis; Tribulus terrestris is an herb commonly appreciated 
for its sexual enhancement benefits in men and women. Tribulus extract is 
found in Passion Rx, which is becoming one of the best known natural 
sexual enhancers on the market. =================================== 1. The best way to use Diet Rx I formulated Diet Rx with the understanding that different people would 
require different dosages. Therefore, the number of capsules that are helpful in 
reducing appetite range from 2 to 4 (in rare instances a person may temporarily 
require 5 capsules a day). Please discuss with your health care provider whether 
Diet Rx or any over the counter diet product is appropriate for you before you 
take the capsules. On your first day start with 2 capsules in the morning on an empty 
stomach about 20 minutes to an hour before breakfast. On subsequent days you can 
increase your dosage to 3 or 4 capsules depending on your response. The third 
and fourth capsules may be taken before lunch, or the third capsule can be used 
before lunch and the fourth in mid to late afternoon. You will find that Diet Rx 
will give you a slight to moderate energy boost which you can use to take a good 
20 minute to an hour walk each day. Those who have used Diet Rx report that they feel full 
eating less food. If you try Diet Rx, I hope you get the same benefits as most 
of the other users. I have tried Diet Rx this past week and have noticed that I 
am eating 20 to 30 percent less each day. If you plan to use Diet Rx, try not to 
mix it with too many other supplements that you are currently taking. It is 
often a good idea, when you take a supplement you have not used before, to first 
learn how it makes you feel by itself as opposed to mixing it with a number of 
other pills. If you get hungry between meals, choose a healthy snack as 
discussed below. =================================== 2. I am interested in losing weight and wanted to 
know if it is better to eat snacks or not to eat snacks. I recently came across a study that evaluated this very topic. The study 
was done at Sahlgrenska Academy, GÃ¶teborg University, in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. A 
total of 140 overweight patients aged 18-60 years were randomized to either eat 
3 meals/day (3M) or 3 meals and 3 snacks/day (3+3M). The patients received 
regular and individualized counseling by dieticians. Both groups decreased 
energy intake and lost weight, but there was no significant difference in weight 
loss after 1 year of treatment. Comments: It appears that, for practical reasons, eating snacks 
between meals does not seem to make a large influence on weight loss or gain. If 
you enjoy snacks, choose healthy ones. See http://www.raysahelian.com/healthysnacks.html for suggestions. =================================== 3. What daily dosage of fish oil do you generally prescribe 
for depression? I don't have a standard amount. I evaluate the whole 
patient, including their diet and lifestyle patterns. I don't use fish oils by 
themselves, but depending on the person I will use fish oils in combination with 
5-HTP or St. John's wort, or SAM-e, or Mind Power Rx, and other supplements. As 
a general guideline, though, I will use three to five fish oil capsules daily 
but this varies with the person and their diet. If someone is eating fish more 
than three times a week, they would not need as many capsules of fish oils 
compared to someone who does not eat much fish. =================================== 4. Does 
Glucosamine influence cholesterol levels? A Danish study was conducted in order to 
determine if glucosamine sulphate influences the fasting blood levels of 
cholesterol and triglycerides. A group of patients over 40 years of age 
with joint pain received either 1500 mg per day of glucosamine sulphate or 
placebo. No significant differences between the glucosamine sulphate group 
and the placebo group with respect to cholesterol and triglycerides were 
observed. See http://www.raysahelian.com/glucosamine.html for details. =================================== 5. My question is in regards to CoQ10 daily use. Can a normal healthy person start taking CoQ10 with his or her diet on a 
regular basis like other multivitamins without any harmful side effects. 
On the other hand, if your body doesn't need CoQ10 but you are taking, 
would it hurt your body or do any damage? There is no easy answer to this. Some people may benefit from 
taking CoQ10, others may not. Much depends on a person's diet and 
metabolism and what other supplements and medicines they are taking. If a 
person wants to take CoQ10, 30 mg a few times a week could offer benefits 
without any foreseeable side effects. If high dosages of CoQ10 are used, 
such as 100 mg a day, side effects could occur including difficulty 
sleeping or fatigue. However, I can't see any harm in taking 30 mg of 
CoQ10 a few times a week. =================================== 6.Â CoQ10 and Lipitor. In a recent question in 
your newsletter, you wondered whether the questioner would have developed 
the muscle pain problems from his Lipitor if he'd been taking COQ10. I had 
been taking 200 Mgs. of COQ10 daily for a couple of years at the time, 
when I was placed on only 10 mg of Lipitor. I still developed such painful 
muscles and so much weakness that I could not even walk to the mailbox. 
So, I am not sure COQ10 would be able to prevent this problem. I figured 
out quickly what was going on and stopped the Lipitor drug. I recovered 
totally. =================================== 7. Alpha lipoic acid and heart palpitations. Thank you SO much for 
the information about alpha lipoic acid on your website. I started taking 
it preventively for eye, heart and brain health due to some related 
diseases in my family history. I've been taking 100 mg a day (as per the 
recommended dose on the bottle) for about a month and started having very 
odd palpitations in my heart. I thought it was due to stress, although 
something in my brain said that wasn't the cause. I listened to my inner 
voice and decided to stop taking the alpha lipoic acid as a test to see if 
that might be the cause, since I traced the beginning of the heart issues 
back to about a week after starting the ALA. After just three days of 
being off the ALA, the heart palpitations stopped. That's when I found 
your website and the warnings. More people should be aware of the proper 
doses in which to take this supplement. It has great benefits, to be sure, 
but not if your heart stops working properly!! A. This is very interesting. We have had previous reports of higher 
dosages of alpha lipoic acid causing heart rhythm problems, but not 100 
mg. Did the bottle say R lipoic or regular lipoic? Q. As far as I know, it was just plain alpha 
lipoic acid, 100 mg. That's what the front of the label said. I threw the 
bottle away, so I can't read the back panel for more details. I'm happy to 
report that the big "chugging" feelings I was sporadically having in my 
heart have ceased. Every now and then I have a mild flutter, but that's 
all and even that seems to be getting less each day. Is this something 
that usually takes a couple of weeks or more to rectify itself? A. Yes, the heart rhythm should 
return to normal within a week or two if no other causes exist to disturb 
it. ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 12 -- October 1, 2007 =================================== Last week we got an email that coincided with the release of statistics 
regarding prescription medication side effects. The email said, "After 
taking Lipitor [a statin drug used for cholesterol lowering] forÂ  2Â  
years, without forewarning, I experienced very heavy and sore calf muscles 
in both legs along with a very fatigued feeling all over, particularly my 
legs and arms. At the ER they suspected peripheral artery disease, but 
tests ruled that out. The ER doctor told me to stop taking Lipitor. After 
taking over $30,000 worth of tests, including a complete vascular study 
with heart catheterization, two neurological studies, and four MRIs, no 
one had any answers except to wait several months to be accepted into a 
medical college study plan. In the meantime, I was unable to walk over 150 
feet without a 3-wheeled walker. I used a wheel chair for longer 
adventures. This experience has been very traumatic for me and my family." The number of serious side effects to prescription drugs reported 
to the FDA more than doubled between the years 1998 and 2005. A serious 
side effect, defined by the FDA, includes death, a birth defect, 
disability, hospitalization or a life-threatening event or required 
intervention to prevent harm. In 1998, there were about 35,000 bad adverse 
effects reported, whereas in 2006, there were about 90,000. The overall 
relative increase was four times faster than the growth in total U.S. 
outpatient prescriptions, which grew in the same period from 2.7 billion 
to 3.8 billion. When I get emails such as the above, it reinforces my dedication to 
provide alternative options to prescription drugs. There are many medical 
conditions, particularly for the treatment of infections or for pain relief, where only a 
pharmaceutical drug is helpful and necessary, but there are countless other diseases 
where natural alternatives are not only safer, but as, or more effective. I wonder if the simple use of CoQ10, which has been found to be 
depleted in those who take statin drugs, could have prevented the Lipitor 
side effects, or at least reduced the severity. Why aren't doctors 
learning these basic nutritional principles? (this is a rhetorical 
question). There are several natural supplements that help lower blood 
lipid levels and most doctors don't have a clue or have no interest in 
exploring these natural options. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas -- For the 
next few days, the following items are heavily discounted: Good Night Rx with 
kava, valerian, melatonin, 5-HTP, and several other relaxation and sleep 
inducing herbs and nutrients is ideal for occasional sleepless nights. Tryptophan 
(120 capsules) is an essential amino acid that converts into 5-HTP and 
then on to serotonin, influencing relaxation, mood, and sleep; Carnosine 
has potent antioxidant activity and acts as a neurotransmitter (chemical 
messenger in the nervous system).Â  Some people notice a sense of 
wellbeing after taking it. Bioperine is a pure form of piperine, derived 
from the fruits of black pepper. Bioperine may promote nutrient absorption . Cordyceps 
is a mushroom extract involved in the immune system. Goji Berry is used for vitality and its strong antioxidants. 
Goji berry is getting a lot of attention lately. Cacao powder is basically dark chocolate without the sugar and excess 
calories - you get all the bioflavonoids and polyphenols and other 
benefits of dark chocolate. =================================== 1. Beta-glucan, a natural fiber, reduces cholesterol Scientists at the University of Minnesota, Medical School, 
Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, in Minneapolis, MN, 
did a 10-week controlled study to determine the benefits of 
beta glucan for cholesterol management. Beta-glucan extract at 3 and 5 g 
doses was given two times a day with meals in the form of a ready-to-eat 
cereal and a reduced-calorie fruit juice beverage. After 6 weeks of 
treatment, the mean LDL- Cholesterol levels fell by about 15 % in 5 gram 
group and 9 % in the 3 g group. Similar results were observed for total 
cholesterol. HDL-Cholesterol levels were unchanged by treatment. My comments: Here is one example of a cheap and safe alternative to 
cholesterol lowering drugs. There are many others that doctor should learn 
about. See http://www.raysahelian.com/betaglucan.html for details. Another great fiber worth mentioning is psyllium. =================================== 2. Resveratrol and prostate cancer Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's 
Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, gave male mice, on a daily 
basis, the powerful 
antioxidant resveratrol, the 
equivalent of that found in a bottle of red wine. They discovered 
that the mice were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer. 
Mice which were fed resveratrol, but still got cancer, developed less 
serious tumors. Last year this same team found that female mice given 
resveratrol had a significantly reduced risk of developing breast cancer. My comments: Red wine has about 2 to 3 milligrams of resveratrol 
per liter (a liter is almost 34 ounces). Most resveratrol supplements on 
the market have about 10 mg per capsule. For the time being, taking one or 
two resveratrol supplements a week is fine if you are consuming many other 
antioxidants on a daily basis. However, if you hardly take any antioxidant 
supplements, then you can take the resveratrol more frequently. =================================== 3. Thiamine deficiency in diabetics Patients with diabetes may become 
deficient in thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. Dr. Paul Thornalley and 
colleagues at the University of Warwick, U.K., believe that  the 
thiamine deficiency is not necessarily due to a shortage in the diet, but 
rather an increased rate of loss of the vitamin from the body. In their 
study, diabetics had 76% less thiamine in the blood than those without 
diabetes. Renal clearance of thiamine was increased 24-fold in type 1 
diabetics and by 16-fold in type 2 diabetics. The thiamine deficiency 
could lead to blood vessel problems, increasing the risk for hardening of 
the arteries. My comments: It seems appropriate for patients with diabetes to 
take at least 2 to 3 times the RDA for thiamine, and perhaps the other B 
vitamins. =================================== 4. Post 
breast cancer nutritional treatment Many women who undergo chemotherapy, surgery, and/or 
radiation therapy for breast cancer are placed on tamoxifen with the hope 
that this drug will reduce recurrence of the breast cancer. There are 
certain blood studies that can help doctors monitor breast cancer recurrence 
or relapse. Two of these breast cancer tumor markers are carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3). Researchers from Government Royapettah Hospital, in Tamilnadu, 
India, randomized 84 breast cancer patients to receive a daily supplement of 
100 mg coenzyme 
Q10 ( CoQ10 ), 10 mg riboflavin and 50 mg niacin  per day along with 
10 mg tamoxifen twice a day. Serum CEA and CA 15-3 levels were elevated in 
untreated breast cancer patients and their tumor marker levels 
significantly reduced upon tamoxifen therapy for more than 1 year. 
Patients supplemented with coenzyme Q10, riboflavin and niacin for 90 
daysÂ  along with tamoxifen had significantly reduced CEA 
and CA 15-3 levels. The authors says. "This study suggests supplementing with CoQ10, riboflavin, 
and niacin to breast cancer patients along with tamoxifen reduces the serum 
tumor marker level and thereby reduces the risk of cancer recurrence and 
metastases." My comments: "I am not sure why the scientists chose these three 
particular supplements (and in these particular dosages) to add to the tamoxifen regimen. But the important 
point is that there appears to be nutritional factors that could reduce 
the risk for recurrence. You will find some of these supplements listed on 
this page: http://www.raysahelian.com/breastcancer.html . 
Perhaps a multivitamin could serve as a substitute for the niacin and 
riboflavin. Some women may do fine with 50 mg of CoQ10, others may need 
100 mg. =================================== Emails from readers Q. Are there natural alternatives to testosterone prescription medicine 
use. My recent test showed I have low testosterone levels. A. I personally am of the opinion that the whole person has to be 
taken into account when considering hormone treatment as opposed to solely 
relying on blood studies. If a person feels fine even though a blood study 
shows a low testosterone hormone level, this does not necessary mean 
replacement is necessary. How do we know testosterone replacement will 
improve health in the long run? What if testosterone replacement therapy 
results in various short term and long term side effects? Even if 
testosterone is replaced, how do we know the ideal dosage and form? If a 
person has a low testosterone level but no major symptoms, it may be 
better not to interfere for the time being. However, if low testosterone 
levels are associated with symptoms of low testosterone, such as fatigue, 
low vitality, low sex drive, low mood, etc., then it may be appropriate to 
consider testosterone replacement or the use of certain natural  supplements that address the particular symptoms of testosterone 
deficiency. Having said this, if the testosterone level is extremely low, then 
prescription testosterone use may be a good option. Another option is the 
over the counter hormone DHEA, or perhaps pregnenolone. See http://www.raysahelian.com/testosterone.html Q. I am having much difficulty finding a mind 
boosting product that has ingredients that are safe enough to be used by 
breast cancer survivors. I finished radiation treatments in March of 07. I 
was taking ginkgo biloba which worked so well for me and I also felt 
better. Then I discovered that it had estrogenic like effects on the body 
and I stopped taking them because my cancer was 80% ER positive, and 10% 
progesterone positive. I am so frustrated. Its as if estrogen receptor positive breast 
cancer survivors are overlooked when it comes to this. A. I have not seen any research to indicate ginkgo biloba causes 
harm to those with breast cancer. One study concludes, "Ginkgo biloba 
extract can be considered as a potential alternative to HRT with 
chemopreventive effects on breast cancer. However, further studies on 
animals and humans will be required." J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2006 Aug;100(4-5):167-76. Another study says, 
"In humans, Ginkgo extracts inhibit the formation of radiation-induced 
(chromosome-damaging) clastogenic factors and ultraviolet light-induced 
oxidative stress - effects that may also be associated with anticancer 
activity. Flavonoid and terpenoid constituents of Ginkgo extracts may act 
in a complementary manner to inhibit several carcinogenesis-related 
processes, and therefore the total extracts may be required for producing 
optimal effects." Fundam Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Aug;17(4):405-17. Since human studies regarding various herbs and breast cancer are 
in short supply, it is premature to jump to conclusions regarding the role 
of a particular herb in being beneficial or harmful for breast cancer 
survivors. There's much yet that is not known. There are many factors that 
influence cancer cell growth or inhibition and herbs have dozens or 
hundreds of compounds in them that influence various stages of cancer 
growth or inhibition. In most cases, herbs have anti-cancer benefits. ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 11 -- September 1, 2007 =================================== Every 7 years I take a test to maintain my medical board certification. 
This test is prepared by the American Board of Family Medicine. The last 
time I took the test I clearly remember a multiple choice question 
regarding osteoarthritis. The choice of answers disturbed me. The question 
basically asked the ideal long term treatment for osteoarthritis. The 
choices were a) The use of aspirin, b) The use of NSAIDs such as naproxen 
or ibuprofen (Motrin), c) The use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) up to 4 grams 
a day, and d) Combination of aspirin and other NSAIDs. What disturbed me 
was that there was no option provided for glucosamine and chondroitin or 
other natural methods. In fact, throughout the whole test, I hardly 
remember any questions regarding the use of nutrition or nutritional 
supplements in the treatment of common medical conditions. Later I found 
out their "correct" answer was c) Acetaminophen. I recently came across a study comparing glucosamine versus 
acetaminophen that I discuss later. Physician Formulas web site has now added 2 new products for children. They 
now have 
chewable children's multivitamin, and chewable 100 percent arctic cod liver oil with DHA. See 
the images on your left. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas -- For the 
next few days, the following items are heavily discounted: Joint Power Rx with glucosamine, chondroitin, 
msm, cmo, curcumin, and other nutrients is formulated to support 
joint health. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid derived from 
kelp and suitable for vegetarians who do not wish to take fish oil 
capsules. Ginseng is well known to increase energy; the Ginseng Revitalizer product has a 
number of different ginseng species combined together. Ashwagandha is an 
herb used in Ayurveda for vitality and relaxation and mental clarity. Most 
people find half a capsule is enough. Broccoli sprouts contain sulforaphane. 
Lab studies show this compound is a potent inducer 
of protective enzymes that provide defense against cancer-causing chemicals. Saw 
palmetto is an herb used for prostate health and also found in Prostate 
Power Rx. =================================== 1. Delicious stevia drink It has been a very hot August in Los Angeles. Sometimes I tend to forget 
to drink enough water. I drink sodas only on rare occasions, and prefer 
not to drink too many fruit juices due to the high fructose content. And, 
there's just so much vegetable juice I can tolerate in a day. The majority 
of flavored drinks on the market have a lot of added sugar. So, how does 
one ingest more fluids if they find it difficult to drink enough water? 
How about stevia drinks? I have found my fluid intake increase 
dramatically  since I started adding lime-flavored Stevia Drink  
packets to a quart of water. The taste is delicious and I can easily drink 
an additional quart of water a day. I so much enjoy the taste of 
the lime... and it is calorie free!! I have served this drink to my 
friends and guests and almost everyone has loved it. You, too, can enjoy 
this calorie free refreshing drink. See the image on your left. A 
packet can be added to a quart of water and then you can refrigerate it or 
add ice to it. Kids are likely to enjoy the refreshing taste. This may 
reduce their dependence on sodas and sugared lemonade. If you substitute 
this calorie free drink for sugared sodas, you may actually consume a few 
hundred calories less a day. =================================== 2. Alpha lipoic acid improves insulin sensitivity in 
diabetics The purpose of this study 
by researchers at University Hospital of Endocrinology, Medical 
University, Sofia, Bulgaria, was to determine whether oral administration of alpha lipoic acid improves 
insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Twelve patients were treated with oral alpha-lipoic acid, 600 mg twice daily over 
a period of 4 weeks. Twelve subjects with normal glucose tolerance served 
as a control group in terms of insulin sensitivity. At the end of the treatment period 
insulin sensitivity of the diabetic patients  significantly increased: Comments: The alpha lipoic dosage used was 600 mg twice daily which 
is quite high. We have had some reports of heart rhythm disturbances with 
high dosages. When researchers do a study, they tend to use high dosages 
of a supplement or medication in order to induce a statistically 
measurable difference within the limited time they have. However, this 
does not mean that the dosage of a supplement or medication needs to be 
the same as that used in the studies. I think a dosage of R alpha lipoic 
acid, which is twice as potent as regular alpha lipoic acid, of 10 to 50 
mg a day is quite sufficient for most diabetics. For more information, see http://www.raysahelian.com/lipoic.html =================================== 3. Glucosamine as good as acetaminophen for 
osteoarthritis pain Researchers from Madrid, Spain, compared the benefit of glucosamine 
sulfate versus acetaminophen (Tylenol) on the symptoms of knee 
osteoarthritis during a 6-month treatment course. Patients were randomly 
assigned to receive oral glucosamine sulfate 1,500 mg once daily, 
acetaminophen 3 gm a day, or placebo. There were more responders to 
glucosamine sulfate (39%) and acetaminophen (33%) than to placebo (21%). 
The findings of this study indicate that, in the long run, glucosamine 
sulfate is more effective than placebo and as or more effective than 
acetaminophen in treating knee osteoarthritis symptoms. Comments: Acetaminophen reduces joint pain quicker than glucosamine 
but it can cause harm to the liver, even at doses of one gram a day. I do 
not think it is a good drug to be taken long term for a chronic condition 
such as osteoarthritis. There is a possibility that if glucosamine is 
combined with chondroitin and other nutrients or herbs it may be more 
beneficial than by itself. I wonder how many years it will take for the 
American Board of Family Medicine to include natural supplements as 
options in their multiple choice questions and answers. For details, see http://www.raysahelian.com/glucosamine.html or http://www.raysahelian.com/osteoarthritis.html =================================== 4. N-Acetylcysteine 
and cocaine craving Twenty three cocaine-dependent patients 
participated in a 4-week study to determine if acetylcysteine 
supplementation would have an effect on cocaine craving. They received N-acetylcysteine at doses of 1200 mg/day, 2400 mg/day or 3600 mg/day. All three doses were 
well tolerated. The majority of subjects who completed the study either 
terminated use of cocaine completely or significantly reduced their use of 
cocaine during treatment. Comments: It is exciting to know that readily available and 
inexpensive supplements are being tested to determine their potential in 
reducing drug dependence.  There is 
so much potential in the use of natural supplements for a number of 
medical conditions. It excites me when I come across such research whose 
findings can improve the lives of so many people. Longer term studies are 
needed to determine whether the initial benefits of acetylcysteine 
supplementation are sustained over time. For long term use, 1,000 mg of 
acetylcysteine seems reasonable. For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/acetylcysteine.html ====================================================================== Emails from readers Q. I live in China and bought 3 bottles of 
Passion RX with Yohimbe recently, which were mailed from the U.S, and 
started to take it several days ago. Yesterday I read a piece of 
information in a newspaper that Viagra could reduce the the level of 
activity of sperm. I wonder if Passion RX also has such kind of side 
effect, or just vice versa... I read also that Yohimbe has very bad side 
effects and is forbidden in some countries, but up to now I can see  good effect of Passion Rx on me, but no side effect. Can I go on taking 
it? A. The formula of Passion Rx has more than a dozen herbs and is 
completely different that Viagra which is a drug that blocks the activity 
of one enzyme. We have not tested 
Passion Rx on sperm quality but some of the ingredients in Passion Rx, 
such as maca, have beneficial effects on sperm health. As to yohimbe, I 
have been careful in putting in only small amounts of the herb in 
order to minimize side effects but still provide benefits that accrue over 
several days of use. In the long term, Passion Rx could be 
taken only 2 or 3 days a week with a complete week off every month or two. 
Passion Rx is also available without yohimbe. =================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 10 -- August 6, 2007 =================================== Ever since I was a child I remember questioning everything told to me by 
parents, teachers, or anyone that represented authority. At an early age I 
realized that adults did not have all the right answers. I don't know what made 
me such a rebel, but it makes sense how this attitude eventually led me to explore 
alternative medicine. Although I grew up eating very healthy as a child, during my 
teenage years I went overboard eating lots of candy, sweets, cakes, and 
ice cream. I think this diet, and genetics (my mom had acne), led me in my 
teenage years to have a moderate, and at times severe, pimple breakouts. I 
ended up going to several dermatologists who recommended antibiotics. I 
tried the antibiotics for a few months and all they did was make me sick and tired. I 
asked these dermatologists if diet had anything to do with acne, and they 
all said no. (Even now, more than 30 years later, many doctors deny a 
relationship between diet and acne.) I started questioning the wisdom of 
these doctors and traditional medical knowledge. I began exploring on my own 
for natural ways to treat this skin disorder. At age 20, one such path led 
me to visit a health food stores and search for books dealing with natural 
ways to deal with skin disorders. I become so interested in natural health 
that I was spending more time reading health books than books on business, 
which happened to be my major at Drexel University in Philadelphia. In my 
fourth year of college I finally switched to nutrition science and, after a 
superhuman effort cramming biology, physics, biochemistry, organic 
chemistry, physiology, and calculus within a year, and taking the MCAT 
medical school admission test, I got accepted at Thomas Jefferson Medical 
School in Philadelphia. I remember receiving the acceptance letter on a 
       
November day, the weather was dry and biting cold. The temperature 
was in the high 30s or low 40s but for several days I walked around campus with only 
a tee shirt. I was so euphoric that I did not even notice the frigid 
cold. Ever since age 20 I have been fascinated with the role of diet in 
health and disease. The reason I have given you this background is to put in 
perspective and share with you a recent study that indicates diet does 
have an influence on pimple formation. I also want to make the point that, even 
on some basic concepts involving the role of diet and disease, modern 
medicine can be way off the track. Hence, we should not take anything 
doctors say as the final word, but to keep in mind that in many cases 
alternatives exist. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - Until August

improved on low glycemic diet Foods that produce a high glycemic load -- such as 
sugared drinks, white bread and white potatoes -- cause a quick rise in 
blood sugar. More complex carbohydrates with fiber, such as unrefined 
cereals, grains, or beans, lead to a more gradual change and  have 
a low glycemic index. Dr. Robyn N. Smith, from the RMIT University in Melbourne, 
Australia, evaluated acne symptoms in 43 male patients, between 15 and 25 
years, who were randomly assigned to a low glycemic load diet or a normal 
diet. After 3 months, the low-glycemic diet was associated with a 
significant reduction in acne compared with the normal diet. In addition, 
the low-glycemic diet produced greater reductions in body weight and body 
mass and a greater increase in insulin sensitivity. Comments: One reason for the success of this low glycemic acne diet is that it 
limited the rise in high insulin levels. Chronically high levels of 
insulin may lead to blockages in skin pores and extra oil building up 
under the skin. I also think eating lots of fish full of omega-3 EPA and DHA oils 
is very helpful for acne. Even with the best diet, many teenagers will 
still be bothered with pimples, but the skin problem is likely to be less 
severe when a healthier diet is adopted. See http://www.raysahelian.com/acne.html for a full discussion on diet and 
acne. =================================== 2. Lactobacillus bacteria 
and antibiotic use An antibiotic often kills the bad bacteria causing an 
infection, but  antibiotics often also kill the good bacteria in your 
gut and other places in your body. By killing the good bacteria in the 
gut, harmful germs can get a foothold and cause diarrhea. British researchers wanted to know whether a probiotic drink 
containing Lactobacillus could help reduce the incidence of diarrhea 
associated with antibiotic use. Older hospital 
patients taking antibiotics drank 100 grams of a probiotic preparation twice a day during a course of antibiotics and 
for one week after the course finished. The placebo group received  
a sterile milkshake. The results showed that 12 percent of the probiotic group 
developed diarrhea  compared with 34 percent in the placebo group. The 
researchers conclude, "Consumption of a probiotic drink containing 
Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and S thermophilus can 
reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhea. This has the potential to decrease morbidity, 
healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 
50." Comments: When I was a resident working in hospitals I routinely 
saw patients suffer from diarrhea after being placed on antibiotics. I 
hope doctors and hospitals begin to add a probiotic supplement or drinks to 
the regimen of patients placed on antibiotics. So much misery could be 
reduced. For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/lactobacillus.html or http://www.raysahelian.com/probiotics.html =================================== 3. Magnesium and atrial fibrillation Magnesium, when used intravenously, appears to be helpful in the acute 
treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation. Dr. Orhan Onalan and colleagues 
from the University of Toronto reviewed randomized clinical trials on the 
role of magnesium in the treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation. They 
compared the effectiveness of magnesium to placebo or antiarrhythmic 
drugs. Magnesium therapy was much more effective than placebo, and did not 
have side effects. Dr. Orhan Onalan and colleagues conclude, "intravenous 
magnesium administration is an effective and safe strategy for the acute 
management of rapid atrial fibrillation." Comments: A recent study shows magnesium 
deficiency resulting from feeding a diet that has a third of the 
recommended magnesium intake induces heart rhythm problems, impairs 
glucose balance, and alters cholesterol metabolism. Doctors often use 
expensive drugs to control rhythm problems whereas in some cases 
an inexpensive and safe mineral exists. See http://www.raysahelian.com/atrialfibrillation.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/magnesium.html ====================================================================== 4. Reducing risk for prostate cancer with 
supplements Belgian researchers gave supplements of selenium, vitamin E, 
and soy isoflavonoids to a group of men diagnosed with isolated prostate 
cancer on biopsy. After six months, the results showed that taking these 
supplements led to a decrease in the PSA level. A lower PSA level could 
predict a lower risk of prostate cancer in the future. See http://www.raysahelian.com/prostatecancer.html ====================================================================== Emails from readers Q. I just wanted to email you to thank you for your wonderful product, 
mucuna pruriens. I have had Parkinsonism for the past 5 years and have 
been struggling for most of that time. When I started taking your product 
my symptoms have minimized from me taking 5 levadopa/carbidopa pills per 
day to 2-3. I take mucuna in the morning and am pretty well set until 
afternoon. A. We are always so happy to hear how these natural supplements are 
actually helping people. Please keep us updated regarding the dosage used, 
and if any side effects. For those of you who are considering using mucuna pruriens, start 
slow at half a capsule and make sure you have approval by your doctor. The 
dosage of Parkinson's medicines may be reduced since if you add a full capsule of mucuna to other medicines used for Parkinson's disease, overstimulation or 
other side effects could occur. Q. I read with interest your comments in the last 
two issues of the newsletter about taking too many supplements but I 
am confused. I can well understand that one, thinking that every 
supplement that 
is said to be helpful is and takes it, may make mistakes thinking they are 
doing good for themselves and end up taking many more supplements than 
their body can handle. But how is one to tell. The suggestions you 
provided are so general. How is one to access information that can be 
applied to an individual based on age, sex, medical conditions, etc.? A. There is no easy guide or formula regarding supplementation that 
applies to everyone. Research in the field of nutritional 
supplementation is very early and many products are on the market that 
have hardly been tested in humans. Every doctor, herbalist, nutritionist, 
or scientist, is likely to have a different opinion on which supplements a 
person should or should not take and in what dosages. Some health care 
providers don't believe that any supplements are necessary while others 
recommend their patients take a dozen or more. I fully recognize the fact 
that many consumers want precise answers, but you have to accept the fact 
that no such thing is possible. Life is full of uncertainty. Does anyone 
know what would happen if you took, for instance, a vitamin E pill every 
day for 40 years? No. What  if you took 20 units compared to 100 
units or 400 units. What about if you took a synthetic vitamin E pill or a 
natural vitamin E complex. How do we know whether it is better to take a curcumin 
capsule versus resveratrol, grape seed extract, green tea extract, or the 
hundreds of herbs or nutrients that are available to us? Just consider now 
the countless possibilities of various combinations of vitamins and herbs 
in varying dosages. And since many people are taking pharmaceutical 
medicines in varying dosages and combinations, imagine the endless 
potential interactions that could occur. The reason I am vague in my discussion on this topic is because I want to 
be scientifically honest. I could easily make a list of several 
supplements and suggest that everyone should buy these particular 
products. But that would not be right or honest. You have to accept the 
fact that science does not have such answers at this time. If you happen to be the type of 
person who wants exact recommendations, I am sure there are websites or 
marketers out there that will ask you to fill out a questionnaire and then 
make recommendations for to you to buy their particular products (in most 
instances the majority will end up getting the same recommendations). It is up 
to each person and their health care provider to read all they can about 
diet, exercise, supplements, and other lifestyle factors and then decide 
which regimens and products appeal to them. As a general guideline, if you are 
sensitive to herbs, are female, are older, or taking pharmaceutical 
medicines, begin with low dosages. One option is to try different 
supplements by themselves for a week or two to see how they make you feel. 
Over time, experiment with different ones and then you can find a few that 
you really like. Once in a while you can try a different one. I actually 
enjoy the process of trying out different supplements and I pay attention 
to how they make me feel in terms of mood, energy, wellbeing, clarity of 
thinking, vitality, vision enhancement, etc. Much, of course, also depends on whether you are 
treating a particular medical condition such as high blood pressure, 
arthritis, prostate problems, etc., and this could lead you to particular 
supplements that specifically address these conditions. =================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 9 -- July 1, 2007 =================================== In the last issue of the newsletter I mentioned my friend who had called 
me for advice regarding the supplements he was taking.Â  Each day he 
was swallowing about 30 capsules and tablets, of about 15 different 
supplements. I told him that I felt uncomfortable with people taking too 
many supplements and that there was no proof taking so many was a healthy 
thing to do. I did not say in the last issue what recommendations I had 
for him. I purposely did not want to be specific since there is no right 
answer. But, we had many emails from readers of the newsletter that wanted 
to know what I told him. Since he had about 15 different bottles on his 
kitchen counter, I mentioned to him that perhaps he could alternate their 
use and take 5 or 6 different supplements a day rather than 15. This way he could go through 
all of them every 3 days. I also told him 
       
that I had no proof that taking more would 
not be helpful, and ultimately it is up to him and his health care 
provider to decide what to take. Some people may not need any supplements, others may do fine taking 
10 or more different ones. However, as a general rule, there should be a 
good reason for taking more than 6 to 10 supplements each day (such as 
treating a medical condition). Think of supplements the same way 
as the produce section of your grocery store. There are dozens of healthy 
vegetables and fruits available to you and each one of them has a unique 
set of vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, flavonoids, and other beneficial 
substances. However, this does not mean you should eat them all every day. 
Same with supplements, there are literally hundreds of products that have 
antioxidant and potential health-benefiting properties. But it is not reasonable to take them all every day. One way you can tell if you are taking too many pills is if 
you notice your heart rate going faster, your body temperature going 
higher, feeling overstimulated or anxious, having uncontrolled or restless 
energy, and very importantly, if you find your sleep is disturbed. Many 
herbs (for instance ginseng, aphrodisiacs, and herbs that increase energy) and nutrients 
(for instance B vitamins) can cause alertness. You may have trouble falling asleep or perhaps experience 
shallow sleep. Or, you may wake up in the morning an hour or two earlier than 
usual. If this happens to you, take a break from these supplements and 
resume a couple of days later at a lower amount. Also, keep in mind, that 
the effects accumulate over time. If you take a pill on the first 
day, some of the effects may last into the next day. So, when you take the 
same pill the second day, it is already adding on to some of the remnants 
of the first day. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - For the next few days, the 
following supplements are on special discount: Â Prostate Power Rx provides 
saw palmetto, pygeum, stinging nettle, phytosterols and other substances 
for prostate health. Curcumin, an extract from turmeric, continues to get 
a lot of press for its many health benefits found in lab studies. To cool 
off during the hot summer days, consider a no calorie Stevia Drink. All 
you have to do is open a packet and empty it in cold, iced water for a 
refreshing drink. Acetylcarnitine is a mind booster and antioxidant, some 
people notice a mild appetite suppression. Bilberry is an herbal extract 
used for better vision. Avena sativa is a mild, gentle aphrodisiac. 
Acidophilus is a probiotic product that supports colon health by altering 
the intestinal ecology to favor "friendly" flora.Â Glucosamine is a 
nutrient used for joint health. =================================== 1. Benefit of Flaxseed I am a big fan of flaxseeds. I add them to soups and enjoy the crunchy taste. 
Flaxseeds are helpful for colon health, similar in some ways to psyllium 
fiber.
Flaxseed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and lignans, a fiber found on the 
seed coat. Researchers at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina 
took a look at the seed's role as a food supplement in 161 men who 
were scheduled to undergo surgery for prostate cancer.
Half of the men added 30 grams of flaxseed (about one ounce) daily to their 
diets for about 30 days.
After the surgery, the researchers looked at the men's tumor cells to see 
how quickly the cancer had multiplied.
The cancer cells in  the flaxseed groups were growing about 30 to 40 percent 
slower than the control group.
The flaxseed study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. In another study, obese individuals who were given flaxseed had 
reduced levels of inflammation in their body. For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/flaxseed.html , or to learn about lignans, http://www.raysahelian.com/lignan.html , =================================== 2. CoQ10 Reverses Muscle Damage from Statin 
Cholesterol Drugs Those of you who have read my newsletters for the past 3 years are 
familiar with my warnings regarding side effects from statin drug use. I 
have mentioned before that statin drugs cause muscle pain and damage, and 
CoQ10 could be helpful. A small study published in the May 15th issue of 
the American Journal of Cardiology supports my viewpoint.Â  Statin 
drugs, such as Lipitor and Zocor, lower cholesterol levels, but at the 
same time they interfere with the making of coenzyme Q10 in the body. 
Scientists now suspect that CoQ10 deficiency as a result of stating drug 
use may partly, or fully, 
contribute to the development of muscle damage. Dr. Giuseppe Caso and colleagues from Stony 
Brook University, Stony Brook, New York gave 100 mg of CoQ10 for one month 
to 32 patients using statins. Pain intensity decreased by 40% after a 
month of CoQ10 treatment whereas patients treated with vitamin E (as 
placebo) experienced no change in pain intensity. Sixteen of 18 coenzyme 
Q10-treated patients experienced a decrease in pain. My comments: I am not sure 100 mg of CoQ10 is needed in the long 
run. If 30 mg or 50 mg works for you, then take these lower amounts. 
Researchers often have a limited time to do a study and use high dosages 
of a medicine to elicit a response, but that does not mean that same 
dosage should be used forever. For more info, see www.raysahelian.com/coq10.html or www.raysahelian.com/statins.html =================================== 3. Cinnamon lowers blood 
sugar It has been quite a number of years now 
that researchers have tested the role of cinnamon supplements in blood 
sugar control. Most studies, but not all, have shown cinnamon to play a 
positive role. In this latest study done at MalmÃ¶ University Hospital, 
University of Lund, in Sweden, the effect of cinnamon was tested on the 
rate of gastric emptying, the after meal blood glucose response, and 
satiety in healthy subjects. Healthy subjects ingested 300 grams 
of rice pudding or 300 grams of rice pudding along with 6 grams of 
cinnamon. The addition of cinnamon to the rice pudding significantly delayed 
gastric emptying and lowered the  glucose response after the meal. My comments: Most cinnamon supplements come in 300 to 500 mg of 
regular powder, and lower amounts for concentrated extracts. It would seem 
reasonable to use about 3 grams a day of the regular powder and less of 
the extracts. This study did not include other supplements. Many people 
who have diabetes are often taking several other supplements and 
medicines. It is not clear how the cinnamon addition would interact with 
these medicines or other products. For this reason perhaps starting with 
one cinnamon capsule and gradually building up could be a good option. 
Discuss with your health care provider. For more info, see www.raysahelian.com/diabetes.html and www.raysahelian.com/cinnamon.html =================================== 4. Have you had your share of Flavonoids today? If your diet has plenty of flavonoids, you are likely helping maintain a 
healthy brain in old age and lowering your risk for heart disease. Flavonoids 
are potent antioxidants found 
in plant-based foods from red wine to tea to vegetables. Dr. Luc Letenneur of INSERM 
in Bordeaux, France, followed a group of 
1,640 older, dementia-free individuals for 10 years, recording information 
on their diet at the beginning of the study.
The men and women who took in the most flavonoids showed significantly 
better mental performance at the beginning of the study, even after the 
researchers adjusted the data for the influence of sex, level of 
education, and age.
And those who ranked in the top half for flavonoid consumption showed more 
favorable progress in their cognitive function over time; for example, 
after 10 years, men and women in the lowest fourth for flavonoid 
consumption had lost 2.1 points on a test of cognitive function known as 
the Mini-Mental State Examination, compared to a 1.2-point loss for the 
people in the highest fourth for flavonoid intake. See more info on 
flavonoids at www.raysahelian.com/flavonoids.html =================================== Emails from readers Q. Have you done a comparison between chia seeds 
and flaxseeds? I have just heard of the chia seed. I am a long time user 
of fresh ground flax seed, but if chia is easier to store, digest etc and 
is more beneficial than flax seed maybe I should make the switch. A. Is an orange healthier than a grapefruit? They are both a good 
addition to the diet. One option is to use a little bit of both since each 
seed will provide a different set of nutrients the body can use. Q. So, what's 
up with all these energy drinks? If a person drinks one big can a day, is that bad? A. There are hundreds of different energy drinks on the market, 
each with its own different formula. We can't make blanket statements regarding 
all energy drinks. As a rule, though, we don't think they are necessary since 
many of them contain lots of sugar and stimulants such as caffeine which are not the best option 
for sustained all day energy. A healthy diet with plenty of physical activity 
and deep sleep at night should take care of most cases of low energy. Some 
of the energy drinks may give you a short boost of energy followed by a 
drop. See www.raysahelian.com/energy.html =================================== =================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 8 -- June 1, 2007 =================================== A friend of mine called me recently for advice. He is 53 years old, very 
healthy, and wanted to know what I thought about his supplement regimen. I 
asked  what he was taking. I was shocked. 
He started reading the labels, and here's some of the ones I remember him 
mentioning: curcumin, garlic, cayenne, resveratrol, chrysin, 
multivitamins, Mind Power Rx, ginseng, zinc tablets, Prostate Power Rx, alpha lipoic 
acid, lycopene, fish oil, flax seed oil, calcium, vitamin D, and a few others I 
can't recall. "Do you really take all of these every day?" I asked him. 
"Yes, every day. I often take 2 or 3 capsules from each bottle. My 
intent is to take a lot of antioxidants to stay 
young." I'm a strong believer in supplements and truly 
feel that they are underused by the medical profession. Sometimes people 
proudly list a dozen supplements they take daily, thinking that the more 
they ingest, the healthier they will be. I don't think there is any 
evidence to support this viewpoint. In fact, my interpretation of studies 
leads me to believe that a certain amount of supplements can be helpful, 
but after a point they could interfere with optimal health and lead to 
unexpected or unforeseen health problems. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - For the next few days, the 
following supplements are on special discount: Â Mind Power Rx - helps 
improve mental alertness and wakefulness along with boosting mental 
stamina. Serrapeptase or Serratiopeptidase - is an enzyme isolated from a 
microorganism in silkworm. N Acetyl cysteine - is a precursor in the body 
to the antioxidant glutathione, which is produced intracellularly, 
particularly by the liver. Acerola Powder - is derived from acerola 
cherries, one of nature's highest sources of vitamin C. Cinnamon extract - 
has strong antioxidant activity and has the potential to help maintain 
healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Banaba - has been used in the 
Philippines for blood sugar control. Mind Boosters - is a best selling 
book written by Dr. Sahelian regarding the natural supplements that 
enhance mood, memory, and mind. =================================== 1. Another Reason to Eat Broccoli Researchers at the University of California, 
Los Angeles, found in lab studies that diindolymethane (DIM), a compound resulting from 
digestion of cruciferous vegetables, and genistein, an isoflavone in soy, 
reduce the production of two proteins needed for breast and ovarian cancer 
to spread.
The UCLA team plans to evaluate the theory in mice. Findings of a lab study do not necessarily mean that a 
person ingesting a DIM or genistein supplement will have benefit in terms 
of cancer prevention. However, it is intriguing to think that perhaps 
these supplements, or others, can someday be found to be beneficial in 
terms of cancer prevention or treatment, either by themselves or combined 
with other natural supplements or even pharmaceutical medicines. In the meantime those with cancer 
or a family history of such, could discuss with their doctors whether it 
would be appropriate for their particular situation to supplement with 
these nutrients. There are many supplements that have shown to play a role 
in cancer, and it is difficult to know which one to choose or which 
combination to take. Each patient with cancer is unique. One option is to have 
half a dozen different 
supplements and then take one each day, alternating their use. For 
instance, one can alternate the use of curcumin, DIM, genistein, 
mangosteen, graviola, resveratrol, reishi, ashwagandha, or others. I would 
suggest having a day off each week.Â  regarding some supplements that have 
been tested for their role in cancer treatment. For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/cancer.html regarding some supplements that have 
been tested for their role in cancer treatment. Other links of interest, http://www.raysahelian.com/diindolylmethane-dim.html or http://www.raysahelian.com/genistein.html =================================== 2. The ideal 
aspirin dose Long-term aspirin therapy at doses greater than 81 mg per day does 
not enhance the prevention of heart disease but does increase the risk of 
stomach bleeding. Over 50 million adults in the US are on long-term 
aspirin therapy for heart disease prevention, yet the optimal daily dose 
is still a point of controversy. Dr. Charles L. Campbell, from the 
University of Kentucky in Lexington, and colleagues performed a review of 
relevant studies. They found that while aspirin doses as high as 1300 mg 
per day are approved for clinical use, scientific data indicate that doses 
as low as 30 mg per day provides the full physiologic effect of higher 
doses. My personal opinion 
is that aspirin, in a dosage of about 81 mg three times a week, should provide 
enough benefits and at the same time minimize the risk for stomach ulcer 
or bleeding. I also think fish oils could be beneficial in thinning the 
blood. Many herbs have mild blood thinning potential. Some of these 
include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, and green tea extract EGCG. It is possible 
the need for aspirin could be further reduced by the use of some 
supplements, but there's still much we need to learn about this before 
making recommendations. For more 
info on aspirin, see www.raysahelian.com/aspirin.html =================================== 3. Avandia increases heart attack risk - Wait a while 
before using a new drug When I was a medical student and resident I was often excited when a new 
drug was approved. At the time I was naive and assumed when a drug was 
approved by governmental agencies, that it was quite certain it was safe 
or that all potential side effects had been discovered. It wasn't until I 
gained a little more experience as a doctor that I came to realize that 
the new drug approval process was not fail-proof. Case in point is the 
latest furor over Avandia, the diabetes drug that millions of people have 
taken for blood sugar control. An MSNBC.com article asks, "How can big 
safety issues go undetected in medicines taken by millions of people for 
many years, as happened this week with the diabetes pill Avandia and a few 
years ago with the painkiller Vioxx?" They add, "The roads â and fingers 
this week â point to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. From a 
companyâs labs to a consumerâs lips, the chronically understaffed federal 
agency has the power and duty to keep dangerous products from harming the 
public." There are many people who have benefited from oral medicines used 
for diabetes, but I think many more could benefit from natural options. =================================== Emails from readers Q. I discovered your alpha lipoic acid website 
just recently as well as the analysis of different supplements I'm 
interested in. Your work is excellent and very important. I've been 
browsing the internet for a longtime regarding treatment of diabetes, high blood 
pressure, and high cholesterol. Started as per numerous and similar 
advices with alpha lipoic acid with lots of hope. The alpha lipoic acid 
almost resulted in a syncope (fainting) -- the very first time and the 
second attempt (I took 250mg both times in a span of 2 months) I had 
extremely violent tachycardia (rapid heart rate)  and very high blood 
pressure. I also experienced bone and joint pain. As per your analysis of 
this supplement I realize the dosage was very high. Thank God I found 
you!! I thought I will die. I thought this will help you to confirm the 
very similar alpha lipoic acid symptoms your clients vented on your web 
site. I think one has to experience on himself first with the smallest 
dosage possible and then make slow adjustments. Thank you very much for 
your diligent work--you just may have saved my life. Q. Can't thank you enough for all the information 
you send. I keep sharing with my friends and now I am passing your website 
to my customers (I am a hairstylist always trying to promote natural 
health and natural healing first)...God Bless and have a great week! Q. My email is in regards to melatonin for my child. 
My son's pediatrician recommended us giving him (almost 5 years old now) 
Melatonin nightly because he had a hard time falling asleep. We have given him 
at least 1 mg every night for several years. Recently we started observing and 
he started complaining of ''tremors" which looked like he was shivering from 
being cold. He recently had a 48 hour EEG which was normal. We stopped using the 
Melatonin and the ''tremors" have disappeared. My child also has had some 
behavioral problems, requiring discipline and ''time outs'' but since we stopped 
the Melatonin this has improved. I also saw some information recently that 
Melatonin affects Human Growth Hormone, my son is very short for his age, in the 
3% for his age. I am a very concerned parent. Do you feel that the long term 
Melatonin use has contributed to his growth problems? The ''tremors?" The 
discipline issues? His lack of growth? I saw a mention that you don't recommend 
its use for more than 2 times per week. Do you think there will be any long term 
problems my child will experience because we used melatonin tremendously more 
than your recommendation? A. The long term use of melatonin in children and adults has not 
been evaluated enough to know the consequences. It is possible that the 
conditions you mention regarding your child's health may be due to melatonin 
excess. If that is the case, hopefully his body and pineal gland will be able to 
recover and readjust after stopping the melatonin. It may be a good idea not to 
use melatonin until he is much older. It is possible that these side effects and 
problems will reverse with time, however we are not familiar with any child who 
has been given high doses of melatonin nightly for several years, so we don't 
have any first hand experience. I can't be sure that these problems are related 
to melatonin use, but it is a possibility. =================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 7 -- May 6, 2007 =================================== Hormone supplements, when misused, can be harmful and dangerous. We 
recently had an email that illustrates the point: "i was taking 10 mg of DHEA 
and 50 mg of pregnenolone together for 2 months and my body felt arthritic. i 
had a hard time walking. i had a hard time sleeping. Can you tell me what 
happened?" My research staff and I get more than a thousand 
emails a month from supplement users who ask us questions or tell us their 
personal experiences with natural products. This gives us a unique 
perspective on the effects of these over the counter pills on individuals 
from all walks of life and from all parts of the world. Breast cancer rates have recently dropped, and many scientists believe 
that the decreased use of hormone replacement with estrogen and 
progesterone is a contributing factor. I will later discuss my thoughts on 
the proper use of prescription and natural hormones. We have had quite a few emails recently regarding concerns of new FDA 
guidance proposals on alternative medicine. See the bottom of the 
newsletter for 2 links that help explain the confusion. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - For the next few days the 
following 6 items will be highly discounted: MultiVit Rx, 5-HTP, 
Chondroitin sulfate, Fenugreek, Ginkgo biloba, and Spirulina. MultiVit Rx 
has become a very popular multivitamin product. Even though it says to 
take up to 4 capsules a day, two capsules are often enough. Most users 
notice enhanced mood, energy, vision and wellbeing. We find a high rate of 
reorder with this multivitamin supplement. 5-HTP is a supplement that 
easily converts into serotonin. Chondroitin sulfate is used by those for 
joint support. Chondroitin is also found in a popular product called Joint 
Power Rx formulated by Dr. Sahelian. Fenugreek is now being researched for 
blood sugar control and may influence triglyceride levels; Ginkgo biloba 
is a mind booster and may have some health improvement benefits; Spirulina 
has been popular for several years as a functional food. =================================== 1 .
Ginkgo biloba extends life? I thought you might be interested in hearing about a French study that 
found that older people who take Ginkgo biloba may be 
living longer. Surprisingly, this same study did not find ginkgo biloba 
reduced the risk of cognitive decline. Dr. Jean-Francois Dartigues at the 
University of Bordeaux followed a group of 3,500 men and women 65 and older 
for over a period of 13 years. Those who used ginkgo lived a little longer 
than those who did not take the supplement. Ginkgo biloba extract has been 
sold in France for more than three decades.
At the start of the study, 6 percent of the participants were taking 
Ginkgo biloba extract, The researchers found that while the effect of the 
herb on mortality risk remained significant, it had no effect on the 
likelihood of developing dementia. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, March 2007. 
See http://www.raysahelian.com/ginkgo.html Comments: I can't say for sure that taking ginkgo will help you 
live longer. It is possible that the individuals who began taking ginkgo 
biloba may have been more health conscious to begin with and paid more 
attention to their overall diet which was the real factor for life 
extension. Or, the reason ginkgo blioba was not found to be helpful in 
reducing dementia is perhaps those who started the ginkgo may have had a 
family history of dementia or were already starting to notice some form of 
cognitive decline. Nevertheless, gingko biloba is a good supplement and I 
can't imagine taking 20 mg or 60 mg of the extract with breakfast a few 
times a week would pose any danger. I don't think it is necessary to take 
a ginkgo supplement every day. Mind Power Rx has 30 mg of ginkgo biloba 
extract per capsule. Those who are taking blood thinning medicines such as 
Coumadin should be careful since ginkgo has mild blood thinning 
properties. I don't think one herb or nutrient alone can be counted on to 
prevent dementia or treat cognitive decline. The brain is too complicated 
and needs many different nutrients. I prefer a mind boosting supplement 
that has a number of different vitamins, nutrients, and herbs combined in 
small amounts. =================================== 2. The Ongoing 
Hormone confusion and debate - and good news about Black Cohosh Breast cancer rates fell sharply in 2003, and then held steady at the 
lower rate in 2004. The most likely reason for the sharp fall in rates was that large numbers of women stopped taking hormone therapy 
for menopause. More doctors are now realizing that the recommendation for estrogen and 
progestin use after menopause (which has gone on for the past few decades) 
may not have been such good advice after all. As many of you suspect, 
doctors, and the medical establishment, are not always right, but 
hopefully most doctors have a tendency to correct themselves when 
presented with fresh evidence. I would suggest we all accept the fact that it is going to take a 
long time to find out the answers to the following questions: When is 
hormone replacement therapy appropriate? Which hormones should be used? 
What dosages are appropriate? These may seem like simple questions but 
after decades of research there still is no general agreement in the 
medical community regarding guidelines to appropriate hormone replacement. I am going to provide you with some of my general thoughts that you 
can use to guide your decisions. First, do not use hormones, whether 
synthetic or natural, unless you have a good reason to and there are no 
other good options (such as nutrients and herbs along with exercise, deep 
sleep, yoga, etc). Second, if you do need to take hormones, use the least 
amounts that work. Third, whenever possible use natural hormones rather 
than synthetic or horse-derived. Fourth, reevaluate your need for these 
hormones, and the dosages that you are using, on a regular basis. Perhaps 
your required dosage could be reduced over time, or even stopped 
altogether. The beneficial dosages may be a fraction of what doctors normally 
prescribe or are available over the counter. Perhaps women may do well at 
half the estrogen and progesterone amount normally prescribed. DHEA and 
pregnenolone are sold at up to 100 mg a capsule. Any dosage above 5 to 10 
mg could be harmful and dangerous. In fact, those who actually benefit 
from DHEA or pregnenolone may do so at dosages less than 5 mg, perhaps 
even as low as 1 or 2 mg. I have been telling the natural health industry 
to limit the amount in each capsule to less than 10 mg, yet there are many 
companies who still sell 25, 50, and 100 mg pills. They are not doing 
their customers a good service. See http://www.raysahelian.com/dhea.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/menopause.html Interestingly, A new study 
provides preliminary evidence that black cohosh herb may reduce breast 
cancer risk.Â  Dr. Timothy R. Rebbeck of the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia compared 949 women with 
breast cancer to 1,524 healthy controls. Women who reported taking black 
cohosh were at a lower risk of breast cancer. Previous studies have shown 
that black cohosh can block cell growth. The herb is also an antioxidant, 
and has been shown to have anti-estrogen effects as well. International 
Journal of Cancer, April 1, 2007. Comments: It is also possible that those who took black cohosh did 
not take estrogen or progesterone, and hence, had a lower rate of breast 
cancer when compared to women who took the hormones. =================================== 3 . Forskolin and 
urinary tract infections Duke University microbiologist Dr. Soman N. Abraham found that many E. coli bacteria 
(the ones responsible for a large number of bladder infections) hide in cells lining the bladder, out of reach of antibiotics. However, 
when the researchers injected forskolin ( an extract from the herb coleus 
forskohlii) directly into the bladder or 
intravenously, it appeared to expel the majority 
of "hiding" E. coli, thus exposing them to the antibiotics. This 
is important in order to prevent recurrent cystitis when the bacteria come 
out of hiding and cause another infection shortly after the first one is 
treated. Comments: Whether forskolin supplements taken orally help 
individuals with bladder infections is not clear at this time. Even if 
forskolin works in humans, we still need research to find out the ideal 
dosage, when to take it (before, during, or after antibiotic treatment) 
and how long to take it for. See http://www.raysahelian.com/forskolin.html ============================ Email questions and comments Q. Is coconut oil good for you as some web sites 
are telling me? A. Some websites are making claims for coconut oil 
that seem to go beyond what the limited research tells us. It is 
preferable to ingest small amounts of a variety of oils in order to obtain a number of different fatty 
acids, as opposed to a large amount of one type of oil. In my opinion, fish oils and flax seed oil are some of the healthiest 
options , but olive oil and small amounts of coconut and other oils can 
certainly be incorporated in one's diet, but I don't think large amounts 
are healthy as some websites promote. As much as possible ingest your oils 
without heating, and if you do use them for cooking, keep the cooking 
temperature as low as possible. See http://www.raysahelian.com/coconutoil.html Q. Just a note you might pass on to takers 
of this Prostate Power Rx supplement: My husband has been taking this for 
over three years and notices a great difference in the less frequency of 
going to the bathroom. However, he now sees that it appears to be less 
effective than when he began taking it in the first place. What he has 
found out (by accident when he went on a trip and forgot to take the 
capsules with him) is that if he stops taking them for two weeks every 
once in a while, and then begins again, the effectiveness of the 
supplement goes back to its original strength for a period of months. We 
love your web site! A. Another reason to take breaks from supplement use. We really 
enjoy getting feedback from users of supplements. Q. Dr. Sahelian, thank you for the Epsom Salt 
"solution" for toe nail fungus. I have been battling a slight problem with 
this for almost 2 years. After only 3 weeks I have seen significant 
improvement. Thank you so much! A. You're welcome. Most of the time it takes several months of 
Epsom salt use for the toe nail fungus to be eliminated or significantly 
reduced. See http://www.raysahelian.com/nailfungus.html Regarding the new FDA guidance proposals on 
alternative medicine, see http://www.raysahelian.com/alternativemedicine.html and scroll down to

news, see http://www.naturalhealthline.com/ =================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 6 -- April 17, 2007 =================================== Some of the most common questions my research staff and I are asked relate 
to how often a supplement should be taken, whether it is safe to use for 
prolonged periods, and whether a particular supplement can be taken the 
same day as another. It is very difficult to give answers that would apply 
to everyone since there are so many factors that influence your need or 
response to supplements. These factors include your age, sex, overall health 
status, activity level, climate you live in, diet, types of fluids consumed, alcohol 
or caffeine use, body weight, 
whether you are currently on prescription medicines, quality of the herbal products, 
your sensitivity and tolerance, whether the herbs are whole herb or 
extracts, whether the supplements are taken with food or on an empty 
stomach, the time of day they are used, and the dosage of the supplements. However, since may people who 
email us are frustrated that their doctors have no clue, I will provide 
some general guidelines that you can adapt to your own unique situation. 
There's not enough space to cover all the supplements in one newsletter, 
therefore I 
will begin with the letter A, and in subsequent 
newsletters proceed further along the alphabet. One point I would like to emphasize: When you take a 
supplement you have never been exposed to before, do your best to try it a on day when you are 
not using other supplements or medicines. This way you can better tell what kind of 
effect this new pill has on you. Also, if you are sensitive to herbs or supplements, 
at first use a portion of a capsule or tablet to avoid any potential 
harmful effects, particularly if you are taking pharmaceutical medicines 
or are taking hormones. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - Until 
May 2nd the following items are at very high discount. Passion Rx without yohimbe, Niacin no flush, Nattokinase, Pantethine, 
       
Green Tea extract and Royal Jelly. We also wish to inform you that we have a new supplement: 
A stevia sweetened chewing gum 
called SteviaDent. Passion Rx without yohimbe 
is now on sale. This is the latest version (the 14th mdification since it was 
introduced in February 2004). Dr. Sahelian is determined to make each 
batch better than the last. The Physician Formulas website has guidelines 
on how to best use this latest version of Passion Rx, which happens to be 
the most effective batch thus far with the fewest side effects. Niacin no flush is used for blood 
lipid management, and we don't suggest using more than one pill a day. Nattokinase is a blood clot dissolving enzyme (we wish 
more human research was available with this enzyme); Pantethine is an 
active form of pantothenic acid and many users notice increased energy; 
Green tea extract has EGCG, a compound getting more and more popular; and 
lastly Royal Jelly, a beehive product that many people find provides a 
sense of energy and vitality. =================================== 1 .
Should you take Garlic supplements? Garlic supplements are one of the best 
selling natural products around. But small amounts of garlic supplements given to 
patients with high cholesterol levels have not 
shown any dramatic improvement in cholesterol levels. These results have 
prompted certain skeptics of nutritional supplements to dismiss garlic as 
a beneficial herb. This is premature. I am not convinced garlic is beneficial in 
lowering the level of cholesterol, but it has many other health benefits. 
Based on the studies that I have read, garlic may help lower 
blood pressure, has antimicrobial activity, and could have anti-cancer 
potential. Plus, it tastes great. I prefer to eat raw garlic and I 
personally don't take a garlic supplement. I suspect some of the benefits 
of raw garlic are reduced when garlic is cooked or processed and packaged in pill form. 
For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/garlic.html =================================== 2. Should you have a Mammogram in your forties? According to The American 
College of Physicians, which represents 120,000 internists, mammograms may not be necessary for women in their forties. The American College of 
Physicians based its recommendations on a comprehensive review of 
mammography research that concluded that the benefit is less clear for 
women in their 40s than for those 50 and older, and that screening carries 
significant risks, including unnecessary biopsies, exposure to radiation, surgery and chemotherapy. 
Women who are told their mammogram shows a possible cancer that turns out to be 
a false alarm are likely to suffer anxiety for a long time. My comments: I tend to agree that mammograms should be reserved to 
women over 50, except perhaps in women who have a very strong family 
history of a mother or sisters who had breast cancer at a young age. There are  cases where 
some 
women are 
alive today because they had a routine mammogram done in their 40s and a cancer 
was picked up early and treated appropriately. However, we cannot let such infrequent cases mar our 
judgment regarding the overall benefit versus risk of millions of American 
women in their 40s subjected to mammograms that may lead to unnecessary 
worry, biopsies, surgeries, false positives, and perhaps not extend life span 
even if diagnosed earlier than usual. See http://www.raysahelian.com/breastcancer.html =================================== 3 . Niacin overdose Niacin pills in high doses are sometimes taken by people to pass a urine 
drug test. However this method does not work and could produce severe side 
effects. University of Pennsylvania doctors discuss four individuals who 
took several niacin pills to try to beat their impending drug screening 
tests. Emergency room doctors discovered these individuals had liver 
toxicity, heart palpitations, skin reactions, nausea, dizziness and 
vomiting. See http://www.raysahelian.com/niacin.html My comments: Many people think vitamins are harmless, but this 
report clearly illustrates very high dosages of even simple B vitamins can have 
unpleasant consequences. =================================== 4. How To Take Supplements Wisely and Safely Please note that the following suggestions are based on my several decades 
of personal and professional experience. My opinions may change with time. 
Other nutrition experts and doctors are likely to have different 
viewpoints. Unless otherwise noted, I am referring to the dosage of one 
capsule of the products available at the Physician Formulas website. I 
will cover additional supplements in upcoming issues. In many cases it may 
be a good idea to take a week off from a particular supplement every 2 or 
3 months or so, unless your doctor is recommending the supplement to treat 
a particular medical condition. The lower the dosage of the supplements 
you take, the more of them can be combined. For more details on each 
supplements, visit http://www.raysahelian.com . Acai is a berry from the Amazon forest which has many compounds with 
antioxidant properties. One capsule can be taken a few days a week, and an 
acai berry supplement seems to be safe taken with other supplements. No 
side effects have yet been reported to us with acai supplement intake. Acerola cherries have one of the highest contents of vitamin C of any 
fruit. Acerola appears to be safe to take on a daily basis and we are not 
aware of side effects. Acerola seems to be okay when mixed with other 
supplements. . Acetyl-l-Carnitine 300 mg is a potent mind booster and antioxidant. Most 
people find one capsule is the right dose while some people may find the 
occasional use of 2 capsules helpful. Acetylcarnitine increases alertness 
and focus. It would be best not to take a capsule with other brain 
boosting supplements due to possible overstimulation. One option is to 
alternate the use of acetylcarnitine one day with Mind Power Rx the next 
day, or alternate with other brain supplements such as DMAE, choline, 
ginkgo, etc. Doses above 500 mg may, in some people, lead to 
overstimulation, insomnia, and nausea. For long term use one capsule 3 
times a week with a week off each month is a good option. Acetylcarnitne 
can be taken with small doses of other supplements such as vitamins E and 
C, and it can be used together with fish oils. Many products on the market 
have acetylcarnitine together with alpha lipoic acid and are promoted for 
antiaging purposes. Be careful using high amounts of these combinations 
since they can keep you awake at night, and shallow sleep is certainly not 
helpful for longevity purposes. I would not recommend taking more than 10 
to 30 mg of R lipoic acid or 20 to 60 mg of regular alpha lipoic acid when 
combined with 300 mg of acetylcarnitine. Acetyl-L-Cysteine is a potent antioxidant. So potent that it is used in 
hospitals by the intravenous route to protect the liver from Tylenol 
(acetaminophen) overdose. Acetylcysteine can be used a few times a week. 
If you take daily acetaminophen for arthritis pain or other reasons, 
discuss with your doctor whether acetylcysteine could be helpful to you. 
Acetylcysteine can be taken together with other antioxidants such as 
vitamins C and E, and alpha lipoic acid, however you would need to lower 
your dose of the other antioxidants. For long term use, 3 times a week is 
appropriate. Agaricus is a mushroom extract that may have antitumor activity, however 
recent reports suggest it may have side effects if taken daily, hence use 
it no more than 3 times a week and take a week off each month. There are 
several mushroom extracts sold for immune enhancement or anti-cancer 
potential. These include AHCC, cordyceps, maitake, and others. It is 
impossible to predict how these various mushroom extracts will influence 
your immune system if you take them together. AHCC is a mushroom extract used in cancer treatment. If you have certain 
types of cancer, discuss with your doctor if AHCC is appropriate for you. 
Your dosage and length of time of use could vary depending on the type of 
condition your doctor is treating you for. No one has yet emailed us 
regarding side effects they have experienced with AHCC. Aloe-Vera taken orally may be helpful in gastric mucosal healing or 
perhaps in inflammatory bowel conditions and the dosage and frequency of 
use depends on the condition being treated. I have not come across much 
research regarding the health benefit of aloe vera when ingested orally as 
a supplement. For long term use (unless for the treatment of a medical 
condition), take only a few times a week or month. Aloe vera can probably 
be combined with other supplements. ============================ Email question Q. When is the best time to take 5-HTP and what is the ideal dosage? I 
have mild anxiety and depression and I find 5-HTP helps me a great deal at 
50 mg a few hours before bedtime, but I don't know whether taking it at 
another time of day or a higher dosage would offer more benefit. A. It is very difficult to predict in any individual person the dose of 
5-HTP that will be most effective, the timing of the 5-HTP and the interaction 
of 5-HTP with other supplements or medicines. The best way to find out is 
through methodical trial and error trying various dosages at different 
times. Also to keep in mind is that the dosage and timing need may change 
after several days as the effects of the 5-HTP accumulate or the depression improves. 
The use of 5-HTP for depression or anxiety is tricky. Some people may find 5-HTP helps them more when taken in the 
evening whereas others prefer to take a 5-HTP supplement in the morning or 
midday. If you have daytime anxiety associated with low mood, 5-HTP could 
be helpful for you taken during the day. If you are not sure how to begin using 5-HTP, open a capsule by 
pulling on both sides and mix half the contents with water and take it on 
an empty stomach a few hours before bed. The next day try the other half 
again in the evening. Base your future dosage on this initial trial. If 
you have not noticed much, increase your dosage to the full capsule of 50 
mg. Some people may require another full capsule during the day. For long 
term use I prefer not taking more than 100 mg a day. It's also a good idea 
to take a day or two off a week, and a full week off every couple of 
months. Some people have found lower amounts of 5-HTP helpful when taken 
under the tongue. ======================================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 5 -- March 30, 2007 ========================================================== A natural cure for toenail fungus infection? I can't believe that I have 
come across an effective, inexpensive, and safe treatment for a condition 
for which modern medicine has no good solutions. 
There are millions of people in the US who suffer from  
toe nail fungus infection, and many more who have athlete's foot. Most have tried all kinds of over 
the counter and prescription anti-fungal creams to no avail. Some people have even 
taken dangerous, liver-damaging oral anti-fungal prescription drugs for several months 
with little benefit. If you suffer from a fungal toe nail infection, you are 
in luck, as I will explain below. Earlier this month I attended the largest Natural Products 
expo in the country held each March in Anaheim, CA. This expo draws tens 
of thousands of people in the natural product industry and there were more 
than 3000 booths in the showroom. I walked around to see what new items or 
ingredients were hot this year. It seemed there wasn't too much difference 
from the year before. The major promoted products included acai berry, 
cacao, mangosteen, goji berry, pomegranate,  fish oils, and hoodia. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - Until mid April, the following 
products are highly discounted: Eyesight Rx, Acai, Arginine, 
Krill oil, Lyprinol, and Tongkat ali LJ100. Eyesight Rx is now available 
in a bottle as opposed to foil packs. A good dosage is a quarter, third or half 
a tablet in the morning, melted under the tongue for a minute or two before 
swallowing the rest. Eyesight Rx can be used for long term vision support, it 
can also be used for a quick improvement in vision within a few hours or a few 
days. Many, but no all, people notice colors becoming brighter and the act of 
seeing can be more pleasurable. Objects become sharper and in better focus. 
Paintings, artwork, or nature becomes more enjoyable to look at. For long term 
use, take a couple of days off a week. You can use it 2 days on, one day off. 
Taking one to three fish oil capsules a day may also help with vision. Acai is a fruit extract from South 
America and getting a lot of media attention for its antioxidant content; 
Arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide, a vasodilator; Krill oil is 
similar to fish oil but has additional vitamin A and astaxanthin; Lyprinol 
is an extract from New Zealand green-lipped mussel; and lastly, LJ100 is a 
potent tongkat ali extract used in Malaysia as an aphrodisiac. LJ100 
is also found in Passion Rx, a bestselling libido formula. =================================== 1. A Cure for Toenail Fungus - a Major Advance in Natural Medicine The medical term for  nail fungus infection is onychomycosis. At least 
5 percent, perhaps up to 10 percent of adults have this frustrating, 
lingering condition that defies all treatment attempts. I was fortunate 
enough to come across a natural cure for this condition. What amazes me is 
that after decades of research by the modern medical establishment, and after 
billions and billions of dollars spent on studies with anti-fungal 
medications, 
the answer has eluded medical researchers. But, an effective and safe 
treatment for nail fungus infection appears to be quite straightforward. The solution 
for toenail fungus infection is simply soaking the toes in a solution of magnesium sulfate, also known as Epsom salts. Epsom salts 
are readily available in most large grocery stores and cost just a few dollars for 
a 3 pound bag. Soaking alone may not be enough, you have to follow other 
recommendations. I have listed exact steps to take to cure this condition at the web 
page below. Do not expect a cure within days. It will take at least 2 to 3 
months, and perhaps 4 to 6 months if the fungus has spread to many nails 
and the nail is very thickened or distorted. The soaks are to be done at least once a day, preferably 
twice a day. There are several other steps that need to be taken to hasten 
the treatment and make it more effective and therefore you must read this 
page below. The basic idea regarding treatment of toenail fungus is to keep the toes cool and dry. Fungi 
love heat and moisture. See www.raysahelian.com/nailfungus.html for specific step by step 
suggestions. Good luck, and I would be interested to find out your 
response after a few months. If you have friends or relatives with this 
condition, let them know of this potential cure, they may be forever grateful to 
you. ============================ 2. Driving Under the Influence of Sleeping Pills The Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers that practically all prescription sleeping pills 
could at times cause sleep-driving such as getting up in the middle of the night and going for a 
drive â with no subsequent memory of doing so. Other complex sleep-related 
behaviors have included making phone calls, fixing and eating food, and having 
sex while still asleep. Ambien isnât the only insomnia drug that can cause sleep-driving. 
Others 
include Butisol sodium; Carbrital; Dalmane; Doral; Halcion; 
Lunesta; Placidyl; Prosom; Restoril; Rozerem; Seconal; and Sonata. Comments: Many people can avoid the use of prescription sleeping 
pills if they follow the 12 suggestions I have listed on my web page on 
sleep, http://www.raysahelian.com/sleep.html . You may also consider the 
occasional use of a natural sleep aid called Good Night Rx. This natural 
product is not as potent as the pharmaceutical drugs, but it is quite good and 
has hardly any side effects when used reasonably, such as no more than 3 nights 
a week. ============================ 3.
Probiotic supplements and the immune system Probiotics, those friendly bacteria found in yogurt and certain other 
fermented foods, are hardly, if ever, used therapeutically in a hospital 
setting. Perhaps they should be.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a major cause of death 
in intensive care units. A breakdown in gut barrier function and immune 
dysfunction are associated with the onset of MODS. In a Canadian study, critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit were randomly 
assigned to receive either placebo or probiotics. The patients responded 
to probiotics with a significantly larger 
increase in systemic immunoglobulin IgA and IgG concentrations than in the patients who 
received placebo. Over the study period, intestinal permeability decreased 
in most patients. Patients receiving probiotics showed a greater 
enhancement in immune activity than did patients receiving placebo. ============================ Email questions Q. I have been going through your website and its wonderful. I am 65 years 
old. Is there an age limit on taking the herbals, hormone supplements or 
amino acids? A. There is no age limit, but in general dosages should be reduced with 
age since many herbs can stimulate heart beat and those with weak hearts 
cannot tolerate high doses of certain herbs. In general, supplements such 
as fish oils, garlic, most vitamins and minerals are fine, but hormones 
can be dangerous unless used in tiny doses of one, two or less than 5 mg. 
Herbs such as ginseng and many sexual herbs can 
stimulate the heart to beat fast which is not a good idea. The individual 
amino acids such as tyrosine and phenylalanine also can cause heart rhythm 
problems in high doses, and so can SAM-e, a nutrient used for depression. As a rule, as people get older, they should take a 
portion of the suggested dosage listed on the label -- at least initially 
to find out if there is any untoward effect. Many older people are often 
prescribed pharmaceutical drugs, and we don't fully understand the 
interactions between natural supplements and drugs. Certain supplements 
have potent effects, almost as much as some drugs. We've had a few emails about people being 
concerned with consumption of soy. Here are a couple: Q. I appreciate very much your research into various nutrients and making 
it available to the public; however, concerning your recommendation to 
take soy. I have seen some websites that say soy is not a healthy food to 
consume. Q. In your newsletter you mention using soy 
protein for building muscle. Recently, however, I read some information 
about soybeans that caused me to eliminate all soy products from my diet 
with the exception of soybean oil. Apparently, soybeans are loaded with phytoestrogens which have moderately strong estrogenic activity in the 
body. While this might be good for a menopausal woman, I don't think it 
should be introduced into an aging male's body. One article claimed that 
soybeans were consumed in quantity by Chinese monks as a way of 
eliminating their libidos! There was also some recent study that showed 
that consumption of the soybeans (but not the oil) actually reduced the 
male participants' testosterone levels by 15%! Needless to say, that is 
the last thing I want happening in my aging body. I have since gone over 
my diet and also eliminated garbanzo beans (also known as "chick peas") 
because they too have some of the same estrogen-like isoflavones as found 
in soybeans. A.  Based on all the information 
I have 
read on soy from multiple research studies and from a number of different 
sources, the moderate use of soy products as part of an overall healthy 
diet that has a wide variety of foods appears to offer no harm, and 
perhaps offer benefits. If soy were so dangerous as some websites make it 
seem, then why do the Japanese have one of the highest longevity rates in the 
world even though they consume soy products more than many other 
countries? Soy, or soy protein, when used in moderation as part of an 
overall healthy diet which includes a wide variety of foods, is a positive 
addition to one's diet. Perhaps a very high consumption of soy may have 
some negative consequences, but this could be true of most foods. A 
balanced diet with some soy should present no problems. Organic soy 
products are preferable. ======================================================== SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 4 -- March 8, 2007 ========================================================== Those of you who have been reading my newsletters for some time know quite well 
not to trust the headlines of articles on health topics. Recent headlines that I 
came across involved the interpretation of a study evaluating the role of 
antioxidant supplements in life extension. You may have seen some of these 
headlines, "Vitamins 'could shorten lifespan," "Antioxidants may slightly raise 
risk of death," and, "Antioxidant vitamins A, C, E, don't lead to longer life." 
I will dissect the study and the headlines and tell you why this study is 
worthless and why the researchers should take a sabbatical and go back to school 
to learn the basics of nutrition and nutritional supplements. In the first newsletter issue of 2007 I mentioned that I was testing a natural 
treatment for athlete's foot and toe nail fungal infection. Modern medicine does 
not have safe and effective treatment options for nail fungus infection. I am 
about to complete my evaluation (the results thus far look quite promising) and 
in the next issue of the newsletter I will explain in detail how you can take 
advantage of a completely safe and inexpensive treatment. PRODUCT DISCOUNTS at Physician Formulas - Until March 26, the following items 
will be highly discounted: Veg Rx, R Alpha Lipoic Acid, CoQ10 30 mg, Beta 
Sitosterol, Choline, and Horny Goat Weed. Veg Rx is a daily supplement for those 
who are vegetarian and may be missing certain key nutrients for optimal health, 
energy, and mood. R Alpha Lipoic Acid is a potent antioxidant and many patients 
with diabetes use it; CoQ10 at 30 mg is a good dose for those who wish to take 
this popular nutrient on a regular basis without overdosing; Beta sitosterol is 
a phytosterol used by those for prostate health and those with cholesterol 
issues. Choline is a nutrient precursor to acetylcholine which functions as a 
neurotransmitter. Choline is also a methyl donor with 4 methyl groups. Horny 
goat weed is a popular herb from China touted as a sexual and energy enhancer. ====================================================== 1. Soy protein as good as whey protein for muscle building Weight lifters and other athletes often use whey protein supplements and have 
been less interested in using soy protein thinking that since soy is a 
vegetable, muscle building would not be as effective as whey protein derived 
from milk. However, a study in rats indicates that soy and whey protein equally 
help restore muscle mass after exercise on a treadmill for two hours. After 
exercise, ingesting protein helps accelerate protein synthesis in muscle tissue. My comments: In addition to a protein supplement, taking about 2 to 4 grams of 
creatine also helps with increasing muscle mass. For more information, see http://www.raysahelian.com/soyprotein.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/creatine.html . ==================================================== 2. Eczema development in child and mother's diet A woman's dietary choices during pregnancy could well influence the odds that 
her child will develop an allergy. Dr. Joachim Heinrich, of GSF-Institute of 
Epidemiology, Neuherberg, Germany evaluated the associations between a mother's 
diet during the last few weeks of pregnancy and allergy and eczema in the infant 
at age 2 years. Data from 2,641 children were analyzed. Overall, 17 percent of 
all children had eczema at age 2. Positive associations were observed between 
high maternal intakes of margarine and vegetable oils during the last few weeks 
of pregnancy and eczema during the first 2 years in the offspring. On the other 
hand, eating a lot of fish late in pregnancy seemed 
to offer some protection against eczema in the children. For more info on 
allergy and eczema, see http://www.raysahelian.com/allergy.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/eczema.html ====================================================== 3. Danger: Relying on nutritional information through headlines may be hazardous 
to your health A new study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association claims 
that taking antioxidant supplements such as beta carotene and vitamin E can 
shorten lifespan. This study is worthless and I will explain why. Researchers first included 68 studies involving 232,606 people and found no 
significant effect on mortality -- neither good nor bad -- linked to taking 
certain antioxidants. When they eliminated the "lower-quality" studies and 
looked only at the most trustworthy ones, they actually found a higher risk of 
death for people taking vitamins: 4 percent for those taking vitamin E, 7 
percent for beta carotene and 16 percent for vitamin A. My comments: Who determined which studies were "lower quality?" It is possible 
that another group of researchers may have had a different opinion on what 
constitutes lower or higher quality. I can already sense a bias. Donald Berry, 
chairman of the department of biostatistics at the University of Texas M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center, said of this study "There are so many choices you can 
make when you're doing these analyses." > Final findings were based on an analysis of 47 studies involving 180,938 people 
who were randomly assigned to get real vitamins or dummy pills. Some involved 
very high doses far exceeding the recommended daily amount of the vitamins; 
others involved normal or low doses. My comments: The pooled studies were too diverse to make any sense. The trials 
ranged from a three-month study of 109 elderly nursing home residents to a 
12-year study of 22,071 male doctors. And the vitamin dosages varied 
significantly from study to study. What if I analyzed various studies on the 
benefit or harm of drinking wine and pooled studies that included the health 
effect of one glass of wine a day and other studies where people drank a bottle 
of wine a day. It's possible that those who drink one glass of wine may live 
longer while those who drink a bottle of wine a day may die sooner due to liver 
damage. But when the results of the one drink and the full bottle studies are 
pooled, the statistical analyses could indicate that drinking wine shortens 
lifespan. Meir Stampfer, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard 
School of Public Health, agrees with my viewpoint. Dr. Stamfer said the studies 
were too diverse to pool together because they looked at various combinations 
and doses of antioxidants tested in different groups of people. "This study does 
not advance our understanding, and could easily lead to misinterpretation of the 
data," said Stampfer. The study's senior author, Dr. Christian Gluud of Copenhagen University 
Hospital, said, "The main message is that prevention by beta carotene, vitamin A 
and vitamin E cannot be recommended. These three antioxidant supplements may 
increase mortality." My comments: Dr. Christian Gluud should take a sabbatical from interpreting 
research results from nutritional supplement studies and go back to school to 
take a course in nutrition 101. I can, without hesitation, say that this doctor 
is ignorant. Firstly, Dr. Gluud, does not seem to recognize that different 
dosages of supplements can have different effects. There is also no mention that 
most people who took vitamin E in the past, and also currently, take a synthetic 
version of one form of vitamin E, dl-alpha tocopherol, whereas there are several 
forms of natural vitamin E. It is possible that high doses of synthetic vitamin 
E may not be helpful, whereas low doses of a natural vitamin E complex including 
alpha, delta, and gamma tocopherol could be beneficial. This is also true of 
beta carotene. There are many forms of carotenoids, and taking a high dose of a 
single carotenoid, such as beta carotene by itself, is not the answer. Bottom line: There is no proof at this time that taking vitamins will help you 
live longer, nor is there good evidence that they will shorten lifespan. In 
order for us to know how vitamins influence longevity, several well controlled 
studies have to be done on individual vitamins in varying dosages for at least a 
20 to 30 year period while keeping dietary intake similar in all the study 
participants. This is not practical and not likely to be done soon. For the time 
being if you do plan to take antioxidant supplements, take products that have a 
wide range of nutrients in low amounts as opposed to just 2 or 3 in high 
dosages. I am not convinced that taking megadoses of a single form of synthetic 
vitamin E or single carotenoid is a good option. One good daily formula with 
lots of different nutrients and antioxidants in small amounts is MultiVit Rx 
which can be taken at one, two, three, or four capsules a day depending on your 
preference.
See http://www.raysahelian.com/antioxidant.html for more info on antioxidants. ======================================================== Questions from Newsletter Subscribers Q. Is 50 years of age too early to start taking vinpocetine and ginkgo biloba 
together as an anti-aging supplement? A. There is no human research that proves taking supplements will lead to longer 
lifespan. My personal belief is that we will eventually find certain natural 
pills will have antiaging benefit, but we are not there yet in terms of 
certainty. It is possible that high doses of certain supplements could actually 
be harmful. Therefore, for the time being, supplements should be mostly taken 
for the benefit they provide in terms of mood, energy, wellbeing, mental 
enhancement, sexual enhancement or the treatment of certain medical conditions 
as opposed to primarily focusing on the hope that they may have anti-aging 
potential. One caution: If your sleep is disturbed because the supplements you 
are taking are too stimulating, then I can't see how this would help with 
longevity. The suggestion would be to take fewer supplements or to lower the 
dosages. ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 3 -- Feb 19, 2007 ========================================================== Does the type of food you eat influence how alert or sleepy you are? If you are 
in your energetic teens and 20s, it may not affect you as much, but as we get 
older we are more apt to notice the effects. In youth, our brain chemicals are 
on full speed and whether we have pasta or protein for lunch may not influence 
how energetic we are the rest of the afternoon. But, as we get older, we are 
likely to notice the food-mood or food-sleepiness influence. Have you ever had a 
large lunch consisting of mostly pasta, such as spaghetti, and then had an 
irresistible urge to take a nap? I have long suspected, based on my personal 
observations, that the type of food we eat before bed influences sleep onset. 
Now, a new study confirms previous research that carbohydrates eaten before bed 
induce sleep. More details below. In this issue I want to mention and discuss side effects that can occur from the 
misuse of certain supplements. Although most supplements are safe, some are much 
more potent than people realize and can cause problems when high dosages are 
taken or when they are taken daily for prolonged periods. Over the past few 
weeks we have had several emails with such accounts, and I want to share a 
couple of them with you so that you have a more in depth understanding on how to 
use supplements effectively while minimizing adverse events. ========================================================== 1. Carbohydrate meal induces sleep To investigate the role of carbohydrate in sleep induction, researchers at The 
University of Sydney in Australia compared the effect of high- and low-glycemic 
index carbohydrateâbased meals ingested several hours before bedtime on sleep 
quality. Twelve healthy men ate standard, isocaloric (8% of energy as protein, 
2% of energy as fat, and 90% of energy as carbohydrate) meals of either low GI 
or high GI rice 4 hours before their usual bedtime. On another occasion, the men 
ate the high-GI meal 1 hour before bedtime. The carbohydrate-based high-GI meal 
resulted in a significant shortening of sleep onset compared with a low-GI meal 
and was most effective when consumed 4 hours before bedtime. GI is short for 
glycemic index and you can learn more about it here, http://www.raysahelian.com/glycemicindex.html My comments: Those who have difficulty falling sleeping at night may consider 
eating a higher proportion of carbohydrate while having very little fat and 
protein. Some options include pasta, potatoes, bread, cereal, and fruit salad. 
In order to stay alert during the day, a good option is to eat small frequent 
meals with a higher proportion of protein and fat. If you eat a large meal 
during the day that consists mostly of carbohydrate, you are likely to have 
difficulty concentrating or functioning at your best at work or at home. This 
may also be true of students. If you have a test in the afternoon, avoid a large 
lunch rich in pasta, potatoes and bread but rather have a smaller meal with a 
higher proportion of protein such as meat and fish. For more information, see http://www.raysahelian.com/sleep.html and http://www.raysahelian.com/carbohydrate.html . ========================================================== 2. SSRI drugs such as Prozac may lead to more bone fractures in older adults The daily use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant 
drugs such as Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and others increases the risk of fractures 
in adults 50 years of age or older. Doctors who prescribe these drugs to older 
patients should let them know of the risk and consider whether the benefits 
outweigh the risks in cases of mild depression. The most common site of fracture 
is the forearm, followed by ankle and foot. Comments: Many people have benefited from the use of SSRI drugs. However these 
medications do have several side effects and doctors have to balance the benefit 
versus the risks. Natural antidepressants are a good option for those with mild 
or moderate depression. They also have side effects but they are less serious. 
Older people taking natural antidepressants should use a third or half of the 
usual prescribed dose. For more information, see http://www.raysahelian.com/ssri.html, 
http://www.raysahelian.com/depression.html, ========================================================== Supplement side effects emails Q. I have been taking 5 HTP for 2 weeks at 50 mg daily, i am on no other meds. 
After 2 weeks my depression, bad thoughts and general anxiety lifted well, i 
took my 5-HTP dose at mid day, was eating better, sleeping better, energy in the 
daytime, i thought i was on my way to recovery then after 16 pills i began to 
have muscle tremors and faster heart beats in the night and 1 or 2 twitches in 
the day, Would u say i should have a break for 2 days and reduce the dose or is 
this just a normal response to serotonin being introduced and i should continue 
on 50mg or more? My doc has no information about 5 HTP. A. We can't give any personal advice, but as a general rule we suggest people 
take breaks from most supplements since their effects can accumulate over time. 
Taking breaks minimizes side effects. A very important concept to keep in mind 
with certain nutrients and herbs is that they can accumulate in the body or 
their effects may be additive. For instance, if you take a certain supplement at 
50 mg, some of it (or its effect on the body and brain) may still be around the 
next day. So, if you take another 50 mg the next day, you are now getting dosed 
a higher amount the second day, and even more on the third day. Sooner or later 
side effects are likely to occur. Just as with medications, supplement dosages 
need to be constantly adjusted. It is possible to take advantage of the benefits 
5-HTP and SAM-e (see below) while minimizing side effects if you do it 
carefully. Q. I took 200 mg of SAM-e for depression every day and within 4 days it lifted 
my mood. But on the fifth day I started feeling jittery, anxious and couldn't 
sleep well. It seemed to negate the benefits I had the first few days. A. This is typical of SAM-e and many supplements. It is quite likely that the 
initial 200 mg was fine for the first few days, but then the required dosage to 
lift your mood dropped. But, by exposing yourself to the same initial dosage of 
200 mg, it was too much for you. Many people find 100 mg every other day to be 
good maintenance amount. But there is a wide range of response and each person 
through trail and error has to find their ideal dosage and how to adjust it on a 
daily basis. Many drug and supplement side effects occur since doctors and consumers do not 
realize the importance of constant dosage adjustment. Most doctors will put a 
patient on a standard mg of a drug and do not consider reevaluating the 
appropriateness of this initial dosage in subsequent weeks, months or even 
years. Many doctors fail to grasp the importance of the uniqueness of each 
individual and treat in a robotic manner using the same dosage of a drug for all 
patients. Furthermore, the dosage required of a natural supplement or a drug can 
vary over time depending on how the condition changes and many other variables 
including diet, sleep patterns, physical activity level, season, temperature, 
etc. ========================================================== Questions from Newsletter Subscribers Q. I'm wondering about all of the research about soy being bad. Personally I 
love soy milk, but I'm constantly told by coworkers that it's not good to drink. 
I'm wondering if you've read any of the research against soy and what you feel 
is best. A. Soy products are a healthy addition to one's diet when done so in reasonable 
amounts and as part of a healthy program with a variety of other legumes, 
cereals, fruits, nuts, vegetables, fish, etc. However, excess soy milk may not 
be the best option if it ends up providing lots of calories and takes the place 
of other healthy food options. Furthermore, much of the soy milk sold is 
sweetened with sugar which is harmful. I think a few ounces of soy milk is 
healthy to drink, and you could purchase the unsweetened variety and add a few 
drops of stevia clear liquid to sweeten it without extra calories. See http://www.raysahelian.com/stevia.html Q. I'm a believer in natural remedies over prescription drugs, however, I have a 
difficult time explaining why to my husband. How can I convince him that natural 
supplements are better than pharmaceuticals? A. It would be simplistic to make a blanket statement that natural supplements 
are better than drugs or vice versa. I find natural supplements and dietary 
intervention to offer great promise in the prevention or treatment of many 
medical conditions including mood disorders, high blood sugar, high blood 
pressure, and certain cardiovascular conditions. Natural therapies can make a 
significant difference in terms of vitality, energy, mind enhancement, vision 
enhancement, and sexual enhancement. Pharmaceutical drugs offer great advantages 
in many areas of medicine, two areas that immediately come to mind involve the 
treatment of infections and pain control, If I had a serious infection, such as 
pneumonia or meningitis, I would not hesitate for an instant in using 
antibiotics. For chronic conditions, some people may benefit from a natural 
approach, others may benefit from a drug while still others may find a 
combination of a natural approach and a drug is the best option for their 
disease. ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 2 -- Feb 1, 2007 ========================================================== Back in the early 1980s when I was a student at Thomas Jefferson medical school 
in Philadelphia, I remember one lecture we had on infertility. The professor 
reviewed some of the causes of female infertility. He mentioned fallopian tube 
blockage, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, and ovulation disorders. There was no 
mention of diet having any influence on infertility. In fact, during all my 
years in medical school, there was hardly any mention of diet having to do with 
medical diseases. We now know that our food choices have a significant influence 
on the incidence of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes... and now perhaps 
even infertility. More details later. I have quite a number of friends who are vegetarian. Many vegetarians may not be 
getting enough of certain nutrients that are absent or found in very small 
amounts in a non-meat diet. These include CoQ10, carnitine, creatine, vitamin 
B12, and others. If you are vegetarian, consider supplementing with my newest 
formulation Veg Rx. See the link to the left. Recently we have had many emails from users of Passion Rx and sexual herbs. Most 
users -- but not all -- have noticed significant sexual enhancement. Below Il 
discuss in some detail on how to best take advantage of these sexual herbs and 
products. Many people expect these herbs to work quickly within an hour, like 
Viagra. But that's not the way most of them work. Learn the secrets on how to 
best take advantage of nature's aphrodisiacs. ========================================================== 1. Zap your sponge germs I thought this was quite interesting when I came across it this week. 
Apparently, if you place your kitchen sponge for a couple of minutes in a 
microwave oven, you can kill almost all the germs that have found a comfortable 
moist home. Researchers at the University of Florida found that microwaving a 
kitchen sponge killed or inactivated more than 99 percent of bacteria, viruses 
or parasites, as well as spores.
The day after the news release came out regarding the germ-killing benefit of 
microwaving, reports came to news stations that people who tried it at home had 
problems with the sponge burning and ruining their microwave. Apparently the 
researchers failed to mention that the sponge has to be wet before it is placed 
in the microwave. Comments: I actually placed a semi wet sponge in the microwave for 2 minutes and 
it survived.... but the germs probably were not as lucky. ========================================================== 2. Trans fats and fertility Dr. Jorge E. Chavarro of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston says the 
more trans fats a woman eats, the more likely she is to have fertility problems. 
To maximize fertility, women should avoid foods that list hydrogenated or 
partially hydrogenated oils. For details of the study, see http://www.raysahelian.com/transfats.html Comments: I have little doubt that over time scientists will discover many more 
medical conditions that are influenced by diet. Diet is only one potential cause 
of infertility. ========================================================== 3. Secrets of Herbal Aphrodisiac Use It boggles my mind that most people in the Western world -- along with the 
media, most doctors and medical researchers -- are not aware of the potent 
effect of herbs in terms of sexual enhancement. There are quite a number of 
aphrodisiac herbs that are effective in enhancing sexuality in men and women, 
but you have to learn how to use them effectively. Herbs work slower than drugs 
and that may be one reason why some people think they don't work. As Americans 
we like a pill that gives an immediate effect and if we don't notice an effect 
within an hour or two we think it is a dud. Most aphrodisiac herbs take a few 
days for optimal effects, but there are some herbs or combinations that work 
quicker. Although Viagra and its cousins Cialis and Levitra work very well for erectile 
function, they have little effect on libido and no benefit regarding genital 
sensation. These drugs don't work that well in women. Herbs generally are not as 
quick in terms of inducing an erection, but with time they can be as effective 
as the drugs. Most people prefer the overall sexual enhancement that comes from 
the herbs in terms of the whole package -- sensation, libido, intensity of 
orgasms, climaxes, lubrication, and erection. Herbs also have the advantage of 
causing fewer side effects. How to Take Passion Rx with Yohimbe, or Individual Sex Herbs, Safely and 
Efficiently Take the herbs in the morning at least a half hour before breakfast so they are 
absorbed well without food in the stomach. Some of the common sexual herbs are 
horny goat weed, tongkat ali and LJ100, mucuna pruriens, tribulus terrestris, 
catuaba, muira puama, maca, ashwagandha, and others. It is impossible to predict 
which one of the herbs or which combination will be effective for you unless you 
try it. If you buy more than one supplement, learn how each one works by itself 
before combining. It is preferable to take these herbs every other day or 2 days on, 2 or more 
days off. You will likely notice the benefits even on the days you are not 
taking them since there is often a delayed response. Very important: These 
herbal products work better when you don't take them every day. Herbs have side effects, too, although less serious than the drugs. Common side 
effects from high doses of sex herbs include overstimulation, restlessness, 
insomnia, increased body temperature, headache, and rapid heart beat. If you get 
insomnia, skip a dose the next day. If you get insomnia it means the dose of the 
herb or the herbal product you took was too high, and next time you take it, try 
half or a third of the initial dose. If you feel increased body temperature, 
drink a glass or two of cold water. Be patient. Most herbs take anywhere from 2 to several days to start working, 
except for a high dose of yohimbe which can work within an hour or two. Keep in 
mind that if you try to induce sexual enhancement quickly, you are likely to get 
more side effects. If you wish to minimize adverse effects, take smaller amounts 
and be patient. The impotence Drugs Viagra, Cialis and Levitra can work within 
an hour or two but they can potentially induce serious side effects, including 
vision loss and chest pain. If you are taking a product for the very first time, Start with a small amount, 
even if it means opening the capsule and taking a portion. The current version of Passion Rx with yohimbe can be taken as a full capsule, 
but if you are sensitive to herbs take half or 3/4 of a capsule. Some people 
notice the effects within a few hours, but most people find that a good approach 
is to skip the second day and then take it again the third morning. The effects 
are often clearly noticed on the third day. Take the fourth day off and take it 
again the fifth day. Eventually you will find a noticeable enhancement of 
genital sensation, erection, lubrication, and overall sexual interest. Some 
people get sexual urges and overall enjoyment similar to what they experienced 
in their teenage years. The dosage of the current version of regular Passion Rx 
(without yohimbe) is a third of a capsule. It is best not to take other supplements, especially those of a stimulant 
nature, on the days that you are taking sexual herbs since restlessness, 
insomnia and overstimulation can occur. Avoid using ginseng, St. John's wort, or 
other similar herbs, Eyesight Rx, hormones, SAM-e, and certain amino acids such 
as tyrosine. I also suggest you avoid drinking more than a cup of regular coffee 
and more than an ounce or two of wine. Use caution if you are taking prescription medicines since sometimes the 
interactions between herbs and medicines is not predicable. It is best not to 
use antidepressant drugs the same day as these herbs. SSRI drugs such as Prozac, 
Paxil, and Zoloft inhibit sexuality. 5-HTP, tryptophan and kava also inhibit 
sexual drive or decrease genital sensation. Be extremely cautious using sex herbs if you have thyroid or other endocrine 
issues, a heart condition, a tendency for high blood pressure or heart rhythm 
abnormalities. Many of these herbs can stimulate heart contraction and if you 
are prone to heart problems you may have untoward reactions. Although initially you may find that a high dose is required for you to notice 
something, with time a lesser dose becomes just as effective. Your dosage 
requirement may change with time. Prostate Power Rx works very well in many people as a sexual enhancer and can be 
alternated with Passion Rx or other sexual herbs. If you find one particular product or herb is no longer effective, take a week 
off and then try another one.. ========================================================== 4. Drink Cloudy Apple Juice In a head-to-head comparison of apple juices, Polish researchers found that 
pulpy, non-clarified juice carried more antioxidants - four times the level of 
polyphenols - than clear apple juice. Unlike cloudy apple juice, the more common 
clear variety undergoes additional processing to remove any apple solids. 
Manufacturers typically think the public will favor the more attractive, clear 
juice over its cloudy cousin, and retailers prefer the clear variety for its 
longer shelf life. For optimal health, drink a variety of 100 fruit juices as 
opposed to just one or two. Most people drink apple juice or orange juice almost 
exclusively whereas there are many additional fruit juice options available. For 
more info on polyphenols, see http://www.raysahelian.com/polyphenols.html ========================================================== 5. No Milk or Cream with Tea Tea improves blood flow and the ability of the arteries to relax but milk 
reduces this benefit. Proteins called caseins in milk decrease the amount of 
compounds in tea known as catechins. A comparison was done with the health 
effects of drinking boiled water and tea with and without milk on 16 healthy 
women. The function of an artery in the forearm before and two hours after 
drinking tea was measured. Black tea significantly improved blood flow compared 
to drinking water but adding milk blunted the effect of the tea. Tests on rats 
produced similar results. When rodents were exposed to black tea they produced 
more nitric oxide which promotes dilation of blood vessels. But adding milk 
blocked the effect. http://www.raysahelian.com/tea.html ========================================================= SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH UPDATE - by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Vol. 4, Issue 1 -- January 8, 2007 ========================================================== I wish you all a wonderful 2007 and hope you are able to achieve at least some 
of the New Year's resolutions you have set for yourself. I have made some 
personal resolutions myself, and one simple one is to take more time to 
appreciate the food at the table rather than rush through meals. I have started 
to eat slower, chew slower, be more conscious and aware of taste and texture, 
and take pauses while being thankful that food is so abundantly available. There are a number of interesting nutritional topics to cover in 2007 and I will 
try to include a variety in the upcoming newsletters. I have come across an 
excellent natural treatment or even a potential cure for athlete's foot and nail 
fungus growth but will test this a few more weeks before I announce it in a 
future issue of the newsletter. 1. CoQ10 Helpful in Heart Failure CoQ10 supplements appear to be helpful in strengthening the heart. Dr. Romualdo 
Belardinelli, of Lancisi Heart Institute in Italy studied 23 patients, average 
age 59 years, with moderate to severe heart failure. They were assigned to four 
weeks each of CoQ10 supplements or placebo pills, with or without supervised 
exercise training. The dosage of CoQ10 was 100 mg three times a day. Those 
taking CoQ10 had improvement in peak exercise capacity. There was an improvement 
in cardiac function with CoQ10 treatment. Combining exercise training with CoQ10 
produced more marked improvements than CoQ10 alone. The researchers conclude 
that the use of CoQ10 improves several aspects of heart failure without any side 
effects. For details, see http://www.raysahelian.com/coq10.html My comments: Those who have heart failure should discuss with 
their doctor the use of CoQ10 supplements. I tend to be more cautious on dosages 
and would prefer keeping the amount of CoQ10, at least initially, to 30 mg or 50 
mg once or twice a day. CoQ10 can be taken with breakfast and or lunch. The 
study went on only for one month, and even though the researchers did not 
observe side effects on 100 mg three times a day, it is possible that prolonged 
use of 300 mg a day over several weeks or months could lead to adverse events. 
We also don't have a good understanding how CoQ10 supplements interact with 
heart medicines. 2. Breast Cancer Rates Drop Did you hear the news that fewer women are being diagnosed with breast cancer? 
Estrogen and progesterone hormone use plummeted after a 2002 study found that 
hormone replacement therapy after menopause raised the risk of breast cancer, 
heart disease and other problems. Before that, the regimen was believed to 
prevent many of these conditions, and doctors prescribed them as little 
fountains of youth. The decline in new breast cancer cases in 2003 is thought to 
have come because millions of postmenopausal women stopped hormone replacement 
therapy in 2002. There appeared to be a 7 percent drop in breast cancer 
incidence between 2002 and 2003 and most researchers believe it is related to 
the discontinuation of the hormones. My comments: Many of you already know that the estrogen most 
commonly prescribed for women as hormone replacement therapy after menopause is 
Premarin derived from the urine of pregnant mares (horses). The progesterone 
prescribed to women by doctors most often is a synthetic progestin, not actual 
progesterone made by the body. Some people claim that the use of natural 
bioidentical hormones would not cause as many problems in women as the use of 
Premarin or progestins. However I have not seen any long term studies comparing 
the two regimens and for the time being I will assume that the risk for breast 
cancer in women with the use of bioidentical hormones is similar until proven 
otherwise. Lately Suzanne Somers, the TV actress, has been heavily - and 
somewhat irresponsibly - promoting her book suggesting women use bioidentical 
hormones to improve their health. I think this is a better option than 
artificial estrogens and progestins, but there is no evidence that they are 
safer and before you take high doses of these hormones keep in mind that it is a 
possibility that future research may show misuse of these bioidentical hormones 
carries serious risks. There are two natural hormones -- DHEA and pregnenolone 
-- available over the counter. Be cautious with their use since they can have 
serious side effects. Hormone supplements are not to be toyed with but be 
treated with respect, even if they are available without a prescription. 3. Ashwagandha for Dyskinesia Many of you remember seeing the actor Michael J. Fox on TV exhibiting repetitive 
involuntary movements. The medical term for this kind of involuntary movement is 
dyskinesia. Involuntary movements can occur in some patients with Parkinson's 
disease due to the long term use of L-DOPA since this drug can damage nerve 
cells in the brain involvement with movement. Another form of dyskinesia occurs 
in those who are given antipsychotic drugs and this type of involuntary movement 
disorder is called tardive dyskinesia. Researchers at Panjab University in Chandigarh, India induced 
tardive dyskinesia in rats by providing high doses of a drug called reserpine. 
Treatment with ashwagandha root extract for a period of 4 weeks to reserpine 
treated animals significantly reduced the senseless chewing movements and tongue 
protrusions. Rats given reserpine had decreased levels of natural antioxidants 
in their bran while treatment with ashwagandha restored levels of antioxidants. 
The researchers say, "The major findings of the present study indicate that 
oxidative stress might play an important role in the pathophysiology of 
reserpine-induced abnormal oral movements. In conclusion, Withania somnifera 
root extract (ashwagandha) could be useful for the treatment of drug-induced 
dyskinesia." For more details, see http://www.raysahelian.com/withaniasomnifera.html My comments: The involuntary movements that occurs in those with 
Parkinson's disease placed on L-Dopa are different from antipsychotic induced 
tardive dyskinesia although both types of dyskinesia may perhaps share a 
commonality of oxidative damage to nerve cells in the brain. It is possible that 
a variety of different antioxidants could help reduce the risk of dyskinesia 
although human research is lacking. If you have antipsychotic drug-induced 
tardive dyskinesia, ask your doctor to read the research provided. If your 
doctor agrees to give ashwagandha a try, use half of a capsule of the 500 mg 
extract to start and gradually increase over time. I have not seen any research 
regarding the role of ashwagandha in dyskinesia due to long term L-DOPA use in 
those with Parkinson's disease. We don't know yet how ashwagandha interacts with 
antipsychotic drugs or drugs used in Parkinson's disease. ========================================= Emails from Newsletter Subscribers Q. I have been taking 500mg a day of tyrosine since June 2006 in combination 
with 500 mg of Para Thyrolate, and vitamin B (as prescribed by a nutritionist.) 
Also, I have high blood pressure and have been taking hydrochlorothiazide (water 
pill) for the past two years. On Friday December 22, 2006 I had a grand mal 
seizure followed by a second one 5 hours later. I have never had a seizure 
before in my life and I am 36 years old. The day of the seizure I had been 
feeling like I was coming down with a cold or flu and barely ate anything all 
day. I have been reading up on the side effects of L-Tyrosine and realized that 
I have been experiencing side-effects for quite some time; heart palpitations 
and what appeared to be mini panic attacks. Has L- Tyrosine ever been documented 
to cause seizures? At the hospital they ran lots of tests and could not seem to 
find anything wrong with me so the seizure remains unexplained. A. Although we have not come across any published studies regarding 
the role of l tyrosine on seizure inducement, we can not rule out the 
possibility, that, in some people, it is possible that high doses of l tyrosine 
could reduce the threshold for a seizure to occur. This is just speculation 
since we have not seen actual research blaming l tyrosine supplement use and 
seizure occurrence. I am not familiar with Para Thyrolate but a search on the 
internet reveals it is a natural supplement that has " parathyroid concentrate " 
and " thyroid concentrate." I have no idea how much thyroid hormones are present 
in this product. High doses of thyroid hormones could also lower seizure 
threshold. I have come across many individuals who have had heart rhythm 
problems from the use of high doses of tyrosine. For more information see http://www.raysahelian.com/tyrosine.html . Q. I am a 
nutritionist practicing in Chicago and wanted your opinion on vitamin E optimal 
intake. I came across an editorial in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
by Maret G Traber who is at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State 
University in Corvallis, OR. Here is the last paragraph of the editorial: "And 
so we are left with the good news that the serum concentration of {alpha} - 
tocopherol is associated with decreased chronic disease risk, but we still do 
not know how much vitamin E to recommend for consumption to achieve that 
concentration. It may be that large vitamin E supplements are not necessary to 
achieve optimal serum {alpha} - tocopherol concentrations, in that the vitamin E 
recommended dietary allowance of 15 mg per day may yield optimal serum 
concentrations to achieve significant reductions in chronic disease mortality. 
However, 15 mg a day may be a vitamin E intake that is achieved only with 
supplements, given the dietary habits of most Americans and the observation that 
vitamin Eârich food sources are less popular foods, such as nuts, seeds, and 
vegetable oils, including olive, sunflower, or safflower oils." A. A person's optimal vitamin E supplement requirement is 
influenced by many factors, particularly diet. I think a daily vitamin E 
supplement (mixed tocopherols) intake of 10 to 100 units a few times a week is 
reasonable, and frankly I don't see the need to take megadoses beyond 100 to 200 
units a day. For more info, see http://www.raysahelian.com/vitamine.html Q. After 7 months of various statin protocols I completely stopped in March 06 
due to extensive pain in the thighs and calfs and started a daily regiment of 
2400mg of Red Yeast Rice. The muscular discomfort has slowly decreased. Last 
month I added 200mg of CoQ10 to my daily regimen. The lingering muscular 
discomfort has gone. I credit CoQ10 for the relief. I wish to continue CoQ10 
along with the Red Yeast Rice and would appreciate your comments, recommended 
dosage and frequency. A. There is no standard nutritional regimen that will apply to 
everyone. As a rule, the best option is to use the lowest amount of supplements 
that work. Personally, I prefer to use less than 60 mg of CoQ10 a day, and there 
have been cases of muscle aches or muscle tissue damage with red yeast rice 
hence it is a good idea to use the lowest amount of red yeast rice that works in 
reducing choles
