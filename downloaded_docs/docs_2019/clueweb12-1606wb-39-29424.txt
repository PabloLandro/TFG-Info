The Arabs were probably the first to process the plant and called it 'desert lily'. Alexander the Great used the gel extract to treat war wounds as it was renowned for its healing abilities. Most ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, Romans, Persians and Indians applied the Aloe Vera extract as 'first aid' for wounds, burns and other skin conditions because of its antiseptic properties. The Aloe Vera extract replenishes and moisturises the skin and restores its natural shine and elasticity. Subtly fragranced rich, concentrated Edwin Jagger shaving cream is specially formulated using a unique combination of organic ingredients, enhanced by plant extracts, to create a luxurious lather for a smooth and comfortable shave. When used with hot water and, ideally but not necessarily, a good quality shaving brush, even a small amount will produce a thick creamy lather. The combination of brush, hot water and natural ingredients will soften and lift the beard in preparation for the razor blade. $25.00 Quantity * Share: Facebook Twitter Edwin Jagger Black Cut Throat Razor Edwin Jagger White Cut Throat Razor Edwin Jagger Cowhide Razor Strop Edwin Jagger Three Piece Ivory Brush Set Edwin Jagger Ivory Double Edge Safety Razor Aesop Moroccan Neroli Shaving Serum Aesop Moroccan Neroli Post-Shave Lotion Edwin Jagger Black Shave Brush Edwin Jagger White Porcelain Shaving Bowl Edwin Jagger Nickel Shave Bowl Edwin Jagger Aloe Vera Cream Pot Edwin Jagger Sea Buckthorn Cream Pot Edwin Jagger Sandalwood Cream Pot Edwin Jagger Aloe Vera Shave Cream Edwin Jagger Sea Buckthorn Shave Cream Edwin Jagger Sandalwood Shave Cream Edwin Jagger Aloe Vera Shave Soap Edwin Jagger Sandalwood Shave Soap Vitamin E Shaving Cream Shave 123 Kit Super Close Shave After Shave Balm Razor Bump Relief Company: about us twitter facebook Assistance: sales & customer service shipping contact us Privacy Find Us: 212 Third Avenue North Suite 106 Minneapolis, MN 55401 (612) 746-5329 directions Store Hours: Mon-Wed 10 am - 7 pm Thurs-Sat 10 am - 8 pm Sun 11 pm - 5 pm © 2012 martinpatrick3.
