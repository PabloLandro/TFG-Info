Unfortunately, cognitive performance declines on average in late  life and the prevalence of dementia nearly doubles every 5 years after the age  of 65 years. Over a million people in Canada will have dementia within a  generation, as more people live to ages when dementia is common. My research  aims to identify ways to optimize cognition across the life course and to  prevent dementia in late life. In particular, I investigate the relationship  between physical exercise, cognition, and brain function using techniques  from several disciplines including neuroscience, exercise physiology and  epidemiology.
