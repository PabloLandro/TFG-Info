Incubation Period: Time interval between exposure to the infection and onset of symptoms. Contagious Period: Time interval during which a sick child's disease is contagious to others.  With precautions, children sometimes can return to child care and school before this period is over. Infections that are not Contagious: Many common bacterial infections are not contagious (e.g., ear infections, sinus infections, bladder infections, kidney infections, and pneumonia).  Sexually transmitted diseases are not contagious to children unless there is sexual contact or shared bathing.
