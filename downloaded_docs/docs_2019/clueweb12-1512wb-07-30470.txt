Sealant Project Home 9th Street Dental Center School Sealant Project Board of Directors Contributors Career Opportunities Contact Us School Sealant Project Annually since 2004, we have been offering dental sealants, a protective coating that prevents tooth decay, to area second graders.  Third graders who participated the previous year also receive sealants if needed. Volunteer dentists examine the children. As well as having sealants applied to their teeth, participating students receive individual
instruction on ways to prevent tooth decay, proper tooth brushing and flossing technique, and they are given a toothbrush and floss to take
hoe.  Each student who returned a consent form received a sticker calendar to track tooth brushing. Approximately 125 children are served through this program each year. The Healthy People 2010 goal is for 50 percent of 3rd graders to have sealants on their molars. As a result of our project, the percentage of second graders in the participating
schools with decay-preventing sealants on their teeth has risen from less than 25% to more than 50%. Phone: 419.289.1430 . Keeps You Smiling! . Fax: 4
