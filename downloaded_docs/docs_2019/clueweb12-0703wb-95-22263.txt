Drugs and Medications for Spinal Cord Injury Conditions › Spinal Cord Injury › Text Size: A A A Drugs and Medications for Spinal Cord Injury Written by Susan Spinasanta ; Reviewed by Edward C. Benzel, MD Tweet Spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment is complex. Besides the primary injury,    a cascade of secondary conditions may develop immediately after the injury or    later. Drugs and medications may be used for the primary injury and / or to    treat the secondary conditions. First Response after SCI Preventing and controlling inflammation is a first response following SCI. A    drug called methylprednisolone may be administered immediately and continued    for 24 to 48 hours. It is a man-made synthetic corticosteroid drug. Corticosteroids    are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs. Secondary Conditions There are many secondary conditions that can develop after a spinal cord    injury. Besides the conditions outlined below, other challenges include bladder    and bowel management, dealing with fatigue, skin problems, and nutrition.

AD causes over-activity of      the autonomic nervous system. In other words, communication between the body      and brain is disrupted above the injury level. This means body functions,      such as breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate become unregulated. Drugs      that decrease heart rate and relax blood vessels include nitroglycerine and      clonidine (Catapres) 1 . They can be used to treat AD. Respiratory infections may develop when chest and abdominal      muscles are weak, such as in cervical and thoracic SCI. Difficulty or inability      to cough contributes to the development of respiratory infection. Common infections      include the common cold, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Antibiotics may be prescribed      to clear the chest. Spasticity is characterized by stiff or rigid muscles      that make movement, such as walking or talking, difficult. Muscle relaxant      and anti-spastic drugs such as baclofen (Lioresal), cyclobenzaprine, and Botox      may be helpful. Pain caused by the injury, even in areas where there is      no sensation or feeling is limited, is common. SCI patients who use wheelchairs      may develop shoulder or arm pain (e.g., tendonitis). Medication may include      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), muscle relaxants, anti-depressants,      and painkillers (e.g., narcotics). Chronic pain (e.g., neurogenic, nerve pain) often accompanies      paralysis. Medication may include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS),      gabapentin (Neurontin, an anti-seizure drug), muscle relaxants, anti-depressants,      and painkillers (e.g., narcotics). Depression is common, but there are many medications that      are used to treat this disorder. Sometimes, anti-depressant medications are      combined. Some examples of anti-depressant medications are: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac Tricylic drugs (e.g., Elavil) Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SSNRIs),          such as Cymbalta (duloxetine). Cymbalta also treats anxiety. View Sources Reference 1. Maddox, S. Paralysis Resource Guide, Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation,      Springfield, NJ. 2003. Page 58.
