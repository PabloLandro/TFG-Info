Experiencing anxiety, depression, or just a lack of  energy?  Headaches, migraines, or an  injury that could use some help healing?   Menstrual issues or severe PMS?   Come by the Health Services clinic for Acupuncture. What  is Acupuncture? Acupuncture  is a safe and effective holistic medicine backed by more than two thousand  years of practice and research. The most commonly practiced medicine in the  world, it is used worldwide both as a primary and adjunctive treatment for a  wide range of conditions. Acupuncture is used to encourage natural healing, improve mood and energy,  reduce or relieve pain and improve function of affected areas of the body. It  is safe and effective and is often successfully used as an alternative to  medications or even surgery. Relief is often obtained with acupuncture when  traditional medical therapy has failed. People  may see an acupuncturist for almost any condition, from cancer to shoulder  pain. Some of the more commonly treated conditions are:  Pain anywhere in the body including  headaches, migraines and physical trauma  Psychological related conditions such as  depression, anxiety and insomnia  Menstrual Issues such as PMS, amenorrhea,  irregular menstruation, etc.   Asthma a/or allergy issues What  are the needles like? Acupuncture  needles are both sterile and extremely thin. Most people are surprised to see  how thin the needles actually are.  They  are ‘atraumatic’, meaning that they do not have a cutting edge like a  hypodermic needle, which slices through tissue. Their design allows acupuncture  needles to slide smoothly through tissues and makes them unlikely to cause  bleeding or damage to underlying structures. What  will I feel? Most  people who have had acupuncture would describe it as virtually painless or far  less painful than plucking out a hair. The sensations that follow range from  nothing at all, to mild tingling, to slight numbness/achiness, to electrical  pulsations in areas distant from the site of insertion. All these sensations  usually subside once the needles are removed. Some people are energized by  treatment, while others feel relaxed. How  long will the treatment last? After  the needles are inserted you are usually left to rest for a period of 20-30  minutes. Most people feel fairly relaxed during this period and many simply  fall asleep. In many cases your treatment may consist of points on the front  and back of your body so the practitioner may insert needles on the front, let  you rest for awhile and then remove them, have you turn over and continue the  treatment on your back. How  many treatments will I need? Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this  question.  The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary from  person to person depending on the conditions being treated, your age and  health, and how you respond to acupuncture.  Acupuncture is a natural  medicine that is assisting your body to make changes.  This can be a  gradual process. Generally, acute problems require less time and frequency of  treatment,  while chronic conditions that have developed over a long time take somewhat  longer to treat. For example, an acute sprain may  require only one or two treatments, whereas more chronic or severe ailments may  require several (or several dozen) treatments. How long will it take for the treatments to work? A positive response to acupuncture treatments is  generally seen after the first or second treatment. If you are being treated  for a menstrual problem or infertility, give the treatments three menstrual  cycles for your body to respond.  You will schedule your appointments  further and further apart after you have achieved optimal response.  Stress relief is experienced right away, and  even feelings of depression often begin to lift after one or two  treatments. How  often should I receive treatment? Again, this depends on what you are being treated  for and your practitioner.  It is common for treatments to be scheduled  one or two times a week in the beginning to obtain optimal response and then  once every other week.  If you are not able to schedule appointments that  frequently, your acupuncturist may prescribe Chinese herbs, dietary changes,  exercises or pressure points for you to use at home. Acupuncture is also often used as a preventative  medicine. Many people see their acupuncturist only 2-4 times a year for a  "tune up" or "balancing" treatment. This can prevent  disease and promote health, energy and vitality. Is Acupuncture covered by insurance? This depends on your insurance policy. Some insurance plans cover acupuncture,  while others do not. You will need to check with your insurance provider to  determine if your plan covers acupuncture. ©             2011 Mount Al
