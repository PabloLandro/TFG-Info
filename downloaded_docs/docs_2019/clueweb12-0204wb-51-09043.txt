Using minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, skilled surgeons position the adjustable Lap Band®, around the upper portion of a patient's stomach.  The Lap Band® is a small, inflatable belt that functions to restrict the amount of food consumed, slow the emptying of food from the stomach, and provide a constant sensation of being "full." The Lap Band® achieves dramatic weight-loss results by reducing the size of the 
              stomach and by limiting the amount of calories a patient can absorb. 
              Laparoscopic Lap Band® Surgery benefits patients with a safer recovery 
              process and healthier weight-loss results. Learn more about the specifics of Lap Band® and morbid 
                obesity surgery .
