        basis of its program, Gastric Bypass Surgery. The procedure reduces the 
        size of the stomach and shortens the intestine. The procedure reduces 
        food intake and the amount of food absorbed. Not a cosmetic surgical procedure, 
        bariatric surgery is a clinical response to a health-threatening clinical 
        condition  morbid obesity  and its results are dramatic: patients 
        typically lose 75% of excess weight within six to twelve months. The National 
        Institutes of Health has endorsed Gastric Bypass Surgery as the only proven 
        procedure for weight loss in severely obese patients. As a consequence, 
        family physicians have encouraged their most severely overweight patients 
        to undergo the procedure, with 40,000 Bariatric surgeries performed in 
        the United Sates in 2001, 63,000 in 2002 and another 100,000 projected 
        in 2003. Weight

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. © 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
