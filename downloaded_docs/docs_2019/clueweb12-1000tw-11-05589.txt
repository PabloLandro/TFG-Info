But the American Academy of Pediatrics warns that over-the-counter medications to treat coughs and colds aren't safe for children under 2 and may not work or could seriously harm children under 6. Whether your child has a cough, a cold, or the flu, you can try these gentle, effective, and safe home remedies. A cold or flu usually takes about ten days to run its course. While none of these home remedies will shorten your child's illness, they may help him feel a lot better. 1) Lots of rest (all ages) Video How to use a bulb syringe to clear your baby's mucus Give your baby relief from congestion by suctioning out the mucus with a standard bulb syringe or other nasal aspirator. Our pediatrician shows you how. How to use a bulb syringe to clear your baby's mucus See all videos How it helps It takes energy to fight an infection, and that can wear a child (or an adult) out. When your child's resting, he's healing, which is exactly what he needs to do. Studies show that stress plays a role in illness, too. If your child is under pressure – because of school or friends, or something happening at home – giving him a break may be just what he needs to fight off his symptoms. What you need A comfortable place for your child to rest and things to occupy him. How to do it Now's the time to let your child watch that favorite video or television program one more time. Or bring him a new set of crayons and paper or coloring book. Even a puzzle can be manageable in bed. Of course, a bed isn't necessarily the best place to rest. Sometimes a change of scenery is helpful. If the weather is good, set up a comfortable place in the yard or on the porch for your child to rest. Indoors, fashion something more fun than his bed – like a tent in the living room or a snug, pillow-filled area near you. If your child finds it hard to rest, help him by cuddling up with some books. Teach him some finger rhymes (like "The Itsy Bitsy Spider") or tell stories together. Or bring him the phone so he can chat with Grandma or a friend. 2) Steamy air (all ages) How it helps Breathing moist air helps loosen the mucus in the nasal passages. A warm bath has the added benefit of relaxing your child. What you need A humidifier, cool-mist vaporizer, or steamy bathroom. Be sure to clean humidifiers often and according to the manufacturer's directions. Humidifiers accumulate mold, which they then spray into the air if they're not kept scrupulously clean. SYMPTOM GUIDE Is it serious? Find out fast How to use it Have a humidifier or a cool-mist vaporizer going in your child's bedroom when she's sleeping, resting, or playing in the room. Give your child a warm bath in a steamy bathroom. Let a hot shower run for a few minutes before getting the tub ready for your child. If she's old enough, let her play in the bath as long as she likes – supervised, of course, unless she's old enough to hang out on her own. For children over the age of 2, adding a few drops of menthol to the bath water (or vaporizer) may also help her feel less congested. Menthol oil is available at most natural food stores. If it's not a convenient time for a bath, simply turn on the hot water in the tub or shower, close the bathroom door, block any gap under the door with a towel, and sit in the steamy room with your child for about 15 minutes. (Bring a couple of books.) 3) Saline drops and bulb syringes (all ages) How it helps Drops clear the nose when kids are too young to blow their nose. For babies, a bulb syringe really comes in handy if a stuffy nose interferes with breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Try using it about 15 minutes beforehand. Clearing a stuffy nose with a bulb syringe works best for young babies, but if your older baby or child doesn't mind the procedure, there's no reason not to do it. 1 2 3 4 5 Previous Next Show All print Comment on this article ARTICLE Whooping cough: How to protect your baby QUIZ What does your child’s cough mean?
