Progurt Team - Tuesday, August 31, 2010 Probiotics are alive, microscopic and hopefully thriving in your digestive tract. Fortunately for you and me, they are benign. They're even known as good bacteria. Yes, that's right. Bacteria. But they're friendly bacteria. It takes bacteria to fight bacteria apparently. And probiotics can kill unhealthy, disease-producing bacteria. There's a lot going on in our intestines that we don't want to know about. More than you bargained for. But it's a valuable series of transactions. More...

Progurt Team - Monday, August 30, 2010 The human digestive system is an incredibly complex machine with many essential functions, but it is highly sensitive and does occasionally play up. Bloating is a very common complaint with a number of underlying causes, from food intolerance and allergy to IBS and poor digestion. Typically it occurs when partly digested foods ferment in the gut and/or there is an imbalance of the organisms that reside in the bowel. The yeast candida for example, thrives on less healthy foods, particularly sugar and the by-products of partial digestion, which can lead to bloating, wind and flatulence especially if an infection or overgrowth is present.

Progurt Team - Friday, August 27, 2010 If you are constantly being bothered by your painful heartburn but still could not find the right cure for it, you will probably be surprised to find out that there are effective cures that you can actually do at home. The following piece will reveal the natural, and often unknown, remedies for those battling constant recurrences of heartburn symptoms. It is not commonly known that yogurt can be a tremendously useful way to halt the discomfort heartburn always brings. Yogurt is so effective because it contains properties that are soothing to the stomach; not only that, the bacteria from yogurt is a natural aid for digestive ailments. Those who do not like yogurt may prefer to ingest lactobacillus capsules or powder, though an even simpler method is to dissolve baking soda into water for a healing drink. It is also important to introduce large amounts of fresh produce into your diet, because such foods will be gentle on your stomach as they are digested. When less effort is exerted into the digestion process, less acid will also be produced and released in your body; therefore, you will have a smaller chance of experiencing heartburn again. More...

Progurt Team - Thursday, August 26, 2010 Walk by the dairy section of the grocery store and you'll find a variety of yogurts for sale. Television commercials extol the dietary wonders of this popular product, which has a long history. Yogurt has been the diet of peasants and the delicacy of kings for more than 4,000 years. Yogurt is a part of history. In some countries, cultures of bacteria were passed down from generation to generation. Legend has it that Genghis Khan fed his vast army yogurt to give the men strength during their long marches through the Orient and Persia. Yogurt is nutritionally valuable to the diet, as it is rich in vitamins and minerals. I link my love of yogurt to the fresh skin you can achieve by eating it and using it as a facial cream. Making yogurt depends on the growth of bacteria to form lactic acid. When milk is inoculated with one or more types of yogurt bacteria, they begin to grow, forming lactic acid which kills any harmful bacteria that may have infected the milk. The milk used in making yogurt differs by region as does the bacteria. Cow's milk is used in the United States, whereas buffalo's or goat's milk is used in Armenia. More...

Progurt Team - Tuesday, August 24, 2010 A new study (appearing in the June 21 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) concluded that different delivery methods of newborn babies has a big effect on the types of microbial communities they harbor as they emerge into the world, findings with potential implications for the heath of infants as they grow and develop. The study showed that babies delivered vaginally had bacterial communities resembling their mother's vaginal bacteria, while Caesarian section newborns had common skin bacterial communities. Researchers believe many of the different microbial communities residing on humans -- each of which is personally unique -- may help protect individuals from various diseases. The study results may help explain the higher incidence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, in C-section babies, a hard-to-treat bacterial infection that has been increasing in hospitals and clinics in recent years, according to the researchers.

Progurt Team - Thursday, August 12, 2010 No one argues that when it comes to feeding baby, mom’s milk is best. But mothers infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, face a dilemma: Because some of their virus can be shed in breast milk, babies risk becoming infected as they drink it. Two research teams are now investigating a germ-warfare strategy to treat such vulnerable infants. They would supplement breast milk with HIV-quashing bacteria. These beneficial microbes can’t guarantee a child won’t become infected, but they could greatly diminish the chance this will happen, says HIV specialist Ruth Connor of Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, N.H. In the August Breastfeeding Medicine, she and colleagues from Complutense University of Madrid, in Spain, report isolating certain lactic acid bacteria from the breast milk of healthy women that substantially inhibit the growth and infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, or HIV-1.

Progurt Team - Tuesday, August 10, 2010 The World Journal of Gastroenterology, in it’s April 7, 2010 edition reported research evidence indicating milk fermented with the probiotic Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 1190 was effective in the therapeutic treatment of chronic gastritis. The researchers noted: “Gastritis affects 80% of the worldwide population according to data of the Worldwide Health Organization. The use of probiotics has been proposed to ameliorate different gastrointestinal tract disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.; however, little attention has been paid to gastric disease. “ Gastritis has many possible causes, including excessive alcohol consumption, stress and certain autoimmune disorders, infection with bacteria, primarily Helicobacter pylori or prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also known as NSAIDs) such as acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA), aspirin or ibuprofen. Thus, the authors decided to investigate the therapeutic effect of milk fermented with exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing S. thermophilus CRL 1190 and its polymer on chronic gastritis induced by aspirin in mice.

African children who eat a high-fiber diet (and the occasional wood-digesting insect) have gut bacteria that help them digest plant fibers and protect them from diarrhea and inflammatory disease, a new study finds. The research may lead to new probiotics that improve the digestive health of Westerners, who were found to have a less diverse assemblage of intestinal microbes.

Different types of food encourage different abundances and diversity of bacteria to grow in the gut. More...

Progurt Team - Thursday, July 29, 2010 A bug that causes inflammation in the gut may play a key role in multiple sclerosis (MS), scientists have discovered. In mice, the bowel bug caused healthy animals to become ill with MS-like symptoms. Scientists believe it may have a similar effect in humans due to its impact on the immune system. MS is an auto-immune condition which attacks the fatty insulation around nerve fibres known as myelin. As the myelin is destroyed, the transmission of nerve messages becomes disrupted, leading to symptoms ranging from mild tingling to paralysis. The disease affects around 85,000 people in the UK and 2.5 million worldwide. More...

Post a Comment Name Please fill in the text in the image in the box below Your comment The Pros of Probiotics in Pregnancy. Progurt Team - Tuesday, July 27, 2010 Here’s another “optimizing” ingredient to add to your grocery list: Probiotics. In a Norwegian study published in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers learned that mothers who consumed milk with a probiotic supplement during pregnancy and breastfeeding cut the chances of their child having eczema in half. We are always hearing about how to optimize the health of our babies with what we ingest during pregnancy; it can get a little hectic trying to squeeze in the Omega 3s, Vitamin D, iron and calcium with all the pregnancy food warnings and aversions. But this study caught my attention because I’m kind of intrigued by probiotics in general. And I have friends with eczema and they hate it. Babies with eczema, no fun at all. More...
