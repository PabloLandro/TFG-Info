Drink plenty of fluid to flush bacteria from your system regularly.  You should drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water per day.

The high levels of vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) will create a hostile environment for the bacteria, thus preventing the UTI .  3.	 Drink unsweetened cranberry juice regularly to prohibit bacteria from clinging to your urinary and digestive tracts.  During an active infection, you can drink from 3-4 glasses per day.  4.	Ro uti nely supplement your diet with acidophilus or eat yogurt several times per week to encourage a healthy supply of "good" bacteria in your digestive and urinary systems.    5.
