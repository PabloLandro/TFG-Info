What Causes Alzheimer's? While scientists are still trying to determine what causes Alzheimer's, they have pinpointed several factors that increase a person's risk for developing the disease. Understanding how plaques and tangles, age, family history, and lifestyle affect risk can empower people to accept the factors they cannot change and make adjustments in the areas over which they do have control. The Mini-Mental State Exam Of the many existing tests that screen for Alzheimer's, the MMSE is widely used and reliable. Taking about 10 minutes to complete, the MMSE measures aspects of cognition that include orientation, word recall, attention and calculation, language abilities, and visual construction. Scores may need to be adjusted or interpreted differently to account for a person's age, educational level, and ethnicity/race. Symptoms of Alzheimer's Although each person is different, most advance through a series of stages characterized by progressively more serious Alzheimer's symptoms. Seven stages of Alzheimer's symptoms developed by researchers and physicians describe how a person’s functioning changes over time, from a normally functioning adult to someone with severe, advanced Alzheimer’s disease. Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease About 5% of those with Alzheimer's disease have early-onset Alzheimer's, which affects people younger than age 65. Learn about the signs, symptoms, and diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Clock Drawing Test The clock drawing test is an assessment that can be used as a part of a neurological test or as a screening tool for Alzheimer's and other types of dementia. Vascular Dementia Vascular dementia is one of the second most common types of dementia, along with Lewy body dementia. Learn about the prevalence, causes, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of vascular dementia. Simple Word Test Diagnostic A simple word test may be the key to early diagnosis of Alzheimer's.

Learn about current Alzheimer's treatment, including medications and non-drug approaches to promote symptom management. Prognosis for Alzheimer's Although there's no cure for Alzheimer's, there's often confusion about whether it's a fatal disease. Learn about the prognosis for someone who's been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Celebs with Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease does not discrimate when it comes to who is and who is not affected. Here is a list of famous people and celebrities that have Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Brain The Alzheimer's brain looks very different from the normal brain.

Learn what to expect during a diagnostic workup and what kinds of specialists may be involved in the process. Urinary Tract Infection Urinary tract infection in the elderly or in people with Alzheimer's can profoundly affect not only their health but can result in significant behavioral changes. Huntington's Disease Huntington's disease is an inherited progressive form of dementia in which personality, memory and mood changes as the disease advances. Types of Dementia Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia -- in fact, almost two-thirds of dementia cases are due to Alzheimer's disease. However, a host of other conditions can also cause dementia, including vascular dementia, Lewy body disease, HIV/AIDS, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, head trauma, and Huntington's disease.

natural activity can have a great therapeutic effect with people who suffer with memory loss for recent events. Tapping into 
a persons past can not only reveal a rich seam of insight and wisdom, but it can be a real tonic for someone who has memory difficulties as a result of their condition.

Early onset Alzheimer's can develop in some very rare cases in people in their thirties. The Mini-Cog The Mini-Cog is a rapid Alzheimer's screening test that takes only 3-5 minutes to administer. It combines 3-item recall with the clock-drawing test to determine whether someone does or does not have dementia. It is extremely accurate as an assessment tool, but as with other screening tools does not substitute for a thorough diagnostic work-up. Blood Pressure Explained Blood pressure results from two forces. One created by the heart as it pumps blood into the arteries through the circulatory system. The other is the force of the arteries as they resist the blood flow. Pick's Disease In Pick's disease the brain tissue changes and loss occurs in focal areas of the brain rather than the generalized damage associated with Alzheimer's.
