   Prescription-Free Natural Bladder Control Formula Many studies have proven that bladder control exercises can
strengthen your pelvic floor muscles thus significantly
reducing the chances of urge incontinence. For the uninitiated,
urge incontinence is commonly referred to as overactive bladder
syndrome. This syndrome affects many men and women all across
the globe and bladder control exercises such as Kegal
exercises, may address the problem if conducted in the correct
fashion. Apart from strengthening the pelvic muscles, Kegal exercises
may also improve the function of your bladder. Now, you may be
asking, why do we need to strengthen our pelvic floor muscles?
Well, it’s critical that we improve these muscles because they
provide support for our bladder, the place where our urine is
stored. Aside from the bladder, your pelvic floor muscles are
also responsible for supporting the vagina and urethra which is
an opening for urine to flow out of our body. How to Perform Kegal Bladder Control
Exercises Important Note: Proper
execution for the following exercise is essential or you might
end up aggravating the problem from bad to worse. That said, I
suggest you pay a visit to the doctor to insure you’re able to
perform the exercises described below in the proper way. Once
you’ve done that, you may begin performing the exercises in the
privacy and comfort of your own home. Two or three 5 minute
sessions per day may help in toning up your pelvic floor
muscles. Here’s how it works: First, urinate as
per usual, and then stop the flow midway through! Hold it for
about 2 – 3 seconds and then discharge the remaining flow. The
objective of this process is to improve your bladder control.
It helps you use the muscles effectively and familiarizing
yourself with them. Also, when you’re not urinating, try to
tighten the muscles and keep it on hold for about 5 seconds or
so. Do this about 10 times and for optimal results, you may
increase the repetitions over time and in a gradual manner. Other Remedies for Overactive Bladder The bladder control exercises I’ve just described to you may
be effective, but it can be rather hassling especially when
you’re required to perform them on a frequent basis in order to
experience the desired results. The upside, though, is that the
exercises can be done for free. It’s not as if you have to pay
for a gym membership in order to perform them. So those who are not interested in performing the exercises
might want to opt for other remedies for overactive
bladder such as herbal medications. They are available
for a price and a bottle would typically last for 30 days.
Here’s a natural herbal-based medication that is made in the
USA, and clinically proven to promote optimal urinary tract
health as well as keeping your overactive bladder syndrome in
check. Click Here for Flostat Natural Bladder
