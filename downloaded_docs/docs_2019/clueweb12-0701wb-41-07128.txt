Nausea, light sensitivity and vomiting are common symptoms. Although the causes of migraines are not well understood, they have been linked to abnormal brain activity, certain foods, environmental factors and stress. Obese patients who frequently suffered from migraines and then underwent bariatric surgery had a large improvement in their migraine frequency and intensity after six months. The more weight they lost, the greater their improvement. Many patients experienced improvements in their migraine frequency prior to even reaching their ideal weight level. These improvements came about regardless of the type of weight loss surgery chosen by patients. Undergoing obesity surgery in Dallas is likely to improve not only your weight, but also your health, since losing weight may improve your migraine symptoms as well as your risk for various medical conditions including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and cancer. Your quality of life is likely to improve as well, since you will have fewer health problems to prevent you from going about your preferred daily activities. Further studies need to be completed to determine whether losing weight through other methods will also help minimize problems with migraines. However, obesity surgery tends to be one of the faster and more effective methods for losing weight and finding relief from migraine pain. Leave Comment Click here to cancel reply.
