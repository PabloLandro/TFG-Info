More Product Info Quantity: Price/Item: -- Please select price and item -- 10 ml |$14.25 Heavenly Scent Diffuser Heavenly Scent Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Diffuser 

This ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser is a state-of-the-art aromatherapy nebulizer system that also ionizes essential oil molecules into the air using a heat-free diffusion method, while enhancing an essential oil’s biological effects. 

Aromatherapy essential oils can be used to reduce symptoms of respiratory problems (colds, flu, hay fever, asthma and allergies), assist symptoms such as chronic fatigue, exhaustion, migraines, headaches, sleeping problems, positively improves the mood and helps to alleviate depression. Creates a pleasant aromatherapy atmosphere and neutralizes most odors. 

The Benefits of the Diffuser: 
1. Purify the environment and minimize airborne pollutants (bacteria, viruses and other microbes, dust, pollen, animal dander, mold spores).
2. It can completely break the essential oil into tiny micro particles and disperse essential oils into an extremely fine cold mist of micro-particles without heat. 
3. Automatic shutoff when water reaches a minimum level. It provides a safe way to diffuse essential oils.
4. No heat is used in the diffusion process of the ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser. Heat causes the rapid evaporation of the more volatile components of the oil, results in a loss of the fullness of the natural aroma and its healing effect. The heat may alter or destroy certain constituents of the oils and thus the therapeutic benefit may not be as optimal as using cold-air diffusion method. 5. You can choose different essential oils as you need.
6. Built-in  timer to enhance both the effectiveness and economy of the essential oils.
