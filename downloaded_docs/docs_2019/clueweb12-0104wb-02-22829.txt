			Psychiatrist, Medical Acupuncture, Integrative Medicine Acupuncture FAQ Frequently Asked Questions The NIH (National Institutes of Health) Consensus Statement on Acupuncture "Acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention is widely practiced in 
			the United States. While there have been many studies of its 
			potential usefulness, many of these studies provide equivocal 
			results because of design, sample size, and other factors. The issue 
			is further complicated by inherent difficulties in the use of 
			appropriate controls, such as placebos and sham acupuncture groups. 
			However, promising results have emerged, for example, showing 
			efficacy of acupuncture in adult post-operative and chemotherapy 
			nausea and vomiting and in post-operative dental pain. There are 
			other situations such as addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, 
			menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofacial pain, 
			osteoarthritis, low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and asthma 
			where acupuncture may be useful as an adjunct treatment or an 
			acceptable alternative or be included in a comprehensive management 
			program. Further research is likely to uncover additional areas 
			where acupuncture interventions will be useful." This NIH Consensus 
			statement was prepared by a non-advocate, non-Federal panel of 
			experts, based on presentations by investigators working in areas 
			relevant to the consensus on November 5, 1997 See Also: Does acupuncture
