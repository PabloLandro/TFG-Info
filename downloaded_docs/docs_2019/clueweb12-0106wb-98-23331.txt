<25% of those with disseminated 

disease); WBC count may not be elevated; in disseminated disease, elevated transaminases red flag for HSV infection; 

unexplained tachypnea unusual presentation of HSV infection; blood in CSF not indicative of HSV in neonate (cortical 

hemorrhage more common in older children) Epidemiology: 85% of perinatal HSV infections occur during passage through birth canal (15% of cases acquired after 

birth, due to exposure to nongenital lesions); HSV-2 infection predominates; maternal acquisition of HSV during pregnancy

associated with high risk for transmission (child most protected if mother already has HSV-2 antibodies) Spectrum of neonatal HSV: continuum (no distinct categories) Skin, eye, mucous membrane (SEM) disease: if only SEM disease present, mortality zero; skin lesions typically appear at 

1- to 2-wk of age at sites of trauma; with maternal history of HSV infection, fetal scalp electrodes contraindicated; if 

mother has history of herpes lesion near time of delivery, do not perform, eg, circumcision (wait until child clear of exposure);

rate of neurologic sequelae ≈ 5%; laboratory studies direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining; sensitivity 

>80% to >95% (few false positives); obtain viral and bacterial cultures Disseminated disease: presents in first 5 to 10 days after birth; mimics sepsis (patients look sick); signs and symptoms include

fever, hepatomegaly, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and tachypnea; obtain viral cultures from sites 

other than blood; CNS involvement may be present (order polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test of CSF); with treatment, 

mortality ≈ 50% (rate of sequelae ≈ 40%); evaluation to define extent of disease consider liver function tests (typically,

bacterial infection not associated with liver involvement); thrombocytopenia and DIC common; abdominal films; 

chest x-ray (to detect infiltrates); computed tomography (CT), electroencephalography (EEG); if HSV infection 

suspected empiric administration of acyclovir recommended CNS disease: onset 2 to 3 wk after birth; symptoms nonspecific, but may include focal seizures; ≈ 50% of patients develop

skin lesions; lumbar puncture (LP) has low specificity (use PCR); EEG diffusely abnormal (in older child, findings

localized to temporal lobes); early CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically normal (cortical 

hemorrhage late finding); viral encephalitis associated with enterovirus infection (less commonly, adenovirus); mortality

15% (sequelae 54%; empiric therapy recommended) General approach to diagnosis: serologies have no role in diagnosis of neonatal HSV because of maternal antibody 

and possibility that source postnatal; culture specimens can be combined (site not key); PCR of CSF; Kimberlin 2001 cultures of skin and eye (particularly conjunctiva) best yield; negative PCR does not exclude possibility of neonatal HSV 

CNS disease (do not discontinue acyclovir based on single PCR [repeat LP and culture]) PCR results from CSF of neonate (Kimberlin 1996): 24% of children with documented SEM disease had positive

PCR; first PCR negative in 25% of children with CNS disease demonstrated by MRI and EEG; HSV DNA detected 

in 25% of children previously categorized as having SEM disease (suggests disease continuum); 6 of 8 negative samples 

collected >5 days after initiation of acyclovir; clinical application of PCR findings 13 children given vidarabine and 

6 given acyclovir (all had positive PCR at 10 days); 18 of 19 died or suffered moderate to severe neurologic impairment 

within first year); 3 in 11 with negative PCR also had neurologic impairment; caveat vidarabine no longer used because

of renal toxicity; current recommendations persistence of positive PCR associated with poor outcome; obtain 

CSF for PCR near end of course; if PCR still positive, continue acyclovir for 1 wk and repeat test (if positive, continue 

acyclovir) Safety and efficacy of high-dose intravenous (IV) acyclovir (Kimberlin, National Institute of Allergy 

and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group, 2001): current duration of therapy 21 days; 

infants given acyclovir 45 or 60 mg/kg per day for 14 to 21 days; ≈ 25% of subjects positive for HSV-1 (68% for HSV-2); 

high mortality in CNS group (at 20 mg/kg per dose, mortality improved); morbidity with improved therapy (higher 

dose, longer duration), all children with SEM disease normal at 12 mo of age; CNS disease (no improvement); disseminated

disease (modest change); dose-related side effects renal toxicity not common; only 2 in 72 children had elevated

creatinine levels at 60 mg/kg per day; however, neutropenia common; should we apply this regimen to HSV 

encephalitis beyond neonatal period? without good studies, answer yes (use 21-day regimen) Recurrent disease: skin recurrences likely (almost all patients have ≥ 1 recurrence in first 6 mo of life); direct correlation

between frequency of recurrences of SEM disease and adverse neurologic sequelae; if <3 recurrences within first 6 

mo, child almost always normal (if ≥ 3 recurrences, only 70%-80% of patients neurologically normal) Suppressive acyclovir therapy after neonatal HSV infection (Kimberlin 1996): after last dose of IV acyclovir,

oral acyclovir initiated at 300 mg/m 2 per dose, bid or tid, for 6 mo; 18 in 26 children met enrollment criteria (16 in 

18 treated tid); study conducted before valacyclovir available; safety 12 in 26 participants developed neutropenia (of 

those, 4 had absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/µl); neutropenia developed in ≈ 50% of patients; oral acyclovir therapy

tid reduced recurrences, compared to historical controls; however, authors concluded that data insufficient to recommend

routine utilization of suppressive therapy after acute management of neonatal HSV infection Risk for maternal transmission: risk greater with primary disease than recurrent disease; presence of maternal antibody

protective; prolonged duration of rupture of membranes increases risk; mucocutaneous barriers (if lesion present, 

risk increased; avoid scalp electrodes); cesarean delivery reduces risk if performed ≤ 4 hr after rupture of membrane in 

mother with active lesions Valacyclovir prophylaxis (Andrews 2006): HSV-2-positive women given 500 mg oral valacyclovir bid starting 36 

wk before delivery; control group given placebo; clinical recurrences reduced with suppressive therapy; shedding of 

HSV within 7 days of delivery similar between groups Other interventions: rapid HSV PCR testing of maternal secretions at delivery; if positive, cesarean delivery recommended;

testing cost-effective; more data needed HSV vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline): currently in phase 3 trials; vaccine prevented genital herpes in ≈ 75% of patients; 

vaccine 40% effective in preventing HSV-2; no efficacy against HSV-1 acquisition; no efficacy in preventing infection if 

patient HSV-1-positive or male; bottom line vaccine protected HSV-naive female patients from infection JUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIBIOTICS Clinical scenario A: 5-yr-old child presented to ED with 2-day history of fever and cough; child moderately ill, tachycardic,

and tachypneic; temperature elevated; pulse oximetry decreased to 97%, and breath sounds decreased on right side; 

WBC count 22,000/µL with 70% PMNs; on chest x-ray, lobar infiltrates and effusion; initial management plan to admit 

patient; obtain lateral or decubitus films and prepare for diagnostic thoracentesis, chest tube, or video-assisted thoracic surgery

(VATS); simple lobar pneumonia empiric administration of high-dose IV ampicillin treatment of choice for presumed

bacterial pneumonia in children >3 mo of age; Streptococcus pneumoniae most likely bacterial pathogen in this 

scenario; despite increases in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), penicillin treatment failures in nonmeningeal disease

rare; ampicillin recommended unless staphylococcal infection suspected; consider third-generation cephalosporin if patient

septic or at high risk ( eg, immunocompromised); if pneumatoceles or effusions present add coverage for routine Staphylococcus aureus and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA); 30% to 40% of pneumococci resistant

to macrolides (exception pneumonia due to Mycoplasma ); add macrolides to regimen in high-risk populations ( eg, patients with sickle cell disease) Aminopenicillins: mechanism of action aminopenicillins bind to penicillin-binding proteins; as resistance mechanism,

bacteria produce  β-lactamase; spectrum of coverageHaemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ; S 

pneumoniae has different mechanism of resistance (amoxicillin-clavulanate [Augmentin], ampicillin plus sulbactam 

[Unasyn], or other  β-lactamase inhibitor not helpful) Resistance of S pneumoniae to antibiotics: organism resistant to every family and class of antibiotics; rate of resistance

to erythromycin 30% (penicillin, 25%); however, group A streptococci 100% susceptible to penicillin; macrolides increased resistance correlates with increased prescriptions (avoid macrolides); S pneumoniae most common cause of 

acute sinusitis and also most common cause of otitis media (high-dose amoxicillin first-line therapy); for nontypeable H influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis , third-generation cephalosporin or modified penicillin that has  β-lactamase inhibitor 

makes sense; look for inducible resistance to clindamycin Prevention and control of resistance: use least broad-spectrum antibiotic that targets pathogen suspected; use appropriate

dose and duration (smaller doses encourage resistance); vaccinating patients helps limit need for antibiotics and 

development of antibiotic resistance Clinical scenario B: 4-yr-old patient with history of diffuse abdominal pain lasting 2 to 3 days; child awake all night 

with severe pain; pain improved, but temperature 39°C; child looks toxic in ED; abdomen diffusely tender with decreased 

bowel sounds; WBC count 25,000/µL; ultrasonography (US) consistent with perforated appendicitis and peritonitis; patient

admitted; IV antibiotics started and surgical consult obtained; recommended initial therapy 1) ampicillin, gentamicin,

and metronidazole ( eg, Flagyl), or 2) ampicillin and sulbactam (Unasyn; if child toxic, add aminoglycoside); other options piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) or ticarcillin-clavulanate (Timentin) acceptable, but added coverage for Pseudomonas usually not necessary in perforated appendicitis; cefoxitin is modified second-generation cephalosporin 

(good coverage for Bacteroides fragilis ; no enterococcal coverage) Cephalosporins: mechanism of action mostly penicillin-binding proteins; with increasing generations, loss in gram-positive

coverage, but gain in gram-negative coverage; all cephalosporins inactive against Listeria and enterococci Aminoglycosides: advantages of once-daily dosing higher peak drug concentrations; prolonged postantibiotic effect;

reduced likelihood of induced resistance; less toxicity Clinical scenario C: 3-yr-old patient presents to ED with 2- to 3-day history of leg pain and limp, and 1-day history of 

fever; pinpoint pain over lower left femur; WBC normal; C-reactive protein (CRP) 10.0 mg/L; aspiration of bone at site 

of pain sent for Gram stain and culture; Gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in clusters; recommended initial 

management 1) nafcillin or cefazolin, or 2) clindamycin, depending on local prevalence of MRSA and clindamycin 

resistance; in this case, nafcillin prescribed; bone scan confirms diagnosis of osteomyelitis ( S aureus identified as pathogen);

patient afebrile; laboratory report organism resistant to nafcillin, first-generation cephalosporins, and macrolides,

but susceptible to clindamycin, vancomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ, eg, Bactrim); 

issue whether to continue or change course of therapy Clindamycin for osteomyelitis: oral formulation 100% bioavailable, but tastes bad; bone penetration excellent; 

works by blocking protein synthesis; excellent activity against gram-positive cocci (not effective against enterococci); increased

resistance from B fragilis and group A streptococci; inducible resistance revealed by positive double-disk diffusion

test (D-test); toxicity risk for Clostridium difficile colitis overrated (problem more common in adults) Vancomycin: prudent use treatment of serious infections resistant to  β-lactamase antibiotics; serious infections in patients

allergic to penicillin; empiric treatment for neutropenic fever, but only if line infection suspected or patient at high 

risk for Streptococcus viridans infection (look for mucositis); prophylaxis for, eg, subacute bacterial endocarditis; surgical

prophylaxis for prosthetic materials in patient or institution with high rate of hospital-acquired MRSA; inappropriate 

use single blood culture positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium if subsequent cultures 

negative and contamination likely; continued empiric therapy when laboratory tests do not support it; primary treatment 

for antibiotic-associated colitis; prophylaxis for dialysis or central lines; selective decontamination of bowel; eradication 

of MRSA colonization MRSA infection Emergence of community-acquired MRSA in pediatric population (Herold 1998): prevalence of community-acquired 

MRSA without identified risk at University of Chicago Childrens Hospital increased from 10 in 100,000 admissions

(1988-1990) to 259 in 10,000 admissions (1993-1995) Mechanism of methicillin resistance: MEC A gene contains sequence of DNA that encodes novel penicillin-binding protein;

hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections associated with separate strains of S aureus (USA 100 and 

USA 300, respectively) Treatment options Oral therapy: clindamycin (depending on level of resistance to clindamycin in particular community); TMP-SMZ; for 

more serious disease, consider adding rifampin (synergy shown); minocycline (if child old enough); linezolid Systemic therapy: clindamycin, vancomycin, linezolid; daptomycin excellent activity against MRSA; highly bactericidal;

does not penetrate lung well (not recommended for empyema and pneumonia); potential for thrombocytopenia

with prolonged use Strategies to reduce antibiotic resistance: appropriate antibiotic selection susceptibility of suspected pathogen

key; consider combination therapy; use optimal dose and route of administration; de-escalation start empiric therapy

to cover most likely pathogens; once specific pathogen identified, de-escalate by narrowing spectrum of coverage; restricted antimicrobial use hospital formularies very helpful and should be used Suggested Reading Andrews WW et al: Valacyclovir therapy to reduce recurrent genital herpes in pregnant women.
