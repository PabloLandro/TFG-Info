Generally defined as being more than 100 pounds over ideal body weight, severe obesity may increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, sleep apnea, gall bladder disease, osteoarthritis, depression, infertility, high blood pressure and certain forms of cancer. Choosing a surgical option for the treatment of morbid obesity is a life-long commitment. Your dietary intake, exercise, and medications require permanent modification. Your surgeon will assist you in selecting a surgery option that may help you reach your goals. Considering Bariatric Surgery The Bariatric Surgeons at Park Plaza Hospital offer advanced Bariatric technology and individualized treatment alternatives specifically designed to promote long-term weight management. This service is not for everyone. Qualified individuals must be 100 or more pounds overweight, and have difficulties or other medical problems due to their weight condition. The long-range success of Bariatric Surgery or any treatment depends largely on the patient, who must follow a healthy, nutritious eating plan for life. The surgery itself is designed to be a permanent procedure. As each case is different and must be independently evaluated and managed, actual weight loss will vary.
