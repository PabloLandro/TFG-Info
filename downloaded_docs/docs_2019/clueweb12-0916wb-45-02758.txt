Three cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in the Abilene schools as of last week. Several unconfirmed cases have been reported in the Chapman area and in other areas of the county. In the notification message sent out late Friday afternoon by the Abilene school district to parents and guardians of students at Garfield Elementary School, Dr. Brian Holmes, the county’s health officer, recommends if a child or staff member is not up to date on their Tdap shots and are 10 years and older, they also needed to be vaccinated. If a child’s last round of vaccinations was in Kindergarten, they will need a booster of Tdap. A Tdap vaccine shot covers tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis. The Abilene schools are currently on Christmas break and will not return to classes until after Jan. 1. If a child is sick, they recommend that all household contacts receive prophylactic antibiotics and be updated on their Tdap vaccine. Even if a child is not sick, the health department is recommending they be treated and updated on the vaccine. Parents and guardians are advised to contact their physician’s office for treatment and vaccination. Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control. It is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of many coughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which result in a “whooping” sound. Pertussis most commonly affects infants and young children and can be fatal, especially in babies less than one year of age. Early symptoms can last for one to two weeks and usually include: • Runny nose • Low-grade fever (generally minimal throughout the course of the disease) • Mild, occasional cough • Apnea – a pause in breathing (in infants) Pertussis can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications in infants and young children, especially those who are not fully vaccinated. Of infants who are hospitalized for pertussis, half will have apnea, which is slowed or stopped breathing, and one in five will get pneumonia. Teens and adults can also get complications from pertussis. They are usually less serious in this older age group, especially in those who have been vaccinated. Complications in teens and adults are often caused by the cough itself. Whooping cough is generally treated with antibiotics and early treatment is very important. Treatment may make the infection less severe if it is started early, before coughing fits begin. Treatment can also help prevent spreading the disease to close contacts (people who have spent a lot of time around the infected person) and is necessary for stopping the spread of pertussis.
