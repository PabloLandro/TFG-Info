Varicose veins Advertisement Search Home > Pregnancy > Antenatal health > Your physical health in pregnancy > Send to a friend Printable version Share Reader comments Varicose veins Approved by the BabyCenter Australia Medical Advisory Board Last reviewed: May 2010 [Show references] [Hide references] What are varicose veins? Why am I getting varicose veins in my legs? Will I get varicose veins in other parts of my body? What are the symptoms of varicose veins? Can I prevent varicose veins? Are varicose veins a serious problem? What if my varicose veins don't go away? What are varicose veins? You may have seen people with bulging purple or blue veins showing on their calves. These are varicose veins. They're much more common in women than men. Varicose veins usually show on your legs, just under the skin's surface, but you can get them in other parts of your body, too. Veins have valves that stop the blood that is returning to your heart from flowing backwards. Varicose veins develop when the valves don't work properly and the vein walls become weak. Blood collects in the area of weakness. Once this has happened, the walls of the vein start to stretch and sag, the vein itself swells and you'll be able to see it under skin. Varicose veins affect about one in three women. You're more likely to get them if they run in the family or if you are overweight . Why am I getting varicose veins in my legs? Your growing baby, the placenta and your uterus (womb) weigh down on the veins in your pelvis. These include the large vein (inferior vena cava) on the right-hand side of your body. This major blood vessel has to work hard. It receives blood from your lower limbs and most of the organs in your pelvis and belly. The pressure on your inferior vena cava makes it harder for the blood from your legs to make its return journey to your heart. At the same time, you have more blood circulating round your pregnant body and the hormone progesterone relaxes your blood vessel walls. All this means the veins in your legs are likely to become swollen, or varicose. Varicose veins are very common in pregnancy (NCCWCH 2008) . The good news is, they do tend to get better once you've had your baby (CKS 2008) . Will I get varicose veins in other parts of my body? You're more prone to getting varicose veins in your legs, but you can get them in other parts of your body. Piles are varicose veins of the rectal area and are common during pregnancy. About four per cent of pregnant women develop varicose veins in and around their vagina (Bell et al 2007) . They usually get better on their own after you've had your baby (Bell et al 2007) . What are the symptoms of varicose veins? As well as being a bit unsightly, varicose veins can cause other annoying symptoms, including:  itchiness and discomfort in the skin over the vein  swollen feet and ankles  muscle cramps at night  heavy, achy legs (CKS 2008) If these symptoms are severe or causing you a lot of discomfort, ask your doctor for help. Can I prevent varicose veins? Unfortunately, there's not a great deal you can do to prevent them or stop them from getting worse (CKS 2008) . But don't despair. There are some things you can try:  Lie down or sleep on your left side, to take the pressure off your inferior vena cava. Put your feet on a pillow and wedge another pillow behind your back.  Don't sit or stand for long periods of time. Move around at least once every half an hour. Or get your circulation going by taking some gentle exercise . Just a quick, brisk walk can help (CKS 2008) .  If you have to sit at a desk all day at work , don't cross your legs. Put your feet up whenever you can. Use a footstool or box.  Putting on too much weight, too quickly can make you more prone to varicose veins. Try to follow a healthy, balanced diet . You can use various tights and stockings to try to prevent blood pooling in your legs. These range from maternity support tights you can buy yourself to compression stockings your doctor can prescribe (CKS 2008) . Compression stockings are rather thick and can be uncomfortable, particularly in hot weather. Put your tights or stockings on before you get out of bed in morning so blood will have less of a chance to gather in your legs. There's no guarantee tights or stockings stop varicose veins from getting worse or starting in the first place, but they may ease your discomfort (CKS 2008) . Are varicose veins a serious problem? Most of the time, varicose veins won't cause you serious problems. However, if you have varicose veins in the area between your vagina and back passage (perineum) your midwife will watch them closely as you give birth. She'll want to make sure that when you reach the pushing stage of labour , your perineum doesn't tear, as this could cause severe bleeding. She'll encourage you to push slowly and to use positions , such as being on your hands and knees, that take pressure off the area. If you've had varicose veins for a few years, it's worth knowing about problems that could develop in the long run:  The skin over a varicose vein can become very thin and may bleed a lot if bumped or cut. It can be difficult to stop the bleeding and you may need to get medical help.  The skin over your varicose veins may suffer a lack of oxygen and nutrients, because fresh blood isn't reaching it. This may cause waste products to build up, leading to eczema, skin hardening or ulcers. If you think you're developing any of these, see your doctor (CKS 2008) . Some mums worry that they may get a blood clot and develop a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), because they have varicose veins. This rarely happens (CKS 2008) , but going through pregnancy and birth itself can put you at risk of DVT. Remind yourself of the postnatal symptoms you should never ignore . What if my varicose veins don't go away? If your varicose veins don't go away after you've had your baby, you could have them treated. It's worth waiting until you've had all the children you want before treatment, because varicose veins tend to worsen with each pregnancy. There are a number of treatments you could have, depending on the type of varicose veins you have. Laser therapy, chemical injections or surgery may all be recommended, depending on the severity of the problem. There may be a Medicare rebate for some therapies, especially if you have deeper varicose veins. The treatment of other more superficial veins may be seen as cosmetic surgery and not covered by Medicare. Your doctor will be able to advise you.
