                            Orders: v Custom Formulations v Wholesale Calcium Magnesium Citrate Tablets Natural Factors Essential for the development and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth, everyone should be sure to maintain adequate levels of Calcium - especially women who are prone to osteoporosis. Calcium is also vital for proper muscle development, plays an essential role in blood clotting, may assist in lowering blood pressure and helps activate many enzymes. Calcium and Magnesium are best taken together and can promote sleep when taken as supplements at night. Low levels of magnesium can lead to leg cramps that tend to disrupt the sleep of the elderly. Other symptoms of magnesium deficiency include insomnia, restlessness, irritability, nervousness, anxiety, depression, fatigue and osteoporosis.  The occurrence of migraines, asthma, kidney stones and PMS can all be related to a magnesium deficiency. Natural Factors Calcium Magnesium Citrate is an extra strength 1:1 combination of Calcium and Magnesium, also containing Potassium, Zinc and Manganese – and vitamin D for enhanced absorption, in citrate form making it easy highly bio-available and easy to assimilate - in convenient tablet form.
