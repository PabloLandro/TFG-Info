The following list of common herbs is an example of possible health benefits for treating some ailments.

Dong Quia Dong quai has been used in Asia for thousands of years as a tonic for the female reproductive system. It also balances and strengthens the female organs and regulates their functions. Feverfew Several studies confirm feverfew's value in preventing migraines. Feverfew may be used as an anti-inflammatory for relief of arthritis, to relieve some types of menstrual problems, and as a digestive aid. Garlic More than 1,000 scientific studies have shown health benefits of garlic. Garlic has been used as protection against colds and flu. In addition, garlic may help lower cholesterol, prevent blood clots, reduce blood pressure and protect against bacterial and fungal infections. Studies have shown that garlic may have a positive role in the prevention of coronary heart disease, thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. Ginger Ginger has been used for centuries to control nausea and for reducing inflammation. Goldenseal Goldenseal is found in popular herbal blends for relieving intestinal and gallbladder inflammation. It also has been used to soothe inflamed or infected mucous membranes.

There are many resources available online that outline specific health conditions and recommend herbs. Herbs can be purchased online or at local health food stores.
