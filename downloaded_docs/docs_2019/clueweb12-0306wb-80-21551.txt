Q-tips have their uses, but removing ear wax is not officially one of them . That’s because when you probe the ear canal with a cotton swab, it can push wax farther down into the ear, potentially damaging the eardrum. If you do end up with impacted ear wax, ear drops are better than doing nothing, but no particular type of drops can be recommended over any other, according to a Cochrane Review , a systematic review of the research. Impacted ear wax — one of the most common ear problems people have -- can damage hearing and cause discomfort, pain or even dizziness. Oil- or water-based ear drops are often prescribed to clear the wax or to help with subsequent ear syringing if necessary. The review of nine trials found that any sort of ear drops can help remove ear wax, but that water and saline drops appear to be as good as more costly commercial products. The quality of the trials was generally low, however, and more research is needed, the report said.

Why I miss paper towels If you thought the national anthem during Chicago Blackhawks home games was deafening , step inside a bathroom in Chicago’s Millennium Park . The sleek Xlerator hand dryers may blast the water away, but their decibel level can spike into the mid-90s, depending on how you stick your hands under the powerful air outlet and the design of the bathroom. ( Click here to hear the hand dryers) At 100 decibels — think jet takeoff, jackhammer or garbage truck — serious hearing damage can occur after eight hours. No one except maybe the cleaning staff is likely to be in the bathroom for eight hours. The machines, meanwhile, are loud because they can dry hands three times faster than traditional dryers — Americans apparently hate most dryers because they take so long -- and use 80 percent less energy, according to the company. They are also marketed as providing a 95 percent cost savings compared with paper towels. But between the explosion of noise from the machines and the scary automatic flush toilets (70 decibels), I’m having trouble getting my kids into bathrooms, let alone getting their hands washed. And the dryers aren't just in Millennium Park. They're now at Target, CVS, Dunkin Donuts, schools — including Niles Township School District 219 -- office buildings, industrial plants and hospitals and even the Chicago Center for Green Technology, said William Gagnon, vice president of marketing and key accounts for Excel Dryer. Still, there is a solution that few people seem to know about: Excel Dryer offers a device that can lower the decibel level by up to 9 decibels and keep it under 90, which is similar to other dryers. It's free. If your business has one, simply call them up (800-255-9235) and ask for the 1.1 Nozzle. It will add a tedious 2 to 3 seconds to the drying time but there's no charge and the dryers are easy to retrofit, said Gagnon.  “People like speed and effectiveness, but in noise-sensitive areas, we provide this solution,” said Gagnon. In the meantime, if you’re a frequent visitor to a public bathroom--or you work in one--bring your earplugs. Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations state that if you’re exposed to a sound level of 95 decibels for a continuous four-hour period, you might need ear protection. “While the dryers may be cost effective, they aren’t worth losing your hearing over,” said Wheaton audiologist Sheri Billings. (Update: These dryers seem to be getting some of you heated up; please try to refrain from making nasty comments.)

United Center hockey fans, listen up: That “Star Spangled Banner” before Stanley Cup Finals games will be a deafening experience. Literally. When the jacked-up crowd claps and screams over the national anthem — a Blackhawks tradition since 1985 — the sound level will reach at least 110 decibels, high enough to create hearing loss in less than a minute, said Wheaton audiologist Sheri Billing . A typical conversation occurs at 60 dB. That’s harmless. But listening to music on headphones at the standard volume — 100 dB — can cause permanent damage after just 15 minutes per day. Hannah Montana concerts, which feature shrieking teenagers, are on par with Blackhawks games and reach 110 dB, Billing said. Everyone is born with 35,000 to 40,000 outer hair cells in the ear, Billing said. When the microscopic, hair-shaped cells are damaged by loud noise, age, over the counter or prescription medications, it hampers our ability to hear. “The more (noise) exposure, the more outer hair cells get killed, the greater the loss,” said Billing. Billing is a big fan of ear plugs — she once passed them out at an ear-splitting Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus — but realizes hockey players aren’t likely to wear them. For fans, however, the small protectors might be a wise move. Once the cacophonous din peaks, it’s impossible to hear the person next to you anyway.

But new headphones for kids can help prevent some of the damage, Chicago Tribune technology reporter Eric Benderoff wrote. "If you want to share music with children, something I do with my Clash-loving 5-year-old son, be aware of the volume," wrote Benderoff. "A big concern with portable music is that people often listen too loudly with headphones, which is increasingly leading to hearing loss problems. "A company called iHearSafe created a line of headphones specifically for young, developing ears. The headphones cannot go louder than 85 decibels. "According to the Academy of Pediatrics and the National Campaign for Hearing Health, 85 dB is considered the threshold for dangerous levels of noise. Also, the length of time one listens to music is a concern, so children should not listen continuously for long stretches, no matter the volume level. "For several years, Apple has included software controls to limit the volume on iPods. But not all music players have such a feature, and with the iHearSafe headphones, parents don't need to do a thing but plug and play. "The headphones work with any device, such as a video-gaming console or portable DVD player, that has a standard headphone jack. The $25 headphones come in three styles: earbuds, ear clips and ear cup. "I liked the ear cups—referred to as headphones on the site—because they best fit my son. He preferred the ear clip style—they look cooler—but had trouble keeping them on his ears." Read the rest of his entry on his tech blog Eric 2.0.

When using personal listening devices, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association recommends turning the volume down, limiting listening time to an hour a day and taking frequent listening breaks. Here are more tips from ASHA and audiologist Dennis Burrows.

But the popular children's entertainer knows a blast of loud music isn't the only risk to a child's hearing. What parents and kids really need to watch is the everyday use of earbuds that come with iPods and other MP3 players, said Roberts, who has teamed up with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) to raise awareness about noise-induced hearing loss. Not only do earbuds send sound directly into the delicate ear canal, but they boost the volume by as much as 9 decibels. And because today's devices can hold and play music for longer periods, kids are wearing them more than the recommended hour a day, putting them at risk for permanent hearing loss after just five years, according to the ASHA.

But now research suggests that cranking your iPod at full volume for more than five minutes a day could increase your risk of hearing loss. To protect those delicate inner-ear hair cells, keep the music at 70 percent of full volume whether you’re listening to rock and roll, opera or the blues, according to the first detailed guidelines for safer iPod listening.
