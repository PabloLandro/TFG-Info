Using only top quality materials, each pair of Jobst Compression Stockings or Socks applies the correct, measured degree of graduated pressure that your legs require. Graduated pressure levels match the natural pressure levels that enable proper blood circulation. A greater degree of pressure is required at the lowest points of the legs, farthest from the heart, near the ankles. As the blood begins to flow upwards, lesser amounts of pressure are required near the knees. Jobst products maintain a constant, even degree of measured compression, ensuring that your legs will help maintain the correct circulation that your body requires for good health. Your physician or primary health care specialist can advise you which compression level is best for your particular needs. © 2011 DiscountSurgical.com All Rights Reserved Questions?
