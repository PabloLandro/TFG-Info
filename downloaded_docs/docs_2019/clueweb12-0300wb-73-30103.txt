School-based dental sealant programs generally provide sealants to children who are less likely than their higher-income counterparts to receive private oral health care, such as children who are enrolled in federal programs like FRPM or Medicaid or who are uninsured. In 2001, a systematic review conducted by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services found that school-based and school-linked dental sealant programs are effective in reducing dental caries. A number of variables (e.g., retention rate, length of study, caries risk of population) influence the extent to which sealants save money. ODH provides grants to school-based dental sealant programs that enable them to provide sealants to students (with parental consent) at no charge to parents in participating schools. Key elements of ODH’s approach are to make sure that programs use a community-based approach to dental caries prevention, target children at higher risk for dental caries, operate efficiently, ensure quality, and maximize the use of public funding.
