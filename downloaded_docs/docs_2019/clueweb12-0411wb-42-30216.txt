How Passive Smoking Can Effect The Health Of The People Around You Articles Member Login Article Marketing Profit From Writing! Content Notification Link to Us Home | Health | Alternative How Passive Smoking Can Effect The Health Of The People Around You Although most people are aware of the dangers of smoking, many smokers cannot seem to quit. They rationalize their addiction by saying that they are only hurting themselves when they smoke. However, smoking also influences the health of those who never smoke. Friends, children, family, co-workers, and even casual bystanders may suffer health problems from passive smoke. First off, what is passive smoke? You probably are familiar with the term "secondhand smoke" to define smoke inhaled by someone who is near a smoker. Secondhand smoke is a combination of smoke from a burning pipe, cigar, or cigarette, and exhaled smoke. It often contains greater amounts of harmful chemicals than inhaled smoke, for example, double the amount of nicotine and tar. This puts those exposed to secondhand smoke at a greater risk of smoking related illnesses and health issues. Research into passive smoking effects on health show increased risks of lung disease, heart disease, and various ailments for people continually exposed to secondhand smoke. Statistics on smoking show a relationship between secondhand smoke and cancer, with people exposed to secondhand smoke having an increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease. Sadly, it is not unusual for the nonsmoking child or spouse of a smoker to develop illnesses associated with smoking because of passive smoking. Passive smoking is especially bad for infants and children. Young children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk of respiratory infections and other respiratory illnesses. Children who have asthma are at an increased risk of having frequent attacks. Passive smoking is also responsible for raising a pregnant woman's risk of having a miscarriage or a premature baby. Due to the health effects of secondhand smoke, smoking has been banned in many public areas, such as restaurants and bars. Passive smoking can also be an issue in the workplace. Workers who breathe in secondhand smoke have an increased risk of illness and even have more absences from work. This has led many offices to ban smoking, and some areas have even passed legislation against smoking at work. Amongst workplaces with a ban on smoking, employers report increased productivity and fewer absences. Typically, most smokers begin seeking ways to stop smoking out of concern for the health of their family. There are many methods to stop smoking, and one of the fastest ways is through the use of a quit smoking hypnosis program. Hypnotherapy programs for quitting smoking are formulated specifically to help smokers stop smoking without going through withdrawal. They are particularly effective because they help smokers beat the mental aspect of the addiction, which is the most difficult aspect to beat. Self-hypnosis stop smoking programs are formulated to teach people hypnosis techniques to help stop smoking. One of the best things about such a program is the fact that smokers learn how to stop smoking without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Hypnotic techniques can diminish or even completely eliminate withdrawal symptoms commonly experienced using other methods of quitting smoking. Another great thing is that since people learn how to use hypnotherapy on themselves, they do not have to worry about relapsing. If they ever want to smoke, they just remember and practice the techniques that allowed them to quit. Hypnotherapy produces many effects to help people stop smoking. It is an excellent tool for eliminating tobacco cravings while also functioning as a relaxation aid to relieve tension. It also works as a tool for encouragement to completely eliminate the psychological addiction to smoking. This combination of effects gives hypnosis its effectiveness in helping people to stop smoking once and for all. The benefits of quitting smoking include better health for the quitting smoker as well as for family, co-workers, and friends. People who are looking to stop smoking for the sake of their families can turn to hypnosis for an effective and easy-to-use tool for quitting. Anyone can learn hypnosis techniques for quitting from a good teaching program, and stop smoking hypnosis has a high rate of effectiveness because it makes the process of quitting smoking easier and faster.
