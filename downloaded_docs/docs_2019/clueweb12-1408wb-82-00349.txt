Ginkgo Biloba - The medical benefits of Ginkgo Biloba extract rely on the Ginkgo flavone glycosides. The 24% designation indicates the carefully measured balance of bioflavonoids, which are primarily responsible for the herbs actions within the body. Medicinal use of Ginkgo can be traced back almost 5000 years in Chinese medicine. At that time it was recommended for respiratory tract ailments as well as for memory loss in the elderly. Current day use shows benefits for circulation inefficiency, prevention of free radical attack, and nervous system disorders such as anxiety. Although Ginkgo is best known for its ability to enhance the circulation to both the brain and the extremities of the body, its antioxidant properties cannot be underestimated. This activity in the brain and the central nervous system may aid with age related declines in the brain. Hundreds of scientific studies attest to the effectiveness of Ginkgo Biloba extract for the many problems associated with cerebral vascular insufficiency and impaired mental performance in elderly patients. One particular study on senior citizens measured their IQs before administering an 8 week course of Ginkgo and then again afterward. Their IQ scores were found to have increased by an average of 1015 points. In October 1997 the Journal of the American Medical Association published research showing that Ginkgo Biloba extract appears to slow the progression of age related mental conditions. The randomly assigned, double blind, placebo controlled study was performed for one year by Dr. Pierre LeBars and a team of scientists at the New York Institute for Medical Research. The study found that 27% of patients who took 120mg Ginkgo extract for 6 months or longer improved their mental functioning, including memory, reasoning, and the ability to learn, compared to only 14% of those taking placebo. The study began with 309 patients aged 45 or older and showed that Ginkgo will stabilise or even improve mental performance in one-third of patients. Bilberry acts as an excellent antioxidant and has the ability to enhance the flexibility of blood vessels; thus allowing increased blood flow. In addition, bilberry has shown to benefit eye health. It therefore may be considered for conditions such as night blindness and for the health of the macular region of the eye. Lecithin is an antioxidant nutrient helping to maintain healthy arteries, improve brain function, and aid in the absorption of thiamine by the liver and vitamin A by the intestines. It is a strong promoter of energy. Lecithin enables fats, such as cholesterol and other lipids to be dispersed in water and removed from the body, thus protecting vital organs and arteries from fatty accumulation.
