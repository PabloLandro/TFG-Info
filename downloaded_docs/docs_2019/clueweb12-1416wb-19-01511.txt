It travels down through the buttocks, and then down the back of the leg, or hamstring.  Many people who experience sciatica pain and symptoms get better within a few weeks or months and sometimes days, with simple non-surgical treatments.  But others feel symptoms and pain so intense that they are debilitated and unable to perform their daily activities. Sciatica sufferers unfortunately experience a wide range of symptoms.  The sciatic nerve runs through several muscles from the lower back and into the leg, causing a wide range of potential symptoms.  You may notice that you have pain on one side of your buttock or in one leg that is worse when sitting, or standing for long periods.  The sciatic nerve divides in two and runs down each leg at the tail bone, therefore symptoms are not always mirrored on both sides of the body.  Some sufferers feel a burning or tingling down one or both legs.  There can also be weakness, numbness, or difficulty moving a leg or foot.  Symptoms might also be as severe as sensing a constant pain on one side of the rear, or a sharp pain that may make it hard to stand up or walk. The term sciatica is not really a medical diagnosis.  It is a symptom of a basic problem in the lower back.  It could be a herniated disc, or spinal stenosis that is pressing on or irritating the sciatic nerve roots.  It is most important to understand the underlying diagnosis, rather than just dealing with the symptoms of sciatica, because the real cause of the symptoms will need to be treated in order to relieve sciatic nerve pain permantly. Even though sciatica most often occurs in people between the ages of thirty and fifty, it is often unrelated to a particular event or injury.  The sciatic pain tends to develop over time as a result of general wear and tear on the structures of the lower spine.  The clinical diagnosis of sciatica is usually referred to as a “radiculopathy.”  This simply means that a disc within the spine has protruded from its normal position in the vertebral column.  As a result of this, it is putting pressure on the nerve root (radicular nerve) in the lower back, which forms part of the sciatic nerve. Symptoms are most frequently reduced by exercising, to strengthen muscles within the back, abdomen and legs.  An easy way to do this is by regular walking.  Begin by walking slowly but surely and progress to walking up to three miles (2Kms) a day at a vigorous pace.  It is great for your lower back and is a pretty low-impact exercise that can provide strength and flexibility to muscles, and ultimately relieve sciatica pain.  Aerobic exercise is another great way to relieve your sciatica symptoms and pain.  It strengthens the muscles related to sciatica pain, plus it is great for overall body fitness . But watch out for any heavy impact, as this could make matters worse. The most important thing that you can do for sciatica relief is to seek the advice of a medical professional.  Your health professional will be able to give you the correct diagnosis for your pain and rule out any more serious problems.  The suitable treatments differ based on the condition that is causing the sciatic pain, so you should not try to self-treat your sciatica without consulting a health professional.
