Features: Convenient easy to swallow capsule Citrate, the most absorbable form of Magnesium Tri-Magnesium Citrate is otherwise known as magnesium citrate, magnesium citrate tribasic, or trimganesium dicitrate.

Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in over 300 enzyme systems. It supports bone formation by regulating the absorption of calcium and is an important mineral required for normal nerve and muscle function. Energy Production: The metabolism of carbohydrates and fats to produce energy requires numerous magnesium dependent chemical reactions. Magnesium is required by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesizing protein in mitochondria. ATP, the molecule that provides energy for almost all metabolic processes, exists primarily as a complex with magnesium (MgATP) Synthesis of essential molecules: Magnesium is required for a number of steps during nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis of carbohydrates and lipids require magnesium for their activity. Glutathione, an important antioxidant, requires magnesium for its synthesis. Structural roles: Magnesium plays a structural role in bone, cell membranes and chromosomes. Ion transport across cell membranes: Magnesium is required for the active transport of ios like potassium and calcium across cell membranes. Through its role in ion transport systems, magnesium affects the conduction of nerve impulses, muscle contraction and normal heart rhythm.
