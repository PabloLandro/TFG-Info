<20 lifetime partners were at significantly higher risk of 
		gonorrhoea than uncircumcised men with a similar number of lifetime 
		partners. It may be that more partners increases the diversity of the 
		subpreputial flora, thus offering some protection to the uncircumcised 
		male. [47]. Non-gonococcal urethritis Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is not prevented by circumcision and 
		may be more common in circumcised men (Table 3). Some of the studies 
		distinguished between chlamydia and NGU [15,26,31]. A significant 
		correlation between the foreskin and NGU has yet to be detected and a 
		negative correlation appears likely. Chlamydia is most commonly the 
		cause of NGU: the data suggest that circumcised men are at greater risk 
		of chlamydial infections. ♥ ♥ Genital ulcer disease Several of the HIV studies examining the role of circumcision have 
		also provided data on its role in the incidence of GUD (Table 4). The 
		findings have been inconsistent but suggest that uncircumcised men may 
		be at greater risk for GUD. Syphilis One of the difficulties in studying syphilis is its low prevalence. 
		Most of the recent studies have been unable to detect a statistically 
		significant difference because there are too few cases. Even the large 
		population survey by Laumann et al. could not detect a difference [31]. 
		The results by Kreiss and Hopkins [21] cannot be generalized to the 
		population at large because both circumcision and syphilis status were 
		obtained by history from a study population that only included men 
		engaging in homosexual activity. When the African data reported in a 
		study by Urassa et al. [32] are controlled for background 
		characteristics, including HIV status, no difference is detectable (OR 
		1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.27). Chancroid Circumcision was once proposed as a treatment for chancroid [48,49] 
		until antibiotics were shown to be effective [50]. Although it is 
		generally reported that chancroid is more common in uncircumcised males 
		[51-55], a review of the medical literature found no case-controlled 
		study to support this assertion, other than the study by Hand [7]. When 
		the proper control group is applied to Hand's data, an interesting 
		finding emerges. Chancroid is significantly more common in uncircumcised 
		white males, but significantly more common in circumcised black males. 
		In two studies from Singapore STD clinics, Malays, who are predominantly 
		Islamic, were less likely to have chanchroid, but in neither study was 
		the finding statistically significant., as there were too few Malays 
		[56,57]. In one of the studies, Indians were more likely to develop 
		chancroid than Chinese (OR 20.77, 95% CI 8.11-53.17). When Malays were 
		compared with Chinese, Malays had a higher incidence of chancroid (OR 
		3.12, 95% CI 0.81-12.08) [56]. In both studies, calculations were based 
		on assumptions of ethnic prevalence in the population and ethnic 
		associations with circumcision status. If chancroid is related to 
		circumcision status, Malays, who routinely circumcise, would be expected 
		to have a lower incidence of chancroid than the Chinese who do not. In an outbreak of chancroid in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the 
		community of Native Indians and Métis (mixed Indian and Caucasian) were 
		the focus of the outbreak, rather than Caucasians [52]. The published 
		evidence suggests that race and ethnicity are more likely to be a factor 
		in chancroid infection than circumcision status. This finding is 
		consistent with the recognized tendency of highly contagious STDs to 
		concentrate in 'core' populations [34] Herpes simplex The results for genital herpes have been inconsistent. Hand, without 
		providing data, reported that circumcision had no impact on the 
		incidence of genital herpes [7]. When Taylor and Rodin's data are 
		analysed by race, the significance of the foreskin for those originally 
		from the UK disappears [10]. Human papillomavirus and genital warts Much attention has been paid to human papillomavirus (HPV) since it 
		was linked with cervical and penile cancers [37,58] (Table 5). The 
		epidemiology of these cancers mimics that of STDs. Genital warts have 
		consistently been a significant risk factor for penile cancer [59,60]. 
		The role of circumcision in the prevention of penile cancer is 
		controversia, especially in light of a recent report from Seattle in 
		which 42% of men with penile cancer were circumcised [60]. In recent 
		studies, HPV-associated lesions are either equally common [15,23,27] or 
		more common in circumcised men. A larger cohort of circumcised men in 
		the USA is reaching the age at which penile cancer occurs. This has 
		resulted in more circumcised men with penile cancers than seen 
		previously [61,62]. How the higher risk of genital warts in circumcised 
		men will affect penile cancer has yet to be determined. The use of 
		condoms and screening men at risk for HPV infection using acetic acid 
		and colposcopy may be the best use of resources for preventing penile 
		and cervical cancers. [63,64]. ♥ ♥ Hepatitis In an Israeli study of the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen 
		in 9182 school children, the investigators speculated as to whether male 
		circumcision could be an important mode of infection, explaining both 
		the male predominance and the striking seasonal trend among boys that 
		their study revealed [65]. An Ethiopian study suggested that 
		circumcision may play a role in HBV transmission [66], but a Gambian 
		study failed to find an association [67]. Likewise, Donovan et al. [27] 
		and Laumann et al. found no difference in hepatitis between men with and 
		without a foreskin. STD prevalence Until recently, no studies have examined the impact of circumcision 
		on overall STD incidence. The data indicate that circumcised men may be 
		a higher risk for an STD (Table 5). This is consistent with trends seen 
		in the USA. As routine neonatal circumcision has been implemented, the 
		rate of STDs has increased rather fallen. Among first-world nations, the 
		USA has one of the highest rates of STDs. HIV infection and male 
		circumcision. In the report by Cook et al. [26] the average 
		uncircumcised man had 2.16 STDs diagnosed, while in the average 
		circumcised man it was 2.32; in an Australian study, there was no 
		difference (1.48 vs 1.44 STDs diagnosed per patient) [27]. HIV There have been 36 case-controlled studies published in peer-reviewed 
		journals addressing the relationship between the foreskin and HIV 
		infection; the results have been inconsistent. Several studies performed 
		in STD clinics have found the foreskin to be a risk factor 
		[17,18,21,25,29,30,68-72], while several random population surveys, 
		which do not have the population bias of an STD clinic study, have found 
		circumcised men to be at higher risk [32,73-75]. Several studies have 
		failed to detect a statistically significant difference between men with 
		and without a foreskin [31,76-87]. In several studies, when the 
		populations are controlled for GUD, number of sexual partners and other 
		factors, the results differ significantly from the raw data. The USA has 
		the highest incidence of HIV infection, as well as the highest incidence 
		of male circumcision amongst developed nations. This speaks against the 
		protective effect of circumcision [89]. The inconsistency of the results 
		and the number of confounding factors make it impossible to link the 
		foreskin to HIV infection [36,90]. Hill's criteria It is impossible to assert a causal relationship based on 
		retrospective data. Hill developed criteria for assessing whether a 
		strong case can be made for causality based on retrospective data [91]. Strength: If an association has a high OR, it weighs in favour of a 
		causal relationship. Few of the associations have had an OR of > 2.0. 
		Moreover, the studies that randomly accessed portions of the population 
		outside of STD clinics have found circumcised men to be at higher risk 
		for an STD [28,31,32]. Consistency: Results among studies have been very inconsistent: this 
		speaks against causality. Specificity: There are several confounding factors: circumcision is 
		not chose randomly [92]. Significant factors such as race, 
		socio-economic status, education level and number of partners are often 
		not controlled for in the published studies. In most studies where these 
		factors have been controlled for, the foreskin is not a significant 
		factor. For example, a US Army study of soldiers in Japan reported that 
		uncircumcised men were more likely to have a penile lesion than were 
		random controls (OR 22.78, 95% CI 6.00-86.29), but men with penile 
		lesions were more likely to be black (OR 15.00, 95% CI 3.12-72-07) or to 
		have had a previous STD (OR 4.41, 1.71-11.34) [93]. No attempt was made 
		to control for these significant factors. Temporality: Most males are circumcised before beginning sexual 
		activity. While some effort has been made to promote circumcision as an 
		HIV preventive in Africa [94], no studies of the effects of later 
		circumcision on disease prevention have been published. Biological gradient: One study of HIV found that circumcised men with 
		more residual foreskin were at higher risk of HIV-2 infection [77]. It 
		is difficult to make any conclusion from this one study. Biological plausibility: Moses et al. [95] suggested: (a) that minor 
		inflammatory conditions can occur underneath the foreskin, resulting in 
		mucosal discontinuity that may provide a portal of entry for viruses and 
		bacteria: (b) that the foreskin may be more susceptible to minor trauma 
		during intercourse: (c) that the warm, moist environment under the 
		foreskin may provides an environment conducive to prolonged survival of 
		pathogens; and (d) in the case of HIV, that Langerhans cells, plentiful 
		in the foreskin of male macaque monkeys, are highly susceptible to 
		simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [95]. While the warm moist environment under the prepuce allows for the 
		growth of all bacteria, including pathogens, the immunological 
		protection provided the subpreputial flora [96], secretory 
		immunoglobulins, and lytic secretions from the prostate, urethra, and 
		seminal vesicles [97] have not been adequately investigated. Undisturbed 
		preputial flora and mucosal immunological defences may protect the 
		uncircumcised male for infection [47]. The role of Langerhans cell in the transmission of HIV is unclear. 
		While they are present in the mucosal prepuce of monkeys [98] and adult 
		males [99], Weiss et al. were not able to detect their presence on the 
		inner surface of prepuces taken from newborns [100]. These cells 
		initiate the immune response to infectious agents. In the primate study 
		referred to by Moses et al. [95] it was Langerhans-like cells in the 
		lamina propria, and not in the epithelium, that appeared to be infected 
		with SIV [101]. It is unclear whether this observation can be 
		extrapolated to the Langerhans cells in the epithelium of the prepuce in 
		humans. Beaugé suggests that the loss of penile skin from circumcision 
		frequently results in tightened skin over the erect penis. This 
		increases friction during intercourse and increases the likelihood of 
		abrasions through which a pathogen can be introduced systemically, 
		making the circumcised penis more likely to contract an STD [101]. The 
		increased likelihood of circumcised men engaging in active anal sex [31] 
		may also increase a circumcised man's susceptibility to STDs. Coherence: Circumcision as a preventive measure for STDs needs to fit 
		into a coherent explanation that takes other know risk factors into 
		account. To date, the only theory proposed is the 'subpreputial space as 
		a cesspool' explanation provided by Weiss [103]. If the 'cesspool" 
		theory is extended to women, then one would expect that women, who have 
		significantly more genital mucosa, would have markedly more STD's than 
		men, whether circumcised or not; this is not the case [34]. Nearly all 
		of the associations between STDs and the foreskin can be explained on 
		the basis of racial, socio-economic, cultural, ethnic, and 
		healthcare-seeking behavioural differences. Studies controlling for 
		these factors have failed to confirm the efficacy of circumcision in 
		preventing STDs. Experimental evidence: There is none. Analogy: Is there another illness to which the foreskin makes a man 
		more susceptible? Can it be equated with the acquisition and 
		transmission of STDs? Lower urinary tract infections in infancy may be 
		associated with the foreskin, but showing analogy to STDs would be a 
		formidable task. Upper urinary tract infections in males are most often 
		related to anatomical anomalies in the male rather than the foreskin 
		[104], and unrelated to behaviour patterns. The aetiologies of these 
		maladies are so disparate that forming an analogy is impossible. Based 
		on the above criteria, a causal relationship between the foreskin and 
		STDs cannot be inferred. Discussion What began as speculation has resulted a century later in 60-75% of 
		American boys being circumcised with no clearly confirmed medical 
		benefit. In the interim, no solid epidemiological evidence has been 
		found to support the theory that circumcision prevents STDs or to 
		justify a policy of involuntary mass circumcision as a public health 
		measure. While the number of confounding factors and the inability to 
		perform a random, double-blind, propective trial make assessing the role 
		of circumcision in STD acquisition difficult, there is no clear evidence 
		that circumcision prevents STDs. The only consistent trend is that 
		uncircumcised males may be more susceptible to GUD, while circumcised 
		men are more prone to urethritis. Currently, in developed nations, 
		urethritis is more common than GUD [34]. In summary, the medical 
		literature does not support the theory that circumcision prevents STDs. References 1 Wiswell TE. 'Circumcision: foreskin fact, foreskin fiction'
