We Proudly Support... Weight Regain 20 Years After Surgery - Help! by Katherine (New Brunswick, Canada) At age 32, I had a stomach stapling done about 20 years ago, and went from 335lbs (5 foot 2) to 175lbs.  I got fit and healthy and life was great. In the next 10 years I went back to college and became an RN, had  a son at age 42!  But shortly after his birth I had a hysterectomy, and overnight it seemed I gained weight back, and had sore feet, knees, and crushing fatigue. I am now 52, and although I cannot eat like a normal person can, my stomach has stretched some and I feel I need a revision in order to function.  I can barely get through my part time shifts, and my knees hurt 24/7.  I have reflux, and my bra size is 42H. My cervical spine curves the opposite way due to the weight of my huge breasts. My plastic surgeon will not consider me for a reduction unless I get some weight off. I have health insurance through Blue Cross as well. I do not want to give up, I am a young 52 with a 10 year old boy who needs me. If anyone out there has any advice or thoughts for me, it would be appreciated!
