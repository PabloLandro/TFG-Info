Inside Out (Jan/Feb 2005) January/February 2005 Page 6 Have A Cough? Don't Take This For It!! If you have a persistent cough, the best bet may be Grandma's cure of hot tea with lemon and honey. The two active ingredients in most cough medicines actually do little to speed recovery, the BBC News Online report of new research from the Penn State Children's Hospital. In addition, nighttime coughs and sleep quality were no better with cough medicine, compared with a simple  non- medicated sugar syrup. The Penn State research team has gone so far as to actually wonder if over-the-counter cough medicine should be used at all. Mind you, they do no harm, but they also provide no medical benefit. Why spend the
money? The study : Led by Ian Paul, the team did a hear-to-head test of two of the main ingredients commonly found in cough medicines along with a dummy cough syrup that contained no medication. One hundred children who had a cough for an average of four days, which was caused by an upper respiratory tract infection, were divided into three groups. Each group received one of the following: * A syrup containing the active ingredient dextromethorphan * A syrup containing the active ingredient diphenhydramine * A dummy syrup containing no medication. The results: Neither of the two active ingredients appeared to be better than the simple syrup, reports the BBC. Dr. Paul said nighttime coughs get better with time - with or without medicine. "This study, however, questions whether over- the-counter medications have a place in the treatment of these illnesses for children," he told the BBC. Source: CompuServe News; S.
