This living fossil may have been saved from extinction by the Chinese who revered the tree and planted it around their temples. Traditional Chinese medicine prescribes ginkgo leaves for their ability to benefit the brain, and relieve the symptoms of asthma and coughs. Ginkgo leaf extracts are now among the leading prescription medicines in both Germany and France. Potential applications - General infectious conditions, influenza, colds, upper respiratory tract infections, urogenital infections, wound healing, abscesses, folliculitis, eczema, burns, varicose ulcers of the leg, arthritis. Evidence suggests that Echinacea may be used for supporting patients undergoing orthodox cancer treatments. See below for more information.

It stimulates greater tone in the venous system, thus aiding the dynamic clearing of toxic metabolites that accumulate during ischemia (times of insufficient oxygen supply).  Ginkgo is clearly implicated in conditions such as cerebral vascular insufficiency and impaired mental performance, giving rise to such symptoms as; short-term memory loss, vertigo, headache, tinnitus, lack of vigilance, and depression.  Research also reveals that ginkgo appears to be very effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (impotence) due to poor blood flow. MEMORY ENHANCEMENT - The memory enhancing effects of ginkgo are not limited to the elderly. In a double blind trial, the reaction time in healthy young women performing memory tests was significantly enhanced after the administration of ginkgo. NERVE FUNCTION - The membrane stabilising and free radical-scavenging effects of GBE are perhaps the most evident in the brain and nerve cells, as these have the highest levels of unsaturated fatty acids. ANTI-DEPRESSANT - Double blind studies have shown ginkgo to be helpful in improving general mood and behaviour.  This effect is most likely to benefit the elderly (particularly those not responding to medication) or for individuals with cerebral vascular insufficiency.  Ginkgo may offer significant benefit as an anti-depressant on its own, or in combination with standard drug therapy such as tricyclics and tetracyclics. ANTI-ALLERGIC - Ginkgo is known for its effects in inhibiting platelet-activating factor (PAF), a stimulator of platelet aggregation and degranulation. PAF is also involved in many inflammatory and allergic processes such as; increasing vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction including broncho-constriction, and reduction in coronary blood flow. SKIN PIGMENTATION - Recently, oxidative stress has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Ginkgo biloba extract has been shown to have antioxidant and immuno-modulatory properties. A recent study demonstrated significant cessation of active progression of depigmentation in patients treated with ginkgo. Ginkgo extract seems to be a simple, safe and fairly effective therapy for arresting the progression of the disease.
