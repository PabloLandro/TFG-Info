OrthoticsÂ can vary from simple arch supports to customised insoles. Our chartered physiotherapists will decide what best suits your needs after completing a full biomechanical assessment. We endeavour to ensure you get the maximum benefit from your insoles thereby reducing stress through joints and muscles and optimising function. Your orthotic evaluation will include; A detailed history Analysis of how your feet affectÂ posture and movement If recommended, a gait scan If required specific orthotics will be ordered Common conditions often treated by orthotics include; Pain in the ball of the foot Tired aching legs and feet Achilles tendon problems Shin splints Flat feet Lower back pain Rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis of knee, hip and ankle Knee joint pain Heel pain Bunions Â Following your evaluation, your prescription is sent to the laboratory and we receive your custom made orthotics back to our department within two weeks. You may collect your orthotics at your convenience. In some instances you may require a scheduled 30 minute appointment should your orthotics need to be further adapted to meet your needs. You are then advised to wean into your orthotics over a 4 - 6 week period. You will be asked to make a review appointment 4 weeks later with your physiotherapist. You may make this appointment when you pick up your orthotics from the department.
