Today, gastric bypass is generally performed using a technique called Roux-en-Y. This procedure reduces the size of the stomach to create a pouch that accepts no more than an ounce or so of food at a time. A small opening between the stomach and intestine allows food to travel directly to the large intestine. Gastric bypass surgery literally bypasses the bulk of the stomach and encourages massive weight loss in obese individuals. Advantages of Gastric Bypass Surgery Gastric bypass surgery enables individuals who have not responded to typical diet and exercise treatments to lose massive amounts of weight. In most cases, patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery are able to lose up to 80% of their excess body weight in one year. Because nearly 95% of weight related health problems, called co morbidities, include high blood pressure, diabetes, incontinence, and GeRD, many patients find that such conditions have also been alleviated or eradicated as a result of the surgery.
