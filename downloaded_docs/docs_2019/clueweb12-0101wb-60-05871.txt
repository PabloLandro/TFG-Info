        Method At present, the American Society for Bariatric Surgery (ASBS) and the 
        National Institutes of Health (NIH) consider roux-en-y gastric bypass 
        to be one of the safest and most effective bariatric treatments for the 
        treatment of morbid obesity. Not surprisingly it is one of the most frequently 
        performed weight loss procedures in North America. Some obese patients 
        may be eligible for laparoscopic roux-en-y bypass, which although a relatively 
        new bariatric procedure is considered to be even better. The Advantages of Open Roux-en-Y Surgery 
        Over Laparoscopic Method Traditional "open" bypass surgery is a more established procedure 
        with fewer "unknowns" in terms of side effects, complications 
        and health risks. Open bypass surgery is also quicker, which makes it 
        theoretically safer. Longer operations result in a fall in body temperature 
        that may interfere with the immune system, as well as a more extended 
        general anesthesia, which may cause additional health risks. Roux-en-Y Bypass Open Surgery Operation Open roux-en-y surgery is conducted under general anesthesia. The operation 
        typically lasts about 1-2 hours. Open surgery permits direct access and 
        viewing of the operation sites in the stomach and abdominal area through 
        the 6-10 inch midline incision in the abdomen. During the roux-en-Y bypass 
        procedure the stomach is transected using staples. A small proximal gastric 
        pouch (capacity 1 ounce) is created out of the upper-stomach, which is 
        permanently separated from the lower stomach. A section of the small intestine 
        is then connected to the pouch, diverting food flow. Finally, the bottom 
        of the stomach is connected to the base of the new roux digestive tract 
        or 'limb'. This permits digestive juices from the stomach and pancreas 
        to mingle with the food and enhance nutrient absorption. How Roux-en-Y Surgery Works This bypass procedure is both "restrictive", as the stomach 
        pouch restricts food intake, and "malabsorptive", as the changes 
        to the anatomy of the digestive tract reduces the absorption of calories 
        and nutrients. See also: Roux-en-Y Bypass Explained Laparascope-Assisted

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
