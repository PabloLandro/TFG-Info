Asthma Relief Home Know About Asthma Medications January 31, 2011  by admin · Leave a Comment Filed under: Astma Relief , Health Flunisolide is used to help prevent asthma symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath. For those who must take corticosteroids by mouth to control their asthma, flunisolide can be used to help decrease the dose of the medication that must be taken by mouth. This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as corticosteroids. It works to make breathing easier by reducing the swelling of the airways in the lungs, and decreasing phlegm and other asthma symptoms. Corticosteroids help decrease the frequency of your attacks and reduce the need for other medications you may use to control your symptoms. Because inhaled corticosteroids control most forms of asthma by delivering medication directly to your airways, they have a low risk of side effects. When used as directed, inhaled corticosteroids can minimize your need for oral corticosteroids, which have a higher risk of side effects. Inhaled corticosteroids include fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), triamcinolone (Azmacort), flunisolide (Aerobid) and beclomethasone (Qvar). Advair Diskus is a combination inhaler containing fluticasone and salmeterol. Asthma is a chronic, or long-term, disease. If you have asthma, at times your airways (the air passages of your lungs) become inflamed .When this happens, your airways get red and swollen. They become narrow, making it harder for you to breathe. You may also wheeze or cough. This is called an asthma flare-up (or “attack”). Even when you feel good, your airways can be inflamed. Certain things, such as smoke or dust, can start or trigger an asthma attack. Anti-inflammatory drugs. This is the most important type of therapy for most people with asthma because these asthma medications prevent asthma attacks on an ongoing basis. Steroids, also called “corticosteroids,” are an important type of anti-inflammatory medication for people suffering from asthma. These asthma medications reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. As a result, airways are less sensitive and less likely to react to triggers. Anti-inflammatory medications are recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) expert panel for children with mild persistent, moderate and severe asthma as the cornerstone for daily routine medical management. This panel recommends that one of these medications be given daily to control airway inflammation. They are considered safe and effective for long-term use. Anti-inflammatory drugs are being used to counter the inflammation in the lungs and bronchial airways. These drugs are very effective in reducing the inflammations and for smooth passage of air through the airways to lungs. Usually these are given as preventive medicine in many patients to make sure that Asthmatic attacks do not occur. Steroids are one types of drugs which is highly effective in making the airways less sensitive to allergies and hence reducing the chances of inflammatory swelling of airways. Relievers – usually in blue/grey delivery devices. They provide immediate relief from asthma symptoms by relaxing the muscles around the airways. If you need to use reliever medication more than three or four times a week (except for controlling exercise-induced asthma), you should speak to your doctor, as this may indicate your asthma is not well controlled. This is the only medication to use in an asthma attack.

January 21, 2011  by admin · Leave a Comment Filed under: Astma Relief , Health Asthma kills thousand every year. Millions of people are severely plagued by this dreaded chronic illness every day of their lives. Doctors around the world, have no idea how to prevent this disease, and its cause has remained one of medicine’s modern mysteries. No one knows for sure how a person contracts asthma. There are logical guesses given the scientific information that medical professionals are working with, but there is no actual set doctrine of how asthma develops or whom if affects. However, what they do know is that once you get asthma your lungs will begin to react to things that will cause an asthma attack. For example if you are suffering from asthma, you might get an asthma attack when you get a cold or you might have an attack when you breathe in something that irritates your lungs, such as cigarette smoke, pollen or even dust. When an asthma attack occurs, there are three things that can happen to your lungs: 1. The cells in your air tubes are producing much more mucus that normal and this particular production of mucus is sticky and thick and it will clog up the tubes making it difficult to breathe. 2. The skin in your air tubes begin to swell. 3. The muscles in your air tubes constrict and prevent you from breathing easily. An Asthma attack can be sudden or it may take a long time to develop. An attack is measured simply by sever, moderate or mild. A Severe Asthma Attack When a person suffers from a sever asthma attack the first thing you need to do is call 911, get medical emergency help immediately because a person can die from a sever asthma attack. With that said when a person is having a severe attack they become breathless, they may have trouble talking and their neck muscles may become tight. Their lips and fingernails might have a grayish or bluish color and the skin around the ribs and/or chest may be sucked in. This type of severity mostly occurs in children. Mild Attacks The mild asthma attack is more common than a severe. During a mild attack a person may feel tightness in their chest, they might start to cough and/or spit up thick mucus. At night a person might feel restless or have trouble sleeping, they might make a wheezing or whistling sound while sleeping which means they are trying to breathe in and out through narrowing air tubes. If you feel you are suffering from a mild asthma attack you should take your medication. This will usually resolve a mild attack as the medication will open up the air passages, making it easier to breathe. Your lungs are not who you are? When an asthma attack comes, short of breath, tightness in the chest, can’t breathe, and very hard to focus on anything else. But in actual reality, all your organs, brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, glands are connected. Disharmony creates the imbalances that lead to illness. My question for you: are you living in harmony with your body and environment? There are more free articles relating to asthma at my site. Therefore, I strongly urged you to start your journey and start taking a look at my site and to get your asthma treated as soon as possible, if you are serious of getting back your asthma free life again.

Inflamed airways usually cause muscles in the area to tighten, so breathing becomes difficult and wheezing is produced while breathing. Wheezing is usually the first asthma symptom that parents notice when their children are having flare-ups or asthma attacks. The hissing sound is usually more prominent during exhalation, but in some cases it can also occur during inhalation. It is quite important for people who have asthma to bring their medication, especially quick relief drugs, wherever they go because attacks can manifest slowly (taking hours or even days) or suddenly. Another asthma symptom that should alert you of an impending attack is breathlessness. It is important for parents to regularly check on their kids who have asthma because shortness of breath is more common in asthma sufferers that have narrow airways. Another asthma symptom that is quite common is chest tightness. Some adults who are also suffering from hypertension and other cardiac-related diseases might want to be more careful with chest tightening because they might think that they are only having an asthma attack but in reality they might already be experiencing a heart attack. Coughing is also a common asthma symptom as well as having difficulty speaking. However, these symptoms are also common in other diseases. Adults who have asthma since childhood usually know whenever they are already suffering from an asthma attack. Through years of suffering from this chronic disease, lifelong sufferers can sense whenever they are experiencing any flare-up. The case with children is quite different. Small children cannot really understand that what they are experiencing is already an asthma symptom. Thus, it is worth mentioning that parents, guardians, and caregivers of both young children and adults who have asthma should be a little more observant of the people they care for. Another important aspect that you need to look into is the severity of an asthma symptom. You can characterize an asthma attack as mild intermittent, which means that asthma flare-ups are limited to twice a week, while nighttime attacks just twice a month. Mild persistent asthma means that symptoms are not severe but the attacks happen quite often. Moderate persistent brings about asthma flare-ups every day. And severe persistent is a type of asthma that severely attacks during the day and even at nights. Usually people with a severe persistent asthma symptom can no longer perform their everyday activities because of their condition.

These are just some of asthma symptoms. An asthma attack is due to the swelling of the membranes lining the airways of your lungs, and thus resulting in constriction and inflammation of the bronchioles. In addition, the increased production of phlegm further aggravates the obstruction of airflow. An asthma attack is often triggered by the following: 1. vigorous physical activities in cold, dry air condition 2. house-dust mites, mold, pollen, and tobacco smoke 3. particles of fur from animals 4. environmental pollutants 5. deficiency of vitamins, such as vitamin C and B6 vitamin, magnesium, and essential fatty acids 6. food allergies, such as dairy products, seafood, wheat, nuts, and food additives 7. psychological stress, such as anxiety 8. repressed emotions Conventional asthma treatment includes using bronchodilators, such as an asthma inhaler of steroids, to open constricted airways. However, they are chemicals and may have long-term side effects on your health. There are alternative treatments of asthma attacks. Asthma is all about breathing. First and foremost, to overcome an asthma attack, you must breathe right. Rapid, short breaths are not conducive to healthy breathing. To breathe right to overcome an asthma attack, practice abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing. That is to say, use your abdomen or diaphragm to breathe in and out in order to increase your lung capacity for optimal breathing. Regular exercise not only strengthens your heart but also your lung muscles, thereby instrumental in enhancing your breathing. Oriental exercises, such as Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong, are excellent for avoiding or overcoming an asthma attack, because these ancient exercises focus on techniques of breathing and stretching with slow movements to promote better circulation and greater flexibility. In addition, these exercises remove stress, which may trigger an asthma attack. Given that stress may trigger an asthma attack, meditation is another strategy to avoid or overcome an asthma attack. Meditation relaxes not only your mind but also your body, especially your musculoskeletal system. Remember, pain creates muscle tension, which in turn aggravates your pain, and thus creating a vicious cycle. Hypnotherapy is another natural way of relaxing and coping with the unpleasant sensations experienced during an asthma attack. Instilling positive suggestions into your subconscious mind may help you relieve asthma symptoms and reduce the need for additional asthma medication. Diet may play a critical role in preventing an asthma attack in terms of nutritional deficiencies and food sensitivities. Always eat natural foods, instead of their processed counterparts, to get the best nutrients as well as to avoid the overload of toxins, which may cause inflammation of airways in the lungs. Exclusion diets are the most effective way of detecting a food sensitivity. Acupuncture is another natural therapy for asthma treatment by using needles to unblock arteries and life channels to maintain a steady flow of nutrients, oxygen, and life energy throughout your body, in particular in your respiratory system. Asthma can be cured naturally without relying on asthma medication.

As the third  largest health profession, behind medicine and dentistry, chiropractic care  for low back pains became common. With  their license, practitioners in the field are reliable enough given the  education and training they obtained. My Chiropractor has been taking care of me for ages now and without his  help, I would not be able to function properly nor write this blog post without  pain. So, if you even need chiropractic care, do your research because getting  a good chiropractor may just be your saving grace too. The Unexpected Benefits of a Good Colon Cleanse! Why are so many people  looking for the perfect colon cleanse? Given all of our unhealthy diets and  unhealthy lifestyles, colon cleansing is a great way to regulate and improve  the function of the colon. A regular colon cleanse is also helpful in  preventing constipation. A good colon cleanser, coupled with a healthy diet  rich in fibers gets rid of undigested waste as well as the hardened fecal mater  that is blocking the passageway of the colon. Waste has no problem passing  through the intestinal organs, preventing constipation . There are many benefits associated with colon  cleansers, but perhaps one that people do not expect is the significant weight  loss that may come with it. The average colon weighs at about 4 pounds, but it  has the amazing ability to store up to 30 pounds of fecal matter. Once the  colon is rid of this, it is only natural for a person's weight to go down too!
