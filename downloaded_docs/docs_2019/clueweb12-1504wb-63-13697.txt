The best way of curing Plantar fasciitis 5/17/2011 Reviewed by: brian from Texas. The best way of curing Plantar fasciitis is to do stretches. Insoles may help, but for quickest relief, keep one foot back, your leg straight, and lean against a wall. Repeat with the other leg. It's best to stretch more than one time per day. This was advice from my doctor and it worked, though it took several days to cure it. Correctional Officer 5/11/2011 Reviewed by: REHass from South Georgia. I walk on concrete all day and my heels would hurt so bad I couldn't hardly walk the next day. I had a coworker tell me about Superfeet. I bought 2 green pairs and love them. To some of the negative reviews. Your feet didn't get in their condition overnight so don't expect Superfeet to fix your feet over night. Give Superfeet time to adjust like the directions read. good and bad. 4/20/2011 Reviewed by: patrick from NH . I recently had some sort of stress fracture on the top of my right foot. It was due to the inner side of my foot collapsing down because of my high arches.These inserts REALLY made a positive difference in the support and eliminated the problem. Although my left foot which has considerably more strength support wise is taking a beating from the arch support. They are uncomfortable on my good foot and give me major blister. Hopefully I will acclimate to them. No good for long distance running 4/7/2011 Reviewed by: Veronica Acosta from Manassas, VA. I have high arches and a history of plantar faciitis so I was really excited to get these insoles. I ran a 10 miler with them on and to my dissapointment the really hurt my feel after mile 5 and my knee started hurting so bad I couldn't run anymore so I had to speed walk the rest of the race.

They are great for walking or short runs but I would not reccomend for long runs. semi-retired 2/8/2011 Reviewed by: Susan from St. Louis, MO.

I'll keep buying as long as they are making them. Hard not soft 11/8/2010 Reviewed by: Susie from Olympia, WA. I was suprised to find these insoles are so hard when you stand on them.  With my plantar fasciitis, they are better than not having them.  They work really well in my every-day casual shoes--my feet do well with them for that.  They don't work for standing on concrete, which I have to do when I work.  And they don't work well for long walks.  But I will keep them in my every-day shoes, where they have been helpful.
