The spasms and pain are often due to illnesses like arthritis, or injuries. Most muscle relaxers do have some addictive potential, and are therefore monitored by the federal government. Like any medications, some people do experience allergic reaction or adverse side effects associated with their drug treatment. Muscle Relaxers give you a sense of relaxation that makes the pain subside. They are prescribed for degenerative diseases such as arthritis or injuries to the muscle. Muscle relaxer medication is usually prescribed along with physical therapy to help the muscle heal. Some of the popular prescribed muscle relaxers are Carisoprodol, diazepam and cyclobenzaprine. Types of Muscle Relaxers — Soma • Soma is a prescription muscle relaxer chemically comprised of carisoprodol, according to MedlinePlus. Most patients take the pills three to four times a day and can ingest the medication with or without food. Those who are pregnant or nursing should avoid the drug, and it may affect one’s ability to drive. Possible side effects associated with Soma include rapid heartbeat, dizziness, drowsiness, upset stomach, and vomiting. Valium • Valium is a prescription sedative that is used as a muscle relaxer, according to MedlinePlus. It also helps reduce anxiety and sleeping problems. The medication is comprised of the benzodiazepine diazepam, and is available in both pill and liquid form. Those who smoke cigarettes may have decreased Valium benefits. Possible side effects include a shuffling walk, changes in sex drive and/or appetite, dizziness, dry mouth, diarrhea, and upset stomach. Skelaxin • Skelaxin is a prescription muscle relaxer chemically comprised of metaxalone, according to MedlinePlus. Most patients take the pills three or four times a day. Those with liver or heart disease may be advised to avoid Skelaxin. Possible side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, upset stomach, vomiting, headache, and nervousness. Yellow skin, unusual bleeding or bruising, and seizures resulting from Skelaxin are considered medical emergencies. Flexeril • Flexeril is a prescription muscle relaxer chemically comprised of cyclobenzaprine, according to MedlinePlus. Most patients take the pills two to four times a day. Those with heart disease, glaucoma, problems urinating, or an overactive thyroid gland may be advised to avoid Flexeril. Possible side effects are dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and upset stomach. Serious side effects that require emergency medical help are chest pain, fever, irregular heart rate, and seizures. Muscle pain is the only thing that muscle relaxers treat. They are not meant for any other kind of pain. In spite of the side effects of muscle relaxants they can be very helpful in getting rid of some of your muscle pain.
