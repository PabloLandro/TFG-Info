          September 30, 2010 at 3:41 pm Help for Procrastination with Hypnotherapy Now many of us may confess to be experts on procrastination. We know exactly how to put things off and leave our troubles behind. Watch TV. Have a coffee or snack. Ring up a friend. Play a computer game or read every email. Do a bit of research or internet surfing. Or are we just good at keeping those things ahead of us or hanging over us? When we look at the definition of the word  Procrastination it means the act or habit of putting something off.  (Latin  pro- onward  and crastinus – tomorrow) So what exactly is Procrastination ? Or what exactly are we doing when we procrastinate?  And why do we do it? Is it in your nature or part of your personality? It is about putting something off that we know should be done now and yet by doing that it can affect the way we feel, the way we look and the way we project ourselves and our confidence levels. It will even affect our social lives because it will make us feel guilty if things are still not done. Or give us an excuse for not going out, or attending a meeting or a function or inviting people to our homes. If we are not well prepared or organized we  have less inclination to engage with others. Procrastination is a habit and an association just as compulsive drinking, eating  or smoking is a habit and association. Each person knows that they have a problem to address yet they will often delude themselves that it is under control and they can deal with it at any time or when they feel ready.  In the meantime, the problem escalates and gets bigger and bigger. In the same way that people smoke, drink and overeat, people procrastinate to give themselves comfort to help them relax or to give them a break. It is possible that procrastination might start unwittingly when a person is under a huge amount of stress or going through a life-changing event like illness bereavement or divorce.  In relation to what is going on in their lives, certain tasks or duties seem trivial, compared with what they or their loves ones are going through.  They may often give themselves permission to let things slip.  Other people would probably give them full permission to let things slide also. Nevertheless, those jobs tasks do need to be addressed at some point in the future. We are now under a huge amount of pressure to appear successful in everything we do.  Some people do not necessarily want success but they will load themselves with unwanted pressure until they cannot cope. A typical procrastinator will look for distractions from the tasks he/she should be dealing with and take on more and more or other peoples responsibilities. In an age and society with less restrictions and boundaries and discipline it is so easy to let things slide.  If we think of the word ‘order’ in the context of a Religious Order  it refers to the way in which those people conduct their lives. They live by rules – a wholesome life  in a clean and tidy environment and they are productive. So when we think about what causes procrastination there are several aspects of our lives we need to address.  Our physical state – are we tired, stressed, depressed, anxious. All these things will affect our ability to get things done. Do we take enough exercise, eat well? It is known that about 85% of people suffering with fatigue do not take enough exercise.  We all need to review our diets from time to time .  Are we drinking too much coffee, tea, alcohol  diet coke?  Are we eating too much sugar and fat?. Have we had our sight and hearing checked. If we are not feeling good physically it will definitely affect our ability to get things done. Even our size or shape will hamper us. Are we too small, weak or too big, fat to be able to carry out the task. Do we need physical help? Attitude and Achievement We also need to look at our attitude. What are we trying to achieve? What do we want to achieve?  Do we avoid opening the mail because of fear of bills or our inability to pay? Do we have a fear of failure or a fear of success or a fear of being found out? Many people will have cognitive blocks in their approach to their work or responsibilities. They may have a lack of confidence in themselves or feel they lack knowledge or understanding of how to complete a task.  They may think they cannot do a job until everything is at hand and find it easy to blame others for not playing their part.  Or simply they may just not be interested in what they are doing or have any desire to complete the task. Now the Chinese they like order and books on Feng Shui will talk of calm relaxed environments that create balance and bring prosperity.  We know that a poorly laid out office with bad lighting and badly arranged layout and equipment will slow us down. Clear the clutter and we feel so much better, freer and clearer in our thinking and our productivity. The other element that affects us all is communication and stimulation. We have all heard tell of high flyers who left their jobs to go self-employed and work from home. Two weeks later they would still be in their pyjamas at lunchtime. It is as if they had lost their way or sense of urgency. Most of us need routines, boundaries, interaction and in some cases competition. Hypnotherapy and Procrastination As a hypnotherapist I see many clients who feel they are underachieving or unfulfilled. One of the first areas of the life I would help them address is overall health and quality sleep. Then by getting them to set goals and work towards them they gain confidence and self-belief very quickly and find they can do more and more. The subconscious mind likes specifics so I help my clients look at the goals, what needs to be done, what must be done and then I ask them to break the projects into smaller more manageable tasks.( The sum of the parts). Often a task or project can seem insurmountable but by dividing and conquering it is soon overcome. _____________________________________________________________________ Sue Turner DCH DHP MNCH(Reg) Candela Clinical Hypnosis                           The Don Ely clinic 19 Reading Road                                      No 1 Harley Street Henley on Thames                                     London RG9 1AB                                      W1G 9QD Tel: 01491 410857    Mobile: 07702939020 www.candela-hypnosis.co.uk candelahypnosis@aol.com Incoming search terms for the article: hypnotherapy procrastination free hypnotherapy for procrastination procrastination support groups birmingham procrastination oxfordshire procrastination hypnotherapy hypnotherapy procrastination procrastination therapy uk procrastination hypnotherapy london procrastination help winchester procrastination help manchester procrastination help hypnotherapy suffolk procrastination help docklands procrastination group birmingham UK procrastination hypnotherapy online vacancies for hypnotherapist Oxfordshire therapy procrastination glasgow sue turner hypnotherapist reviews sue turner hypnotherapist review sue turner hypnosis reviews sue turner and hypnosis testimonials sue mobile procrastination uk help procrastination therapy scotland procrastination therapist uk procrastination support london nhs procrastination groups london londion hypnotist procrastination wolverhampton hypnosis for love addiction uk nottingham hypno therapy online reviews procrastination help with procrastination nottingham help for procrastination london case study procrastination hypnotherapy can hypnotherapy cure procrastination can hypnosis cure procrastination bromley hypnotherapy to break from love addiction bromley hypnotherapy for love addiction hypnosis for study procrastination hypnosis procrastination london hypnosis procratination london hypnotist in soho hypnotise procrastination london hypnotherapy procrastination west yorkshire hypnotherapy procrastination bristol hypnotherapy london procrastination hypnotherapy and procrastination hypnotherapist reviews hypnotherapist nottingham nuneaton hypnosis to cure procrastination best hypnotist for procrastination in London Filed Under: Procrastination Tagged with end Procrastination , Procrastination coaching , Procrastination help , Procrastination henley , Procrastination hypnosis , Procrastination hypnotherapists , Procrastination hypnotherapy , Procrastination londion , Procrastination oxfordshire , Procrastination treatment Digg it Save to Del.icio.us Subscribe to My RSS feed Add this to: Do You Have Something To Say?
