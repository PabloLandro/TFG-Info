Not enough to cause gastric problems, but about 400-500 mg/day at least to try.  The better route to take is with high-magnesium foods. Like one pumkin seed being one milligram of Magnesium. Also, long soaking baths in Epsom Salts, with a full cup of it. Big Lots often has it for less than 3 dollars a box. That being said, I'm going to tell you a story, about one single muscle, the Sternocleidomastoid. Simple neck muscle, goes from behind the ear down to the collarbone and sternum. But when it gets tight, it can cause all kinds of problems. And if you haven't already learned the special stretch for it, you need to. Yesterday. First site shows its location, and a short list of some of the problems, such as at the eyes, that it can cause if it is in spasm. Second site tells about Sternocleidomastoid Syndrome, which I believe you have, along with other issues and symptom-sets. Read the article well, look up any words you don't recognize. Some of the things are stuff you may have encountered earlier. Finally, what to do about it? The special stretch for it is shown in a video, and if you have any difficulty doing it, you know you are getting closer to at least one of your issues. Oh, and regarding your hydration. I suggest sports drinks diluted half/half. Good fluid levels, good electrolytes. Including small amounts of Magnesium.
