<0.001). On a scale of 0 to 100, maternal mean
satisfaction score = 97.2 (range 50 to 100). Of 93 mothers responding, 92 said
they would circumcise another son in the future. All babies completed 6-week
follow-up. No major adverse events were observed. There were no infections; 5
cases of minor bleeding occurred (all in Mogen arm, resolved with brief local
pressure). In no case was too much skin removed; in 16 cases too little skin
was removed (15 Mogen). In 2 cases the Plastibell migrated proximal to the
corona and had to be removed by study staff. Conclusions: We observed high maternal acceptability
and satisfaction with neonatal male circumcision, suggesting that it will be
acceptable and feasible as part of public HIV prevention efforts in Botswana. Although in this study setting we observed no major adverse events, a retained
Plastibell could result in serious injury if not removed in time. Safe and
sustainable delivery of neonatal male circumcision in resource-limited settings
will also require addressing issues of s
