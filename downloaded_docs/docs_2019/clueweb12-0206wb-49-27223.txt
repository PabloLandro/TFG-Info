              Kshirsagar. Other Cases Carbamazepine and Open Neural Tube Defect- a case of anti-epileptic 
          drug induced teratogenecity Case report: A 25 year old female patient G3 P2 A1 L1with a history of epilepsy 
          of 3 years duration presented to Therapeutic Drug Monitoring OPD of 
          KEM hospital for estimation of serum carbamazepine (CBZ) levels. Patient 
          was diagnosed as a case of neurocysticercosis in December 2001 and was 
          taking CBZ in the dose of 200 mg thrice daily since then. While on therapy 
          the patient conceived in the month of November 2003. During pregnancy, 
          CBZ was advised in the same dose after weighing the risk and benefits 
          of antiepileptic therapy along with 5mg of folic acid per day and patient 
          was informed about the risks. The patient did not follow up subsequently and directly presented at 
          the 8 months of gestation. Ultrasonography done at that time showed 
          the fetus to have Arnold Chiari malformation. The patient delivered 
          a male child on 23/09/04 by lower segment cesarean section (LSCS). The 
          newborn weighed 2.45 kg with Total Length (TL) of 49cm and Head Circumference 
          (HC) of 32 cm. On examination, child was noted to have a 4cm x 4 cm 
          open neural tube defect in lumbar region with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
          leak and bowel bladder incontinence. There was no associated craniofacial 
          or finger nail malformation. In the mother, prenatal serum CBZ (9.24 mg/ml) and CBZ epoxide (2.53) 
          levels were within therapeutic range. (The therapeutic range of CBZ 
          being 4 mg/ml to 12 mg/ml.) After 15 days of delivery serum CBZ levels 
          for mother were 15.24 mg/ml and CBZ epoxide levels were 2.62 mg/ml while 
          for the child CBZ levels were 1.93 mg/ml and CBZ epoxide was not measurable. 
          Parents refused neurosurgical intervention in view of guarded prognosis 
          and patient was discharged home on 17/09/04. Eight years prior the patient had delivered a female child, when she 
          was not on CBZ therapy and the child was born without any congenital 
          anomalies. Discussion Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an iminostilbene derivative chemically related 
          to tricyclic antidepressants. CBZ is used as an antiepileptic in treatment 
          of generalized tonic clonic seizures as well as simple and complex partial 
          seizures. It is also used for patients with manic-depressive illness, 
          postherpetic and trigeminal neuralgia and phantom limb pain ( 1 ). Infants of epileptic mothers are at two-fold greater risk of major congenital 
          malformations than offsprings of nonepileptic mothers that is 4% to 
          8% compared to 2% to 4%. These malformations include congenital heart 
          defects, open neural tube defects, craniofacial abnormalities and others. Common teratogenic effects of CBZ include small head circumference, 
          finger and toe nail hypoplasia, craniofacial defects, mild mental retardation 
          and developmental delay ( 2 ). Incidence 
          of Neural tube defect in general population is 0.1% where as exposure 
          to CBZ in utero without concurrent exposure to valproic acid carries 
          1% risk of neural tube defect (10 times that of general population) 
          ( 3 ). Causal role for anticonvulsants in congenital malformations is suggested 
          by association of congenital defects with higher concentration of the 
          drug or polytherapy as compared to monotherapy ( 1 ) 
          One possible factor is decreased activity of the enzyme epoxide hydrolase 
          with resulting increased concentration of CBZ epoxide, which may be 
          teratogenic ( 4 ) . 
          Also in pregnancy, metabolism of carbamazepine is increased so that 
          increased epoxide metabolites are generated and these epoxide radicals 
          are known to be teratogenic. Lymphocyte toxicity test is done to evaluate 
          the epoxide hydrolase status of the patient. However this test could 
          not be performed in the patient. During pregnancy, risks and benefits of antiepileptic therapy should 
          be weighed carefully as discontinuation of treatment itself may pose 
          risk to mother as well as fetus. Current guidelines suggest use of a 
          single antiepileptic drug with the lowest effective dose and frequent 
          monitoring of serum levels. The incidence of teratogenicity with Primidone 
          is highest (14.3 %) followed by valproate (11.1%), phenytoin (9.1%), 
          carbamazepine (5.7%) and phenobarbital (5.1%) ( 5 ) . Adequate prepregnancy councelling is essential for women who have epilepsy. 
          Women who become pregnant should be advised of the availability of noninvasive 
          screening tests and invasive diagnostic tests for congenital birth defects 
          (including NTDs). Procedures for prenatal diagnosis include: (i) assessment 
          of serum markers such as maternal serum alpha-foetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase 
          activity at 15 to 20 weeks; (ii) prenatal Ultrasonography at 16 to 20 
          weeks; and (iii) amniocentesis after 15 weeks of pregnancy if a positive 
          screening test is present. The levels of these two serum markers are 
          increased in neural tube defects and a value of more than two multiples 
          of the median is considered significant. Detailed counseling of the 
          couple needs to be an integral part of the prenatal screening programme 
          ( 6 , 7 ) Women in intermediate- to high-risk categories for NTDs (NTD-affected 
          previous pregnancy, family history, insulin-dependent diabetes, epilepsy 
          treatment with valproic acid or carbamazepine) should be advised high-dose 
          folic acid (4.0 mg-5.0 mg daily) supplementation. This should be taken 
          as folic acid alone, not in a multivitamin format, due to risk of excessive 
          intake of other vitamins such as vitamin A ( 8 ) References 1. Mcnamara J D. Drugs effective in treatment of epilepsies.
