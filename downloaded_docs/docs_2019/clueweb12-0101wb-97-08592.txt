There are numerous arguments why regular exercise is especially important during a woman’s menopause and below are some of the top reasons: Heart disease. Menopause has been reported to exacerbate the probability of being afflicted with coronary heart disease ; however if the cardiovascular system is strengthened with regular physical activity , then the risk is significantly decreased. Physical training also promotes the health of our blood vessels so that good circulation is sustained and symptoms during menopause, such as chronic exhaustion and enervation will cease. Porous Bones or Osteoporosis.  Even though working out cannot fully block the advent of osteoporosis, it can diminish the rate in which bone density is lost, hence the condition advances at a much slower rate. It can also produce more hardy and tough ligaments, bones and tendons so that strains and breakages do not ensue quite so often. Natural hormone replacement therapy is also believed to protect against osteoporosis and is worthy of hashing out with your physician. Depressive Disorder. This is a common sign of the onset of menopause. And exercise has been proven to clear depression in many women. This is because exercise galvanizes the brain to release endorphins, which are referred to as the ‘natural high’ producing hormones for they produce a feeling of liveliness. Minor depressive disorders generated by the uncertainties of this natural condition can often be assuaged by performing some kind of exercise. Overall Feeling of Satisfaction.  Working out is great for making you feel fitter and healthier, even if you only exercise a few times each week. Plus if you are feeling more contented about yourself, then you will not be so caught up with symptoms of perimenopause . What type of exercise regimen you should do is a personal choice. However, you should aim to include a variety of aerobic routines and muscle building workouts. Cardio Training Program. This category includes any form of physical exercise that makes the speed of your heartbeat and your breathing rate to rise. Some examples of these exercises are brisk walking or aero-walking, jogging, running, swimming, biking or vigorous dancing. It also includes activities such as doing chores in the house, gardening activities, chasing after your puppy or the children and even vigorous lovemaking. In fact, whatever activity you do which causes your heart to pump faster can be described as an aerobic activity and thus it is beneficial for you. It is essential not to over-exercise however, because the potential benefits of exercise can be negated by overexertion and this will get you feeling weak and tired when you should be bright and feeling good. Muscle building Exercises This includes anything that makes your muscles work. These can be, climbing the stairs, lifting objects, stretching and muscle toning exercises and even carrying bags or heavy objects can be classified as body building even if these activities don’t technically cause your muscles to grow. Weight_lifting workouts are vital for keeping the tendons, bones, connective tissues and muscles stronger, and this in turn lessens the chance of getting bone fractures and sprains. Based on this health arguments you can see that any workout exercise undertaken during the menopause years is more desirable than not having a fitness plan. You should try to find a few fitness activities you like and alternate between these physical activities so that there is minimal chance of you getting disinterested to performing them regulary. Lastly, a moderate amount of fitness routine during the pre-menopause years can make life a lot more comfortable menopause and ‘post-menopause’; and ultimately, is it not what we ladies want?
