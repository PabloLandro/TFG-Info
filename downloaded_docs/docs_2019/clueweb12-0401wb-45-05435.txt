Posted on Dec 17, 2008 | Comments 0 Acupuncture uses the insertion of needles in certain points of the body to help stimulate responses that are beneficial to the patient. Through acupuncture, anything from weight control, chronic pain, to permanently quitting smoking is possible. One such symptom that may be controlled through acupuncture is migraine headaches. For those who have never experienced a migraine headache , the symptoms of one may not seem to be as serious as they can be for those who have suffered through one. Migraine headaches are commonly associated with a pulsating pain in the temporal region of the head, which is often times accompanied by nausea, vomiting, as well as a heightened sensitivity to bright lights. One can see how symptoms such as these can prove to be quite debilitating, especially in a work environment. Pain medications can offer some relief from migraine headaches, but due to the likelihood of frequent reoccurrences, the use of these medications can sometimes be harmful to the body over an extended period of time. Because of this, some have sought after a more holistic method to relieve or alleviate migraine headaches. As is the case with countless other ailments, acupuncture has been shown to help reduce, not only the severity, but also the frequency of migraine headaches.
