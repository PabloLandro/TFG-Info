This plant has been used as a natural body care for centuries and can be traced back to Ancient Egypt where it was given to deceased pharaohs as burial gifts. The plant is often called the "plant of immortality" because of its many health benefits. It is also known as the "lily of the desert" because it can be found growing in deserts and is valuable for health and beauty products. The sap from the aloe vera plant is often harvested to create body and skin care products. Aloe vera is added to many products for its calming effects, including lotions, make up, soaps, shampoos, and sunscreen. Aloe vera is said to have anti-aging benefits because it provides moisture to dry and cracked skin. It has also been used to heal open skin wounds. Because aloe vera has anti-inflammatory benefits, it is a great natural solution to acne. It can help reduce any swelling or redness associated with severe acne. Using aloe vera gel on specific blemishes as a spot treatment has shown significant improvement in reducing the size of the blemish, as well as overall redness to the skin. It may also be able to reduce the look of scars or facial abrasions. These anti-inflammatory benefits are not just limited to the use of body and skin care products. Aloe vera is also great for people who are suffering from arthritis. Arthritis sufferers can use aloe vera to ease the pain and pressure caused by swollen joints.
