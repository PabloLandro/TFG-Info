			  on Wednesday, April  2, 2008 I have tried several different things that seem to help with my so called Diabetes 2. I didn't want to do medication, so cut portions, drink a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and do drink plenty of water, take fenugreek and cinnamon supplements, it's been about 6 months and I am seeing a big difference and I am not always good about remembering but I try to do at least 2 of these a day. Watch potatoes and rice intake and eat plenty of veggies. 2 | 1 | Diabetes Mellitus Cures - Next >> Related Topics Diabetes mellitus children Insulin dependant diabetes mellitus Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes exercise Managing diabetes Recipes diabetics Diabetes symptoms women Women diabetes complications Queries Diabetes Question diabetes 24 year woman More..
