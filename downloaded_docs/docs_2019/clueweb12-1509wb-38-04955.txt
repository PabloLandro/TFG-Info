It interrupts your natural body clock otherwise known as circadian rhythms. The further you travel from your home base the harder it is to avoid jet lag and the symptoms that go with it. To cure jet lag and possibly prevent the symptoms I will show you 3 easy ways to beat jet lag The first method to help prevent jet lag is sleeping on the plane as you travel to your destination. For longer flights a travel neck pillow can help you sleep better and feel refreshed when you get to your destination. Some people have trouble falling asleep on airplanes. If you fall into this category you may want to try some over the counter sleep aids. It is best to try these ahead of time to see how your body will react to sleeping pills. If you find a brand that works particularly well be sure to pack these into your carry on luggage to use on your flight. If you dont feel comfortable taking a sleep aid on your flight you can try adjusting your sleep schedule. Start about 1 week before your flight leaves. Adjust your sleep times by about 1 hour per day to eventually match your destinations time zone. This means that if your destinations time zone is earlier you would get up 1 hour earlier per day and go to bed 1 hour earlier until you matched the required time zone. When you return home you would simply reverse the process to match your home sleep schedule. Seasoned travelers often choose melatonin as a great jet lag remedy. However, a few people might react in different ways to prescription or over the counter melatonin. Possible symptoms include feeling tired without sleeping and sickness. It is best if you try this before your trip departure to see if your body will have a reaction. If you want to take melatonin naturally try drinking red wine at the airport or on your flight. Here are a few safety tips about dealing with jet lag. If you feel overly tired from your trip please get the rest you need. Dont push yourself right away. Getting a few hours of sleep at your hotel will let you awake feeling refreshed. This is especially helpful if you are traveling to a new destination and not aware of your surroundings. You dont want to become a target for crime because you are feeling tired and your mind less alert than normal. Your trip will not get off to a good start if you become a victim of crime on your first day there!
