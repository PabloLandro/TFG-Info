Buy Here Top Features of The Ebac CD425 Industrial Dehumidifiers Ideal for dehumidification on a large scale Quick moisture control of up to 285 pints per day "Reverse Cycle" defrosting system for effective low temp operation down to 33°F Adjustable humidistat to control the level of dryness desired Welded steel chassis with baked epoxy-coated and vinyl coatings for abrasion and corrosion resistance System lamps to report the operating status of the unit Rugged design for harsh industrial environments Ducted applications available How it Works: The effective answer to excessive humidity is a refrigeration-type dehumidifier such as the CD425 dehumidifier. Warm moist air is drawn by a fan across a cold coil which causes the water vapor to condense onto the coil and drop into a container or tray. The cold air is then passed over a heat exchanger where it is warmed before being passed back into the surrounding area. Continuous circulation of air throughout the dehumidifier gradually reduces the humidity within the area. This dehumidifier has a humidistat that automatically switches it on and off, which saves energy and expense by maintaining the desired level of humidity with intermittent operation.
