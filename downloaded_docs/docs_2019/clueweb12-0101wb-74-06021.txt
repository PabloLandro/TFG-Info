  Surgery Lap-Band Failures: Conversion To Gastric Bypass And Their Preliminary 
        Outcomes The LAP-BAND is designed to be an adjustable laparoscopically placed 
        gastric restriction device for the treatment of severe obesity. The purpose 
        of this study was to assess the outcome in patients who had failed to 
        effectively lose weight with this device and were converted to a gastric 
        bypass. Method A retrospective chart review was performed of all LAP-BANDS placed in 
        patients at our institution from March 1996 to June 1998. Results 36 LAP-BANDS were placed. To date, 18 of 36 (50%) have been removed. 
        Fourteen of 18 were simultaneously converted to a gastric bypass. Indications 
        for conversion included: failed weight loss (5), failed weight loss with 
        esophageal dilatation (5), failed weight loss with leaking band (2), and 
        symptomatic esophageal dilatation (1). Median time to conversion after 
        LAP-BAND placement was 38.2 months. Median follow-up after conversion 
        to gastric bypass was 8.3 months. Nineteen percent excess weight loss 
        occurred after LAP-BAND placement. Forty-three percent excess weight loss 
        occurred after conversion to gastric bypass. Conclusion In our experience, the LAP-BAND is associated with a high frequency of 
        inadequate weight loss. Conversion to gastric bypass in this subset of 
        patients is technically challenging but results in superior weight loss 
        in a shorter time period. Authors: Kothari SN, DeMaria EJ, Sugerman HJ, Kellum JM, Meador J, Wolfe L. Medical

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
