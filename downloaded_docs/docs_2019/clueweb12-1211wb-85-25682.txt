For 4 months I am adapting a program to get back in shape and I have been experiencing lower back pain . I have done several times taking medicines, and the cold method to remedy the pains. I now started problem with sleeping hours. And adding to facts I regularly doings sports tasks and trainings exercises to be promoted. I want no surgery… Can anything be done as remedy for my lower back pains ? I have consulted a friend physician. She told me she encountered lower back pain , and worse she got s-joint twist.  Simply, she all did, all of these, as part of therapy and exercise, stretch your hamstring and strengthen the abs? I really can’t believe it. She added, I also needed hanging one leg of the side of my bed, and pulling the other leg to my chest and push against my hands. And you got to believe it!!! This really helps… Now I know remedies for pains in my lower back…You can also try warm and cold methods. Heat will help, but heat can add on inflammations so ice can be better with ibufrofen or naproxen. I am hoping it helps people what wants to relieve pains for their lower back.
