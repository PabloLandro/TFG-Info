			YEARS MIGRAINE, 5 YEARS VERTIGO HORMONAL IMBALANCE “I am thankful that my 
			migraine, vertigo and premenstrual symptoms are all behind me now.” I 
			chanced upon NCM ad on the daily morning paper and gave Dr. Huang a 
			call. I brought my 
			husband with me and have been under the care of Dr. Kevin Huang for 
			the last four months. Little did I know that acupuncture would rid 
			me of my migraine, vertigo and hormonal imbalances. Migraine has been part of my life for the last 20 
			years because of my very strenuous and demanding job. Before I left my strenuous work five years ago, I developed 
			Vertigo. Even though 
			that I am now in a completely different work environment, my 
			migraine and vertigo persisted. I would worry at times driving because I am afraid that my 
			vertigo would attack while I am driving. Now I seldom have headache and if ever I do have, it is only 
			minor. Acupuncture also help balanced my hormones, 
			before I would be experiencing a lot of symptoms prior to my monthly 
			period. I would either 
			be suffering from physical pain or mental or emotional roller 
			coaster. But since I 
			have been on my program treatment with Dr. Huang, all these are 
			history. I am thankful 
			that my migraine, vertigo and premenstrual symptoms are all behind 
			me now. Sincerely, Marina T . Costa Mesa , California July 20, 2007 Read
