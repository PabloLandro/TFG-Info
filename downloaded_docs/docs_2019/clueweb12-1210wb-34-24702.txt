This number is predicted to double to over one million (~2.8% of the Canadian population) by 2038. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer Disease (AD), representing about 2/3 of all dementia. Other common disorders leading to dementia includes cerebrovascular disease, frontotemorpal lobar degeneration, and Lewy Body Disease. A number of these disorders have a high heritability with familial clusters. Mutations in several genes have been identified to cause familial Alzheimer and frontotemporal dementia. Other genetic and environmental risk factors also contribute to the development of dementia. The different types of dementias often have a typical clinical profile, although there is significant overlap between the syndromes. Importantly, there is no clinical test during life that could identify the different types of dementia pathology. In my research, I am examining the various factors that contribute to the cause of dementia, and I am exploring new laboratory and imaging techniques that can help us identify and differentiate the different types of dementia. We are also involved designing and carrying out clinical trials to investigate novel therapies for treating different types of dementias at various stages, with the ultimate goal to find a cure for these devastating conditions of the brain.
