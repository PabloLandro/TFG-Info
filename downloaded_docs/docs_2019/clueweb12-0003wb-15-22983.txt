Testimonials I have worked with Sharon for the past year and would highly recommend her, and have in fact sent several patients her way! I came to her first looking to help regulate my menstrual cycle and to aid in fertility as my partner and I planned to try to get pregnant a few months later. Sharon subsequently treated me through our insemination attempts, skillfully encouraging timely ovulation, and a healthy embryo implantation. Once I actually became pregnant, she treated me throughout my first trimester and into my second (where I happily am now) easing fatigue and nausea, and helping maintain my early pregnancy. Oh, and along the way she cured my sciatica! Her expertise with acupuncture and herbs is amazing. Her compassion and healing presence are truly a rare find. As a patient, it's not often that you feel so seen, heard and cared for. She's a gem.
