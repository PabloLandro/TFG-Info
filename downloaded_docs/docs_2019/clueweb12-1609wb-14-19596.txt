What is Laetrile? Also known as amygdalin or vitamin B17, laetrile is a substance that works to target and kill cancer cells using its own natural offenses.  A laetrile molecule consists of three substances: Glucose (a simple sugar) Hydrogen cyanide Benzaldehyde A cancer cell contains many sugar transporters which grab sugar from the bloodstream and draw it into the cell to provide energy.  As the laetrile molecule approaches, the cancer cell drags it inside and attempts to metabolize it.  However, once inside, the laetrile molecule releases toxic cyanide and benzaldehyde and kills the cell.  Due to this release of a toxic substance, there has been much controversy over the use of laetrile in the medical field, but it is now known that this metabolism pattern does not occur in normal cells and the laetrile affects only cancerous tissue. How Does Vitamin C Help Fight Cancer? Laetrile is often used in conjunction with therapeutic doses of vitamin C.  It’s widely known that a diet rich in vitamins is an excellent way to prevent cancer, but vitamin C can also help fight cancer once it has already developed. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning that it scavenges damaging free radicals from the body and helps prevent cancer long-term.  These free radicals, or molecules with unpaired electrons, can cause DNA damage to cells in the body.  Since damaged DNA is what causes cells to mutate into cancer cells, vitamin C supplementation can help prevent the formation and spread of cancer.  It’s also essential for maintaining good health and a strong immune system, so supplementation during cancer treatment has additional benefits on top of killing cancer cells. An alternative cancer treatment clinics consult can help determine the best course of action for treatment.  Used in conjunction with DMSO, laetrile and vitamin C have the potential to kill cancer cells and bring patients into remission.
