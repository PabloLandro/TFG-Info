Vaginal Obesity Surgery Option For Women December 15th, 2010 Anna More people are having troubles losing weight and keeping it off, no matter how many diets they follow or how many crunches they complete. As a result, many are turning to surgery in order to help them lose weight and regain their health. But as with any surgery, there is a risk of complications. In recent days, surgeons have discovered that obesity surgery performed through the vagina is one way to help reduce the risk of negative effects, while still providing a life-saving surgery for those without any other options. The Need for Obesity Surgery Even with all of the new information about the dangers of obesity, it seems that many people are still overweight. Being overweight and obese can lead to a number of health problems including: High blood pressure Higher risk of diabetes Higher risk of some types of cancer Higher risk of heart attack, stroke and heart disease Those who are battling with being heavily overweight or obese know they are putting their bodies at risk, but sometimes there is very little they can do to correct the weight gain. They try dieting and they try exercise, but when the body is very overweight, these traditional methods of losing weight can be very difficult to follow. In this situation, when dieting, exercise and even prescription diet pills do not result in weight loss, a doctor can step in to help them regain their lives. With obesity surgery, the stomach can be made smaller, which forces obese patients eat less and lose weight rapidly. While this sort of surgery is only indicated in those who have already tried to lose weight in other ways, the surgery can often be the last chance for a healthy life for morbidly obese people. Benefits of the Vaginal Obesity Surgery Procedure Surgery is not a decision to be made lightly, regardless of the procedure options available to you. Those who decide to schedule obesity surgery can face the same health risks as with any other surgery. Since obesity surgery is elective, some may think the risks are not worth the time on the operating table. With a vaginal obesity surgery procedure, many of the common risks associated with obesity surgery can be reduced. Since the vagina is already an open cavity of the body, the surgeon doesn’t have to make a large incision in the stomach. This reduces the possibility of infection while also increasing the speed of recovery. Often, this surgery can be completed with just a small nick in the uterus as the opening point and this cut is easily stitched up. In addition, there is less risk of blood loss during the surgery as the cut is smaller. Potential Risks of Vaginal Obesity Surgery However, no surgery is not without its risks. While obesity surgery through the vagina is less invasive, there can still be complications. Those who are unhealthy to begin with might have troubles with infection, bleeding, and pain. In addition, any time anesthesia is used, there is a risk of death. These are important considerations to weigh with your doctor and the surgeon before scheduling any surgery. Vaginal Obesity Surgery is the latest possibility for obese women who have not been able to lose weight using traditional methods. In losing the weight, the patient can become healthier while also receiving a second chance at life. Related content: Why Choose The African Mango Vitamin?
