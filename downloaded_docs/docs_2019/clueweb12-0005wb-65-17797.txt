Although the use of acupuncture during pregnancy has yet to be extensively studied, research suggests that acupuncture may help with the following conditions. Acupuncture For Pain During Pregnancy Acupuncture may help relieve pregnancy-related back pain and pelvic pain, according to a research review published in 2008. The review's authors found that women who used acupuncture in combination with standard treatment experienced greater pain relief (compared with those who used only standard treatment, physical therapy, or exercise-based therapy). Since the review included only three clinical trials, the review's authors call for further research on the use of acupuncture in treatment of pain during pregnancy. Acupuncture For Morning Sickness Several studies suggest that acupuncture may be an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy . For instance, a 2002 trial involving 593 women (all of whom were less than 14 weeks pregnant and had symptoms of nausea or vomiting) found that those who underwent weekly acupuncture sessions for four weeks reported less nausea throughout the study. Members of the acupuncture group also reported less dry retching from the second week on (compared with women who did not receive acupuncture). Acupuncture For Insomnia During Pregnancy In a small study published in 2005, scientists discovered that acupuncture might help ease insomnia during pregnancy. The study involved 30 pregnant women struggling with sleep problems , 17 of whom were assigned to eight weeks of acupuncture treatment. Compared to those who did not receive acupuncture, members of the acupuncture group reported a greater decrease in insomnia over the course of the study period. Acupuncture For Depression During Pregnancy Acupuncture shows promise in treatment of depression and emotional distress during pregnancy, according to several studies. In a 2010 trial involving 150 pregnant women with major depression, for example, researchers found that those who underwent eight weeks of depression-specific acupuncture treatment had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms (compared to study members who received massage therapy or acupuncture treatment that did not specifically target depression). An earlier study, published in 2007, found that acupuncture treatment helped alleviate emotional complaints during pregnancy (including anxiety and irritability). Should You Use Acupuncture During Pregnancy? Although acupuncture is generally considered safe, it's important to consult your doctor before beginning acupuncture treatment for pregnancy-related health problems. While acupuncture may offer some benefit to pregnant women, more research needs to be conducted before acupuncture can be recommended as a sole treatment for any pregnancy-related condition.
