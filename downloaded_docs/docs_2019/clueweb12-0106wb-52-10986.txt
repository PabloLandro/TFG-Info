CRASH - Trial Protocol - Background Trial 
        Protocol Back Background Corticosteroids 
        in Head Injury Worldwide, 
          some millions of people are treated each year for serious head injury, 
          of whom close to a million die, and a similar number are disabled, [Ref 
          1] often with profound effects on the subsequent quality of 
          life of the affected individuals and their carers. [Ref 
          2] If a treatment as simple as short term corticosteroids produces 
          just a moderate benefit, this could be worthwhile. For example, if corticosteroids 
          reduced the risk of death by just 2% (e.g. from 15% to 13%), and reduced 
          the risk of permanent disability by a similar amount, then treatment 
          of 500,000 patients would avoid 10,000 deaths and prevent 10,000 permanent 
          disabilities. But, such a benefit would be impossible to demonstrate 
          reliably without large scale randomised evidence. If, for example, 10,000 
          patients were randomly allocated to receive a corticosteroid infusion 
          and 10,000 a placebo infusion, then a reduction from 15% to 13% dead 
          should be detectable - and a reduction from 15% to 12% would certainly 
          be detectable. By contrast, a trial involving only 2,000 patients would 
          probably miss such differences. .. So 
          far, all of the randomised trials of corticosteroids in head injury 
          have been small: the largest included only a few hundred patients, and 
          even in aggregate they have involved only about 2,000 patients (Figure 
          1). [Ref 3] When all previous trials are combined, the risk of death in the corticosteroid 
          treated group appears to be about 2% lower than in the control group, 
          but the 95% confidence interval runs from 6% lower to 2% higher mortality. 
          (This overall reduction from 39% dead to 37% dead corresponds to an 
          'odds ratio' of 0.91, with 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.12; the 
          corresponding odds ratio for death or disability in those trials is 
          0.90, with 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.11.)Â  Hence, the overall 
          result from the previous trials is compatible with there being no real 
          benefit, but it is also easily compatible with a benefit of a few percent. 
          However, the existing trials are too small to demonstrate or to refute 
          either possibility. .. Figure 
        1. Aggregate mortality results from 13 randomised trials of steroids in 
        head injury published before 1997 Steroid Control Number 
        of patients 1,061 1,087 Number 
        of patients who died 396 (37%) 422 (39%) Absolute benefit 
        of steroids 2%, indicating 1 death prevented for every 50 patients treated: 
        but these previous trial results are also statistically compatible with 
        there being no real benefit at all (or even a small hazard). Corticosteroids 
        in Spinal Injury Recent 
          evidence of benefit from corticosteroids in acute spinal cord injury 
          has renewed interest in their possible role in brain injury. The Second 
          US National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS 2) compared 24 hours 
          of methylprednisolone (MP) vs placebo in 333 patients with acute spinal 
          cord injury. [Ref 4] At six months, patients who had received steroids rather than placebo 
          appeared to have greater improvement in motor function, and in sensation 
          to pinprick and touch. Similar results were reported in a Japanese trial 
          of the same regimen. [Ref 
          5] Recent trials of MP in acute spinal cord injury have 
          indicated slightly more neurological recovery with 48 than with 24 hours 
          of treatment. [Ref 6] Dose 
        Selection Post-traumatic 
          neuronal degeneration can involve lipid peroxidation, [Ref 
          7] and in cats [Refs 
          8,9] and mice [Ref 
          10] this can be inhibited by methylprednisolone, [Ref 
          11] with 30 mg/kg needed for maximal effect. The dose 
          of steroid used in previous head injury trials was, however, much lower 
          than this, [Ref 3] and so a trial of the early administration of methylprednisolone in 
          doses that are high enough to inhibit lipid peroxidation may produce 
          slightly greater treatment effects than those in Figure 1. The CRASH 
          trial has therefore been designed to determine reliably: .. the effects 
            of high dose corticosteroid infusion on death and on disability following 
            significant head injury, and the effects 
            of such infusion on the risk of infection and
