This, in part, is a result of anti-inflammatory properties of Manuka honey. In addition, the anti-inflammatory properties in Manuka honey also help to reduce pain and minimize scaring. It also been found that Manuka honey dressings a moist wound environment, which create the healing process easier. Manuka Honey draws lymph from the deeper tissues of the wound by osmosis and continuously cleans the wound bed. Lymph contains enzymes that degrade protein molecules. The constant reduction of wound fluid debris remove impurities such as dirt or grit. The most likely explanation for debridement activity of Manuka honey involves the conversion of blood into plasmin, which is an enzyme that is the protein in blood clotting. This conversion minimizes dead tissue and scab on the wound. The osmotic effect of manuka honey draws moisture into the skin. It has also been found that Manuka the ability to reduce bad odors in wounds. Odorous substances such as ammonia and sulfur compounds are produced when bacteria feeds on the protein in a wound. Since Manuka Honey provides bacteria an alternative energy source (sugar), these harmful compounds are no longer produced and wound malodor is eliminated. In clinical observations, Manuka honey has also been demonstrated, the ability to wound infection in cases where antibiotics and administration have other conventional treatments have failed. More specifically, Manuka Honey has been found to be effective against antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and other multidrug-resistant microorganisms. These mutant forms of bacteria resist antimicrobial elements by forming a biofilm. Manuka honey breaks these lumpy biofilms and preventing the formation of biofilms. These results are particularly encouraging, given the growing number of cases where staph infections that do not respond to antibiotics. Previously there was no evidence of bacterial resistance to Manuka Honey. It is highly unlikely to ever develop bacteria capable of a resistance to Manuka Honey because bacteria rely on sugar as a source of food. Manuka honey's antibacterial properties are the result of the following: 1. The high sugar content and low water activity provides an osmotic effect; 2. Acidic pH inhibits the bacterial growth; 3. Glucose oxidase enzyme produces hydrogen peroxide; 4. Factors such as plant and UMF Honey Methylglyoxal. Manuka antibacterial properties have the ability to penetrate beneath the surface of the skin, making it possible to deep-seated infections and boils to delete with intact skin. In other words, diffuses Manuka honey through the skin, deeper tissues. "The use of Manuka honey dressings help to avoid cross-contamination," says Frank Buonanotte, CEO of Honeywell Mark International, a manufacturer of advanced wound and skin care products containing , Active Manuka Honey is a remedy. "The sticky nature of Manuka Honey provides a protective barrier that prevents cross-contamination." my old articles Manuka Honey Benefits - A Discussion You may use Manuka honey for face care?
