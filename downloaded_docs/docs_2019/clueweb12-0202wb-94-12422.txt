by which pregnant women who have never had diabetes suddenly find
that they are insulin resistant and have a resultant high level of
sugar in their blood. It is believed that this condition arises as a
result of the actions of certain hormones produced in the placenta.
Estrogen, cortisol and human placental lactogen (HPL) block the
action of insulin in the mothers body. The body will attempt to
compensate with an oversupply of insulin produced in the pancreas.
For most mothers this works fine. For about 4 % of all pregnant
women, however, it does not, and gestational diabetes is the result. Untreated or poorly controlled diabetes
can have adverse effects on the baby. Excess blood glucose passes
through the placenta with the result that your baby will also have
high blood glucose levels. This causes the babys pancreas to
produce more insulin to get rid of the excess glucose. The baby is
now getting more energy that in needs. The excess will be stored as
fat and can lead to a condition known as macrosomia. The goal of gestational diabetes
treatment is maintain a blood glucose level similar to pregnant women
who do not have the condition. Treatment typically includes special
meal plans, physical activity sessions, daily glucose level testing
and insulin injection. Diabetes Types Type 1 Diabetes Natural Remedies Controlling Cholesterol Naturally - Dietary supplements help optimize lipid profiles....
