This type of drug is used especially for muscles that control bones on the human skeleton. These are not the same as those drugs that used during intubations or for certain surgeries in order to reduce anesthesia or to facilitate intubations. How Muscle Relaxants Work Muscle relaxants act on the (CNS) central nervous system. They are available (in the United States) only by prescription. Some of the common muscle relaxants include: carisoprodol (Soma), along with Diazepam (Valium) and the drugs cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), as well as methocarbamol (Robaxin). These drugs mostly come in tablet form. Methocarbamol (Robaxin) can also be found in tablet and injectable media. Muscle relaxants, at least some of them, can be found in Canada without the need of a prescription. Uses of these drugs Muscle relaxants are normally only prescribed with rest, restricted exercise, professional physical therapy, along with other medical treatments. These drugs can only provide pain relief; they cannot solve the underlying cause of your pain. While these drugs can make you feel better, you should avoid going back to normal activities. Doing so too soon can make the injury worse.
Muscle relaxants are very effective in relieving muscle pain caused by a variety of injuries; however, they are not as good or effective for treating other forms of pain. In some cases, people will feel dizzy, drowsy, confused, or even lightheaded when on these drugs. Others may feel clumsy, unbalanced, or have complaints of blurred vision. Muscle Relaxants Drug's Side Effects Sedation is the most commonly reported adverse effect of muscle relaxant medications. These drugs should be used with caution in patients driving motor vehicles or operating heavy machinery. There are other contraindications when using carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, or the drug diazepam. Benzodiazepines will also have the potential for abuse. For this reason, they should be avoided. Doctors often recommend taking muscle relaxants at night. This helps prevent daytime drowsiness and allows the drug to also act as a sedative effects.
Some of the other side effects, that you might find with muscle relaxants include: dry mouth, drowsiness, possible addiction, and urinary retention. Warnings for these drugs Anyone who is taking muscle relaxants with other medications must be careful. This is also true if you have certain medical conditions. Diabetes patients must be aware that metaxalone (Skelaxin) can often cause false testing results, particularly on one certain test for sugar levels in the urine. Those with epilepsy should know that taking methocarbamol, a muscle relaxant, can increase the possibility of seizures.
Other conditions to be watched include; those with allergies, mothers who are breastfeeding and have kidney disease, anyone who has had recent heart attacks, those with irregular heartbeat, those with overactive thyroid gland, liver disease, hepatitis or have abused alcohol or drugs in the past must consult with their doctor. If you have glaucoma, or if you have current problems urinating, tell your doctor. Recommended Dosage for these drugs The exact dose varies according to the drug being taken as well as the way it is administered. In some drugs, there can also be issues with absorption rates. These often require higher doses. One drug, in particular, methocarbamol, may need a higher dose rate. It is important that you consult your doctor about any questions you have concerning your dose. Drugs Interactions Muscle relaxants have been known to interact with a few other medicines. This can affect the way each medicine works. It can also increase the chances of side effects. You must tell your doctor if you are taking or planning to take any type of medicine while you are taking muscle relaxants. This will include over-the-counter medicines as well.
