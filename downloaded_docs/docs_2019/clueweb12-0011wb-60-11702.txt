The Pro-Tec  Achilles Tendon Support applies focused compression on the Achilles tendon while providing lift to the heel, reducing stress where the Achilles tendon attaches to the heel.  CoolMax  covered felt with hook-and-loop closure can be easily adjusted for just the right amount of support. ProArch  3/4 Orthotics, Pair - $19.95 USD When a faulty stride or extended walking causes the plantar fascia (the band of connective tissue that runs from your heel to your toe) to stretch too taut, you feel the severe heel and arch pain of plantar fasciitis.  ProArch  Orthotics  with its flexible, prescription-quality polypropylene "arch spring" shell  provides the right support for your arch.  The fabric-covered, Euduron  foam cover ensures maximum cushioning and foot shock protection.   The 3/4 length gives a perfect fit when you require extra toe room.

Silicone Gel Arch Insoles, Pair - $29.95 USD Silicone gel insoles are known for their superior shock absorption capabilities, and these insoles are no exception. A double thick, cobra shaped longitudinal arch support enhances the ultra-thin design of our insoles. These silicone insoles fit in most shoes (even shoes without a removable insole), and once inserted the double thick silicone pad forms around your foot to add support and extra cushioning to the sensitive areas below the arch and heel. Great for sufferers of  metatarsalgia, diabetic feet, fat pad atrophy, Morton's neuroma, plantar or heel pain. Order by men's/women's shoe size above. Bio Balance  Anti-Pronation Insoles, Pair - $19.95 USD For people who overpronate when they walk, feet hit the ground off balance, causing ankles to roll inward, leading to foot and lower body pain. Now, overpronators can get the special support they need. Bio Balance  Anti Pronation Insoles are slanted from the center to the inside, helping to correct foot misalignment from the heel to the forefoot, as you walk. Made from a shock-absorbing, visco-elastic material that won't bottom out, these insoles reduce the excessive pronation that flattens arches, stretches the foot's soft tissue, and puts stress on your entire lower body. A very thin, slick design fits comfortably inside most shoes, even those without removable insoles. Order by shoe size above.  Click here to see the placement of the insoles and how they support to relieve overpronation.
