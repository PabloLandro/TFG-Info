Parents of Whitefish students have been notified using a phone information system and notices have also been sent home with students. As a precaution, the department has also cancelled a middle school band concert, in order to stop the whooping cough infection in its tracks. Health officials urge anyone with a cough lasting more than five days to see a doctor. They're also advising students to get the pertussis vaccine. "When an individual gets pertussis or its identified and confirmed then generally we put them on a course of antibiotics usually for five days, said Community Health Director Jody White, and then once they've completed that they're no longer contagious and can go back to school, daycare, or work. Additional details can be found on the Flathead County Health Departments website or by calling the pertussis hotline at 751-8188. UPDATE: The Flathead County Health Department says the quick response from Whitefish school administrators and nurses has prevented the spread of whooping cough. As of Saturday afternoon, Health Officer Joe Russell tells NBC Montana there are no new reported cases of whooping cough after one Whitefish Middle School student contracted the illness. He says his office took crucial steps to prevent the spread such as giving students who were in close contact a five day course of antibiotics. The department also set up guidelines for a youth wrestling match, refusing entry to anyone with signs of the illness. Health officials will know more about the issue when lab results come back to their office. You share in the NBC Montana.com community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.
