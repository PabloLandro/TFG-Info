   Lung Segmental Anatomy DDX of Pneumonia (Practically Speaking): Bacterial - Staphylococcus, Streptococcus (gets treated
   with antibiotics) Viral - Influenza, Parainfluenza, RSV (gets no
   treatment with antibiotics) Approach/Discussion to Simple Pneumonia: Begin with history and physical examination including careful chest auscultation. PA and lateral chest films are the first step radiographically in looking for
   infection. Bacterial - Airspace disease -> infiltrates
      -> consolidation / air bronchograms Viral - Airway disease -> bronchial cuffing
      -> hyperinflation Mycoplasma - In between bacterial pneumonia and
      viral pneumonia in appearance, it can look like either and is a
      joker Bacterial pneumonia is now treated in most cases as an
   outpatient with oral antibiotics. Remember that the CXR always lags behind the patient's
   clinical appearance during healing. Approach/Discussion to Complicated Pneumonia: Computed tomography needs to be pushed for early in complicated
cases. What is found on computed tomography will often modify therapy
substantially.

   CT Followup Summary Radiologist's job is to detect, characterize, and follow the
   infection in simple cases of pneumonia When a pneumonia starts to become complex or in an immune
   suppressed patient the radiologist needs to push for early use of
   computed tomography to further identify the disease process and to
   guide further therapy. References: See References Chapter.
