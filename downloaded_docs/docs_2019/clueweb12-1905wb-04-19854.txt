< 0.05) concentrations of glucose (1829%), triglycerides (2330%), and total cholesterol (1226%) were observed with all three doses of cinnamon; LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower only in the 3-g (10%) and 6-g (24%) cinnamon groups, and HDL cholesterol concentrations did not change significantly. The decreased concentrations of glucose and lipids were maintained even after the 20-day washout period. The results of this study indicate that a wide range of cinnamon intakes may be beneficial in reducing the risk factors associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Since the effects were similar at all three levels tested, there is a possibility that even less than one gram of cinnamon may be effective. The authors suggest that cinnamon may also be beneficial to the non-diabetic population for preventing and controlling elevated glucose and blood lipid concentrations. The maintenance of lower serum glucose and lipid concentrations even when the subjects were not consuming cinnamon denotes the sustained effects of this spice and is evidence that cinnamon need not be consumed daily to achieve the effects observed. It is important that the mechanisms responsible for these effe
