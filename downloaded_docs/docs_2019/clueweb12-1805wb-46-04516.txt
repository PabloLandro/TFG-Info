																	PDF Version ABSTRACT: The new age of 
														nutraceuticals is now 
														embracing the centuries 
														old herbal extract of 
														Ginkgo biloba (Mantissa 
														Plantarum Altera, 1771, 
														Ginkgoceae). The 
														standardized preparation 
														of the Ginkgo leaf 
														extract (EGb 761) contained 2main 
														bioactive constituents, 
														flavonoid glycosides 
														(24%) and terpene 
														lactones (6%), along 
														with less than 5 ppm of 
														the allergenic 
														component, ginkgolic 
														acid. The Ginkgo leaf 
														extract has been 
														reported to have 
														neuroprotective, 
														anticancer, 
														cardioprotective, stress 
														alleviating, andmemory 
														enhancing effects and 
														possible effects on 
														tinnitus, geriatric 
														complaints, and 
														psychiatric disorders. 
														The therapeutic 
														mechanisms of action of 
														the Ginkgo leaf extract 
														are suggested to be 
														through its antioxidant, 
														antiplatelet, 
														antihypoxic, antiedemic, 
														hemorrheologic, and 
														microcirculatory 
														actions, where the 
														flavonoid and the 
														terpenoid constituents 
														may act in a 
														complementary manner. 
														Toxicity studies show 
														that the Ginkgo leaf 
														extract is relatively 
														safe for consumption, 
														although a few side 
														effects have been 
														reported, that is, 
														intracerbral hemorrhage, 
														gastrointestinal 
														disturbances, headaches, 
														dizziness, and allergic 
														skin reactions. The use 
														of Ginkgo leaf extract 
														may be promising for 
														treatment of certain 
														conditions, although its 
														long-termuse still needs 
														to be evaluated.

														Ginkgo biloba, Ginkgo

														terpenoids. Introduction Complementary and 
														alternative medicine is 
														defined as a “diagnosis, 
														treatment and/or 
														prevention which 
														complements mainstream 
														medicine by contributing 
														to a common whole, by 
														satisfying a demand not 
														met by orthodoxy or by 
														diversifying the 
														conceptual frameworks of 
														medicine” (Ernst 2000). 
														Over the past 15 y, 
														there has been a steady 
														growing trend of these 
														unconventional therapies 
														throughout the globe. 
														The European and the 
														U.S. market alone 
														contributed to about $7 
														and $5 billion per 
														annum, respectively, in 
														1999 (Calixto 2000). 
														Until 2000, estimates 
														showed that nearly 50% 
														to 75% of the U.S. 
														population have tried 
														complementary and 
														alternative medicine (Neldner 
														2000). NIH broadly 
														classifies complementary 
														and alternativemedicine 
														into 6 categories; 
														Mind-Body Interventions, 
														Bioelectromagnetics 
														Applications, 
														Alternative Systems of 
														Medical Practice, Manual 
														Healing Methods, Herbal 
														Medicine, and Diet and 
														Nutrition (Wootton 2005). The 
														category of herbal 
														medicine has grown 
														faster than any of the 
														other forms of 
														alternative treatment 
														(Ernst 2002). 
														Traditional Chinese 
														medicine is a subsection 
														of herbal medicine 
														(Wootton 2005). The 12 
														most commonly used and 
														best-studied medicinal 
														herbs are listed in 
														O’Hara (1998). Over the past couple of 
														decades, the Ginkgo leaf 
														extract has stepped into 
														the herbal spotlight 
														mainly because of its 
														proven benefits for 
														treating Alzheimer’s 
														disease (Bastianetto and 
														others 2000; Zimmermann 
														and others 2002; Smith 
														and Luo 2003; Yao and 
														others 2004). It also 
														appears promising as a 
														therapeutic for many 
														other chronic and acute 
														forms of diseases. 
														Ginkgo leaf extract 
														topped the list of the 7 
														best selling herbal 
														products in 1998 with 
														retail sales of US $150 
														million (Izzo and Ernst 
														2001). Ginkgo biloba: 
														botanical data Ginkgo 
														biloba L. (Mantissa 
														Plantarum Altera, 1771, 
														Ginkgoceae) belongs to 
														the botanical family of 
														Ginkgoceae with synonyms 
														like Salisburia 
														adiantifolia, Salisburia 
														macrophylla, and 
														Pterophylla 
														salisburiensis. The 
														ginkgo tree, known to be 
														among the oldest living 
														species on this planet, 
														has flourished in 
														forests for over 150 
														million years and hence 
														it is called a “living 
														fossil” (McKenna and 
														others2001). It is a 
														dioecious tree with the 
														male and female 
														reproductive organs on 
														separate trees. They 
														have a large trunk with 
														a girth of about 7 m and a height 
														of about 30 m. Young 
														trees are conifer like 
														and exhibit branching 
														dimorphism. Leaves that 
														growin clusters are 
														golden yellowin fall 
														during senescence. The 
														leathery leaves are very uniquely shaped with 2 
														lobes and resemble the 
														maidenhair fern in shape 
														and venation. The 
														pollination process 
														involves the male 
														microstrobilli bearing 
														loosely distributed 
														sporangiophores 
														containing microspores 
														with male gametophytes 
														and the female pendulous 
														pairs of ovules borne on 
														the shoots. These trees 
														begin to reproduce after 
														about 20 y by developing 
														naked seeds (nuts) with 
														an outer fleshy layer 
														(fruits). The outer 
														fleshy layer of the 
														fruit has a considerable 
														amount of butanoic and 
														hexanoic acids, which 
														are responsible for the rotting flesh, 
														fermented odor (McKenna 
														and others 2001). History and traditional 
														uses of Ginkgo biloba 
														The ginkgo tree is the 
														only surviving member of 
														Ginkgoaceae family, class of 
														Ginkgoatae, rediscovered 
														in Asian graced temple 
														gardens by Kaempfer in 
														1670. The class of 
														Ginkgoatae consists of 
														approximately 15 genera, 
														and among these, Ginkgo, 
														Baiera, and Ginkgoites 
														are the most important (Bilia 
														2002). The name ginkgo 
														comes from the Chinese 
														words sankyo or yin-kuo, 
														which means a hill 
														apricot or silver fruit, 
														due to their apricot 
														shaped mature fruits and 
														yellow color (McKennaand 
														others 2001). Englbert 
														Kaempfer, a German 
														surgeon, first used the 
														term “Ginkgo” in 1712, 
														but it was Linnaeus who 
														termed it Ginkgo biloba 
														in 1771 (Gertz and 
														Kiefer 2004). Both the 
														leaves and the nuts of 
														this tree have been in 
														use for the past several 
														centuries in traditional 
														Chinese medicine. In 
														fact, the nuts are known 
														to have a longer history 
														of usage, being first 
														mentioned in herbals in 
														the Yuan dynasty [1280 
														to 1368 AD], published 
														in 1350 AD (Goh and 
														Barlow 2002). For over 
														5000 y, the seeds (nuts) 
														have been known to treat 
														pulmonary disorders 
														(like asthma, cough, and 
														enuresis), alcohol 
														abuse, and bladder 
														inflammation while the 
														leaves have been mainly 
														used to treat heart and 
														lung dysfunctions and 
														skin infections (Mahady 
														2002; Smith and Luo 
														2004). However, it was 
														only in the last 20 to 
														30 y that the use of the 
														ginkgo leaf and its 
														standardized extract 
														formulation, EGb 761, 
														originated in Germany, 
														and now is the most used 
														form of supplement for 
														cognitive ailments in 
														the United States (Smith 
														and Luo 2004). Other 
														uses of this tree 
														include the fruit, 
														prepared by fermentation 
														and cooking, being a 
														delicacy in weddings and 
														feasts (McKenna and 
														others 2001; Bilia 
														2002). The roasted or 
														boiled ginkgo seeds are 
														also considered a 
														gourmet delicacy in 
														Japan, China, Korea, and 
														Malaysia. The tree is 
														also grown in many parts 
														of Europe and the United 
														States mainly for its 
														ornamental value. It 
														grows well in most 
														places due to such 
														properties as pest, 
														pollution, and disease 
														resistance (McKenna and 
														others 2001). Ginkgo 
														leaf extract Since the 
														constituent composition 
														of ginkgo leaf undergoes 
														fluctuating changes with 
														respect to their origin, 
														species, and time of 
														harvest like any other 
														plant, it is essential 
														to standardize the 
														Ginkgo leaf extract to 
														obtain consistent 
														bioactivities. The 
														culturing, harvesting, 
														and extraction of the 
														ginkgo leaves are 
														rigorously standardized 
														and controlled based on 
														its known active 
														components (Smith and 
														Luo 2004). Typically, 
														the leaves are collected 
														during summer and fall between the 
														months of July and 
														September when they are 
														still green. These 
														leaves are then dried 
														and analyzed for the 
														presence of pollutants 
														and toxic substances 
														like heavy metals and 
														aflatoxins. The crude 
														dried leaves are then 
														extracted using an 
														acetone: water mixture 
														(35 to 67:1). 
														Standardization of 
														Ginkgo leaf extract can 
														be done by measuring 
														flavonoids and 
														terpenoids (Bilia 2002). 
														The standardized extract 
														preparation of the 
														ginkgo leaf, EGb 761, 
														developed by 
														Beaufor-Ipsen Pharma 
														(Paris, France) and Dr. 
														Willmar Schwabe 
														Pharmaceuticals 
														(Karlsruhe, Germany), 
														contains 24% flavonoid 
														glycosides, 6% terpene 
														lactones, and less than 
														5 ppm ginkgolic acid 
														(the constituent 
														proposed to have 
														allergenic properties) 
														(Smith and Luo 2004). 
														Recently, a new method 
														to evaluate Ginkgo leaf 
														extract using HPLC-fingerprinting 
														has been suggested as a 
														better method to monitor 
														various preparation of 
														the Ginkgo leaf extract 
														(Sun and Liu 2007). Active components of 
														Ginkgo biloba leaf The 2 
														main pharmacologically 
														active groups of 
														compounds present in the 
														Ginkgo leaf extract are 
														the flavonoids and the 
														terpenoids (Smith and 
														Luo 2004). Flavonoids, 
														also called 
														phenylbenzopyrones or 
														phenylchromones, are a 
														group of low molecular 
														weight substances that 
														are widely spread in the 
														plant kingdom. 
														Flavonoids present in 
														the Ginkgo leaf extract 
														are flavones, flavonols, 
														tannins, biflavones (amentoflavone, 
														bilobetol, 
														5-methoxybilobetol, 
														ginkgetin, isoginkgetin 
														and sciadopitysin), and 
														associated glycosides of 
														quercitin and kaempferol 
														attached to 
														3-rhamnosides, 
														3-rutinosides, or p-coumaric 
														esters (McKenna and 
														others 2001). The 
														flavonoid content in the 
														Ginkgo leaf is known to vary 
														between seasons; greater 
														amounts are found in 
														fall than in spring 
														(McKenna and others 
														2001). These compounds 
														are known to actmainly 
														as antioxidants/free 
														radical scavengers, 
														enzyme inhibitors, and cation 
														chelators (DeFeudis and 
														Drieu 2000). In general, 
														the bioavailability of 
														flavonoids is relatively 
														low due to limited 
														absorption and rapid 
														elimination (Goh and 
														Barlow 2004). Flavonoids 
														in the glycosidic form 
														are poorly absorbed in 
														the intestine; only in 
														the aglycone form can 
														they be absorbed 
														directly (Goh and Barlow 
														2004). Unabsorbed 
														flavonoids that reach 
														the colon may be subject 
														to metabolism by 
														bacterial enzymes, and 
														then absorbed (DeFeudis 
														and Drieu 2000). Once 
														absorbed, flavonoids 
														reach the liver where 
														they are metabolized to 
														conjugated derivatives (DeFeudis 
														and Drieu 2000). It is 
														known that the 
														biological activities of 
														flavonoidmetabolites are 
														not always the same as 
														those of the parent 
														compound (Manach and 
														others 2004). Two types 
														of terpenoids are 
														present in Ginkgo as 
														lactones (nonsaponifiable 
														lipids present as cyclic 
														esters): ginkgolides and 
														the bilobalide (Smith 
														and Luo 2004). 
														Ginkgolides are 
														diterpenes with 5 types 
														A, B, C, J, andM, where 
														types A, B, and C 
														account for around 3.1% 
														of the total Ginkgo leaf 
														extract (DeFeudis and 
														Drieu 2000). Bilobalide, 
														a sesquiterpene 
														trilactone, accounts for 
														the remaining 2.9% of 
														the total standardized 
														Ginkgo leaf extract 
														(Smith and Luo 2004). 
														There are no adequate 
														studies determining the 
														dose of Ginkgo extract 
														needed to achieve 
														beneficial effects, 
														although the recommended dose of standardized 
														extract, EGb 761, is 40 
														to 60 mg, 3 to 4 times 
														daily based on clinical 
														trials (Mahady 2001). 
														For chronic conditions 
														the German commission 
														recommends a minimum 
														8-wk intake in order to 
														observe the beneficial 
														effects of the Ginkgo 
														leaf extract (McKenna 
														and others 2001). 
														Pharmacological effects 
														of Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo 
														leaf extract has shown 
														beneficial effects in 
														treating 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases like 
														Alzheimer’s, 
														cardiovascular diseases, 
														cancer, stress, memory 
														loss, tinnitus, 
														geriatric complaints 
														like vertigo, 
														age-related macular 
														degeneration, and 
														psychiatric disorders 
														like schizophrenia (Ramassamy 
														and others 2007). These 
														multifaceted activities 
														of the Ginkgo leaf 
														extract may work through 
														various mechanisms of 
														action. The suggested 
														mechanisms of the Ginkgo 
														leaf extract are its 
														antioxidant effect, 
														anti-platelet activating 
														factor (Anti-PAF) 
														activity for cardio and 
														cerebral vascular 
														diseases, inhibition of 
														beta amyloid peptide (Aβ) 
														aggregation to reduce 
														Alzheimer’s progression, 
														and decreased expression 
														of peripheral 
														benzodiazepine receptor 
														(PBR) for stress 
														alleviation and 
														stimulation of 
														endothelium derived 
														relaxing factor to 
														improve blood 
														circulation (Amri and 
														others 1996; Pietri and 
														others 1997a; DeFeudis 
														and Drieu 2000; Smith 
														and Luo 2004). 
														Antioxidant effects. The 
														underlying principle 
														behind the therapeutic action of the Ginkgo 
														leaf extract on chronic 
														ailments (such as 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases, cardiovascular 
														diseases and cancer) has 
														focused on its 
														antioxidant properties. 
														The 2 proposed 
														mechanisms of action are 
														(1) directly scavenging 
														free radicals and (2) 
														indirectly inhibiting 
														formation of free 
														radicals. The Ginkgo 
														leaf extract can 
														scavenge reactive oxygen 
														species (ROS) such as 
														hydroxyl radicals (OH˙), 
														peroxyl radical (ROO˙), 
														superoxide anion radical 
														(O2−˙), nitric oxide 
														radical (NO˙), hydrogen 
														peroxide (H2O2), and 
														ferryl ion species (Mahady 
														2002; DeFeudis and 
														others 2003). The Ginkgo 
														leaf extract can also 
														enhance activities of 
														antioxidant enzymes such 
														as superoxide distmutase 
														(SOD), glutathione 
														peroxidase, catalase, 
														and/or heme-oxygenase-1, 
														thereby indirectly 
														contributing as an 
														antioxidant (Song and 
														others 2000; DeFeudis 
														and others 2003). It has 
														been suggested that 
														ginkgo leaf extract 
														increases expression of 
														mitochondrial enzymes 
														like NADH dehydrogenases, 
														which can influence ROS 
														generation in the 
														mitochondria. This is a 
														protection against 
														uncoupling of oxidative 
														phosphorylation, thereby 
														increasing ATP levels 
														regulating energy 
														metabolism (Janssens and others 
														1995; Tendi and others 
														2002). In comparison to 
														other antioxidants, the 
														Ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 
														761) is known to be 
														regulatory and adaptive, 
														either dilating or 
														contracting blood 
														vessels, or controlling 
														neurochemicals or 
														neuroendocrine 
														indicators according to 
														the circumstances (Smith 
														and Luo 2003). The main 
														constituents implicated 
														in all these actions are 
														the flavonoids (quercitin 
														and kaempferol) and the 
														terpenoids (ginkgolides 
														and bilobalide) (Bastianetto 
														and others 2000;DeFeudis 
														and others 2003; Smith and Luo 2004), 
														where each contributes 
														their antioxidant 
														property differently. 
														The flavonoids are known 
														to exert their effects 
														through inhibition of 
														the cyclooxygenase-2 
														enzyme, which is a part 
														of prostaglandin 
														synthesis, and its 
														inhibition is known to 
														reduce colon 
														carcinogenesis. The 
														bilobalide increase the 
														activities of the 
														antioxidant enzymes (SOD 
														and catalase) and 
														improve cell viability 
														(Watanabe and others 
														2000; DeFeudis and 
														others 2003). However, 
														proanthocyanidins 
														(present at about 7% in 
														Ginkgo leaf extract) 
														present in the whole 
														leaf extract bind to 
														proteins and inactivate 
														antioxidant enzymes such 
														as catalase, glutathione 
														peroxidase, and lactate 
														dehydrogenase (Pietri 
														and others 1997a). 
														Hence, the presence of 
														these proanthocyanidins 
														may hinder the 
														antioxidant effects of 
														the Ginkgo leaf extract. 
														Prevention of 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases. Alzheimer’s 
														disease is a form of 
														dementia that 
														progressively 
														deteriorates 
														intellectual capacity of 
														various domains of the 
														brain, particularly with 
														aging (Smith and Luo 
														2003). Alzheimer’s 
														disease affects about 4% 
														of the population over 
														65 and 20% of those over 
														80 (Zimmermann and 
														others 2002). Research 
														has now found links 
														between Alzheimer’s disease and 
														deposition of amyloid 
														beta peptide (Aβ) 
														(Bastianetto and others 
														2000; Yao and others 
														2004; Ramassamy and 
														others 2007). Aβ is a 
														polypeptide with 39 to 
														43 amino acid residues 
														and a major component of 
														senile plaques and 
														vascular amyloid 
														deposits of the brains 
														of patients suffering 
														fromAlzheimer’s disease. 
														Ginkgo leaf extract is 
														known to inhibit the 
														formation of Aβ from β-amyloid 
														precursor protein (APP), 
														a crucial process in the 
														pathogenesis of 
														Alzheimer’s disease (Yao 
														and others 2004). 
														Formation of amyloid 
														precursor protein has 
														been indirectly linked 
														to high cholesterol 
														levels (Koudinov and 
														Koudinova 2001; Wolozin 
														2002; Puglielli and 
														others 2003). It has 
														been postulated that the 
														inhibition of Aβ is through the Ginkgo 
														leaf extract’s ability 
														to compete with free 
														cholesterol for 
														interaction with Aβ and 
														thereby decrease their 
														aggregation (Yao and 
														others 2004). 
														Alternatively, the 
														Ginkgo leaf extract 
														inhibits ROS 
														accumulation induced by 
														Aβ (particularly 
														flavonol quercitin) and 
														also reduces neuron 
														apoptosis, where apoptosis is considered 
														to be one of the main 
														causes for 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases (Bastianetto 
														and others 2000; 
														Ahlemeyer and 
														Krieglstein 2003; Ergun 
														and others 2005; 
														Ramassamy and others 
														2007) and thus help to 
														relieve Alzheimer’s 
														disease. Ginkgolide B 
														and bilobalide are 
														reported to inhibit 
														apoptosis induced by staurosporine (alkaloid 
														anticancer drug) and 
														serum deprivation 
														(Ahlemeyer and 
														Krieglstein 2003). 
														Bilobalide also 
														prevented DNA 
														fragmentation due to 
														hydroxyl radical β-amyloid 
														and hydrogen peroxide (Ahlemeyer 
														and Krieglstein 2003). 
														In addition, Ginkgo leaf 
														has also been reported 
														to improve cerebral 
														blood flow by stimulating 
														norepinephrine secretion 
														(Yang and others 2005) 
														and increased the life 
														span in a particular 
														study of rats treated 
														chronically with EGb 
														761, due to its 
														antioxidant action in 
														reducing oxidative 
														stress and free radical 
														production (Winter 
														1998). Ginkgo leaf 
														extract is known to 
														improve memory 
														complaints as well. 
														Walesiuk and others 
														(2005) used EGb 761 at a 
														dose of 100 mg/kg and 
														found improvements of 
														spatial and nonspatial 
														memory tested in rats 
														using the maze and 
														object recognition test. 
														Not only was EGb761 
														responsible for memory 
														response improvement but 
														was also reported to 
														improve response 
														retrieval. Similar 
														effects on improvement 
														of cognition, memory 
														loss, or improved blood 
														flow which may be 
														beneficial for 
														Alzheimer’s disease, 
														vertigo, dyslexia, and 
														other neuropsychiatric 
														disorders were exhibited 
														in a number of human 
														clinical trials using 
														Ginkgo leaf extract (Hopfenmuller 
														1994; Hartley and others 
														2003; Smith and Luo 
														2004; Issing and others 
														2005; Akhondzadeh and 
														Abbasi 2006; 
														Donfrancesco and 
														Ferrante 2007; Kennedy 
														and others 2007b; 
														Napryeyenko and others 
														2007; Ramassamy and 
														others 2007; Scripnikov 
														and others 2007). 
														However, others showed 
														no benefit of Ginkgo 
														leaf extract on 
														cognitive functions or 
														memory (van Dongen and others 2000, 2003; 
														Carlson and others 2007; 
														Kennedy and others 
														2007a; Lovera and others 
														2007). Although there is 
														a body of evidence 
														showing the potentially 
														beneficial effects of 
														Ginkgo leaf extract on 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases, it is still 
														not conclusive whether 
														Ginkgo leaf extract 
														supplementation can 
														improve cognitive 
														functions in humans. Cardioprotective 
														effects. Ischemia, 
														impaired blood 
														circulation, is a common 
														underlying condition of 
														cardiovascular and 
														cerebral vascular 
														diseases. During an 
														ischemic attack, there 
														is an increased release 
														of free radicals and 
														lipid peroxidation 
														causing tissue damage 
														and resulting in chronic 
														diseases (Mahady 2002). 
														Cardioprotective effects 
														ofGinkgo leaf extract 
														are through antioxidant, 
														antiplatelet activity 
														and increased blood flow 
														through release of 
														nitric oxide and 
														prostaglandins (Pietri 
														and others 1997a, 1997b; 
														Mahady 2002). Pietri and others 
														(1997b) showed that 
														consumption of Ginkgo 
														leaf extract prior to 
														cardiac surgery helped 
														in reducing reperfusion 
														induced lipid 
														peroxidation and 
														prevented ascorbate 
														depletion, tissue 
														necrosis, and cardiac 
														dysfunction. Moreover, 
														they also showed that 
														ginkgolide B reduces 50% 
														to 60% of the 
														postischemic production 
														of ROS (Pietri and 
														others 1997b). Pietri 
														and others (1997a) also 
														showed that reperfused 
														hearts treated with 
														terpene constituents 
														alone recovered 
														functionally better than 
														those treatedwith EGb 
														761 (Pietri and others 
														1997a). This leads to 
														the conclusion that 
														terpene constituents 
														decreasedmyocardial 
														vulnerability to 
														ischemic reperfusion. 
														The Ginkgo leaf extract 
														is also known to improve 
														coronary blood flow 
														through antiplatelet 
														activity (by ginkgolide 
														B) and by improving 
														contractile functions 
														which are due to 
														increased release of 
														catecholamines from 
														endogenous liver tissue 
														reserves by flavonoids 
														(quercitin, kaempferol, 
														and isorhamnetin) (Mahady 
														2002). Anticancer 
														effects. Cancer is a 
														disease characterized by 
														uncontrolled division of 
														cells and the ability of 
														these cells to invade 
														other tissues. The 
														disease is of 
														mutifactorial origin 
														that involves changes in 
														gene expressions and 
														aberrations in the cell 
														signaling pathways. Ginkgo leaf extract is 
														known to exhibit a 
														chemopreventive action 
														at various levels with 
														antioxidant, 
														antiangiogenic 
														properties, and 
														influence gene 
														expression (Sagar and 
														others 2006). The Ginkgo 
														leaf extract’s 
														antioxidant ability 
														contributes to improving 
														cellular tolerance to 
														oxidative stress (Smith 
														and Luo 2004) as well as 
														to reduce angiogenesis, 
														which is blood vessel 
														formation required for 
														tumor metastasis (Monte 
														and others 1994; 
														DeFeudis and others 
														2003; Kim and others 
														2006; Sagar and others 
														2006). The nitric oxide 
														(NO) involved in cancer 
														progression also appears 
														to be resolved through 
														the terpenoids of the 
														Ginkgo leaf extract by 
														altering the expression 
														of NO synthase enzymes (DeFeudis 
														and others 2003). In 
														addition, Ginkgo leaf 
														extract is known to 
														influence the expression 
														of genes involved in 
														cell proliferation, cell 
														differentiation, and 
														apoptosis at the mRNA 
														levels in breast and 
														bladder cancer models (Gohil 
														and others 2000; 
														Papadopoulos and others 
														2000; DeFeudis and 
														others 2003), thus 
														providing anticancer 
														effects. Effects on 
														stress modification, 
														mood, and memory. 
														Anxiety syndromes such 
														as stress, moods, and 
														depression are becoming 
														common in the modern 
														world. Complementary and 
														alternative medicine is 
														becoming popular as a 
														prophylactic and/or 
														therapeutic treatment 
														for these symptoms. 
														Stress involves a rise 
														in the levels of 
														glucocorticoids, and a 
														subsequent memory 
														dysfunction, increased 
														anxiety, decreased 
														immunity, 
														gastrointestinal tract 
														disturbances, myocardial 
														infarction, or effects 
														such as increased 
														vigilance (Walesiuk and 
														others 2005). Since mood 
														and emotion are related 
														to stress, the 
														alleviating effects of 
														Ginkgo leaf extract may 
														result in improving 
														mood, thus resulting in 
														antidepressant activity 
														(DeFeudis and Drieu 
														2004). Ginkgolides A and 
														B decreased the ligand 
														binding capacity, 
														protein, and mRNA 
														expression of peripheral 
														benzodiazepine receptor 
														(PBR) which led to 
														decreased corticosteroid 
														synthesis and 
														subsequently the 
														circulating levels of 
														glucocorticoids (Amri 
														and others 1996). The 
														memory enhancing effects 
														of Ginkgo leaf extract 
														through prevention of 
														neuron degeneration are 
														discussed in the 
														previous section on 
														prevention of 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases. Effects on tinnitus, 
														geriatric, and 
														psychiatric disorders. 
														Tinnitus, or “ringing in 
														the ears,” is a common 
														condition observed in 
														almost 10% of the 
														population (Drew and 
														Davies 2001). One of the 
														common causes for 
														tinnitus is the 
														inadequate blood supply 
														to the inner ear (Ernst 
														and Stevinson 1999). 
														Thus, Ginkgo leaf 
														extract was thought to 
														have some potential 
														beneficial effects in 
														treating tinnitus. There 
														are a number of clinical 
														trials discussing the 
														effects of ginkgo leaf 
														extract on tinnitus 
														(Ernst and Stevinson 
														1999; Drew and Davies 2001;DeBisschop 
														2003; Rejali and others 
														2004).However, effects 
														of Ginkgo leaf extract 
														on tinnitus are 
														inconclusive due to 
														different commercial 
														extract samples of the 
														ginkgo leaf, different 
														intervention methods, dosages of the 
														extract, and use of 
														different primary end 
														points to evaluate the 
														results (Ernst and 
														Stevinson 1999). 
														Age-related macular 
														degeneration is thought 
														to be one of the common 
														causes of age-related 
														visual loss, possibly 
														due to oxidative damage 
														to the retina. Ginkgo 
														has been reported to be 
														effective against senilemacular 
														degeneration due to its 
														free radical scavenging 
														effect (Diamond and 
														others 2000). Vertigo, 
														which involves a 
														sensation of movement 
														when no movement is 
														occurring, is another 
														disorder which ginkgo 
														has been found to be 
														effective against (Issing 
														and others 2005). 
														Schizophrenia is a 
														mental disorder 
														involving impairments in 
														the perception or 
														expression of reality 
														and by significant 
														social or occupational 
														dysfunction. The 
														condition is 
														characterized by 
														excessive free radical 
														formation in the brain. 
														A clinical trial carried out by 
														Atmaca and others (2005) 
														showed a positive effect 
														in treating 
														schizophrenia patients 
														through increase in the 
														levels of antioxidant 
														enzymes like SOD, 
														catalase, and 
														glutathione peroxidase. Safety profile Studies 
														show that a relatively 
														low risk is associated 
														with the consumption of 
														Ginkgo leaf products. 
														Occasional adverse 
														effects with excessive 
														consumption of Ginkgo 
														leaf extract have been 
														reported which include 
														gastrointestinal 
														disturbances, headaches, 
														dizziness, excessive 
														bleeding, allergic skin 
														reactions, and 
														occasional 
														anaphylaxis-like 
														reactions (only with 
														intravenous 
														administration) (Kleijnen 
														and Knipschild 1992; 
														Skogh 1998; Vale 1998; 
														Benjamin and others 
														2001; De Smet 2002). 
														Long-term safety of 
														Ginkgo leaf extract is 
														not clear. Chinese and 
														Japanese cuisines often 
														involve ginkgo nut 
														consumption as a part of their diet. 
														A particular case study 
														reported frequent 
														vomiting and clonic 
														convulsions in a 
														36-y-old womanwith no 
														prior history of 
														epilepsy after consuming 
														approximately 70 to 80 
														nuts over 1meal. 
														4’-Methoxypyridoxine, 
														one of the components 
														present in the nuts, is 
														suspected to cause 
														convulsions by 
														indirectly affecting an 
														enzyme glutamate 
														decarboxylase, resulting 
														in a decrease of the γ -aminobutyric 
														acid (GABA) level in the 
														brain (Miwa and others 
														2001). Hemorrhage or 
														excessive bleeding 
														caused by Ginkgo leaf 
														extract is due to its 
														inhibitory effects on 
														PAF. At levels of 120 to 
														240 mg/d EGb 761 does 
														not have significant 
														effects on PAF 
														antagonistic action; 
														however, dosages greater 
														than 100 times are 
														reported to cause 
														hemorrhage in rabbits 
														and humans (Koch 
														2005).Due to its effect 
														on PAF, Ginkgo has been 
														known to interact with 
														anticoagulant drugs (Lu 
														and others 2006; Aruna 
														and Naidu 2007), 
														although Jiang and 
														others (2005) did not 
														observe any significant 
														effects of Ginkgo in 
														clotting status in 
														healthy subjects. Ginkgo 
														leaf extract also 
														interacts with 
														antidepressants (that 
														is, Trazodone), 
														antiepileptic, 
														antidiabetic, diuretics, 
														and nonsteroidal 
														anti-inflammatory drugs, 
														aswell as other herbal 
														drugs (Matthews 1998; 
														Uchida and others 2006; Tang and others 2007). 
														These interactions are 
														believed to be affected 
														mainly by the 
														flavonoidic glycosides 
														and the terpenoids by 
														selectively inhibiting 
														particular enzymes, 
														including cytochrome 
														P450 (Gaudineau and 
														others 2004).However, 
														others reported no 
														effect on clearance of 
														cytochrome P450 
														substrates by Ginkgo 
														leaf extract (Markowitz 
														and others 2003; 
														Greenblatt and others 
														2006; Mohutsky and 
														others 2006). The 
														apparent discrepancy has 
														been suggested to be due 
														to age-dependent 
														responses (Gurley and 
														others 2005). The other components of 
														Ginkgo leaf extract are 
														the ginkgolic acids 
														(alkyl phenols), which 
														are considered to be 
														toxic. They are bilobol, 
														cardanols, cardols, and 
														ginkgol and are known to 
														cause gastrointestinal 
														and allergic reactions. 
														All commercial 
														preparations of Ginkgo 
														leaf extract must 
														contain 5 ppm or less of 
														ginkgolic acids tominimize these 
														adverse reactions of 
														Ginkgo leaf extract use 
														(McKenna and others 
														2001). German 
														authorities report no 
														side effects on pregnant 
														and lactating women; 
														however, data with 
														respect to effects on 
														fertility, lactation, 
														and pregnancy, 
														particularly near labor, 
														are inadequate to be 
														conclusive (McKenna and 
														others 2001; Dugoua and 
														others 2006). Conclusions The standardized Ginkgo 
														leaf extract preparation 
														has been found to 
														exhibit multifaceted 
														therapeutic effects that 
														include effects on 
														neurodegenerative 
														diseases, cancer, 
														cardiovascular diseases, 
														tinnitus, geriatric 
														complaints, and 
														psychiatric disorders. 
														The main underlying 
														mechanism of action in 
														all these cases has been 
														the antioxidant 
														properties of the 
														extract. There are other 
														principles of action 
														that include PAF 
														antagonism, modulation 
														of the peripheral 
														benzodiazepine receptor, 
														and endothelium relaxing 
														factor improving the 
														circulatory properties 
														of blood. Thus, Ginkgo 
														leaf extract has been 
														shown to be a promising 
														herbal dietary 
														supplement with proven 
														therapeutic benefits. 
														However, its long-term 
														safety needs to be 
														properly addressed. Printable
