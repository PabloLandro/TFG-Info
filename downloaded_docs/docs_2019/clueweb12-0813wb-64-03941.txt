Hydroxyzine may cause dizziness or drowsiness. If you experience dizziness or drowsiness, avoid these activities. Use alcohol cautiously. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and dizziness while you are taking hydroxyzine. What is hydroxyzine Hydroxyzine depresses activity in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which causes relaxation and relief from anxiety. Therefore, hydroxyzine is used to treat anxiety disorders and tension in stressful situations--before surgery, for example. Hydroxyzine may also increase the effects of other medicines, such as pain relievers and sedatives, so it is useful after surgery also. Hydroxyzine is also an antihistamine. It blocks the effects of the naturally occurring chemical histamine in your body. This makes hydroxyzine useful for treating allergic conditions, especially those that involve the skin, such as hives, itching, and rashes. Hydroxyzine may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. Who should not take hydroxyzine Before taking hydroxyzine, tell your doctor if you have any other medical conditions, especially heart, liver, or kidney disease. You may require a lower dose or special monitoring during hydroxyzine therapy if you have any other medical conditions. It is not known whether hydroxyzine will harm an unborn baby. Do not take hydroxyzine without first talking to your doctor if you are pregnant. It is also not known whether hydroxyzine passes into breast milk. Do not take hydroxyzine without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. If you are over 60 years of age, you may be more likely to experience side effects from hydroxyzine. You may require a lower dose of this medication. How should I take hydroxyzine Take hydroxyzine exactly as directed by your doctor. If you do not understand these directions, ask your pharmacist, nurse, or doctor to explain them to you. Take each dose with a full glass of water. To ensure that you get a correct dose, measure the syrup form of hydroxyzine with a special dose-measuring spoon or cup, not with a regular tablespoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist where you can get one. Store hydroxyzine at room temperature away from moisture and heat. What happens if I miss a dose Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take only your next regularly scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose of this medication unless otherwise directed by your doctor. What happens if I overdose Seek emergency medical attention. Symptoms of a hydroxyzine overdose include extreme drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, seizures, hallucinations, and decreased breathing. What should I avoid while taking hydroxyzine Use caution when driving, operating machinery, or performing other hazardous activities. Hydroxyzine may cause dizziness or drowsiness. If you experience dizziness or drowsiness, avoid these activities. Use alcohol cautiously. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and dizziness while you are taking hydroxyzine. What are the possible side effects of hydroxyzine Stop taking hydroxyzine and seek emergency medical attention if you experience an allergic reaction (difficulty breathing; closing of your throat; swelling of your lips, tongue, or face; or hives). Other, less serious side effects may be more likely to occur. Continue to take hydroxyzine and talk to your doctor if you experience dizziness, drowsiness, sleepiness, or confusion; blurred vision or a dry mouth; or nausea or vomiting. Side effects other than those listed here may also occur. Talk to your doctor about any side effect that seems unusual or that is especially bothersome.
