We Proudly Support... Weight loss surgery is about a lifelong lifestyle change, not another diet attempt.. by Traci (Bariatric Life Coach) (Indianapolis, IN) Life is hard, food is easy and that doesn’t change after weight loss surgery.  The word 'diet' has a negative tone for those of us who have struggled with food and our weight for so long. Weight loss surgery should not be viewed as the easy way out or just another diet.  This is a lifelong lifestyle change and if we don’t wrap our arms around that concept we may start to self-sabotage by treating it like all of those past diets we attempted. Food is still part of my life because I have to eat to live.  Planning is essential and protein is priority.  I don’t eat high calorie, high sugar foods or high amounts of carbohydrates.  My pouch is a sensitive piece of real estate that needs nutrition and if there is no nutritional value to a food I don’t want to waste my valuable space with those foods. There are still times when I feel powerless over food and I eat something that makes me ill in the long run.  I’m human and I’ve learned that I have to recognize it, not beat myself up.  Instead, I must make the healthier choice next time. Keeping trigger foods out of my house is something I do for me and working my recovery.  Filling my house with healthier options makes it a more positive and safe environment and helps keep me on track!
