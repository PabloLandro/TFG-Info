Carolina Asthma And Allergy Categories Home Allergy Food Allergy General Allergy Pet Allergy Relief Allergy Shot Allergy Symptoms Allergy Treatment Site Map Asthma/Allergies in North Carolina ? Question: I am a moderate allergy-induced asthma sufferer who is planning on 
moving to the Raleigh/Durham area early next year. Can anyone provide 
any insight or links to information regarding the affects of Carolina 
weather (specifically tree pollens and humidity) on asthmatics ? Any 
help would be greatly appreciated ! Answer: I live in Columbia, South Carolina and my asthma is definitely better in the 
fall and winter.  I find it much harder to breathe on our hot, humid summer 
days.  If you find that humidity is a bother, you may want to check into 
getting a good dehumidifier. 
It depends.  Are you allergic to the things that are in the air in 
that area? That's a good question. It's really time for me to have another 
evaluation and see what bothers me the most. After I know this, I can 
compare it with what is prevelant in North Carolina. How can I find out 
the kinds of allergens that are in the air in N.C. ?

list that included plants indigenous to the area.  I'm sure you could get 
your hands on one. Submit your comment or answer | Home | Allergy Food | Allergy General | Allergy Pet | Allergy Relief | Allergy Shot | Alle
