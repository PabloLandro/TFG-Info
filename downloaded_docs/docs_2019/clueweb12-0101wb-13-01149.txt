The reason? Medical costs related to obesity may be twice as high as earlier estimates, according to one new report. The study analyzed the actual weight of people, while previous studies only considered the self reported weight of patients, which was likely to be understated. Researchers also took into account the role of genetic factors in the patients, looking at the weight of each subject’s immediate family members to determine whether obesity ran in the family. Researchers John Cawley, Ph.D., an associate professor at Cornell University, and Chad Meyerhoefer, Ph.D., professor of economics at Lehigh University, based their findings on data from a survey involving 24,000 adult patients from 2000 to 2005. They found that costs related to obesity medical care are close to $168 billion, representing 17 percent of medical costs in the U.S. The figure is a sizeable jump from last year’s estimate of $147 billion – a figure cited by federal health officials – which is 9 percent of the country’s total medical costs. - Full Story - »»» Patients with diabetes may need fewer medications after bariatric surgery • Diabetes • 

 • Weight Loss • Aug 17 10 Bariatric surgery appears to be associated with reduced use of medications and lower health care costs among patients with type 2 diabetes, according to a report in the August issue of Archives of Surgery, one of the JAMA/Archives journals. “The rapidly growing epidemics of obesity and diabetes threaten to overburden the world’s health care systems,” the authors write as background information in the article. “From an epidemiological standpoint, once these diseases develop they are rarely reversed. Dietary, pharmaceutical and behavior treatments for obesity are associated with high failure rates, and medical management of diabetes is also often unsuccessful. Despite many efforts to improve the control of glucose levels in diabetes, including clinical guidelines and patient and provider education, less than half of all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus achieve the American Diabetes Association recommendation of a hemoglobin A1C level of less than 7 percent.” The use of bariatric surgery—that results in long-term weight loss, improved lifestyle and decreased risk of death—has tripled in the past five years, the authors note. Martin A. Makary, M.D., M.P.H., and colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, studied 2,235 U.S. adults (average age 48.4) with type 2 diabetes who underwent bariatric surgery during a four-year period, from 2002 to 2005. They used claims data to measure the use of diabetes medications before and after surgery, along with health care costs per year. - Full Story - »»» Sleep problems linked to weight gain in middle-age • Obesity • 

 • Sleep Aid • 

 • Weight Loss • Jul 02 10 Women, try not to think of this if you lie awake at night: having trouble sleeping means you’re likely to gain weight. As if simply getting older weren’t hard enough, new research shows that middle-aged and older women who have trouble falling or staying asleep may pack on more pounds than their well-rested contemporaries. A number of studies have found that sleep-deprived children and adults are more likely to be overweight than those who usually get a full night’s rest. But many of those studies assessed people at one point in time, so it was hard to know which came first, the sleep problems or the excess pounds. - Full Story - »»» Community interventions and in-home visits may slow excess weight gain in American Indian children • Children's Health • 

 • Weight Loss • Jun 02 10 Community intervention can help American Indian families change behavior related to early childhood weight gain and obesity, according to a new Kaiser Permanente and Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) study. The study, published online in the Journal of Community Health, also finds that adding in-home visits to the community intervention has an even more profound effect on behavior change, and can reduce a child’s body mass index. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, this is the first study to target obesity prevention among American Indian children starting at birth. - Full Story - »»» Eating Breakfast Boosts Weight Loss • Weight Loss • May 03 10 If you’re skipping breakfast in an effort to slim down, it might be wise to rethink your weight-loss strategy. Studies show that folks who eat breakfast tend to be thinner and healthier than those who don’t. In a study of nearly 3,000 individuals enrolled in the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), 78 percent reported eating breakfast every day of the week. All NWCR subjects had maintained a weight loss of 30 pounds for at least one year. On average, the subjects had lost more than 70 pounds and kept it off for six years. Skipping any meal — especially breakfast — seems to promote weight gain rather than weight loss, since breakfast-skippers are more likely to give in to mid-morning munchies or extra-large lunches. Either way, they typically end up consuming far more calories than if they had just eaten breakfast in the first place. - Full Story - »»» Obesity May be Evaded by Weight Loss Surgery • Surgery • 

 • Weight Loss • Apr 15 10 Complication arising in pregnancy  due to obesity can be evaded with weight loss surgery. If overweight women  undergo weight loss surgery before they conceive, it may avert pregnancy complications. It is known that women who are overweight have a high chance of developing complexities during pregnancy. One example of such complication is high blood pressure, or preeclampsia, which elevates the threat of premature birth and infant death. Wendy L. Bennett, M. D., M. P. H., Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead researcher evinces, “We have long known that women who have these blood pressure disorders are not only at an increased risk for pregnancy complications in themselves and their babies, but also for chronic diseases in the future” . - Full Story - »»» Vitamin D, Weight Loss, and Obesity • Obesity • 

 • Weight Loss • Mar 21 10 Vitamin D continues to make headline news. Findings suggest adequate levels may break barriers with individuals battling excess weight. Research reveals a relationship between vitamin D levels in the body, vitamin D intake, and body weight. While the exact relationship is not entirely understood, a growing body of evidence suggests an association between obesity/excess body weight and D levels exists. In addition, the link is supported by the fact that obesity and low D are co morbid (occur at the same time) with diseases such as: disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, depression and even periodontal disease. - Full Story - »»» Lap-Band Weight-Loss Surgery Can Reverse Metabolic Syndrome in Obese Teens • Children's Health • 

 • Obesity • 

 • Weight Loss • Jul 02 09 A new study of obese adolescents has shown that laparoscopic gastric banding surgery—the “Lap-Band” procedure—not only helps them achieve significant weight loss but can also improve and even reverse metabolic syndrome, reducing their risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is defined as a cluster of risk factors—high blood pressure; low levels of HDL or “good” cholesterol; excessive abdominal fat; and elevated levels of blood sugar, C-reactive protein and triglycerides—that increase a person’s chances of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes later in life. The single biggest risk factor is obesity, and metabolic syndrome usually improves when a person loses weight. The study was led by Drs. Ilene Fennoy, Jeffrey Zitsman and colleagues at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center and presented at the annual Endocrine Society meeting in Washington, D.C. - Full Story - »»» Gastric bypass provides long-term diabetes control • Diabetes •

 • Weight Loss • Jun 29 09 In more than half of obese patients with type 2 diabetes, their metabolic condition resolves after gastric bypass and they remain free from diabetes up to 16 years later, according to study findings presented last week at the 26th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery in Dallas. In a study of 177 patients with diabetes who underwent gastric bypass for obesity, also referred to as bariatric surgery, between 1993 and 2003, the severity of diabetes before surgery was a key predictor of whether diabetes resolved in the long term. Moreover, long-term diabetes resolution correlated with the maintenance of weight loss. “The most significant finding is that long-term resolution of diabetes seems to be linked to how severe the diabetes was at the time of surgery,” senior author Dr. James W. Maher, from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, told Reuters Health. “Patients with diet-controlled diabetes had a 75 percent likelihood of being diabetes-free at long-term followup, while the figure was 65 percent diabetes-free in patients who were originally controlled with oral medications and only 28 percent of insulin-dependent diabetics had long-term resolution.” - Full Story - »»» Hormone May Help Combat Frailty in Older Women • Endocrinology • 

 • Weight Loss • Jun 12 09 Frail elderly women with unexplained weight loss may benefit from supplementation with the body’s appetite-stimulating hormone, ghrelin, or with similar agents, according to a new study. Results of the study, which was funded partially by the National Institutes of Health, were presented at The Endocrine Society’s 91st Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. Unexplained weight loss is a common problem in older adults. It can lead to the development of frailty, a debilitating syndrome of declines across multiple body systems. Frail individuals have much higher rates of functional decline, hospitalization and death than healthier people their age, said study lead investigator Anne Cappola, MD, ScM, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia. - Full Story - »»» Studies confirm weight-loss surgery beats diabetes • Diabetes • 

 • Weight Loss • Mar 03 09 The most common form of diabetes disappears in most obese diabetics after weight-loss surgery, researchers said on Tuesday in a study that strongly affirmed the benefits of the operations. The researchers combined data from 621 studies worldwide with 135,246 patients and found that 78 percent of obese diabetics returned to normal blood sugar levels and had no symptoms of diabetes following weight-loss operations, also known as bariatric surgery. Another 8 percent saw their diabetes symptoms improve, although the disease was not eliminated. “This is the most comprehensive study of the effect of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes. It includes every major paper that’s been written in this field,” Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who led the research published in the American Journal of Medicine, said in a telephone interview. - Full Story - »»» Weight loss improves mild sleep apnea • Sleep Aid • 

 • Weight Loss • Feb 11 09 Losing weight through lifestyle changes can improve or even reverse mild cases of the nighttime breathing disorder, sleep apnea, a new study suggests. The study, of 72 overweight adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), found that those placed on a diet-and-lifestyle regimen not only lost weight but showed significant improvements in their sleep apnea. OSA occurs when the soft tissues at the back of the throat temporarily collapse during sleep, causing repeated breathing interruptions. Major symptoms include loud snoring and daytime sleepiness. - Full Story - »»» Divorce, antidepressants, or weight gain/loss can add years to your face • Psychiatry / Psychology • 

 • Weight Loss • Feb 03 09 Your mother’s wrinkles — or lack there of, may not be the best predictor of how you’ll age. In fact, a new study claims just the opposite. The study, involving identical twins, suggests that despite genetic make-up, certain environmental factors can add years to a person’s perceived age. Results just published on the web-based version of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), reveal that factors like divorce or the use of antidepressants are the real culprits that can wreak havoc on one’s face. “A person’s heritage may initially dictate how they age – but if you introduce certain factors into your life, you will certainly age faster. Likewise, if you avoid those factors you can slow down the hands of time,” said ASPS Member Surgeon and study author Bahaman Guyuron, MD, professor and chairman, department of plastic surgery, University Hospitals Case Medical Center. “In this study, we looked at identical twins because they are genetically programmed to age exactly the same, and in doing so we essentially discovered that, when it comes to your face, it is possible to cheat your biological clock.” During the study, Dr. Guyuron and his colleagues obtained comprehensive questionnaires and digital images from 186 pairs of identical twins. The images were reviewed by an independent panel, which then recorded the perceived age difference between the siblings. - Full Story - »»» Growth hormone treatment after weight loss surgery prevents loss of muscle mass • Endocrinology • 

 • Surgery • 

 • Weight Loss • Feb 03 09 Growth hormone treatment for six months after weight loss surgery reduces patients’ losses in lean body mass and skeletal muscle mass, according to a new study accepted for publication in The Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM). Weight loss surgery techniques, such as gastric banding, have been shown to be effective in reducing body weight and obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes. Although the results of these procedures are widely beneficial, there are some complications. Following surgery, patients are at risk of losing needed lean body mass and skeletal muscle mass due to the serious complications associated with rapid and sustained weight loss. This new study investigated whether growth hormone treatment could prevent or reduce these losses. “Besides its more commonly known effect on linear growth during childhood, growth hormone benefits body composition throughout life by increasing muscle mass and reducing fat mass,” said Dr. Silvia Savastano, M.D., Ph.D., researcher at University Federico II of Naples in Italy and lead author of the study. “The results of our study show that the use of short-term treatment with growth hormone during a standardized program of low calorie diet and physical exercise is effective in reducing the loss of muscle mass and increasing the loss of fat mass after bariatric surgery.” - Full Story - »»» Physicians Agree Moderate Weight Loss Will Help Patients Manage Their Type 2 Diabetes • Diabetes • 

 • Weight Loss • Jan 22 09 Physicians say they are counseling their overweight type 2 diabetes patients to lose weight, but patients say that the message is not getting through, according to a new survey announced today by the Behavioral Diabetes Institute. Eight in 10 physicians surveyed said that they discuss weight issues with their patients every/almost every visit, yet half as many patients – only four in 10 – report having these discussions with such frequency. In particular, roughly half of overweight patients and a third of obese patients say their physician seldom or never discusses their weight with them. Almost all of surveyed physicians (85 percent) acknowledge that losing even a little weight can help manage type 2 diabetes. When discussing weight issues with their patients, 90 percent of physicians surveyed report that they tell their overweight patients to lose weight. However, when the surveyed patients were asked whether or not their doctor ever suggested that they lose weight, only 66 percent of them said yes. - Full Story - »»» Page 1 of 11 pages 1 2 3 > Last » Advertisement Home | About Us | FAQ | Contact | Advertising Policy | Privacy Policy | Bookmark Site All trademarks and registered marks are the properties of their respective com
