You must therefore be attuned to the characteristics of the onset of a hot flash , as this will prevent and abate discomfort and concern. Educating yourself by finding out exactly how a menopausal hot flash feels is imperative in the prevention and avoidance of this aggravating symptom of menopause and hormonal transition. What exactly are menopausal hot flashes, and how does it feel to experience them? Hot flashes, one of the most common symptoms of menopause and hormonal transition, usually manifest as intense sensations of heat, an increased heart rate and profuse sweating around the body. They usually begin with intense sensations of heat within the chest or face, which spread throughout the body very quickly. Although each menopausal woman experiences hot flashes in a different way, many would say that the experience of a hot flash can be likened to a “flushing” sensation, especially since the face, chest and neck often becomes red and flushed during an intense episode. Medical experts and researchers have divided menopausal hot flashes into three categories dependent upon intensity and side effects: Mild hot flashes only produce a minute alteration in body temperature, and often go unnoticed due to their benignity. Moderate hot flashes produce a more noticeable rise in body temperature, and often are accompanied by some perspiration and an accelerated pulse. Moderate flashes have the potential to inhibit activity. Severe hot flashes are very intense, and often require immediate attention. These flashes will produce profuse sweating, flushing, and a drastic increase in heart rate. Knowledge of the major side effects of menopausal hot flashes is important, but it is only partially what you must learn when attempting to prevent this condition. You also must realize the many culprits of hot flashes so you can avoid common triggers. What causes menopausal hot flashes? Hot flashes can be caused by many different things, but the most common culprit is the lack of estrogen that develops within your body during menopause and hormonal transition. Decreased estrogen production causes the body to falsely request more body heat from the hypothalamus, the regulatory section of the brain that controls body temperature and the production of heat. In response to this request, the hypothalamus commands the release of certain chemicals that dilate the blood vessels within the skin, causing a sudden increase in body temperature and often perspiration, hence hot flashes. Hot flashes can be extremely uncomfortable, especially when they progress to levels of intensity that entail discomforting side effects. There are, however, measures you can take to prevent and alleviate this condition. How to best cope with hot flashes during menopause As with all other symptoms of menopause, hot flashes can be treated with a threefold method of remedy. The three steps entail an increasing amount of risk and financial obligation as you progress through them. Because of this, you should always try to treat hot flashes with the lowest-leveled methods possible. Lifestyle changes: To achieve greater hormonal stability, you should eat from a diet rich in essential nutrients and develop a regimen of daily aerobic exercises like jogging and swimming. Not only will this alleviate and prevent hot flashes during menopause, but they promote overall healthiness and longevity, especially when continued after the conclusion of menopause. Herbal supplements: Certain herbal supplements contain naturally occurring sources of estrogen, which promote hormonal balance when taken. Pharmaceuticals: Drugs and surgeries should only be used in extreme cases when other conditions are present. Because they are so dangerous and expensive, these methods should not even be considered unless they are absolutely required. Most menopausal women find that a combination of natural supplements and lifestyle alterations is the most effective and safe way of treating hot flashes and the many side effects that they produce. By insignificantly changing your daily habits, you will regain much control over your menopausal life, and you will notice a decrease in the frequency and intensity of all symptoms, including hot flashes.
