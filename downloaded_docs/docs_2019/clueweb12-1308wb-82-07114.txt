Your baby coughs because he is either trying to get rid of mucus, or because his throat and airway are swollen. Many things cause a cough, but it is usually a sign of a cold or the flu. Colds: If your baby's cough is caused by a cold , he may also have a stuffy, runny nose, a sore throat, watery eyes and a fever . Your baby coughs to get rid of the extra mucus caused by the cold. Flu: Flu can look very similar to a cold. If your baby has the flu, he will have a fever, runny nose and sometimes diarrhoea or vomiting . But a cough caused by flu will be different to one caused by a cold. It will be 'dry' instead of 'chesty'. This means that your baby will be coughing up very little mucus. Find out how to tell the difference between a cold and the flu. Croup: If your baby has croup , he will cough because his airway is swollen. Babies have narrow airways. They are much smaller than yours. This makes it harder for your baby to breathe when it is swollen. Children aged between six months and three years are most likely to get croup. A croup cough will sound like barking. It often starts in the night. Whooping cough: Whooping cough is a bacterial infection. It is infectious. A baby with whooping cough will have an intense, hacking cough. There will be a lot of mucus and your baby will make a 'whoop' sound when he breathes in. Find out how to protect your baby from whooping cough. Asthma: Asthma can also cause your baby to cough. A baby with asthma will wheeze when breathing in and out, have a tight chest and will also be short of breath. Tuberculosis: A persistent cough is a possible sign of TB. A TB cough will last for over two weeks. A baby with TB may cough up blood, be breathless and have less of an appetite. He may also have a fever. Read more about Tuberculosis in children . Sometimes, a viral infection can develop complications. Complications such as pneumonia and bronchitis can both cause your baby to cough. How can I help to soothe my baby's cough? Your baby will recover from his cough on his own. But, there are some things that you can do to make your baby more comfortable. Put him in a steamy room. If your baby has a chesty cough that makes a lot of mucus, steaming can help clear his nose and chest. Run a hot shower and then place your baby in the room. Shut the door and use a towel to block the bottom of the doorway. Stay there for about 15 minutes. Try taking some books or toys with you, to give your baby something to do whilst sitting in the room. Raise the head of the mattress. Sometimes a cough can keep your baby awake at night. Raising the head of his mattress may help him to breathe easier. Try putting a couple of towels or pillows underneath your baby's mattress at the head end. This will make a slight slope. Give him plenty of fluids. If your baby is under six months old, give him plenty of your breastmilk. It will help him to fight the cause of his cough. It will also soothe his throat if it is sore. If your baby is older than six months, give him plenty of water or other drinks. Try not to give him fruit juices or soda drinks. They may irritate his throat if it is sore. Give him honey if he is over a year old. Research has found that honey can be more soothing for the throat than cough syrups. If your child is between one and five years old, give him half a teaspoon a day. If your child is between six and 11 years old, give him a whole teaspoon. Make sure his teeth are brushed afterwards. You can also make your own warm, soothing drinks for your baby if he is over six months old. These drinks will be much better for him than the syrups you can buy. Why not try the following recipes?

When should I call the doctor if my baby has a cough? A cough will usually clear up on its own, especially if you follow the tips above. If your baby's cough is caused by a cold or the flu , the care you give will be all your baby needs. Colds and the flu are viruses. Antibiotics won't get rid of them. But, you should always take your baby to the doctor quickly if: your baby's cough lasts for over two weeks your baby's cough gets worse your baby starts coughing up green, yellow, brownish or blood-stained mucus your baby has rapid or shallow breathing, and is wheezing your baby has an intense, hacking cough or 'whoop' your baby is losing weight and lacks an appetite your baby is coughing constantly, or begins to turn blue Will over-the-counter medicines help my baby? You may be tempted to give your baby over-the-counter medicines to help him. These medicines will not cure your baby, but they may help to soothe his symptoms. Always ask your doctor before giving your baby any medicines. Some cough syrups contain lots of alcohol. This is bad for your baby. Check the ingredients before you give your baby any syrups.
