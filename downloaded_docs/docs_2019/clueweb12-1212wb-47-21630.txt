How to Remove Wax Buildup in your Ear? | Short Interesting Articles and Interesting Facts Home About Smelly Brain Contact Privacy Policy Resources Health Disclaimer Short Interesting Articles and Interesting Facts Interesting Articles & Facts How to Remove Wax Buildup in your Ear? on January 21, 2011 If we try to wipe the inside portions of our ears with the use of a cotton swab, we can see than a yellow stain will appear on the tip of the buds. This is what we call the earwax. Earwax, which is medically known as cerumen, is a naturally secreted substance by our ears, which helps protect the inner structures from foreign pathogens like dust and debris. Finding earwax in our ears is actually very helpful since it is a type of natural defense for our body. However, earwax is constantly produced inside our ears. This is why regular cleaning should be done in order to remove the excess wax. If this is not properly met, earwax could start to accumulate and buildup inside our ear canal. This causes problems in hearing and can also be a source of infection. Because of this possibility, it is important for us to learn how to remove wax buildup in ear. In removing cerumen or earwax from our ears, we will need several items. These items consist of hydrogen peroxide, mineral oil, medicine dropper and a blow dryer. This procedure is actually very simple and easy. But before we are about to start, we should always be aware that sticking our fingers inside our ears is a definite no-no. This likewise includes other foreign objects that are not designed for ear cleaning such as pins, paper clips or pencil tips. Aside from increasing the risk for infection, doing this can also push the wax buildup deep into our ears. If this happens, it would be a lot harder for us to remove the said wax. What we need to do is to add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide or mineral oil into our ears with the use of a medicine dropper. This would only require two drops each of either liquid on both ears. We should then allow the excess liquid to flow out of the ear as the oil or peroxide will try to soften the buildup of earwax. We can do this procedure for at least 2 days. In case we don’t like to use mineral oil or hydrogen peroxide, we can always bank on using OTC ear cleaners. As soon as the wax is soft and easily removed, we can now rinse our ears using warm water. We can use a syringe to hold the water and inject it slowly into the ear canal. Doing this would require us leaning over a bowl in order to catch the excess fluids. After the rinsing, we should turn our heads over to the affected side in order to drain the excess water. It is important that we should never rub our ears dry. Doing this can actually cause trauma to the ears. Instead, we can always use a hair dryer or blower in order to keep the insides dry. These are the steps that we could follow in order for us to learn how to remove wax buildup in ear.
