What causes Calcium-related Muscle Spasms or Cramps? The extra requirements for calcium may be a result of very high protein intake, high phosphate levels (kidney disease, poor diet), hormonal diseases or imbalances, nutritional imbalances (high magnesium / calcium ratio, low Vitamin B5), celiac disease or other intestinal conditions that interfere with calcium absorption, prescribed medications that promote calcium loss, or supplementing the wrong nutritional remedies , among them being the high intake of a Vitamin B-Complex , which can trigger "burning" muscle sensations and chronic muscle tension, in addition to a number of other medical complaints related to excessive B-Vitamin supplementation. Calcium requirements are also affected by blood-thinning drugs or medications, by nutritional supplements that have a blood-thinning effect such as Vitamin E, omega / fish oils, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, saw palmetto, bromelain..., also alcohol, pomegranate (and some berry) juices, lecithin and some fiber supplements, and a higher intake of grains, as well as oxalic acid sources such as Swiss chards, rhubarb, spinach, beets, cocoa products..., which all have a lowering effect on calcium levels . When High Calcium is suspected but no resources are available to measure cellular calcium levels (serum calcium cannot be used for that purpose), an acidifying treatment may be tried such as taking a very large amount of Vitamin C for a few days.  If the muscle spasms or cramps get worse, then one can assume that calcium was likely on the low side, and one needs to either increase its dietary intake, and/or use calcium supplementation. If, on the other hand, the muscle cramps or spasms improve, then calcium is likely too high and requires extra co-factors to make it more bioavailable.  Remedies include a higher daily intake of Vitamin C , a phosphorus source such as Lecithin , supplementing extra Magnesium , or one could increase one's Protein intake. Increasing stomach acid (if low) with supplements, or using lemon or lime water with meals are other options. What causes left-sided or right-sided Muscle Spasms or Cramps? One-sided leg cramps or spasms can help with the decision of what to supplement, whereby the left side is usually indicative of extra Calcium requirements, while the right side is generally an indication of Magnesium being needed, although a combination of Calcium and Magnesium may be necessary to get relief as a result of both being low.  If right-sided muscle cramps respond to calcium (rather than to magnesium or other acidifying remedies), then dehydration is suspect, and extra sodium or potassium may be required instead. While electrolyte or other nutritional imbalances can be a cause or contributing factor for toe spasms or cramping of one's toes also, if one never experiences spasms or cramps in other parts of the body, then they may occur as a result of poor circulation, wearing tight shoes, or sitting in a particular position (car, theater, or plane) for longer periods of time.  Briefly exercising one's toes, or taking a short walk usually provides relief and resolves the problem. If poor circulation causes muscle cramps or spasms, Omega / Fish Oils, Gingko biloba or Vitamin E may be considered as a treatment for their blood-thinning, and/or vasodilating (Vit E) properties, although one should be aware that depending on the amounts taken, blood-thinning remedies may also reduce calcium levels. Since calcium is quite low in ratio to magnesium, supplementing 500mg of elemental calcium per day quickly resolved the problem - but only symptomatically! The right strategy of course was to raise Sodium , since continuing to supplement calcium would only lead to a greater increase in cellular magnesium over time (unless potassium is high also), which in turn would lower sodium even more and result in all sorts of additional medical problems (see " Mineral Ratios " for the reasons). While using extra salt would work for many individuals, it generally does not prevent muscle cramps with low- aldosterone types (whose sodium levels are chronically low - even with high sodium intake), so supplements such as Choline Bitartrate are indicated instead to raise sodium levels, which in time will lower magnesium and thus correct an individual's calcium / magnesium ratio also.  In the above case, a silica supplement - which also inhibits magnesium - was another important complementary remedy. Sodium Carbonate (baking soda) or Sodium Citrate ("Eno") can be helpful for low sodium-related muscle cramps and spasms as well.  They, or similar buffering agents are used by some athletes to combat muscle fatigue and to increase performance by raising muscle and plasma pH, however when increasing amounts from a recommended 0.3 g per kg of body mass to what some trainers consider to be an optimal intake of 0.6 g per kg, there is a risk to induce muscle spasms, stomach cramps, and/or a variety of other side effects. Once it is established that calcium and/or magnesium are needed, then the mineral type should be matched to stomach acid levels.  If they are high, then calcium or magnesium " carbonate " is preferable, and when stomach acid levels are low, then " citrate " is better.  Carbonate is also generally better with a tendency for soft stools, and citrate is generally better with a tendency for constipation. Are chronic Muscle Spasms a warning sign of other medical problems? Since low calcium and/or low magnesium-induced muscle cramps go hand in hand with disturbances of bone mineral metabolism, it may be worthwhile to be evaluated for other, possibly more serious medical problems such as Osteopenia or Osteoporosis , whereby additional preventive supplements (e.g. Vitamin D and K ), or other dietary adjustments may be indicated.  Those suffering from leg cramps that are due to insufficient potassium intake should be aware of - or at least use their symptoms as a warning sign - that ongoing low potassium levels increase the risk for Cardiovascular Disease and/or Stroke . Some sources recommend 10+ mg of Biotin a day for both, various types of muscle cramping, and also for " Restless Leg Syndrome " (which is a neurological disorder), since some dialysis patients suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) have tested deficient in that B-Vitamin.  Other sources attribute the symptoms associated with Restless Leg Syndrome 50 to Iron or Folate deficiency, resulting in lower dopamine production. Acute back spasms are often triggered as a result of injuries, while chronic back spasms can result from a curvature of the spine (scoliosis), age-related degenerative disk disease, and/or spinal alignment problems. Osteopathic / chiropractic adjustments, physiotherapy, muscle relaxants, needle acupuncture, needle-less electro-acupuncture, or electro therapy are common treatment options, depending on the type of medical system one is most comfortable with. Nutritional imbalances, i.e. abnormal Mineral Ratios , are also capable of affecting spinal alignment, or they can lead to scoliosis over time and subsequent muscle cramps and spasms, in which case drug therapy or frequent visits to a chiropractor, physiotherapist, or acupuncturist can become frustrating, since the therapy or treatment won't last.  However, once a nutritional balance is established, the spine is less likely to go out of alignment and trigger muscle spasms, cramps, and/or other health problems. "Sleep Starts" (myoclonic or hypnagogic jerks) describes a type of involuntary muscle jerking that takes place just before drifting off to sleep.  While felt by most people at some point in their lives, these sudden muscle twitches or jolts don't generally interfere with someone's sleep unless they occur on a regular, nightly basis. When they start to take place seconds apart, they will seriously affect a patient's ability to fall, or remain asleep.  Some individuals experience shorter bouts that only last a few weeks, however other people are less fortunate and may suffer "sleep starts" for several months, or on an ongoing basis. There are some known medical conditions associated with myoclonus, including brain or spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome, multiple sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, drug or chemical poisoning, organ damage, and others, however "sleep starts" is considered to be a type of Periodic Limb Movement Disorder that as of yet lacks a specific medical cause, treatment, or has a known relationship to a specific medical condition, although females are affected more than males, partly due to hormonal fluctuations that seem to aggravate this condition around the time of their menstrual cycle. Standard treatments for "sleep starts" consist of clonazepam therapy (a benzodiazepine type of tranquilizer), which - while able to help the symptoms, invites the usual long-term dependency this class of drugs is known for.  Some patients require additional drugs, or drug combinations that may include barbiturates, sodium valproate, phenytoin, or primidone. Unfortunately, nutritional remedies (as listed above) that are helpful for conventional muscle spasms and cramps do not offer any benefits for most types of myoclonus, however Taurine in the 1,500 mg to 6,000 mg a day range has been shown be somewhat helpful for "sleep starts," provided reasonable care is taken at the same time to avoid stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine, and excessive intake of white sugar, which are known to worsen the symptoms. ¤ ___________________________________________________________________________________ Copyright © 2000-2012  Acu-Cell Disorders: Muscle Spasms & Cramps Acu-Cell Disorders B-Vitamins & Interactions Vitamin C Supplementation Vit C / E / B12 / B15 Interactions Bioflavonoids & Polyphenols High / Low Carb-Fat-Protein Diets Simple, Refined & Complex Sugar Glycemic Index / Glycemic Load & Satiety Index Chocolate & Cocoa Benefits?

Feb. 2012 What remedies are helpful for exercise-induced Muscle Spasms or Cramps? Overuse or injuries are common causes for painful muscles contractions, which can involve neck, chest, back, abdominal, calf, and front & back thigh muscles, and they can be experienced in one's hands, arms, and toes. After stretching and massaging the affected muscle, consuming foods or beverages containing Lactic Acid is one strategy to reduce muscle cramping when working out, despite the buildup of lactic acid in muscle tissue during strenuous exercise being actually a common cause of muscle cramps.  This happens from insufficient oxygen not being able to oxidize lactic acid, which would otherwise get rid of it from muscle. Inosine and Creatin supplements also help as preventive remedies to reduce the buildup of lactic acid in muscle. As exercise tolerance 49 increases from repeated training, it takes increasingly longer before lactic acid builds up in muscle, so there is less of a chance of muscle cramps to develop.  Lactic acid is found in a number of foods and beverages, and it is also commercially added to increase their acidity (olives, sauerkraut, cheese, beer, soft drinks, pickles...).  Lactic acid-containing drinks can serve as valuable fluid replacement remedies for athletes before, during, and after competitive training and exercise. Sodium and Potassium imbalances also tend to become more of a problem during, or after physical activity, but less so during rest, so for exercise-induced leg cramps or muscle spasms, their addition in the form of a sports drink, or through additional Sodium / Potassium supplementation may be a consideration -- however Sufficient hydration (taking in enough fluid) is equally important before, during, and after a workout! In practice, not all cases are that straightforward.  The following example presents the chemistry of someone who experienced severe muscle cramps in his quadriceps (front of the thigh) within only a few minutes on an exercise bike.  It also demonstrates a seemingly possible - but in the long-term incorrect - interchangeability of s
