There are 2 types of fats, the bad one and the good ones but these people just have not been able to comprehend this. More harm would in fact be done than good when fats and oils are absolutely eliminated in a person’s diet. The Skinny about Fish Oil An individual would be putting one nail at a time in his own coffin by entirely wiping out from his day to day eating plan the fatty acids that are very important for the body. Omega -3 EFAS and omega-6 EFAS are the two types of essential fatty acids. Appearance of tumor, inflammation and clotting of the blood can result from excessive consumption of omega-6 EFAS according to researches even if between the two types of essential fatty acids there are just very small disparities. But there is a silver lining to it; omega-3 EFAS has the reverse effect. Both kinds of the fatty acids can be found in numerous foods, for example in fish oils you can find omega-3 EFAS and in vegetable oils, there is the omega-6 EFAS. Differences between Omega-3 and Omega-6 When a person does not balance his intake of omega-3 EFAS and omega-6 EFAS, diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure, aging prematurely, hypertension, certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases would result as believed by scientists and doctors. Vegetable oils contain omega-6 EFAS, as stated on a previous paragraph. Linoleic acid is also found in quantity that is high in soy and corn oil, two examples of the numerous foods that contain omega-6 EFAS. Oils from flaxseed, marine plankton and walnuts contain the omega-3 EFAS.
