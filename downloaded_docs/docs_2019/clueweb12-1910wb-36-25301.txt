				"I walk with my wife a lot, but I have trouble keeping up with her and I try and play catch-up the whole time. It doesn't always work. Now it does. The pain is gone in my knee. I'm losing weight. I can't see myself walking without these things. One day I had pain in my feet, pain in my knees. The next day I had no pain at all! And the only difference was putting them in my shoes.  I found the solution to my pain problems and I'm going to keep using them." Mike K. - 
				"The best thing, no doubt about it, is that I'm able to be a grandpa again. The WalkFits really are a blessing. I was laid up for six months. My ankles would give out on me. But I have not fallen, tripped or had a problem since I've had these. 100% gratifying. I'm a very happy guy and a very lucky guy." Jim M. - 
				"I've been wearing these for about three years now. I got a pair in my workboots and a pair in the shoes I wear in the house all day. Every pair of shoes I have has them. If I don't wear them then my feet ache again." Shem W. - 
				"I tore the ACL in my left knee and then I tore the one on my right knee.  And then after that I said, that's it. I'm not going to play anymore. WalkFit® has changed my life. I never thought they could do what they do for me. It's just amazing. I do not leave the house without my WalkFit®." Cathy M. - 
				"I've done everything to get out of pain. I've had steroid injections at the site and I've had custom-made orthotics and I still could NOT walk!! The WalkFits made a huge difference. Not to have the pain was like the clouds parted and the sun came out. To be able to do those things that I thought I'd never to be able to do again and that give me joy means a lot to me." Paul R. - 
				"Years of fire fighting did take a toll on my feet and nothing helped till I found the WalkFits. They feel great. There's no pain. I kick myself for spending over $200 on those other orthotics when I could have bought 10 WalkFits for the price of one. I've been wearing them for five years and haven't had a lick of pain ever since. They feel great! There's no pain!"
