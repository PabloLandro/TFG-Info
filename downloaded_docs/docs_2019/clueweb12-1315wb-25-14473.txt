In the beginning of nineties a group of pharmaceutical chemists working at Pfizer was developing prescription medications for treating hypertension and some cardiovascular diseases. Clinical trails suggested that the active element Sildenafil has little effect on angina pectoris but could induce marked penile erections. Some patients even refused to give back remaining drugs, and one of them even broke into the laboratory in order to claim more pills for further use. Pfizer therefore became aware of that they have invented potentially very popular medications. That's how viagra pill came out.

You can visit an online drug store at any convenient for you time and make acquaintance with generic prices and available discount pharmacy. Saving on your prescription medication costs begins at the doctors office, before you get to the pharmacy.
1) Ask questions. Before you leave the doctors office be absolutely clear what each medicine written on your prescription is for.
You may already have one of those medicines at home and not need it right now or you may have already tried it through another doctor and found it not to work.
The same medicine can often be written by different names. For example, you may have been prescribed Omeprazole before and it did not work. 
If you then get another prescription for Losec the chances are it wont work either as it is exactly the same. All this costs you more money.
2) Look at your prescription. At the bottom there are two places a doctor can put their signature. On the right which instructs the pharmacist to dispense the prescription as written and on the left which allows for the generic equivalent to be used.
If your doctor has signed on the right then ask why. There may be a medical reason but at the same time there may not and you could instead get prescribed a less expensive but clinically equivalent medicine.
3) Irrespective of where the doctor signs the prescription, ask if the name of medicine that has been written is a brand name or a generic name. © Copyright 2012 Estraderm Hairstyles Diabetes no prescription Elisha Cuthbert Shoes Online Kamagra HIV Testing migraine meds no prescription drugs Elisha Cuthbert Without A Prescription Prom Hairstyles Gastrointestinal no prescription drugs Emma Watson Shoe Site Jessica Alba No Proof Prescription interna
