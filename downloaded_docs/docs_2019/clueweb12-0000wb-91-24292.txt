Erythromicin is a common misspelling of erythromycin. Bacterial infections such as acne, acute pelvic inflammatory disease, chlamydia , and pertussis can all be treated with the antibiotic erythromycin. This prescription drug works by inhibiting the action of ribosomes, a component of bacteria cells that aids in the formation of protein. As a result, bacteria are unable to properly grow and multiply. Commonly expected side effects of erythromycin include diarrhea , nausea, and vomiting. In fact, diarrhea is so often seen with this drug that it is often prescribed in an off-label fashion to treat diabetic gastroparesis in order to increase the rate at which food moves through the digestive tract. If the diarrhea is bloody or accompanied by muscle weakness, stomach pain, or dark urine, a healthcare provider should be seen right away.
