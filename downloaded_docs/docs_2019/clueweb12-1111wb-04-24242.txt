Because they contain a very high percentage of Leptospermum honey, MEDIHONEY dressings are able to work in the presence of wound fluid, blood, and tissue, thus promoting an optimal healing environment. MEDIHONEY dressings provide a moist, occlusive environment conducive to optimal wound healing. As wound exudate is absorbed, the alginate forms a gel, making the dressings easy to remove without disrupting the wound bed. The dressings are indicated for the management of moderate to heavily exuding wounds such as: •diabetic foot ulcers •Venous stasis leg ulcers •Arterial leg ulcers •Leg ulcers of mixed etiology •Pressure ulcers (I-IV) •1st and 2nd degree burns. •Donor sites. •Traumatic and surgical wounds.
