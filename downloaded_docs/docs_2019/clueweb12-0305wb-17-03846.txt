Eating plenty of fiber and increasing fluid intake can help reduce constipation by softening the stools and reducing pressure on the bowels.  Fruits, vegetables and whole grains are excellent sources of fiber.  A proper diet can prevent formation of new hemorrhoids and lessen the prolapsing of existing ones.  For those who already suffer from hemorrhoids, adding bulk laxatives, such as psyllium mucilloid (METAMUCIL), KONSYL, or polycarbophil (FIBERCON), to the diet may be necessary.  Fiber intake of 25 to 30 grams daily and drinking eight to ten glasses of water every day is also the recommended regimen for reducing constipation.
