Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass 2. Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass 3. Biliopancreatic diversion/Duodenal switch. New Life Surgery believes these surgeries to be the most effective for 
        weight loss. All three provide the means for significant weight loss, 
        though they work in different ways. Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Stomach Bypass is the most common form of weight loss surgery in the United 
        States because it results in reliable weight loss with acceptable risks 
        and minimal side effects. Success rate of weight loss: The Roux-en-Y gastric 
        bypass has noted at least 80% of patients lose 50% or more of their excess 
        weight and successfully maintain. Gastric bypass surgery does not eliminate 
        the desire for food, but the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass makes it difficult 
        and uncomfortable to overeat. Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Laparoscopic gastric bypass is the same surgery as the open Roux-en-Y 
        but it is done minimally invasive. Instead of one 8-10inch incision, the 
        surgery is performed through 6-7 small incisions. Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD)/Duodenal switch Success rate of weight loss: BPD/Duodenal switch is currently the most 
        successful surgery for weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. The 
        average weight loss is 70-% or more of excess weight and long term. Bariatric

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
