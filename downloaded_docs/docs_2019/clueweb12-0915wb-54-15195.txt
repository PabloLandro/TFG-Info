Contact your Charlottesville or Waynesboro podiatrist to find the right exercise plan for you. Iliotibial band syndrome is also a common injury found among female runners and triathletes. The IT band is made up of tissue that runs on the outside of the thigh, from the pelvis to just below the knee. While crucial to stability during activity, its continual abrasion against the top of the femur and the knee can make it inflamed, causing pain in the hip, thigh and/or knee. Often, using a foam roller can help runners prevent and heal sore IT bands. Stretching is a great preventative measure for IT band pain. Try standing straight up, and bending to the side as far down as is comfortable. Two sets of 15 repetitions on each side should work wonders. Hip flexor exercises can do the trick as well. Kneel on one knee and turn the torso until you feel a stretch on the IT band. Hold this for 5-10 seconds, and repeat 3 times on each side. Again, consult Dr. Murray and Dr. Chang or another licensed professional to design the appropriate workout for you. Shin splints, known to doctors as medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), result from too much force on the shinbone and the connective tissue attaching muscles to it. If you run, chances are that you’ve had the ‘splints. Studies show that up to 15% of running injuries are shin splints, and the advertisements in the back of running magazines are certainly a good testament to that fact. Shin splints are common among runners who have flat feet or over-pronate. In other cases they are caused by tightness in other various muscles and tendons (another good incentive to warming up and stretch!) and by increasing mileage too quickly. Try your best not to increase mileage more than 10% per week; especially with the female disposition to have diminished bone density, female runners are up to 3.5 times more likely than men to contract stress fractures from shin splints. By far, the single most important to preventing shin splints, along with all of the Q-angle injuries mentioned above, is wearing properly fitted shoes and being attentive to when your shoes are worn out. Your local shoe dealers, Ragged Mountain Running , the Charlottesville Running Company and Richey and Co. Shoes , can all provide foot assessments and expert advice about properly fitting shoes. Age and Hormone-Related Causes of Injuries The female Q angle can take tolls on knees, ankles and feet of all ages. High school athletes have a high incidence of injuries to the ligaments in the knees, primarily the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL), because they tend to lack the lateral stability and endurance necessary for optimal performance and injury prevention. Some experts write that 30% of all ACL tears occur among high school females due to the Q-Angle of the female hip. Some helpful tips for ACL/MCL injury prevention among teens include not neglecting a 5-10 minute warm up, followed by stretching, planning for rest, and staying hydrated. High school athletes can also benefit from light to moderate lateral plyometrics such as lunges and squats, and even light weight lifting. Female-specific hormones may have great effect on female runners throughout their lives. Hormones, such as relaxin, that women release during pregnancy lead to the relaxation of ligaments. Biologically, this allows for smoother births, but these hormones can affect ligaments in the feet, leading to arch pain, collapsed arches, plantar fasciitis and over pronation. While the jury is still out on the benefits of running during pregnancy, most experts agree that easy running in moderation can be helpful for second trimester moms who are runners, as long as it is balanced with enough time resting the feet and attentiveness to overheating and hear rate levels. Consult your obstetrician to determine a proper exercise routine during your pregnancy. Not surprisingly, pregnancy may necessitate larger shoe sizes due to swelling. Ligament laxity may permanently increase shoe sizes or altered foot shape. Cramming a new foot size into old shoes too often results in foot and ankle pain. Contact your local shoe experts to determine whether your shoe size has changed, and what the best new fit might be – your feet are worth it! And what about running injuries during menopause? The experts are still out on whether running correlates to an easier ride through menopause. However, the precaution about menopause often is that diminishing bone density resulting from hormonal changes can often lead to osteoporosis. Boosting the amount of calcium in your diet to between 1000-1500 mg before menopause is a good preventative measure to ward off post-menopausal osteoporosis, especially for female runners. Keeping running and strength training up can keep your bones strong, help prevent bone fractures and healthy circulation, not to mention running’s other physical and emotional benefits! Other Causes of Female Injuries In addition to biology, nurture, or cultural influences, may be factors in female injuries as well. High heels often lead to bunions , hammertoe , ingrown toenails , sesamoid injuries , Morton’s Neuroma , back pain and other problems. Remember that good-looking shoes are not exclusive of comfort. Consider buying shoes with arch support and room in the toe box from stores like Richey and Co. Shoes . But high heels are not the only culprits of foot and ankle pain! If your running or athletic shoes do not fit or are worn out, you can likely injure your legs, ankles or feet. Be attentive to the wear in your shoes, and buy new athletic shoes frequently – according to your podiatric experts, Dr. Murray and Dr. Chang , the appropriate shoes will prevent a host of injuries! Unfortunately, female athletes are particularly susceptible to eating disorders, and what doctors have come to know as the “Female Athlete Triad.” The triad is made up of an eating disorder and weight loss, amenorrhea (missed periods), and osteoporosis. Poor nutrition can lead to bone loss, decreased serum estrogen levels, psychological abnormalities, and, in extreme cases, death. Those who suffer from the Female Athlete Triad may experience fatigue, anemia, depression, decreased concentration, constipation, cold intolerance, and parotid gland enlargement seen in the cheeks. If this isn’t bad enough, the boneless can cause stress fractures that will not heal without proper nutrition and self-care. Nurture your body! Healthy eating leads to strong bones and can keep you strong, fit and running your best. Balanced and healthy diets improve athletic performance, prevent osteoporosis, and aid in the healing of injuries. Consuming a target of 1000 mg of calcium per day, with sufficient Vitamin D for calcium absorption (which can either be derived from sunlight or regulated supplements), will help prevent stress fractures .

So, to all the female runners out there, stay strong and inspired, and remember that consulting your doctor, fully understanding the various causes of injuries and taking care of yourself will aid in injury prevention and healing.

If you’re ever experienced a similar injury, we would love to hear about your experience in the comments. What is the Achilles Tendon? A tendon is a band of tissue that connects a muscle to a bone.  The Achilles tendon runs down the back of the lower leg and connects the  calf muscle to the heel bone. Also called the “heel cord,” the Achilles  tendon facilitates walking by helping to raise the heel off the ground. What is an Achilles Tendon Rupture? An Achilles tendon rupture is a complete or partial tear that  occurs when the tendon is stretched beyond its capacity. Forceful  jumping or pivoting, or sudden accelerations of running, can overstretch  the tendon and cause a tear. An injury to the tendon can also result  from falling or tripping. Achilles tendon ruptures are most often seen  in “weekend warriors”— typically, middle-aged people participating in  sports in their spare time. Less commonly, illness or medications, such  as steroids or certain antibiotics, may weaken the tendon and contribute  to ruptures. Signs and Symptoms A person with a ruptured Achilles tendon may experience one or more of the following: • Sudden pain (which feels like a kick or a stab) in the back of the ankle or calf—often subsiding into a dull ache • A popping or snapping sensation • Swelling on the back of the leg between the heel and the calf • Difficulty walking (especially upstairs or uphill) and difficulty rising up on the toes These symptoms require prompt medical attention to prevent further  damage. Until the patient is able to see a doctor, the “R.I.C.E.” method  should be used. This involves: • Rest. Stay off the injured foot and ankle, since walking can cause pain or further damage. • Ice. Apply a bag of ice covered with a thin towel to reduce swelling and pain. Do not put ice directly against the skin. • Compression. Wrap the foot and ankle in an elastic bandage to prevent further swelling. • Elevation. Keep the leg elevated to reduce the swelling. It should be even with or slightly above heart level. Diagnosis In diagnosing an Achilles tendon rupture, the foot and ankle surgeon  will ask questions about how and when the injury occurred and whether  the patient has previously injured the tendon or experienced similar  symptoms. The surgeon will examine the foot and ankle, feeling for a  defect in the tendon that suggests a tear. Range of motion and muscle  strength will be evaluated and compared to the uninjured foot and  ankle.  If the Achilles tendon is ruptured, the patient will have less  strength in pushing down (as on a gas pedal) and will have difficulty  rising on the toes. The diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is  typically straightforward and can be made through this type of  examination. In some cases, however, the surgeon may order an MRI or  other advanced imaging tests. Treatment Treatment options for an Achilles tendon rupture include  surgical and non-surgical approaches. The decision of whether to proceed  with surgery or non-surgical treatment is based on the severity of the rupture and the patient’s health status and activity level. Non-Surgical Treatment Non-surgical treatment, which is generally associated with a  higher rate of re-rupture, is selected for minor ruptures, less active  patients, and those with medical conditions that prevent them from  undergoing surgery. Non-surgical treatment involves use of a cast,  walking boot, or brace to restrict motion and allow the torn tendon to  heal. Surgery Surgery offers important potential benefits. Besides decreasing  the likelihood of re-rupturing the Achilles tendon, surgery often  increases the patient’s push-off strength and improves muscle function  and movement of the ankle. Various surgical techniques are available to  repair the rupture. The surgeon will select the procedure best suited to  the patient. Following surgery, the foot and ankle are initially  immobilized in a cast or walking boot. The surgeon will determine when  the patient can begin weightbearing. Complications such as incision  healing difficulties, re-rupture of the tendon, or nerve pain can arise  after surgery. Physical Therapy Whether an Achilles tendon rupture is treated surgically or  non-surgically, physical therapy is an important component of the  healing process. Physical therapy involves exercises that strengthen the  muscles and improve the range of motion of the foot and ankle.
