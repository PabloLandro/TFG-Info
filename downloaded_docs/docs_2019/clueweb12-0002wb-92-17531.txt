Bø K, Kvarstein B, Nygaard I Norwegian University of Sport and Physical Education, Department of Sport Medicine, Oslo, Norway. kari.bo@nih.no OBJECTIVE: Pelvic floor muscle training effectively treats female stress urinary incontinence . However, data on long-term efficacy and adherence are sparse. Our aims were to assess current lower urinary tract symptoms and exercise adherence 15 years after ending organized training. METHODS: Originally, 52 women with urodynamic stress urinary incontinence were randomly assigned to home or intensive exercise. After 6 months, 60% in the intensive group were almost or completely continent, compared with 17% in the home group. Fifteen years later, all original study subjects were invited to complete a postal questionnaire assessing urinary symptoms (using validated outcome tools) and current pelvic floor muscle training. RESULTS: Response rate was 90.4%. There were no differences in any urinary outcomes or satisfaction between the 2 study groups as a whole or when restricted to those without intervening stress urinary incontinence surgery. One half of both groups had stress urinary incontinence surgery during the 15-year follow-up period. Twenty-eight percent performed pelvic floor muscle training at least weekly; this rate did not differ by original group assignment or operated status. More operated women reported severe incontinence (P = .03) and leakage that interfered with daily life (P = .04) than did nonoperated women. There were no other differences between operated and nonoperated women. CONCLUSION: The marked benefit of intensive pelvic floor muscle training seen short-term was not maintained 15 years later. Long-term adherence to training is low. Urinary symptoms were equally common in both operated and nonoperated women. Further studies are needed to understand factors associated with long-term effectiveness of stress urinary incontinence treatments. Published 2 May 2005 in Obstet Gynecol , 105(5): 999-1005.
