If you have infrequently bowel movements or have to strain to have them, then this sets up the conditions to create piles.  When you strain to have a bowel movement, you cause blood to congest in the rectum.  This blood congestion causes an increase in pressure in the abdomen and rectum veins and over time these veins balloon out, turning into piles.  Pressure in the abdomen obstructs the return of blood from the rectum. There are many changes that you have to make to get rid of constipation.  The first, the one most people think about, is to increase dietary fiber.  But if you do this, it is best to understand what fiber to use and how much to eat.  And, you have to make some changes in your diet, if you are eating mostly processed foods.  The other cause of piles is emotions or anxiety.  When it comes to illness or body imbalances, they usually have some emotional component to it.  So it is always best to make changes in diet and to see what emotional issues are related to your piles. There are, of course, other causes of piles.  Any activity that puts excess pressure on the abdomen and rectum veins can cause piles.  If you are pregnant, or if you sneeze or cough frequently, exercise too much, lift weights, or stand or sit too long, these conditions can lead to piles.  If you couple these conditions with a poor diet, then you increase the probability of piles.  Look at these various activities you do and make adjustments to their frequency. Do not mistake itching for piles.  Itching can be a sign of allergies, yeast infection, parasites, or the use of coarse toilet paper.  Piles are usually distinguished by bleeding, inflammation, swelling, pain, or irritation. The first step in dealing with your piles is to stop straining to have a bowel movement.  You can do this by increasing your fiber intake.  It is always best to use natural fiber.  When you used un-natural fiber, which is found in drugstore laxatives, you can become addicted to them.  Use cereal in the morning that has wheat ban or oat bran.  You can add wheat germ to get more fiber and to get the B-vitamin. 60-Day Risk FREE Trial People Said About Calmovil Hemorrhoid Cure " I discovered a pea size growth on my butt that hurt so bad, I couldn't even sit!

Also eat vegetable with lunch and dinner.  Raw vegetables are best and if you cook them, cook them lightly.  Cooking vegetables diminishes the value of their fiber. Look at your stools.  Short ones or hard ones show the lack of fiber.  If they sink quickly to the bottom of toilet water, they lack fiber.  Your stools should be one long piece and brownish.  They should be soft but should stay together in the water and float. Eat a variety of natural fiber that comes from grains, fruits and vegetables.
