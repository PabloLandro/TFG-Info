<0.001). HIV prevalence was comparable among uncircumcised and circumcised men (4.6% and 4.2%, respectively; table 1 ). Similarly, there was little difference in prevalence of other, self-reported, sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the
                                 past 12 months (although it should be noted that STI transmission may also occur by means other than anal intercourse).

                                       circumcised and uncircumcised men Overall, 39.9% of men reported any unprotected anal intercourse in the past 12 months and this was similar by circumcision
                                 status ( table 1 ). Of these, 22.4% reported exclusive UIAI, and circumcised men were more likely to report this than uncircumcised men ( table 1 ). Among men who reported always being the insertive partner, none of the circumcised men tested HIV positive (0/27), compared
                                 with 2.5% (2/79) of uncircumcised men. Few men (13.9%) reported being willing to take part in an HIV prevention research study on circumcision, while 20.1% reported
                                 that they did not know if they would be willing to do so ( table 1 ). Only 11.3% of uncircumcised men reported being willing to take part. Previous Section Next Section Discussion This is the first study to assess the association between circumcision and HIV among MSM in Scotland, although some study
                                 limitations should be noted. The data are cross-sectional and causality cannot be inferred. The oral fluid sample response
                                 rate was relatively low and may not be representative. However, the overall survey response rate was higher (71%), and only
                                 age differed between the men who did and did not provide oral fluid specimens; suggesting that the men who provided these
                                 were representative of the larger venue-based sample. Finally, circumcision status was self-reported, although this has been
                                 shown to be a valid measure. 14 We found no evidence of an association between circumcision and HIV or other self-reported STI among MSM in Scotland, similar
                                 to findings elsewhere. 3–5 Among men reporting unprotected anal intercourse, less than one-quarter exclusively favoured the insertive role, which might
                                 plausibly provide partial protection against HIV infection. In contrast to a recent US study, 15 this behaviour was more common among circumcised than uncircumcised men; and none of the circumcised men who were exclusively
                                 the insertive partner tested HIV positive. Although findings are inconsistent across studies, a possibly protective effect
                                 among this group has been reported, 4 and merits further investigation. There are few studies of the willingness of uncircumcised MSM to be circumcised. 4 One, from the USA, found that 53% were willing to be circumcised. 16 However, our findings are similar to those of the London study, in which only one in 10 uncircumcised men were willing to
                                 participate in circumcision research. 12 Together with the low levels of exclusive UIAI in these populations, these findings suggest that a randomised controlled
                                 trial of male circumcision for HIV prevention is unlikely to be feasible in the UK. Although circumcision may be partly protective
                                 against HIV infection for those men who are exclusively insertive partners, our results suggest that comprehensive HIV prevention
                                 strategies, including the promotion of consistent condom use, should continue to be the focus of prevention efforts among
                                 MSM. Key messages There was no evidence of an association between circumcision and HIV or other self-reported STI among MSM in Scotland. Among men reporting unprotected anal intercourse, less than one-quarter exclusively favoured the insertive role. With only 11% of uncircumcised men reporting willingness to take part in a HIV prevention research study on male circumcision,
                                          a randomised controlled trial of male circumcision for HIV prevention is unlikely to be feasible in this population.
