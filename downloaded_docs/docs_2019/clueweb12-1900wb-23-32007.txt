			HYPNOTHERAPY HYPNOSIS THERAPY STOP SMOKING? Using Advanced Structured 
    Hypnotherapy, the link of satisfaction between an 
			emotional part 
    of the subconscious mind and the cigarette will be broken and that desire for 
    a cigarette will be redirected into something more beneficial to the 
			individual. Hypnosis takes advantage of the mind's natural skills of imagination and 
			visualisation. Clients then picture 
    themselves free from the habit, filled with new health, 
    energy and vitality. 
    They are able to see themselves as healthier, more attractive, and more active. WHAT CLIENTS SAY: "It's been six 
			months now since I stopped. I have no feelings about smoking 
			anymore. What freaks me out is when I look back at my old self, 
			standing outside the office on a drizzly November day, huddled 
			together with all the other smokers! I realise now how much smoking 
			ruled my life." ----------------------------------- David Samson Dip Adv Hyp David Samson is a General
