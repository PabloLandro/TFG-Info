Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Musculoskeletal Complaints Bariatric Surgery information Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Musculoskeletal Complaints Pains in Neck, Shoulder, Spine, 
        Hip, Knee, Foot After Gastric Bypass Guide 
  to Weight Loss Surgery - Research Into Gastric 
  Reduction Surgery Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Musculoskeletal Complaints Over 18 months, researchers studied the frequency and prevalence of musculoskeletal 
        (MSK) complaints in obese patients before and after undergoing gastric 
        bypass surgery. The researchers concluded that the complaints, which involved 
        joint and tendon pain, decreased significantly following surgery and initial 
        weight loss, even in non-weight bearing areas of the body. Study Method The comprehensive review of MSK symptoms (neck, shoulder, spine, hip, 
        knee, foot pain, fibromyalgia syndrome, etc.) before and after weight 
        loss studied 54 patients recruited from University Hospitals of Cleveland's 
        Bariatric Surgery Program, according to Michele Hooper, MD, the study's 
        principal investigator and co-director of the Arthritis Translational 
        Research Program at University Hospitals of Cleveland. Patients Of the 54 patients who were studied, there were 52 women and two men 
        ranging in age from 35-53 years. For the female participants, the mean 
        weight before surgery was 292 pounds. Many patients suffered from the 
        following comorbid conditions before surgery: hypertension, sleep apnea, 
        type 2 diabetes, asthma, bladder incontinence and gastroesophageal reflux 
        disease. Results Dr. Hooper's findings, which will be presented in San Antonio at the 
        American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting on October 21, 2004, 
        demonstrated that there was decrease of 52% in the number of sites of 
        musculoskeletal complaints and a 92% reduction in fibromyalgia syndrome 
        pain (widespread pain and tenderness in muscles and soft tissue) between 
        6-12 months after surgery. There was significant improvement of function 
        and quality life as well. Musculoskeletal Indices Used Using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), 
        a leading outcome measure of osteoarthritis-related disabilities in the 
        hip and knee; as well as the London Fibromyalgia Epidemiology Study Screening 
        (LFESSQ), an index that test pain and fatigue criteria, Dr. Hooper and 
        colleagues found that there was a dramatic resolution of fibromyalgia 
        pain after surgery, which may be due to a decrease in the above stated 
        comorbid syndromes and an increase in physical activity. As weight loss 
        continues, these benefits may improve further. Conclusion "The study clearly showed the benefit of weight loss in terms of 
        pain, function and quality of life. We are now trying to understand why 
        certain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis are so much more common 
        than hip or ankle arthritis in people who are overweight," says Dr. 
        Hooper. Source: News Medical Net Stomach Bypass Surgery Information BARIATRIC SURGERY INFORMATION What Is Weight Loss Surgery | How to Qualify | Types

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
