Valerian is also very common all over Europe. The yellow-brown, tuberous rootstock produces a hollow, angular, furrowed stem with deeply dissected leaves each bearing 7-10 pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. The resulting smell of the dried, powdered rootstock is reminiscent of dirty socks or unwashed underwear. Various constituents within the root account for the peculiar smell and the strong sedative properties. The butyl isovalerate present has been used in a synthetic, fermented egg product to attract coyotes and repel deer, while eremophilene has also been detected in ripe African mangoes. The valepotriates exert strong tranquilizing actions on the central nervous system. German health authorities have indicated that valerian is an effective treatment for restlessness and for sleep disturbances resulting from nervous conditions. Ten controlled clinical studies have been conducted on various valerian preparations, including freeze-dried aqueous extracts, ethanol extracts, and other forms. Two studies involved only one test dose prior to evaluation. A recent German study showed no effects over the short term, but after twenty-eight days of treatment, valerian was shown to be better than a placebo in inducing sleep. This suggests that valerian root preparations may not be suitable for acute insomnia. More studies must be conducted to resolve differences in results with previous research. Valerian is perhaps best characterized as a minor tranquilizer. Valerian may be administered in the form of a tea, a tincture (hydroalcoholic solution), an extract, capsules, or tablets. Valerian is also added to bath water for external application. No significant side effects or contraindications are noted, although rare reports of gastrointestinal complaints or headache have been reported. VALERIAN ROOT USES Historical uses - Known as 'all-heal' in the Middle Ages, valerian was credited with many virtues -in particular with healing epilepsy. In 1592, Fabius Calumna published a detailed work on herbal medicine in which he claimed to have cured his epilepsy with the herb. Stress-related disorders - Valerian reduces mental over activity and nervous excitability, helping people who find it hard to 'switch off.' Valerian is beneficial for almost any stress-related condition, and, in general, has a calming, rather than directly sedative, effect on the mind. Anxiety and insomnia - Many symptoms of anxiety, including tremors, panic, palpitations, and sweating, can be relieved with valerian. Valerian is a useful remedy for insomnia, whether caused by anxiety or overexcitement. Effective relaxant - Valerian relaxes over contracted muscles, and is helpful for shoulder and neck tension, asthma, colic, irritable bowel syndrome, muscle spasms, and menstrual pain. High blood pressure - Valerian is used with other herbs in remedies for high blood pressure caused by stress and anxiety. Other medical uses - Phobia, Temporomandibular joint syndrome or disorder / TMJ (TMD), Urinary incontinence. HABITAT AND CULTIVATION Native to Europe and northern Asia, valerian grows wild in damp conditions. Valerian is cultivated in central and eastern Europe. The plant is grown from seed in spring, and the root and rhizome of 2-year-old plants are unearthed in autumn. VALERIAN ROOT RESEARCH Therapeutic properties - Extensive research in Germany and Switzerland has confirmed that valerian encourages sleep, improves sleep quality, and lowers blood pressure. Active constituents - The valepotriates are sedative and depressant, inducing sleep. Other constituents are also responsible for valerian's action, but they have not yet been identified. Nervous system - Valerian reduces nervous activity by prolonging the action of an inhibitory neurotransmitter. CONSTITUENTS Valerian contains volatile oil (inc, isovalerianic acid, borneol), valepotriates, alkaloids, iridoids. HOW MUCH VALERIAN ROOT TO TAKE Many people take 300-500 mg of valerian root herbal extract in capsules or tablets one hour before bedtime for insomnia. As an alcohol-based tincture, 5 ml can be taken before bedtime. Combination products with lemon balm, hops, passion flower, and skullcap can also be used. Children aged six to twelve often respond to half the adult dose. SIDE EFFECTS AND CAUTIONS Valerian should not be taken with alcohol. Recent research indicates that valerian does not impair ability to drive or operate machinery. Valerian does not lead to addiction or dependence. There are no known contraindications to using valerian during pregnancy or lactation. HOW VALERIAN ROOT WORKS IN THE BODY Valerian's usefulness in the nervous system is mainly due to the valepotriates, which have a sedative effect on the mind. One of its main uses is in insomnia, where it both helps the sufferer to fall asleep more quickly and allows them to wake in the morning without feeling stupefied. Valerian is particularly useful for those whose minds are so active they cannot switch off enough to relax. Valerian is helpful for all types of stress-related anxiety as it does not impair the ability to concentrate, but has a calming effect. Valerian is used to treat numerous ailments, for example digestive complaints where there is a contributing stress or tension factor. Valerian is also a muscle relaxant, and is used with other herbs in the cardiovascular system to treat high blood pressure. APPLICATIONS MACERATION - Soak 2 tsp of the chopped, preferably fresh root for 8-10 hours in a cup of cold water. Use as a sedating brew for anxiety and insomnia. Add 2 - 3 drops of peppermint water (available from pharmacies) to disguise the flavor. INFUSION - Use for anxiety and insomnia. TINCTURE - Use as a sedative or for insomnia. The dosage can vary considerably with individuals: up to 5 ml may be required, but in some people this can cause headaches, so start with low doses of 1 - 2 mI. Combine with licorice and other expectorants such as hyssop for coughs. Can be added to mixtures for high blood pressure where tension or anxiety is a contributory factor. COMPRESS - Soak a pad in the tincture to ease muscle cramps. WASH - Use the infusion or maceration for chronic ulcers and wounds, and for drawing splinters.
