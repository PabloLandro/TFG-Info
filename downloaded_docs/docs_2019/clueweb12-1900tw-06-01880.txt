Since Jan. 1, there have been 35 cases of pertussis -- also called whooping cough -- reported in Hillsborough County. The Florida Department of Health has reported 112 cases in Florida this year. The Tampa Tribune reports the Hillsborough cases came from seven families. A Hillsborough County Health Department spokesman says in one case an adult infected six children who did not have vaccinations. Officials say the illness starts with a low grade fever, runny nose, sneezing and a cough. Antibiotics can treat the illness, but children often cough for six to eight weeks. Health experts recommend booster shots for adults who expect to be around young children.
