Just passing through! 02-09-2010 09:28 AM - permalink Zoe Hi Andrew, I haven't been on this board for a while. I'm one of the moderators. i remember now some of your earlier posts. When were you diagnosed with pyridoxine dependency? How are you doing now? View Conversation About Me About Andrew Seizure Background Here is my story regarding B vitamins: I had my first seizure at two weeks old. I spent the first six months of my life in and out of hospital. Doctors were mystified by my illness. None of the normal antiepileptic drugs that were administered had any positive effects. At this time I was having many different types of seizures a day some of which went status. Countless tests were being done including, EEGs, lumber punctures etc. A top pediatrician from the main city hospital told my mother that he was going to a meeting. He said he would talk about me in the hope that someone there would be able to help us. At this meeting there was a professor who was doing research into childhood epilepsy. He suggested a trial of Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (vitamin B6). Pyridoxine Hydrochloride was administered (I was five months old). Within two to three days my mother noticed a big difference in me. Id stopped having severe seizures. Because of the positive effects that Pyridoxine had on my seizures doctors slowly weaned me off all the antiepileptic drugs (this was back in 1970-71). Ive been prescribed Pyridoxine Hydrochloride on a daily bases ever since. I attended a normal school thanks to vitamin B6. I was still experiencing my aura (seeing colours) when taking vitamin B6 only, so when I was 19 years old, with my doctor's consent, I added a multi B complex tablet to my daily medication. This stopped my aura. I have only used B vitamins (NO special Diets and NO extra minerals) to control my extremely rare, Atypical form of Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) Dependent Epilepsy. My ALDH7A1 gene appears to be normal according to the initial results of a genetic test. http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ALDH7A1 Without B vitamins (mainly vitamin B6 (pyridoxine HCL)) I would probably be mentally impared or worse due to severe seizure activity (Status Epilepticus). In my lifetime I have had two unsuccessful trials of Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs). B vitamins - for me - are the equivalent of your AED(s). http://faculty.washington.edu/sgospe/pyridoxine/index.html Then in 2005 I was diagnosed with Dyslexia and in 2011 Asperger's Syndrome (approx. 40 years after Pyridoxine Dependent seizures were diagnosed).  As far as I know Asperger's Syndrome is one of those conditions you are born with, it does not develop mid life as epilepsy can. I think vitamin B6, as well as controlling my seizures, has also been controlling the temper tantrums associated with my ASD condition (just as it controls the Keppra rage for some of you guys who use Keppra) and as a result my Asprger's Syndrome went unnoticed to many. http://www.autism.org.uk/asperger http://www.autism.org.uk/imported%20content/lazarus/approaches-therapies-and-interventions/diet-and-supplements/diet-and-vitamins-therapeutic-approaches.aspx (page 2) http://www.autism.com/pro_b6_studies.asp **DO NOT ALTER ANY MEDICATION WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S CONSENT** Treatments Vitamin B6 & Multi B complex tablet Location England Interests CAD (mainly 3D), Cosmology, Partical Physics, Art, Music, Vitamins, Fractals, Evolution...
