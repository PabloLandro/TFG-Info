Though Kegel may be an  effective treatment for fecal and urinary incontinence it has not been  "proven" to be effective for prolapse. As described above, prolapse  occurs due to a break in the fascia support system. Exercising the  pelvic floor muscles will not put these breaks back together nor will  it pull the prolapsed vagina, bladder, urethra, rectum, or uterus back  into position. A simple analogy: a patient with an umbilical (belly  button) hernia has a break in the supportive abdominal wall  fasciaâ€¦..all the sit-ups in the world may strengthen the abdominal wall  muscles but will never put the abdominal wall fascia back together.  However pelvic floor exercises may be useful especially when used in  conjunction with a pessary. Pelvic floor exercises will strengthen the  muscles of pelvic floor, and may enhance the ability to retain the  pessary in the vagina. Pessary Therapy A  pessary is a small device that can be inserted into the vagina to  support the prolapsed vagina and its neighboring organs. This may  relieve symptoms and reduce the prolapse, thus avoiding surgery. Many  different types of pessaries are available for prolapse and urinary  incontinence, some of which are shown below. :: next >> Prolapse Treatment 3400 Old Milton Pkwy, Building C, Suite 330, Alpharetta, GA 30005 | 9201 W Sunset Blvd Suite 406
