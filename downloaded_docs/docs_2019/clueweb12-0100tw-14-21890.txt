How to Prevent Muscle Cramps During Exercise « Nutrition Fun Facts Nutrition Fun Facts About My friends say I give USEABLE nutrition advice, so I'm going to start blogging… How to Prevent Muscle Cramps During Exercise February 10, 2012 During exercise it is not uncommon for your leg to cramp up, especially during exercises such as yoga or pilates where you have to hold a pose or flex intensely. Muscle cramps may be caused by poor circulation, fluid imbalance and/or a nutrient deficiency. First of all, always stay hydrated. Drink water before, during and after exercise. If you drink plenty of water, then it may be a mineral deficiency.  I’ve often heard trainers or instructors say “eat a banana for a leg cramp.” The reason is because bananas are high in potassium, but bananas are only one of many foods high in potassium. Some other minerals, such as calcium and magnesium may also be the culprit to leg cramps. Great Sources of Potassium: Sweet Potato Tomato Paste (or puree) Potatoes White Beans Yogurt Halibut Cod Fish Great sources of Calcium: Fortified Soy Milk or Almond Milk Sardines Pink Salmon Dairy Products (do choose low-fat or non-fat) Spinach Kale White Beans Great Sources of Magnesium: Get Nuts! Pumpkin and Squash Seed Kernels, Brazil Nuts, Almonds, Cashews, Pine Nuts Bran cereal Halibut Quinoa Spinach Buckwheat Flour White Beans One food item was repeated in all 3 lists. Did you notice what it was? White beans boast high amounts of potassium, calcium and magnesium and that might be just what you need to alleviate cramps during exercise. Remember to Stay Hydrated and Eat Right!
