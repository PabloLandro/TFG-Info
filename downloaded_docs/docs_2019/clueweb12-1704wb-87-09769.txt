With September being National Pain Awareness Month I wanted to mention a great therapy we offer at Grand Health Chiropractic & Wellness Center .  There is a treatment for pain caused by bulging or herniated spinal discs in the neck and back called spinal disc decompression therapy. The treatment is an alternative to surgery or prolonged treatment with prescription medications for patients. Medical journal research has placed the effectiveness of spinal disc decompression therapy at 75 to 92 percent with a relapse rate of 2 percent.  Many patients have been able to avoid surgery, prolonged treatment with prescription medications, and extended time in pain with spinal disc decompression therapy. Spinal Decompression Treatment is non-invasive and provides gentle decompression of the disc through the use of a decompression table. You are strapped to the table so that as it moves it applies a distraction force to the targeted area of the spine (the compressed disc). A computer controls the distraction force which is applied in between periods of relaxation. This gently pulls the spine apart elongating it and creating a small vacuum between the vertebrae which pulls the disc back into shape. Much like a repetitive stress injury the decompression works in very minute increments. But over time that adds up and lets the disc reshape itself, heal and get the proper flow of nutrients going to fight off brittleness and future injuries. Interested? Ask one of our Doctors if this is a good option for you. Original Article click here. www.pr.com This entry was posted in Back Pain , Chiropractic by GrandHealth . Bookmark the permalink .
