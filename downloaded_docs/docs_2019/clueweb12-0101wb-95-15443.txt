  Research Studies Laparoscopic Adjustable 
        Silicone Gastric Banding Weight Loss Surgery Operation An increasing number of surgeons with different levels of experience 
        with laparoscopic surgery and open obesity surgery have started to perform 
        laparoscopic implantation of the Lap-Band. Method An electronic patient data sheet was created and was mailed and e-mailed 
        to all surgeons performing laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding 
        (LASGB) in Italy. Patients were recruited since January 1996. Data on 
        1,265 Lap-Band System operated patients (258 M/1,007 F; mean BMI 44.1, 
        range 27.0-78.1; mean age 38, range 17-74 years) were collected from 23 
        surgeons performing this operation. Results Intra-operative mortality was absent. Post-operative mortality was 0.55% 
        (7 patients) for causes not specifically related to laparoscopic adjustable 
        silicone gastric banding implantation. The laparotomic conversion rate 
        was 1.7% (22 patients). Laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding 
        related complications occurred in 143 patients (11.3%). Pouch dilatation 
        was diagnosed in 65 (5.2%), and 28 (2.2%) of these underwent re-operation. 
        Band erosion was observed in 24 patients (1.9%). Port or connecting tube-port 
        complications occurred in 54 patients (4.2%), 12 of whom required revision 
        under general anesthesia. Follow-up was obtained at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 
        and 48 months, and mean BMI was respectively 38.4, 35.1, 33.1, 30.2, 32.1 
        and 31.5. The percentage of patients observed at each follow-up was > 
        60%. There was no intra-operative mortality and no complication-related 
        mortality, with acceptable weight loss. Conclusion The laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding operation is safe 
        and effective, and deserves wider use for treatment of morbid obesity. Source: Angrisani L, Alkilani M, Basso N, Belvederesi N, Campanile F, Capizzi

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
