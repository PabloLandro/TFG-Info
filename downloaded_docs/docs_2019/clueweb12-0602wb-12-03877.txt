All products are authentic brand names and will include a product information insert in English. Medical Information: Erythrocin tablets contain the active ingredient erythromycin, which is a type of medicine known as a macrolide antibiotic. It is used to treat infections caused by bacteria. (NB. Erythromycin is also available without a brand name, ie as the generic medicine.) Erythromycin works by preventing bacteria from producing proteins that are essential to them. Without these proteins the bacteria cannot grow, replicate and increase in numbers. Erythromycin doesn't directly kill the bacteria, but leaves them unable to increase in numbers. The remaining bacteria eventually die or are destroyed by the immune system. This treats the infection. Erythromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against a wide variety of bacteria that cause a wide variety of infections. Erythromycin may be used to treat infections of the upper or lower airways, skin or soft tissue, eyes or ears. It may also be used to treat certain sexually-transmitted infections, oral and dental infections, and to prevent infections in people who are at risk, for example due to surgery, trauma or burns. Erythromycin is also used for treating inflammatory acne, as it is active against the bacteria associated with acne, Propionebacterium acnes. This is a common type of bacteria that feeds on sebum produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. It produces waste products and fatty acids that irritate the sebaceous glands, making them inflamed and causing spots. By controlling bacterial numbers, erythromycin brings the inflammation of the sebaceous glands under control, and allows the skin to heal. (Other antibiotics may be preferred for acne however, as strains of the Propionebacterium that are resistant to erythromycin are becoming widespread.) To make sure the bacteria causing an infection are susceptible to erythromycin your doctor may take a tissue sample, for example a swab from the throat or skin. Erythromycin has a similar range of antibacterial activity to penicillin and so is also useful as an alternative to penicillin in people who are allergic to penicillins. What is it used for? Bacterial infections of the lungs (chest or lower respiratory tract), eg bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease. Bacterial infection of the nasal passages, sinuses or throat (upper respiratory tract infection), eg sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis. Whooping cough. Bacterial infection of the middle ear (otitis media) or outer ear canal (otitis externa). Bacterial mouth infections, eg gum disease (gingivitis), Vincent's angina. Bacterial infection of the eyelids (blepharitis). Bacterial infections of the skin or soft tissue, eg boils, abscesses, cellulitis, impetigo, erysipelas. Acne. Chronic inflammatory disorder of the facial skin (acne rosacea). Bacterial infections of the stomach and intestines. Inflammation of bone due to bacterial infection (osteomyelitis). Inflammation of the urethra due to bacterial infection (urethritis). Inflammation of the prostate gland due to bacterial infection (prostatitis). Gonorrhoea.Syphilis.Diphtheria.Scarlet fever. Prevention of bacterial infection following surgery, burns, trauma or dental procedures.
