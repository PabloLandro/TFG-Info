Send Enquiry Gloves Full Arms The most important effect is that compression increases the pressure in the tissue under the skin (subcutaneous) helping to reduce and prevent swelling. The compression of subcutaneous tissue helps move excess fluid (swelling) back into the capillaries (tiniest of the blood vessels) and helps prevent too much fluid from leading out of these little vessels. For arm sleeves, the greatest compression begins at the wrist and decreases up the arm.
