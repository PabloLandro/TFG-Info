They were explaining the differences in caffeine substituents. Here is part of the essay that I thought you all would enjoy: Caffeine belongs to a family of naturally occurring compounds called Xanthines. They stimulate the central nervous system and the skeletal muscles. Caffeine is the strongest Xanthine. Theophylline, a second xanthine found in tea, has fewer central nervous system effects but is a strong myocardial (heart muscle) stimulant, it dilates the coronary artery that supplies blood to the heart. It is most important in the treatment of bronchial asthma because it relaxes the bronchioles of the lungs. Because it is also a vasodilator (relaxes blood vessels) it is used to treat hypertensive headaches. It is also used to alleviate and to reduce the frequency of attacks of angina pectoris (severe chest pain). Awesome, I had no idea about the whole headache thing. link Reply Comments: From: daisyhunter 2008-04-13 04:01 pm (UTC) ( Link ) caffeine is one of the little tricks for migraines.
