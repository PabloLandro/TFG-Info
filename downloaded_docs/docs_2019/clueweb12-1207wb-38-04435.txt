        - 399-4919 [Map] Chicago Acupuncture ™ is one of the top
      Acupuncture clinics in Chicago. Larisa Turin, the founder of Chicago Acupuncture ™ , has over 35 years of experience in Oriental and
      Western Medicine. Whether it's a chronic disease, migraines, infertility,
      pain, menopause, immune disorders, or any other condition you might have,
      Larisa will make sure that you get the personalized treatment you deserve
      so you can join the hundred's of other patients that she has successfully
      treated. The foundation of her success is the unique combination of
        experience  and
        education as both a physician and an oriental medicine practitioner. She merges the best aspects of western medicine
  (diagnosis, physiology, and disease etiology) with those of Chinese medicine
  (treatment of the root of the disease instead of just the symptoms,
  restoring overall body balance without the side effects of medications).
  Larisa specializes in the treatment of chronic and complex conditions, as well
  as anti-aging and longevity medicine. Larisa's knowledge of anatomy
  as well as many years of experience allows her to perform safe and painless
  acupuncture. Read more about
