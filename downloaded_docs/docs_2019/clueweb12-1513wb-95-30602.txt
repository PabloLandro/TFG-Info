        Oct 28th, 2009        • Category: True Health Tip Did  you know that honey is the ultimate super food? Based on the numerous health  benefits, honey may provide more nutrients, vitamins and minerals than meat, eggs, milk, grains and vegetables. Plus, it only contains about 100 calories  per teaspoon. Unlike  refined sugar, honey and other natural sugars—found in dates, figs and raisins—are  live physiological sugars which contain the germs of life. “Flowers of sulphur” or bee pollen with raw honey can even be applied topically to the skin to  promote healing. According to the Waikato Honey Research Unit, honey is now being accepted as a standard  of care in treating skin ulcers as well as wounds and burns. Researchers indicate that applying honey to your skin helps douse inflammation, swelling and pain… causes offensive odors to vanish— and promotes the skin to heal rapidly with little scarring. In many cases, honey was more effective in treating infected lesions that were not responding to standard antibiotic and antiseptic therapy. Whether you eat it or slather it on your skin, honey is good for you inside and out.
