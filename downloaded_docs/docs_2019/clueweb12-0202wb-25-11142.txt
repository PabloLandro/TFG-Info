Migraines [Archive]  - FIAR Forums FIAR Forums > Family Room Boards > In Sickness and in Health >  Migraines PDA View Full Version : Migraines Kendra AU 05-05-2011, 09:23 PM I'm having another bought with them and it's making me miserable and weepy. If I could think straight long enough to figure out what would be really fun to do I'd take the kids and so just that, but honestly I can't think straight! :lol: I also have a 30-40 minute drive with my guys and my mil tomorrow to the local Agricultural Festival that's on each year. It's always gobs of fun, but man I'm dreading that ride right now. My mil, bless, her will chat the whole way but I have to be able to focus on some of what she says, kwim? :lol: Rachel Jane 05-06-2011, 06:37 AM :group::group::group::group: Kendra AU 05-06-2011, 04:22 PM I actually woke up with one yesterday and it only progressed steadily all day due to some emotional stress. It also looks like I was battling the cold the boys had two weeks previous. That said I feel so much better today! I'm not as freaked about that car ride right now. :lol: Penny 05-10-2011, 11:28 PM Hi, If you are getting them 2 or more times a week I recommend taking feverfew everyday for about 6 weeks. I was having a terrible time with that and after about 6 weeks of feverfew....tada....not a single one since. I was getting them 3 to 4 times a week and thought my head would explode but feverfew saved my sanity. HTH, Penny JavaJackie 05-11-2011, 07:52 AM I had a migrain yesterday and while I pretty much know how to help treat them based on how bad they are but I am having trouble with the day after pain. My head is so sore today and I am still have trouble with light and sound. Any thoughts on how to treat the headache hangover?

My head is so sore today and I am still have trouble with light and sound. Any thoughts on how to treat the headache hangover? I take old fashioned aspirin for this.  It takes some of the edge off and keeps me from getting into the rebound headache loop.  Also, I sip caffeine free coke (NOT diet).  This keeps the stomach upset settled and manageable. vBullet
