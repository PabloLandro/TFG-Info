Most people find that purchasing a donut cushion can greatly reduce the pain and discomfort of hemorrhoids .

This just means that you should eat some more fiber or maybe take a type of softener for your stool so you are able to pass on your stools easier. The bleeding is most likely occuring because your stools are too hard, and they are aggravating the hemorrhoid as they pass through. Hemorrhoids often itch, but do all you can to resist scratching. Scratching can lead to infections, and can cause serious damage to the area. If the area is bothering you, try taking a damp cloth and patting the area to cleanse it. The itching might be caused by not having the area clean enough, so cleaning the area may relieve some itching. If you are battling a hemorrhoid, you should avoid any heavy lifting as this can exacerbate the condition. Increased pressure on veins causes them to swell, leaving you in much discomfort and pain. If you get hemorrhoids often you should be certain that you drink more water. Water naturally hydrates your body, helping your stool to become softer and easier to pass. You should avoid alcohol and caffeine. As mentioned earlier, hemorrhoids can happen as a result of pregnancy or childbirth or a number of other circumstances.
