We give them the best diet we can, whilst trying to steer them away from all of the drinks and sweets that just taste so delicious. It is a bit of an uphill battle especially when they sail of to school where you cannot keep an eye on them. Hopefully, they have learnt to do all that you instructed of them and at least rinse their mouths after they have eaten…of course they haven’t! Now they are running with the pack, they are stuffing themselves with everything you haven’t given them- kids will be kids. But before you have a heart attack, sit down and relax because there is one last thing you can do which might just save the day and that is to have them kitted out with dental sealants at the dentists. They are a thin film of plastic that is laid over the more vulnerable surfaces of the teeth and are resistant to the acids that come from sugar. With a sealant in place, you are seriously cutting down the chances of tooth decay getting through and it can last anywhere up to 10 years, by which time, your kid’s should have shed the desire to eat everything and be grown up enough to understand about the dangers of poor oral health…you’d think eh?!
