Russell C, Dodds L, Armson BA, Kephart G, Joseph KS Department of Community Health and Epidemiology , Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the rate of diabetes up to 13 years after pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes and to identify risk factors for developing diabetes . The role of a subsequent pregnancy, with and without gestational diabetes , was also examined. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of women with gestational diabetes . POPULATION AND SETTING: Women who had gestational diabetes in their first pregnancy between 1989 and 2002 were identified through a population-based perinatal database in Nova Scotia, Canada. METHODS: Subsequent diagnoses of diabetes , up to 13 years after the first pregnancy, were obtained from physician billing and hospital discharge databases. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of diabetes after pregnancy. RESULTS: Of the 1401 nulliparous women with gestational diabetes , 251 women (17.9%) developed diabetes in the follow-up period. The cumulative incidence at 1, 5, and 10 years was 5.9, 14.8, and 22.2%, respectively. Factors significantly associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus included a pre-pregnancy weight of > or = 86 kg (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9), insulin therapy during the index pregnancy (RR = 4.1, 95% CI 2.1-7.9), neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.2), and a subsequent pregnancy with gestational diabetes (RR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.4). CONCLUSION: Indicators of the severity of gestational diabetes , defined by insulin use, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and recurrent gestational diabetes in a subsequent pregnancy, are important in predicting a subsequent diagnosis of diabetes . Our findings do not support the theory that subsequent pregnancy, per se, increases the risk of developing diabetes . Published 17 December 2007 in BJOG , 115(2): 253-9; discussion 260.
