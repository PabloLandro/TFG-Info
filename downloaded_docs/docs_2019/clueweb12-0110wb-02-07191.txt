frequent cause 
          of night leg cramping. Cramps are often caused by a lack of 
potassium , 
          resulting in an electrytic imbalance. Strenuous exercise with 
sweating 
          and diarrhea or other bowel disease may cause loss of 
potassium and 
          other important minerals. It is very important to replace them
 with 
          supplements. Some people get leg cramps at night for no 
apparent reason. 
          This is called restless legs syndrome . Another cause may be a deficiency in 
hesperidin , 
          one of the bioflavonoids (sometimes called vitamin P), 
naturally occurring 
          nutrients usually found in association with vitamin C. These 
bioflavonoids, 
          including Hesperidin, Citrin, Rutin, Flavones, Flavonals, 
Calechin and 
          Quercetin, were found to be essential in correcting the night
 
          leg cramps . Wine induces stomach cramps in 
some people. 
          To ease the cramps or perhaps eliminate them altogether, take 
some 
          olive oil before imbibing. Try some oil on bread, or on a 
salad. Milk and other dairy 
products can cause abdominal cramping, bloating, gas and discomfort in 
some women. 
          If you are eating dairy products to get calcium, try switching
 to yogurt, 
          lentils, broccoli, cabbage, tofu, collard and other greens, 
turnips, 
          rhubarb and almonds. Gastroenteritis , caused by a 
virus 
          that has entered the digestive tract or contaminated food or 
water, 
          causes inflammation, cramping, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. 
Severe 
          cases can lead to dehydration, so be sure to drink fluids and 
balance 
          your electrolytes (take Pedialyte for young children and the 
elderly, 
          and sports drinks for everybody else.) Diarrhea caused by intestinal parasites is the third leading 
          cause of illness. If you have a number of the following 
symptoms: gas, 
          diarrhea, chronic constipation, bloating, fatigue, skin 
rashes, nail 
          biting, mood swings, insomnia, dry skin, brittle hair, hair 
loss, weight 
          gain, bad breath, and muscle cramping, you should be tested 
for parasites. Tips To stop leg/foot cramping, firmly press in on the 
upper lip . This is the meridian which is connected to the legs 
and feet. Take a hot shower before going to bed, 
            letting the water run down the part of your leg that gets 
cramps. 
            Or, if you get cramps in the night, take a shower then. Get 
the water 
            as hot as you can stand it, as this will help relax the 
muscles. If you are in bed when you get a leg cramp, stretch 
            your leg straight out and bend the toes back toward
 your 
            head. Hold in this position for 30 seconds, relax, and 
repeat until 
            the cramp is gone.This will stretch out your calf muscle. 
You may 
            also do this standing up - push your heel onto the floor and
 bend 
            your toes upward. This forces the calf muscle to lengthen. If you get leg cramps frequently at night, start a stretching
 
            regimen before bed. Try pressing your toes against a
 wall 
            to stretch out the calf muscles; hold for 30 seconds, relax,
 repeat 
            several times. Cramping often comes while you are exercising. follow 
            these tips: Keep hydrated . As you sweat, you 
		        lose important electrolytes, which are needed to prevent 
cramps. Warm up for 10-15 minutes before 
		        exercising. This will stretch out the muscles you will be 
using. If you exercise and get cramps after eating ,
 
		        you have probably begun your exercise too soon after eating. 
As 
		        you digest, your body diverts blood from your muscles and 
cramping 
		        can result. Take magnesium, potassium and calcium supplements 
		        daily, especially before exercising. Remedies Folk Apple cider vinegar Drink a mixture of two teaspoons 
of vinegar 
          and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of warm water. Apple 
cider vinegar 
          is high in potassium. Aspirin (or ibuprofen) taken at the earliest
 signs 
          of menstrual cramps will help relieve them. 
Aspirin 
          helps stop the production of prostaglandins, part of the 
process that 
          causes cramps. Calcium A calcium deficiency causes muscle 
cramps 
          or involuntary movement of muscles. If you are prone to leg 
cramps at 
          night, take a calcium supplement (calcium lactate is 
preferred), a warm 
          cup of milk, or chew on some Tums an hour before going to bed.
 However, 
          we do not recommend taking Tums on a regular basis due 
to its 
          interference with your normal digestive process. We suggest 
that if 
          you get frequent leg cramps you take a calcium supplement 
daily. Taking 
          magnesium with the calcium will aid in the absorption of the 
calcium 
          and prevent calcification of various organs and soft tissues. 
200-300 
          mg of calcium before bedtime is recommended. Chamomile tea A study showed that drinking 
five cups 
          of this tea each day for two weeks reduced the pain of menstrual
 
          cramps . The tea increased the level of glycine in the
 urine. 
          Glycine is an amino acid that helps relieve muscle spasms and 
relax 
          the uterus. CoQ10 may aid in relieving muscle cramps. Magnesium will help the smooth muscles that 
surround 
          your arteries to relax, and your body uses it to process 
calcium. Try 
          taking 400 mg of magnesium before bed. A calcium/magnesium 
supplement, 
          taken one hour before bedtime, is recommended. Mustard For years coaches have given mustard
 to their 
          athletes with leg cramps. Cramps are sometimes caused by a 
deficiency 
          in acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that stimulates your 
muscles 
          to work. Mustard has acetic acid, which helps the body make 
more acetylcholine. 
          Take a spoonful or two of mustard. Pickle juice As with mustard coaches have 
          given pickle juice to their athletes with leg cramps. 
          Cramps are sometimes caused by a deficiency in acetylcholine, 
the neurotransmitter 
          that stimulates your muscles to work. Pickle juice has acetic 
          acid, which helps the body make more acetylcholine. Take a few
 ounces 
          of pickle juice. Quinine/tonic water Drinking four to eight 
ounces of 
          tonic water (make sure it has quinine in it!) an hour before 
          going to bed is a very effective remedy for most people. If it
 
          is too tart for you, add some lemon for flavoring. You should 
notice 
          a difference within a few days, otherwise discontinue. OTC 
quinine was 
          banned by the FDA because of health risks, but there is enough
 quinine 
          in tonic water to help most people. See the Hyland's 
homeopathic remedy
