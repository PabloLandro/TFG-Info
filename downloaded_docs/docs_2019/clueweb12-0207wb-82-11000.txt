Lower abdominal workout that works fast | Lower back exercises | Lower back pain exercise Lower abdominal workout that works fast | Lower back exercises Lower back exercises Any good abs exercise program involves high intensity muscular overload and progressive increase in intensity. Abdominal exercises must be undertaken carefully so that the back is adequately supported. The upper and lower abdominal muscles are not separate muscles and abs exercises can help strengthen the entire abdominal region. But some exercises will tend towards developing either the upper or lower abdominal region. Abdominal exercises can help you also gain strong stomach muscles and back muscles. This can reduce the likelihood of back pains and provide protection against injury by efficient response to stress. Lower abdominal workout that works fast - Let us examine the muscles in the abdominal region. The Rectus abdominis is the muscle that stretches down the stomach from your ribs to the hips. The external and internal obliques run down the sides of the waist. They aid the rectus abdominis during curling and twisting exercises. Ab exercises need to tone or harden the muscles in that area. In addition, the body fat covering the abdominal muscles must be eliminated. That can only be achieved with a proper eating plan. Increasing protein intake and limiting carbohydrates is said to be one way of tackling flabby abs along with a sensible abs exercise routine and strength training. When suffering from lower back pain, great care must be taken with lower back stretches or lower back exercise. The no pain, no gain motto does not apply. In fact, lower back exercises which are painful may cause further strain rather than providing relief. If you are experiencing significant lower back pain, it’s always prudent to be evaluated by an appropriate health care professional before embarking on an exercise program of lower back stretches or other exercises. This is one of the easiest lower back stretches. Most individuals can perform it quite easily and comfortably. It’s also a wonderful, simple movement for either first thing in the morning, or last thing at the end of the day. Brief description - On hands and knees, gently arching the spine, first in one direction and then the other, with coordinated breathing. Goal - To gently wake up the spine and paraspinal muscles, increasing flexibility, ease of movement, and improving comfort. The Movement 1) Position yourself on your hands and knees, either on your bed or on the floor. 2) Very slowly, raise your head. As you do this, allow your belly to open downward toward the floor, and your back to fall into an arch. Move only as far as comfortable. Feel a nice stretch. 3) Then stretch your spine in the opposite direction by dropping your head, your chin moving toward your chest, while your back raises toward the ceiling. Move only as far as comfortable. Feel a nice stretch.
