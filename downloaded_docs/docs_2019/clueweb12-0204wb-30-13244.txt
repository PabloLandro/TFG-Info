Obesity has been on the rise and has been one of the major health related problems that the world is seeing today. Obesity has a direct impact on healthy living. Heart disease, diabetes, many types of cancer, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic musculoskeletal problems are few of the health disorders that are seen in overweight and obese people. Diagnosing obesity is very important and it relates to diagnosis of body fat. The body mass index (BMI) is an accepted marker for excess body weight. This is not the ultimate marker as it can diagnose a muscular person as obese. It can also asses an elderly person with low body weight but high body fat (this can happen due to low muscle mass and bone density) as healthy. Other markers for the evaluating obesity include waist circumference (associated with central obesity), and a patient's risk factors for diseases and conditions associated with obesity. Besides these indirect methods, body fat can also be measured directly. Treatment for overweight and obese individuals through diet, exercise and anti-obesity drugs are considered in the first level of treatment. Treatment for severe obesity will include bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is gaining popularity and is seen as a crusader in the war against obesity. Weight loss surgery helps patients with greater weight loss than conventional treatments. Bariatric surgery helps improve quality of life and reduces the risks of obesity related diseases such as hypertension, heart attacks, diabetes etc. Metamorphosis Medical Retreats facilitates a wide range of affordable bariatric weight loss surgeries including; Laparoscopic adjustable Gastric banding (AGB) for weight reduction Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RGB) for morbid obesity Laparoscopic Vertical sleeve gastrectomy for obese Gastric balloon Uninsured, self insured and underinsured obese individuals will see cost savings of up to 70% when weight reduction procedures are performed overseas.
