                  Outbreak (Ithaca, NY – August 31, 2006) – Pertussis, or 
                  whooping cough, is a highly contagious disease involving the 
                  respiratory tract. It is caused by a bacterium that is found 
                  in the mouth, nose and throat of an infected person. Since June 
                  2006, there have been 29 laboratory confirmed cases in Tompkins 
                  County. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) defines 
                  an outbreak as 2 or more epidemiologically linked cases. Pertussis 
                  incidence has been on the rise nationally over the last few 
                  years. Pertussis can occur at any age and most cases are reported 
                  in children under 5 years of age. However, there has been an 
                  increase in the number of adolescents and adults who have been 
                  infected with pertussis according to the NYSDOH. This is also 
                  true in Tompkins County. Karen Bishop, Supervising Community Health Nurse at the Tompkins 
                  County Health Department (TCHD) warns that complications from 
                  pertussis may include pneumonia, middle ear infection, loss 
                  of appetite, dehydration, seizures, and episodes of brief cessation 
                  of breathing. “Infants are particularly at risk from older 
                  siblings, parents, or caregivers who may be harboring the bacteria. 
                  The incubation period is usually 5 to 10 days but may be as 
                  long as 21 days,” she said. Bishop noted that pertussis begins with mild cold symptoms 
                  including sneezing, runny nose, low-grade fever and a mild cough. 
                  Within 2 weeks, the cough becomes more severe and is characterized 
                  by episodes of numerous rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched 
                  “whoop.” Coughing episodes may recur for 1 to 2 
                  months and are more frequent at night. “Because pertussis is a bacterial infection, it can be 
                  treated with antibiotics,” Bishop advised. She urges anyone 
                  who may have these symptoms to call their physician immediately. 
                  The health department has kept local physicians apprised of 
                  pertussis incidence in the County, she added. Pertussis is spread person to person through close contact 
                  with respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or 
                  sneezes. “If people are exposed in this way and develop 
                  symptoms,” Karen Bishop says, “they should stay 
                  home from work, school and social gatherings to avoid exposing 
                  friends and extended family until they are medically evaluated 
                  and treated.” The single most effective way of preventing pertussis is maintaining 
                  the highest level of immunization in the community. Infants 
                  receive pertussis immunization as part of routine childhood 
                  immunization. And within the last year, vaccines have become 
                  available for adolescents and adults. Basic respiratory hygiene 
                  - hand washing and covering coughs and sneezes and antibiotic 
                  treatment for those diagnosed with pertussis are crucial in 
                  controlling the spread of pertussis in the community. For more information: www.tompkins-co.org/health/chs/pertussis.htm or call 274-6604. (-30-) Tompkins
