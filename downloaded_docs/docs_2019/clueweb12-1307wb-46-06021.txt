The clinic was established in September of 1995 to provide diagnostic and treatment services to children who do not have dental insurance or financial resources to pay for dental care. The clinic is held on the campus of West Kentucky Community and Technical College and operates one Friday a month, September through April. Angels Clinic in Murray is an additional site where treatment services are being provided to adults. To schedule an appointment or to find out more about either clinic, please contact Amy Crosier, RDA at: (270) 809-4123. School-based Sealant Program The Purchase AHEC works in conjunction with the area family resource centers to provide a school based sealant program in area school systems. The goal is to help reduce the potential of tooth decay in a child's permanent molars by painting on a hardening substance that decreases the potential for decay to develop. For more about the program or to schedule a visit to your school, contact Amy Crosier, RDA at: (270) 809-4123. Community Based Initiatives The Purchase AHEC welcomes the opportunity to provide dental health care information at your school or community based health fairs. A variety of displays are available and can be adapted to address dental issues related to a specific age group or target a specific need. Call Amy Crosier, RDA at the Purchase AHEC office 270-809-4123 for more information.
