        Reduction Forum Varicose Veins and Weight Researchers don't know exactly why veins 
        stretch and valves fail in some people, but they've found some factors 
        that increase the risk. Varicose Veins - Causes You Can't Change Being a woman. For unknown reasons, 
          varicose veins are slightly more common in women than in men. Family history. If your mother or father 
          had varicose veins, you're more at risk than someone without a family 
          history of the problem. Age. As you grow older, the walls of 
          your veins tend to weaken and lose flexibility. Pregnancy. Varicose veins can develop 
          or worsen during pregnancy because hormone changes can weaken vein walls. 
          And the weight of the baby can press on the large vein in the abdomen, 
          making it harder for blood to flow back up to the heart. Also, weight 
          gain puts extra pressure on blood vessels in the legs, making varicose 
          veins worse or more likely. Varicose veins that appear with pregnancy 
          usually disappear soon after the baby is born. Varicose Veins - Causes You Can Change Standing. Being on your feet for long 
          periods of time puts more pressure on the vein walls and valves, weakening 
          them. Lack of exercise. The calf and thigh 
          muscles help pump blood up the legs toward the heart, taking pressure 
          off the veins. When you don't exercise enough, the muscles weaken and 
          can't help as much, which increases the chance of varicose veins. Obesity. Extra weight strains the blood 
          vessels and raises a woman's risk of varicose veins. Obese men, though, 
          aren't more likely than thin men to have the condition. Varicose Veins - Treatments Mild varicose veins need no treatment other 
        than for cosmetic reasons. In most cases, people with symptoms can use 
        support hose or heavier elastic knee-high stockings to manage their condition. 
        Frequent rest periods with leg elevation can also help with leg swelling 
        and the feeling of heaviness in the legs. Regular exercise is also advised 
        to improve circulation to the legs. If symptoms are severe or a person finds 
        the appearance of the veins unacceptable, varicose vein surgery may be 
        an option. A variety of surgery methods are used. These include cutting 
        the veins out, injecting the veins with chemicals to destroy or shrink 
        them, or using lasers or radio waves to destroy shrink the veins. Treated varicose veins usually disappear 
        with surgery. Problems do not return in the treated veins, but may develop 
        in other veins. Once a varicose vein is closed or removed, nearby healthy 
        veins take over the job of carrying blood back to the heart. For Lasting Weight Control If you want to lose weight for life, follow Anne
