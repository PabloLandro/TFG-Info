< 29.5, FAQ score≥5. 160 cases who had signs of nervous system and cerebrovascular disease examined and verified by CT scanning were selected and randomly divided into two groups, i.e. turbid-clearing and intelligence-improving group (TIG 110 cases) and traditional acupuncture group (TG, 50 cases). Points treated in TIG: Zhongwan (CV 12), Fenglong (ST 40), Neiguan (PC 6), Yongquan (KI l), Renying (ST 9), Fengchi (GB 20). Points treated in TG: Baihui (GV 20), Fengchi (GB 20), Dazhong (KI 4), Shenmen (HT 7). NO. 28, l-2 cun stainless steel needles were used in the treatment with reducing technique of rotating the needle on CV 12, ST 40, PC 6, and reinforcing technique of rotating the needle on other points. Acupuncture was applied once daily for 20 minutes, 30 sessions constituted a treatment course. Results: The total effective rate was 65% in TIG and 40% in TG, with a statistically significant difference (P< 0.05). Scores of HDS and FAQ test of the two groups before and after treatment were significantly and statistically different (p< 0.01) respectively. Scores of HDS and FAQ test between the groups after treatment was significantly and statistically different (P < 0.05). It indicated that the two acupuncture methods all improved intelligence and social ejection of VD, however, the turbid-clearing and intelligence-improving acupuncture therapy was markedly superior to traditional acupuncture method in the therapeutic effect and intergral improvement of HDS and FAQ. This study suggests that acupuncture is an effective method for VD. By Liu Huian & Chen Guiying The Second Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin College of TCM, Tianjin 300150, China.
