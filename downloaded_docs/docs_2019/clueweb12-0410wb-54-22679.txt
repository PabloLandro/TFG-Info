There are numerous published studies that demonstrate the direct effects acupuncture can have on the reproductive system. When properly performed, the success rate of ongoing IVF pregnancies doubled from that of the control group. It has also been shown to increase implantation rates, decrease miscarriages, decrease ectopic pregnancies and increase live births. With our comprehensive treatments and individualized approach, we have helped many couples achieve their goals. Our highly qualified and experienced practitioners not only have a background in western medicine but also have a substantial amount of experience using acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to treat problems such as infertility. Within our practice, more than half of all clients treated for infertility conceived. While most clients were successful through IVF, some experienced natural pregnancies. We would like to extend our thanks to the doctors/specialists at Pacific Centre for Reproductive Medicine (PCRM) as well as other facilities in Great Vancouver for their continued support of our practice.
