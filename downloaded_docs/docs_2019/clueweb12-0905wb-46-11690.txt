Big flap over circumcision -- CDC gunning for foreskin? - Comedy - dscriber media dscribers magazine watch the basement World Ink angle Tweet Sep 01 Big flap over circumcision -- CDC gunning for foreskin? Author // Brad Weismann First a joke: A foreskin staggers into a bar, knocking over tables and smashing glasses. And the bartender says, "That's it -- I'm cutting you off!" Now the news... Representatives from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are setting off a micro-burst of hysteria at the National HIV Prevention Conference in Atlanta this week as they mull a recommendation that boys' foreskins should be cut off to help stem the spread of HIV infection. Aside from the surprising news that little boys seem to be placing themselves in the kind of risky sexual situations that result in AIDS, there were immediate negative reactions to the CDC's new health-care assault from several quarters. Right-wing pundit Rush Limbaugh claimed on his radio show that President Obama wants to mandate circumcision. Various anti-circumcision groups , which refer to themselves without evident irony as "intact-ivists," have made strong statements advocating no changes in U.S. medical policy. It's a touchy subject -- which reminds me of another joke! Q: Why do women find circumcised men so attractive? A: They can't resist 10 percent off! News reports cite scientific studies that show that foreskin cells are particularly susceptible to HIV, and that the foreskin can tear during intercourse, providing an entry point for infection. Opponents are adamant that the numbers don't add up. There are immensely complicating factors that feed the controversy. First, the inherently intimate nature of the procedure, and the risk, however low, of damage to the penis. Second, there is the cultural/religious aspect. Judaism mandates circumcision for males on the eighth day after birth. A ceremony called the brit milah or bris is performed by an individual specially trained to perform it -- the mohel (pronounced moil). And it's back to the jokes! A mohel saved all the foreskins he removed, and one day he had enough to make a wallet. The benefit? When he rubbed it, it became a life raft! Ha-cha! Islam does not mandate circumcision, but it is practiced by a majority of believers. Many African cultures utilize the procedure as part of a rite of passage for males. The practice is much more rare in Europe, Asia and South America. Intactivists stigmatize circumcision as genital mutilation without consent, akin to female genital mutilation. Current U.S. medical policy is strictly neutral on the issue, deferring to the wishes of the infant's parents. The CDC is clear on one thing -- its Web site states, "Whatever the content may include, CDCâ€™s final circumcision recommendations will be completely voluntary." And now, more gags! Two boys are standing side-by-side at a urinal. "Hey," says the first kid. "Your penis sure looks weird." "Well," says the second kid, "I was circumcised right after I was born." "Did it hurt?" "Are you kidding? I couldn't walk for a year!" -- Pictured: A dramatization of a routine neonatal circumcision procedure as seen from a child's perspective.
