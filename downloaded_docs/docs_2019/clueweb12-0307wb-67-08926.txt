         contraceptives, and cimetidine. In vitro studies of protein binding indicated that warfarin did not affect M1 protein binding. At the same time M1 was shown to cause
         increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac, ibuprofen and tolbutamide at concentrations in the clinical
         range. In vitro studies of drug metabolism indicate that M1 inhibits CYP 450 2C9, which is responsible for the metabolism of phenytoin, tolbutamide,
         warfarin and many NSAIDs. M1 has been shown to inhibit the formation of 4’-hydroxydiclofenac from diclofenac in vitro . The clinical significance of these findings with regard to phenytoin and tolbutamide is unknown; however, there was extensive
         concomitant use of NSAIDs in the clinical studies and no differential effect was observed (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Methotrexate Co-administration, in 30 patients, of leflunomide (100 mg/day x 2 days followed by 10 to 20 mg/day) with methotrexate (10
         to 25 mg/week, with folate) demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs. However, co-administration
         increased risk of hepatotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Hepatotoxic Drugs ). Rifampin Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1
         peak levels were increased (~ 40%) over those seen when leflunomide was given alone. Because of the potential for leflunomide
         levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to receive both leflunomide and
         rifampin. CLINICAL STUDIES A. Adults The efficacy of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was demonstrated in three controlled trials showing
         reduction in signs and symptoms, and inhibition of structural damage. In two placebo controlled trials, efficacy was demonstrated
         for improvement in physical function. 1. Reduction of signs and symptoms Relief of signs and symptoms was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 Responder Index, a composite
         of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures in rheumatoid arthritis. An “ACR20 Responder” is a patient who had ≥20% improvement
         in both tender and swollen joint counts and in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physician global assessment, patient global
         assessment, functional ability measure [Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ)], visual analog pain scale, and erythrocyte
         sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. An “ACR20 Responder at Endpoint” is a patient who completed the study and was an
         ACR20 Responder at the completion of the study. 2. Inhibition of structural damage Inhibition of structural damage compared to control was assessed using the Sharp Score (Sharp, JT. Scoring Radiographic Abnormalities
         in Rheumatoid Arthritis, Radiologic Clinics of North America, 1996; vol. 34, pp. 233-241), a composite score of X-ray erosions
         and joint space narrowing in hands/wrists and forefeet. 3. Improvement in physical function Improvement in physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Medical Outcomes Survey
         Short Form (SF-36). In all leflunomide monotherapy studies, an initial loading dose of 100 mg per day for three days only was used followed by
         20 mg per day thereafter. US301 Clinical Trial in Adults Study US301, a 2 year study, randomized 482 patients with active RA of at least 6 months duration to leflunomide 20 mg/day
         (n=182), methotrexate 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n=182), or placebo (n=118). All patients received folate 1 mg
         b.i.d. Primary analysis was at 52 weeks with blinded treatment to 104 weeks. Overall, 235 of the 508 randomized treated patients (482 in primary data analysis and an additional 26 patients), continued
         into a second 12 months of double-blind treatment (98 leflunomide, 101 methotrexate, 36 placebo). Leflunomide dose continued
         at 20 mg/day and the methotrexate dose could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/week. In total, 190 patients (83 leflunomide,
         80 methotrexate, 27 placebo) completed 2 years of double-blind treatment. The rate and reason for withdrawal is summarized in Table 3 . Table 3.

         (n=92). Treatment duration was 24 weeks. An extension of the study was an optional 6-month blinded continuation of MN301 without
         the placebo arm, resulting in a 12-month comparison of leflunomide and sulfasalazine (study MN303). Of the 168 patients who completed 12 months of treatment in MN301 and MN303, 146 patients (87%) entered a 1-year extension
         study of double blind active treatment (MN305; 60 leflunomide, 60 sulfasalazine, 26 placebo/sulfasalazine). Patients continued
         on the same daily dosage of leflunomide or sulfasalazine that they had been taking at the completion of MN301/303. A total
         of 121 patients (53 leflunomide, 47 sulfasalazine, 21 placebo/sulfasalazine) completed the 2 years of double-blind treatment.

         to 15 mg/week (n=498). Folate supplementation was used in 10% of patients. Treatment duration was 52 weeks. Of the 736 patients who completed 52 weeks of treatment in study MN302, 612 (83%) entered the double-blind, 1-year extension
         study MN304 (292 leflunomide, 320 methotrexate). Patients continued on the same daily dosage of leflunomide or methotrexate
         that they had been taking at the completion of MN302. There were 533 patients (256 leflunomide, 277 methotrexate) who completed
         2 years of double-blind treatment. Patient withdrawal data in MN302/304 is summarized in Table 5 . Table 5.

Signs and symptoms Rheumatoid Arthritis The ACR20 Responder at Endpoint rates are shown in Figure 1 . Leflunomide was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA by the primary
         efficacy analysis, ACR20 Responder at Endpoint, in study US301 (at the primary 12 months endpoint) and MN301 (at 6 month endpoint).
         ACR20 Responder at Endpoint rates with leflunomide treatment were consistent across the 6 and 12 month studies (41 to 49%).
         No consistent differences were demonstrated between leflunomide and methotrexate or between leflunomide and sulfasalazine.
         Leflunomide treatment effect was evident by 1 month, stabilized by 3 to 6 months, and continued throughout the course of treatment
         as shown in Figure 2 .

         of double-blind treatment (total treatment period of 2 years) in studies US301, MN305, and MN304. ACR Responder rates at 12
         months were maintained over 2 years in most patients continuing a second year of treatment. Improvement from baseline in the individual components of the ACR responder criteria was also sustained in most patients during
         the second year of leflunomide treatment in all three trials. 2. Inhibition of structural damage The change from baseline to endpoint in progression of structural disease, as measured by the Sharp X-ray score, is displayed
         in Figure 3 . Leflunomide was statistically significantly superior to placebo in inhibiting the progression of disease by the Sharp Score.
         No consistent differences were demonstrated between leflunomide and methotrexate or between leflunomide and sulfasalazine.

Improvement in physical function The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) assesses a patient’s physical function and degree of disability. The mean change
         from baseline in functional ability as measured by the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ DI) in the 6 and 12 month placebo and active
         controlled trials is shown in Figure 4 . Leflunomide was statistically significantly superior to placebo in improving physical function. Superiority to placebo was
         demonstrated consistently across all eight HAQ DI subscales (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and
         activities) in both placebo controlled studies. The Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36), a generic health-related quality of life questionnaire, further addresses
         physical function. In US301, at 12 months, leflunomide provided statistically significant improvements compared to placebo
         in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score.

In those patients continuing
         therapy for a second year, this improvement in physical function as measured by HAQ and SF-36 (PCS) was maintained. B. Pediatrics Clinical Trials in Pediatrics Leflunomide was studied in a single multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial in 94 patients (1:1 randomization)
         with polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Approximately
         68% of pediatric patients receiving leflunomide, versus 89% of pediatric patients receiving the active comparator, improved
         by Week 16 (end-of-study) employing the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI) ≥ 30 % responder endpoint. In this trial, the
         loading dose and maintenance dose of leflunomide was based on three weight categories: <20 kg, 20 to 40kg, and >40 kg. The
         response rate to leflunomide in pediatric patients ≤40 kg was less robust than in pediatric patients >40 kg suggesting suboptimal
         dosing in smaller weight pediatric patients, as studied, resulting in less than efficacious plasma concentrations, despite
         reduced clearance of M1. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations: Pediatrics ). INDICATIONS AND USAGE Leflunomide is indicated in adults for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA): to reduce signs and symptoms to inhibit structural damage as evidenced by X-ray erosions and joint space narrowing to improve physical function (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and/or low dose corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with leflunomide
         (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: NSAIDs ). The combined use of leflunomide with antimalarials, intramuscular or oral gold, D penicillamine, azathioprine, or methotrexate
         has not been adequately studied (see WARNINGS: Immunosuppression Potential/Bone Marrow Suppression ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Leflunomide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to leflunomide or any of the other components of leflunomide. Leflunomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Leflunomide, when administered orally to rats during
         organogenesis at a dose of 15 mg/kg, was teratogenic (most notably anophthalmia or microophthalmia and internal hydrocephalus).
         The systemic exposure of rats at this dose was approximately 1/10 the human exposure level based on AUC. Under these exposure
         conditions, leflunomide also caused a decrease in the maternal body weight and an increase in embryolethality with a decrease
         in fetal body weight for surviving fetuses. In rabbits, oral treatment with 10 mg/kg of leflunomide during organogenesis resulted
         in fused, dysplastic sternebrae. The exposure level at this dose was essentially equivalent to the maximum human exposure
         level based on AUC. At a 1 mg/kg dose, leflunomide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits. When female rats were treated with 1.25 mg/kg of leflunomide beginning 14 days before mating and continuing until the end
         of lactation, the offspring exhibited marked (greater than 90%) decreases in postnatal survival. The systemic exposure level
         at 1.25 mg/kg was approximately 1/100 the human exposure level based on AUC. Leflunomide is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient
         becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. WARNINGS Immunosuppression Potential/Bone Marrow Suppression Leflunomide is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections.
         In the event that a serious infection occurs, it may be necessary to interrupt therapy with leflunomide and administer cholestyramine
         or charcoal (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Need for Drug Elimination ). Medications like leflunomide that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections,
         including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis. Severe infections including sepsis,
         which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid
         illness which, in addition to rheumatoid disease, may predispose patients to infection. There have been rare reports of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving leflunomide alone.
         These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other
         immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of
         a significant hematologic abnormality. Patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline
         and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate
         and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly. If evidence of bone marrow suppression
         occurs in a patient taking leflunomide, treatment with leflunomide should be stopped, and cholestyramine or charcoal should
         be used to reduce the plasma concentration of leflunomide active metabolite (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Need for Drug Elimination ). In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from leflunomide to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential
         for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic
         exposure to both compounds. Leflunomide washout with cholestyramine or charcoal may decrease this risk, but also may induce
         disease worsening if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment. Hepatotoxicity RARE CASES OF SEVERE LIVER INJURY, INCLUDING CASES WITH FATAL OUTCOME, HAVE BEEN REPORTED DURING TREATMENT WITH LEFLUNOMIDE.
            MOST CASES OF SEVERE LIVER INJURY OCCUR WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF THERAPY AND IN A SETTING OF MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS FOR HEPATOTOXICITY
            (liver disease, other hepatotoxins). (See PRECAUTIONS .) At minimum, ALT (SGPT) must be performed at baseline and monitored initially at monthly intervals during the first six months
         then, if stable, every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. In addition, if leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, ACR
         guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity must be followed with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing monthly. Guidelines for dose adjustment or discontinuation based on the severity and persistence of ALT elevation are recommended as
         follows: For confirmed ALT elevations between 2- and 3-fold ULN, dose reduction to 10 mg/day may allow continued administration
         of leflunomide under close monitoring. If elevations between 2- and 3-fold ULN persist despite dose reduction or if ALT elevations
         of >3-fold ULN are present, leflunomide should be discontinued and cholestyramine or charcoal should be administered (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Need for Drug Elimination ) with close monitoring, including retreatment with cholestyramine or charcoal as indicated. In clinical trials, leflunomide treatment as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate was associated with elevations
         of liver enzymes, primarily ALT and AST, in a significant number of patients; these effects were generally reversible. Most
         transaminase elevations were mild (≤ 2-fold ULN) and usually resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (>3-fold
         ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Table 8 shows liver enzyme elevations seen with monthly monitoring in clinical trials US301 and MN301. It was notable that the absence
         of folate use in MN302 was associated with a considerably greater incidence of liver enzyme elevation on methotrexate. Table 8.

         LFTs, leflunomide was added to a group of 130 patients starting at 10 mg per day and increased to 20 mg as needed. An increase
         in ALT greater than or equal to three times the ULN was observed in 3.8% of patients compared to 0.8% in 133 patients continued
         on methotrexate with placebo added. Pre-existing Hepatic Disease Given the possible risk of increased hepatotoxicity, and the role of the liver in drug activation, elimination and recycling,
         the use of leflunomide is not recommended in patients with significant hepatic impairment or evidence of infection with hepatitis
         B or C viruses. (See WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Skin Reactions Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide.
         If a patient taking leflunomide develops any of these conditions, leflunomide therapy should be stopped, and a drug elimination
         procedure is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Need for Drug Elimination ). Malignancy The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppression medications.
         There is a potential for immunosuppression with leflunomide. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative
         disorders was reported in the clinical trials of leflunomide, but larger and longer-term studies would be needed to determine
         whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with leflunomide. Use in Women of Childbearing Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating leflunomide in pregnant women. However, based on animal studies,
         leflunomide may increase the risk of fetal death or teratogenic effects when administered to a pregnant woman (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Women of childbearing potential must not be started on leflunomide until pregnancy is excluded and it has been confirmed
         that they are using reliable contraception. Before starting treatment with leflunomide, patients must be fully counseled on
         the potential for serious risk to the fetus. The patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect pregnancy, they must
         notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing and, if positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risk to
         the pregnancy. It is possible that rapidly lowering the blood level of the active metabolite by instituting the drug elimination
         procedure described below at the first delay of menses may decrease the risk to the fetus from leflunomide. Upon discontinuing leflunomide, it is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo the drug elimination procedure
         described below. Women receiving leflunomide treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue leflunomide and undergo
         the drug elimination procedure described below which includes verification of M1 metabolite plasma levels less than 0.02 mg/L
         (0.02 mcg/mL). Human plasma levels of the active metabolite (M1) less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal
         risk based on available animal data. Drug Elimination Procedure The following drug elimination procedure is recommended to achieve non-detectable plasma levels (less than 0.02 mg/L or 0.02
         mcg/mL) after stopping treatment with leflunomide: Administer cholestyramine 8 grams 3 times daily for 11 days. (The 11 days do not need to be consecutive unless there is a
            need to lower the plasma level rapidly.) Verify plasma levels less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) by two separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma levels are
            higher than 0.02 mg/L, additional cholestyramine treatment should be considered. Without the drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma M1 metabolite levels less than 0.02 mg/L
         due to individual variation in drug clearance. PRECAUTIONS General Need for Drug Elimination The active metabolite of leflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. In instances of any serious toxicity from leflunomide,
         including hypersensitivity, use of a drug elimination procedure as described in this section is highly recommended to reduce
         the drug concentration more rapidly after stopping leflunomide therapy. If hypersensitivity is the suspected clinical mechanism,
         more prolonged cholestyramine or charcoal administration may be necessary to achieve rapid and sufficient clearance. The duration
         may be modified based on the clinical status of the patient. Cholestyramine given orally at a dose of 8 g three times a day for 24 hours to three healthy volunteers decreased plasma levels
         of M1 by approximately 40% in 24 hours and by 49 to 65% in 48 hours. Administration of activated charcoal (powder made into a suspension) orally or via nasogastric tube (50 g every 6 hours for
         24 hours) has been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, M1, by 37% in 24 hours and by 48% in 48
         hours. These drug elimination procedures may be repeated if clinically necessary. Respiratory Interstitial lung disease has been reported during treatment with leflunomide and has been associated with fatal outcomes
         (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a
         variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated
         fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of the therapy and for further investigation, as appropriate. If discontinuation
         of the drug is necessary, initiation of wash-out procedures should be considered (see WARNINGS: Drug Elimination Procedure ). Renal Insufficiency Single dose studies in dialysis patients show a doubling of the free fraction of M1 in plasma. There is no clinical experience
         in the use of leflunomide in patients with renal impairment. Caution should be used when administering this drug in this population. Vaccinations No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during leflunomide treatment. Vaccination with live
         vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of leflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration
         of a live vaccine after stopping leflunomide. Information for Patients The potential for increased risk of birth defects should be discussed with female patients of childbearing potential. It is
            recommended that physicians advise women that they may be at increased risk of having a child with birth defects if they are
            pregnant when taking leflunomide, become pregnant while taking leflunomide, or do not wait to become pregnant until they have
            stopped taking leflunomide and followed the drug elimination procedure (as described in WARNINGS: Use in Women of Childbearing Potential and WARNINGS: Drug Elimination Procedure ). Patients should be advised of the possibility of rare, serious skin reactions. Patients should be instructed to inform their
            physicians promptly if they develop a skin rash or mucous membrane lesions. Patients should be advised of the potential hepatotoxic effects of leflunomide and of the need for monitoring liver enzymes.
            Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians if they develop symptoms such as unusual tiredness, abdominal pain
            or jaundice. Patients should be advised that they may develop a lowering of their blood counts and should have frequent hematologic monitoring.
            This is particularly important for patients who are receiving other immunosuppressive therapy concurrently with leflunomide,
            who have recently discontinued such therapy before starting treatment with leflunomide, or who have had a history of a significant
            hematologic abnormality. Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they notice symptoms of pancytopenia
            (such as easy bruising or bleeding, recurrent infections, fever, paleness or unusual tiredness). Patients should be informed about the early warning signs of interstitial lung disease and asked to contact their physician
            as soon as possible if these symptoms appear or worsen during therapy. Laboratory Tests Hematologic Monitoring At minimum, patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored
         at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Bone Marrow Suppression Monitoring If used concomitantly with immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, chronic monitoring should be monthly. (See WARNINGS: Immunosuppression Potential/Bone Marrow Suppression .) Liver Enzyme Monitoring ALT (SGPT) must be performed at baseline and monitored at monthly intervals during the first six months then, if stable, every
         6 to 8 weeks thereafter. In addition, if leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, ACR guidelines for monitoring
         methotrexate liver toxicity must be followed with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing every month. (See WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity .) Due to a specific effect on the brush border of the renal proximal tubule, leflunomide has a uricosuric effect. A separate
         effect of hypophosphaturia is seen in some patients. These effects have not been seen together, nor have there been alterations
         in renal function. Drug Interactions Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant
         decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide) concentration (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Need for Drug Elimination ). Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when leflunomide is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances. This is also to be considered
         when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure. In a small (n=30) combination study
         of leflunomide with methotrexate, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients. All elevations resolved,
         2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A >3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients.
         All of these also resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met
         “ACR criteria” for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik Grade IIIa). No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified
         (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). NSAIDs In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac and ibuprofen at concentrations
         in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, there was extensive concomitant use
         of NSAIDs in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed. Tolbutamide In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of tolbutamide at concentrations in the
         clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rifampin Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1
         peak levels were increased (~ 40%) over those seen when leflunomide was given alone. Because of the potential for leflunomide
         levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide
         and rifampin. Warfarin Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when leflunomide and warfarin were co-administered has been rarely reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year bioassay in rats at oral doses of leflunomide up to the maximally
         tolerated dose of 6 mg/kg (approximately 1/40 the maximum human M1 systemic exposure based on AUC). However, male mice in
         a 2-year bioassay exhibited an increased incidence in lymphoma at an oral dose of 15 mg/kg, the highest dose studied (1.7
         times the human M1 exposure based on AUC). Female mice, in the same study, exhibited a dose-related increased incidence of
         bronchoalveolar adenomas and carcinomas combined beginning at 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 1/10 the human M1 exposure based on
         AUC). The significance of the findings in mice relative to the clinical use of leflunomide is not known. Leflunomide was not mutagenic in the Ames Assay, the Unscheduled DNA Synthesis Assay, or in the HGPRT Gene Mutation Assay.
         In addition, leflunomide was not clastogenic in the in vivo Mouse Micronucleus Assay nor in the in vivo Cytogenetic Test in Chinese Hamster Bone Marrow Cells. However, 4-trifluoromethylaniline (TFMA), a minor metabolite of leflunomide,
         was mutagenic in the Ames Assay and in the HGPRT Gene Mutation Assay, and was clastogenic in the in vitro Assay for Chromosome Aberrations in the Chinese Hamster Cells. TFMA was not clastogenic in the in vivo Mouse Micronucleus Assay nor in the in vivo Cytogenetic Test in Chinese Hamster Bone Marrow Cells. Leflunomide had no effect on fertility in either male or female rats
         at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg (approximately 1/30 the human M1 exposure based on AUC). Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X (See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.) Pregnancy Registry: To monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to leflunomide, health care providers are encouraged
         to register such patients by calling 1-877-311-8972. Nursing Mothers Leflunomide should not be used by nursing mothers. It is not known whether leflunomide is excreted in human milk. Many drugs
         are excreted in human milk, and there is a potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from leflunomide. Therefore,
         a decision should be made whether to proceed with nursing or to initiate treatment with leflunomide, taking into account the
         importance of the drug to the mother. Use in Males Available information does not suggest that leflunomide would be associated with an increased risk of male-mediated fetal
         toxicity. However, animal studies to evaluate this specific risk have not been conducted. To minimize any possible risk, men
         wishing to father a child should consider discontinuing use of leflunomide and taking cholestyramine 8 grams 3 times daily
         for 11 days. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of leflunomide in pediatric patients with polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
         (JRA) have not been fully evaluated. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical (Phase III) studies of leflunomide, 234 subjects were 65 years and
         over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other
         reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater
         sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients over 65. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with the use of leflunomide in RA include diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), alopecia
         and rash. In the controlled studies at one year, the following adverse events were reported, regardless of causality. (See Table 9 .) Table 9.
