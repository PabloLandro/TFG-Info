Our reviews | Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Home Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Our reviews Respiratory infections are the leading cause of use of general practice services in Australia and in many other countries. Acute respiratory infections are also among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children in low-income countries. They are often dealt with sub-optimally and are a leading cause of use and misuse of antibiotic drugs, suggesting deficiencies in the application of research data to inform clinical decisions. The reviews published by the ARI Group increase the likelihood that research results will be used to improve the quality of care delivered in the field of acute respiratory infections. Please find links to our current published reviews and protocols below.
