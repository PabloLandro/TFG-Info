NEWSBRIEF â€“ NOVEMBER 2000 NEWSBRIEF - Honey outperforms antibiotics. Researchers attending the First World Wound Healing 
Congress in Melbourne learned that honey has outperformed conventional antibiotics in treating burns and 
infected caesarean sections.  Honey can eradicate E. coli, Salmonella, and Helicobacter pylori and even kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria including the hospital superbug MRSA.  Not all types of honey work 
though.  The most effective ones are manuka honey from New Zealand and jelly bush honey from Australia.  
It is believed that these varieties release hydrogen peroxide which is deadly to microbes.  Dr. Peter Molan of 
the University of Waikato in NZ has found that swallowing half a teaspoon of manuka honey on an empty 
stomach will eradicate the bacteria Helicobacter pylori that cause most stomach ulcers. New Scientist, October 7, 2000, pp. 32-35 CATEGORY
