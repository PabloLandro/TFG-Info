The kids are going      back school, days are getting shorter and the nights are getting chilly. Fall is knocking on our door. For allergy sufferers, this time of year      can be miserable. But it doesn't have to be. Because there is an answer for allergy      sufferers that is safe, effective and can help end your suffering long      before that first frost hits. Here's the background... The usual allergy story Standard symptom-centered treatments for      allergies are decongestants, antihistamines, steroid nasal sprays and eye      drops or nose drops. While these drugs might temporarily ease      your sneezing, runny or clogged nose, coughing, itchy eyes, nose and      throat, the real root cause of the allergy -- your body's screwy reaction      to what it perceives as a threat -- remains untouched. Plus, like all drugs, allergy drugs come      with a long list of side effects. One of the side effects of decongestants      is an eventual INCREASE in nasal congestion -- so they worsen one of the      very symptoms they're supposed to help, making you even more dependent on      them. I'll bet you didn't know that. Good for Big Pharma. NOT so good for you. And antihistamines, another common      treatment, cause sleepiness, stomach upset or pain, headaches, rapid      heartbeat and a dry mouth. So your nose may be clear for a little while,      but you're sleeping at your desk. Or flying to the bathroom 10 times a day. A better answer and the process But there is great news for allergy sufferers      who want to get REAL relief... Probiotics. Here's why... I'll give an example using ragweed, but      this applies to ANY allergen: Your body is equipped with a system of      enzymes to "digest" ragweed using a 2-step process. First, when you breathe in the ragweed,      enzymes break down the protein molecules in the ragweed into little things      called peptides. Next, secondary enzymes digest these      peptides and turn them into amino acids. Once they have been turned into      amino acids, your body can deal with them and there's no risk of an      allergic reaction. This efficient process can only run      properly if you have enough of the right kinds of enzymes, though. And if you don't? Well, you'd have a problem with allergies.      Your body doesn't have the needed levels of enzymes to break down and      transform an allergen into benign amino acids. Make sense? Good, because what you need to eliminate      or dramatically decrease all kinds of allergy symptoms, and actually get      rid of the allergies altogether is probiotics. You see, probiotics actually manufacture      enzymes to help give your body a fighting chance against allergens. The studies prove it In one double-blind long-term study, a      probiotic mixture was given to 1,223 pregnant women 2-4 weeks before they      delivered. Once the babies were born, they too were given the probiotics      for 6 months. The babies who received the probiotics      before and after birth were 34% less likely to develop eczema and other      allergic disorders. In another study conducted at UC-Davis, 60      adults were divided into 3 groups of 20. One group was given probiotics      every day. The second group got a placebo. And the third group got nothing,      but was instructed not to take probiotics of any kind. After a year the probiotic group showed a      significantly lower level of allergy symptoms as compared to the other 2      groups. These findings were published in the      Journal of Nutrition. Relief      from allergies is one of the major areas of focus I had when formulating Super      Shield multi-strain probiotic formula. Over 50 million people in the US alone      suffer from allergies, and those numbers continue to grow. Clearly the current treatment options are      not working, and more people suffer each year with allergies AND the side      effects of the drugs they take for them. So my suggestion is to help your body      naturally by giving it a boost of the good bacteria that it needs so it can      make enough enzymes to fight allergens (that aren't enemies at all). By the way, I used to suffer from seasonal      allergies too, so I know the misery very well. But my allergies completely disappeared      over 19 years ago, and taking probiotics everyday was a key reason why. Why not see what a medical-grade probiotic      supplement can do for you?

To your health, Sherry Brescia PS: Susan used Super Shield for IBS and      got a pleasant surprise: Dear Sherry, I had purchased Super Shield for help with      my IBS. I was tired of taking medications that made me tired and did      nothing for my gas, bloating and constipation. Plus I liked the idea of a      more natural approach instead of being dependent on prescription drugs. I'm happy to say that Super Shield has      helped a lot with my IBS--I rarely get flare-ups anymore and my bowel      movements have been much more regular. But what I'm really shocked about is my      allergy symptoms have decreased dramatically! I haven't needed my allergy medicine in      over two weeks and that is a first for me! I hope it continues! Thanks for a great      product. Susan S . ******************* Want      more case studies?  Here are a few thousand for you.
