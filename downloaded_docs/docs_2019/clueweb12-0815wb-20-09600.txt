Involved in more than 325 biochemical reactions, some of the early symptoms of magnesium deficiency include body aches, chronic constipation, headaches and migraines, insulin resistance, PMS, leg cramps, muscle twitches, and more. Left untreated, a magnesium deficiency can lead to more life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and others.

Jigsaw Magnesium w/SRT: It's the only magnesium supplement in the world that combines Albion's premier dimagnesium malate into a time released formula. Clinically proven to be more bioavailable than any other form of magnesium for super-absorption. Bound to malic acid, part of the energy-producing cycle, which breaks off to help the body create energy and to help eliminate aluminum from the body. No diarrhea side effect like most other magnesium supplements. Awarded the Albion Gold Medallion. Coated, easy-to-swallow, and highly dissolvable tablets. SRT : Sustained Release Technology means you enjoy the benefits of a slow release, easily absorbable mineral without the diarrhea side-effect. Instead of the magnesium being dumped into your system all at once, it is absorbed over an 8 hour period so that you get the maximum you need to start feeling better. Magnesium w/SRT contains: No artificial colors or dyes No casein No yeast No chemical additives No gluten No lactose No pesticides No preservatives No carnauba wax Supplement Facts: Serving Size = 4 tablets Active Ingredients Amount per Serving % Daily Value Vitamin B-6 (as Pyridoxal-5-phosphate) 5 mg 250% Folic Acid (as calcium folinate) 400 mcg 100% Elemental Magnesium (as dimagnesium malate) 500 mg 125% Malic Acid (as dimagnesium malate) 1,550 mg * * Daily Value not established Other Ingredients: Microcrystalline Cellulose, modified cellulose, guar gum, stearic acid, xanthan gum, vegetable stearate, silica. Background Information: Magnesium found in legumes, whole grains, green vegetables, nuts and seeds may not be fully absorbed by your body due to chronic recurrent health conditions, the use of prescription drugs, or an overabundance of calcium. Unfortunately, calcium has been singled out as the most important mineral your body needs. But calcium cannot work without magnesium. So many supplement makers have added magnesium to their calcium products as an afterthought. Most of these calcium/magnesium combos use poorly absorbed, cheaper forms of both minerals, and your body doesn't get what it needs. A magnesium deficiency may also result from a poor diet. Magnesium is involved in more than 325 known biochemical reactions in the body, the most important of which is energy production. Magnesium activates adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy storage molecule, to create and store energy. Without magnesium, there is no energy. Without energy, there is no life. A magnesium deficiency can produce many unwanted symptoms—and may be an underlying cause of symptoms related to many chronic conditions. In fact, most Americans unknowingly have a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium loss can only be replaced with a high-quality supplement. Unfortunately, most magnesium supplements contain only an average of 28% absorbable magnesium. Taking more just to replenish a magnesium deficiency often results in magnesium being “dumped” into the intestines where it can easily cause diarrhea.
