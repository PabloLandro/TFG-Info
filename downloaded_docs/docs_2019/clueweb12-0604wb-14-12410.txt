Drugs can affect  the brain with very different results. Psychoactive drugs affect the function  of the brain resulting in changes of perception, mood, consciousness, cognition  and behavior. While medication is prescriptive, people also often use  psychoactive substances recreationally or for advantage, due to an  often-euphoric nature and the capacity of some substances to increase  alertness. There are three main categories of psychoactive drugs. Stimulants Stimulants, sometimes called uppers, act to rejuvenate,  energize and to alert, without dramatically affecting perception. Examples of  stimulants are: coffee, nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy, among  others. Depressants Depressants, sometimes called downers, chill a person out,  reduce anxiety and sedate the user. Depressants consist of sedatives, hypnotics  and narcotics. Examples of depressants are alcohol, nitrous oxide,  barbiturates, benzodiazepines and opioids. Opioids Common opioids are morphine, heroin, codeine, hydrocodone,  oxycodone and methadone. Hallucinogens consist of psychedelics, dissociative- and  delirium-inducting substances. These drugs produce distinct subjective  alterations of perception, sense of space and time, consciousness and mood.  Examples of psychedelics are LSD, mushrooms and cannabis. Pain Management Most people use psychoactive drugs to manage pain.  Analgesics or painkillers, act on the central nervous system and include  NSAIDs, like aspirin, ibuprofen and the highly addictive class of opiate  narcotics, such as morphine and oxycodone. The desire and need to alter consciousness is not a recent  phenomenon, and dates back to the advent of man. Archaeological evidence  indicates that ancestors used plants as psychoactive substances almost ten  thousand years ago. Many preindustrial cultures used psychoactive plants such  as jimson, mescaline and psilocybin mushrooms for religious rituals. Many animals also consume psychoactive plant. For example:  cat ingesting catnip. Traditional myths contain references of animals  introducing sacred plants to humans. The cultural use of psychoactive  substances covers a vast historical landscape. Nevertheless, there may also be  an evolutionary relationship between animals and psychoactive plants and the  existence of these chemicals and receptors within the human nervous system.

If working  the night shift, the following tips may help people sleep better and avoid  sleepiness: Increase the total       amount of sleep by adding naps and lengthening the amount of time allotted       for sleep. Use bright lights in the       workplace. Minimize shift changes       so that the biological clock of the body can adjust to a nighttime work       schedule. Get rid of sound and       light distractions in the bedroom during daytime sleep. Use caffeine only during       the first part of a shift to promote alertness at night. If sleep does not come during the day and all else fails,  talk with a doctor to see if it would be wise to use prescribed, short-acting  sleeping pills to help sleep during the day. Dealing with Jet Lag Eastward travel generally causes more severe jet lag than  westward travel because traveling east requires people to shorten the day and the  biological clock is better able to adjust to a longer day than a shorter day. Fortunately  for globetrotters, a few preventive measures and treatments seem to help some  people relieve jet lag. Adjust the biological clock. Several days before traveling  to a new time zone, gradually shift sleeping patterns and eating times to  coincide with those at the final eastern destination. People can also adjust the  biological clock by using light therapy. This involves exposure to special  lights, many times brighter than ordinary household light, for several hours  near to the new wake up time. Alternatively, after arrival, spend a lot of time  outdoors to make sure the body gets the light cues it needs to adjust to the  new time zone. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Although it may be tempting to  drink alcohol to relieve the stress of travel and make it easier to fall  asleep, people more likely to sleep lighter and wake up in the middle of the  night when the effects of the alcohol wear off. Caffeine can help keep people  awake longer, but caffeine can also make it harder for people to fall asleep if  its effects have not worn off by bed time. What about melatonin? The body produces the melatonin  hormone to make the body drowsy. Melatonin builds up in the body as the night  progresses and decreases when daylight arrives. Melatonin is available as an over-the-counter supplement.  Because melatonin is safe when used over a period of days or weeks and seems to  contribute to feeling sleepy, it is a treatment for jet lag. Nevertheless, the  effectiveness of melatonin is controversial and its safety when used over a  prolonged period is unclear. Some studies find that taking melatonin  supplements before bedtime for several days after arrival in a new time zone  can make it easier to fall asleep at the proper time. Other studies find that  melatonin does not help to relieve jet lag. Be aware that adjusting to a new time zone may take several  days. If traveling away for just a few days, it may be better to stick to the  original sleep and wake times as much as possible, rather than adjusting the  biological clock too many times in rapid succession.
