The plant can be propagated easily by seeds and division. The root material, which is rich in volatile oils, has been used since Roman times for its sedating and tranquilizing properties; valerian has been used traditionally for nervousness, depression, insomnia and anxiety. EFFECTS : Valerian has mild sedative and tranquilizing effects. It also reduces insomnia, nervousness and anxiety when used over a 2-week period. Valerian is quite safe for human consumption. Autonomic effects: fatigue, mydriasis, palpitation of the heart and tremor. DURATION : The effects of valerian appear 0,5-1 hour after ingestion and last a few hours. Dosage and preparation : The ground root material can be eaten (fresh or dried), imbibed as a tea, taken as an alcoholic tincture or be smoked. A tea may be prepared by boiling the plant material in 0.5-1 litre of water for ± 5 minutes. 2-5 grams of dried root (taken one or more times a day over a 2-week period) is effective in reducing nervousness and anxiety. With doses above 10 grams the sedative, psychotropic effects become more pronounced. Valerian combines well with hops (Humulus lupulus) and kava-kava (Piper methysticum); valerian/hops combinations produce strong sleep-inducing teas and valerian/kava-kava combinations (ratio resp. 50%/50%) enhance dreaming. Figure: Dried valerian Figure: Close-up Botanical aspects : V. officinalis is a perennial that belongs to Valerianaceae and is native to Europe. This plant has fingered leaves, small pinkish-white flowers and very odoriferous roots (rhizomes). It grows 0,3-1,5 meters in height and can easily be propagated by seeds and rhizome division. Phytochemistry : The roots contain valeneric acids (valerenic acid, hydroxy valerenic acid, acethoxy valerenic acid and valerenal), valepotriates (valtrate, isovaltrate, acevaltrate, didrovaltrate), actinidine (a pyridine derivative), glutamine and a volatile oil, from which 150 compounds have been identified (mainly mono- and sesquiterpenes). Table 1.32: Valepotriates Table 1.33: Valerenic acids Table 1.32,a /1.33,a: Substituents of valepotriats and valerenic acids Pharmacology : Constituents of valerian extracts have affinity for GABA-, adenosine-, barbiturate- and benzodiazepine receptors.These pharmacological effects have been ascribed mainly to the presence of the valerenic acids, valepotriates, actinidine and glutamine. - The valtrates (especially dihydrovaltrate) have specific affinity for barbiturate and peripheral benzodiazepine- receptors. - The valerenic acids (val. acid, AcO-val. acid) inhibit the enzymatic inactivation of GABA in the brain by 20-38% (accumulation of GABA may result in a decreased central activity and increased sedativity). - Glutamine may also contribute to increasing the GABA concentrations, because in the brain glutamine (which easily passes the blood-brain-barrier) can be converted into GABA. - Actinidine also appears to affect the GABA neurosystem. It is still not known whether the psychoactivity is an effect of a group of compounds, some unknown compounds or due to a synergistic effect. It is known, however, that the effects of the individual constituents cannot account for the total root activity. Toxicology : There is some evidence that several decomposition products of valepotriates (baldrinal and homobaldrinal) exhibit cytotoxic- and mutagenic activity. Modifiers : - Valerian might antagonize the effects of alcohol. - Kava-kava (piper methysticum) enhances dreaming when combined with valerian. - Hops (humulus lupulus) combinations are strongly sleep-inducing. - Valerian potentiates barbiturate-induced sleeping-time. - Activated charcoal reduces the effects of valerian.
