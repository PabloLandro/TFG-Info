Only you cannot buy replacements at the hardware store! Drink up! Pure water helps flush toxins  from the kidneys. Your kidneys filter and purify the  blood. Each one has about one million microscopic filters called nephrons that  absorb nutrients and then eliminate waste and toxins as blood circulates  through the kidneys. The kidneys work constantly to help balance body fluids  and minerals. Urinary system problems can range from incontinence to infections  to painful stones to kidney failure, requiring transplant or dialysis. Carbonated beverages, caffeine, 
table salt and too much alcohol can damage the urinary system as they affect mineral and  fluid balance. The  Urinary System pack This pack contains  the following products: URINARY  MAINTENANCE • Strengthens and balances the entire urinary  system. COMBINATION  POTASSIUM • The kidneys balance all of the minerals in the  body, especially sodium and potassium. Most people do not get adequate  potassium. KB-C TCM • Strengthens the kidneys’ ability to balance  the minerals of the body. • May help to strengthen the bones. Its Chinese name jian gu can be translated to mean “strengthen the   bones.” It is designed to strengthen the water element. In Traditional   Chinese Medicine, it is used to nourish the kidneys and   nutritionally support the urinary and structural systems, eliminating   water and providing extra joint support . Complimentary Urinary System Products CRANBERRY & BUCHU CONCENTRATE • Contains  substances that interfere with the adhesion of potentially dangerous microbes  to the urinary tract lining. • Nourishes the urinary tract. Cranberry contains a substance that reduces the ability of bacteria to   cling to the lining of the urinary tract. This may reduce the tendency   to develop urinary tract infections. Cranberry also controls the odor of   urine from incontinent individuals. It retards the degradation of urine   by Escherichia coli bacteria to produce   ammonia odors. KIDNEY ACTIVATOR TCM • Supports the urinary and  lymphatic systems. • Chinese name qu shi can be translated as “to get rid of dampness.” • May promote  kidney function and help clear retained water from the body. Kidney Activator TCM Concentrate, Chinese [Urinary] contains the same   herbs found in Chinese Kidney Activator but in a highly concentrated   blend. This Chinese combination of 16 herbs is designed to support the   urinary and lymphatic systems. Kidney Activator is called qu shi, which   can be translated as “to get rid of dampness.” In Traditional Chinese   Medicine, it is said to promote kidney function and to help clear   retained water from the body, which may positively affect joints. Its   primary herbs include morus, hoelen, alisma and astragalus. J P-X • Contains  juniper, parsley and other herbs that help support the kidneys and bladder. A male urinary system tonic. This combination is diuretic and   antiseptic. It is used to restore weakened sexual function; also scanty   or difficult urination, water retention, bladder infections. KIDNEY DRAINAGE • Features  asparagus and plantain, which may help support fluid removal from the kidneys. • Contains  juniper berries, which may help maintain proper fluid balance. • May help increase urine production (goldenrod) without reducing important  electrolytes. The kidneys can be compared                           to a water purification plant. These organs remove waste from the blood just as a purification                           facility removes impurities from drinking water. Every day the kidneys filter nearly 200 liters of fluid                           from the bloodstream. They excrete toxins, metabolic wastes                           and excess ions, and they reabsorb necessary metabolic                           byproducts. 
Optimal kidney function is needed to remove metabolic                           waste and maintain the health of the surrounding tissue. Complimentary  Essential Oils Essential oils  are concentrated oils expressed from plants.

Pine Needle Pure Essential Oil [ Urinary , Immune, Respiratory,   Circulatory, Skin] (Pinus sylvestris, steam distilled, wildcrafted) has   traditionally been used for its warm, stimulating and revitalizing   properties. Its antiseptic and antibacterial compounds are soothing to   skin conditions, and its strengthening characteristics invigorate and   regenerate.
