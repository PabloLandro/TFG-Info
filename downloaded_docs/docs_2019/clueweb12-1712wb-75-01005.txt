women feel when they are going through menopause. They are one of 
the most common and earliest signs of menopause. How do they occur? Hot flashes result from a decrease in the female hormone estrogen. 
Their exact cause is not completely understood, but it is believed 
that estrogen production may affect the part of the brain that 
controls the body's temperature. Blood vessels in the face, chest, 
and body dilate (widen) and make you feel warmer. Hot flashes usually appear suddenly and without any warning, but 
they may be triggered by emotional stress, excitement, anxiety, 
alcohol, or some foods. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of a hot flash include: redness and warmth on the skin of your face, neck, shoulders, 
or upper chest pounding heartbeat sweating followed by a slight chill Hot flashes may last a few seconds or as long as 30 minutes. Most 
last no longer than 2 or 3 minutes. Hot flashes are most 
troublesome when they occur at night and interrupt your sleep. How are they diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you and ask about your 
symptoms. What is the treatment? If your hot flashes are mild and infrequent, use a fan or sip a 
glass of cool water or juice when a hot flash begins. If your hot flashes are frequent and severe, and if you have night 
sweats severe enough to keep you from sleeping, your healthcare 
provider may suggest hormone therapy. This treatment involves 
taking the 2 hormones estrogen and progesterone if you still have 
your uterus. You may take estrogen without progesterone if you no 
longer have your uterus. The hormones can be prescribed as pills 
that you swallow, skin patches, creams, vaginal suppositories, 
vaginal rings, shots, or pellets placed under the skin. Depending 
on your age, treatment with estrogen and progestin may increase 
the risk for heart disease. It may also increase your risk for 
stroke, breast cancer, blood clots, some gallbladder problems, and 
possibly dementia. Also, estrogen taken without progestin 
increases the risk of uterine cancer if you still have your 
uterus. Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy with 
your healthcare provider. Other medicines your provider may prescribe are Catapres 
(clonidine) or Bellergal, a medicine that contains phenobarbital. Talk to your provider about what might be the best treatment for 
you. How long will the hot flashes last? Hot flashes may begin before you have stopped having your 
menstrual periods. They may stop after a few months, or they may 
continue for as long as 5 years or more. How can I take care of myself? Try to keep cool, both physically and emotionally. Avoid hot, spicy foods. Keep as cool as you can in hot weather or in warm rooms. Wear 
light, cotton clothing and dress in loose layers. Keep your 
house cool and use lightweight blankets at night. Don't drink or eat a lot of red wine, chocolate, or aged 
cheeses. These foods contain a chemical that can affect your 
body's thermostat and trigger a hot flash. Avoid smoking, alcohol, and caffeine. Exercise regularly, according to your healthcare provider's 
recommendation. Use relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises, to 
help relieve stress. Published by RelayHealth. This content is reviewed periodically and is subject to
