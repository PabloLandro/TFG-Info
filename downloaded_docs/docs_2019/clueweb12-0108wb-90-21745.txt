The gel on the inside of the aloe vera leaf contains nutrients that support the immune system that aid in the healing soft tissues and membranes that line the entire digestive tract.  It has been used topically on minor cuts, itching and wounds by breaking the leaf and rubbing the gel on the affected area, which is where the plant has gained most of its popularity.  It cools and soothes these areas, especially in the case of a minor burn.  The properties of this plant may promote the shedding of dead skin cells while stimulating new tissue growth.  Having said this, it may prevent a scar from occurring.  Aloe Vera contains calcium, iron, lecithin, 
zinc, potassium, sodium, magnesium and manganese. POTENTIAL BENEFITS: Aloe Vera has been used to support digestion and may help to reduce inflammatory processes in the gastro-intestinal tract.  Aloe Vera may be used for burns, insect bites, scar tissue, sores, wrinkles and sunburns.  It can also be used as a deodorant.  Isn't that wonderful?  Aloe Vera may also be applied to external hemorrhoids to decrease the inflammation.  When I was young, my mom would use the gel from the inside of the Aloe Vera leaf on our skin to treat poison ivy and poison oak. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS: DO NOT take Aloe Vera if you are pregnant or if you have any gastro-intestinal disorders.  May cause allergic reactions, cramping or diarrhea.  If taken internally as a purgative, it may cause a hemorrhage.  DO NOT exceed recommended dosages.  If taken as a laxative in excess, it could lead to irritation of the bowels or ulcers.  DO NOT give internally to children or the elderly without a physician's recommendation.  When used as a topical, deep wounds should be treated by a professional healthcare provider. PARTS USED: The gel on the inside of the leaves. GENERAL USAGE: Aloe Vera may be used daily, but check with your doctor first.  Aloe Vera has been used for burns, as a deodorant, for digestion problems, hemorrhoids, insect bites, radiation burns, scalds, scar tissue and other skin conditions.
