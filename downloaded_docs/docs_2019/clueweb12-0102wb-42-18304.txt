        Stomach Bypass Types of Bariatric Operations Weight Loss Surgery Advice If you are severely obese and wish to 
        find a weight loss clinic or surgeon in Wisconsin, to discuss gastric bypass, lap-band or gastroplasty surgeries, 
        please see details in center panel. Bariatric Surgeons in Wisconsin Gastric bypass or banding operations to reduce morbid obesity are fast 
        becoming an effective method of assisting patients to reduce weight and 
        improve weight-related health risks. But, no matter whether you choose 
        gastric bypass (like roux-en-y or fobi pouch) or adjustable stomach banding 
        (like lap-band), or any type of gastroplasty, it's important to realise 
        that no weight loss operation can help you normalize your weight in the 
        long-term unless you follow the proper post-operative diet and exercise 
        guidelines. Due to the restrictive nature of the typical diet 
        plan after bypass surgery , make sure you ask your bariatric clinic 
        about what post-surgery support groups they have and what other patient 
        suppport services are available. Finally, before deciding on any type of weight loss surgery, ask your 
        doctor for a full explanation of all your options, including non-surgical 
        weight reduction methods. Obesity Clinics in
