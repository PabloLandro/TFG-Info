Lower Back Pain and Gas Lower Back Pain and Gas Lower back pain and gas are hardly any fun, but when you have them at the same time, they can both be down right unbearable.

Lower back pain is one of the most common problems among adults world wide.  Eighty percent of adults will experience lower back pain at least once during life.

In fact most lower back pain treatments can be done at home.

Sometimes heating pads and ice packs have had success in treating lower back pain as well. Gas pain is becoming more and more common as well.

Gas pain can be treated in a number of ways, but it all depends on what is causing the gas pain to occur in the first place.  The best way to prevent gas is to eat a healthy and balanced diet and to do your best to relax.  Stay away from acidic foods and drinks like soda and junk food.  In the event that gas pain still occurs, there are a few remedies you can try before heading to the doctor.  Drinking tea is a great way to eliminate gas pain (it is also a fantastic remedy for stomach problems).  Another way, which will not taste good, is to mix hot water and medical charcoal and then drink it. If the lower back pain and gas are happening simultaneously, it could be a sign that you are in need of medical assistance.
