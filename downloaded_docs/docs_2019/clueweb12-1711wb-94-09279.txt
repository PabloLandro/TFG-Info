I had an injured horse, I was looking for ways to help promote healing and to keep infection away. My filly had punctured her tendon sheath on one of her back legs, pastern area. She spent a week at the clinic and 6 weeks on stall rest. We used this on the wound. The prognosis for a tendon sheath injury/infection is only a 5% chance of a full recovery. The filly is now 100% sound and full of herself. I HIGHLY reccommend this product for any cut, scrape, major wound. It truly does help. Last spring my colt hurt his pastern... Weeks went by. It wasn't healing, but wasn't getting worse either. We were all at our wits end. The vets were all very frustrated. We tried everything, then I remembered the honey... We started using it. On day 7 of 'the honey use' we took off the bandage to a healed wound. Completely healed, no proud flesh, not even a raised scar. By day 9 after we started using honey, the hair was growing back. This was after weeks and weeks of treatments. 7 days of honey and it was completely healed. I had pictures, but lost them somehow (technology hates me sometimes lol.) The vets now reccommend it and even carry a couple of jars with them. I just can't say enough good about this honey. I would reccommend that everyone keep a jar on hand. I have a couple and will never be without again.

It sounds so sticky, but I guess that wasn't a problem?

The vet was skeptical, but at that point was willing to try anything. It worked and now they all carry it. It is sticky, but you just slap a spoonful on the bandage and spread it around then apply the bandage (usually a square of gauze) to the wound, then wrap the wound up. If it's cold enough out that there are no flies and the wound is in a hard to wrap area, a bandage isn't necessary. If there are flies, it's best to wrap it - obviously. If you go to www.manukahoneyusa.com it will tell you all about how it promotes healing, how to use it etc.  It's great stuff, even for humans, I highly recommend it.
