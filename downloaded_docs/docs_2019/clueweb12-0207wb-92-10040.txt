Cinnamon-6, as Referenced in the book, "A Promise Made, A Promise Kept" , by Dr. James Chappell In his book, "A Promise made, A promise Kept," Dr. James Chappell					  gives you the six herbs and one mineral that have been shown to "reverse" (cure) diabetes.  Because he describes in detail how these herbs and minerals work, and refers to them specifically as "cures," 					  the FDA forbids him to manufacture and, or sell the formula. Cinnamon, by itself, may help those with type 2 diabetes more efficiently utilize insulin secreted by the pancreas.  More effiecient insulin utilization means more appropriate sugar levels.					  Some of the constituents that make up cinnamon have been shown, in both in vitro and animal studies to stimulate insulin receptors and block the enzyme that interrupts them. But... why settle for one effective herb, when you can have six, plus a mineral that have been shown to help regulate sugar levels?  Here they are in one incredible product- it's called CINNAMON-6 Cinnamon - Latin name: Cinnamomum zeylanicum - Found in India, Madagascar, and Brazil. American Ginseng - Latin name: Panax quinquefolium - Found in North America.  Today American ginseng is one of the most popular herbs.  					  American ginseng's adaptogenic qualities help balance the body, depending on the individual's needs. Bitter Melon - Latin name: Momordica Charantia - Found in Amazon, East Africa, Asia, Caribbean, and South America.  Bitter Melon is also known as Karela or Momordica					  Charantia. Chromium - Chromium was first discovered as an essential trace element in 1955.  It can be found in yeast, foods, cereals, whole grains, 					  spices and more.  The body of an average, healthy individual contains only several miligrams. Fenugreek - Latin Name: Trigonella foenum-graecum - Found in Argentina, France, India, and North Africa.  The seeds of Fenugreek are a condiment					  commonly used in Indian homes and are a rich source of fiber, particularly gel fiber.  Gel fiber from Fenugreek resembles guar gum in chemical structure. Gymneme Sylvestre - Latin name: Gymnema Sylvestre - Found mostly in India.  In ancient times, Ayurvedic Physicians of India observed					  that the leaves of the plant GYMNEMA SYLVESTRE posses a remarkable property of suppressing for a few hours, the sense of taste for sweet substances. Nopel - Latin name: Opuntia Ficus-Indica - is a perennial cactus that is found in semi-tropical areas throughout the world, also known as 					  prickly pear. * Prices include FREE Ground Shipping within the Continental U.S. Cinnamon-6                                   Quantity Price 1 Bottle - 243 Capsules $44.95 - *FREE Shipping Included Cinnamon-6                                          Supplement Facts Serving Size Servings Per Container 9                                          Capsules 27 Amount                                          Per Serving Cinnamon-6 750mg per Capsule Calories 10 Calories from Fat 1.5 Carbohydrates 3 grams Chromium (as picolinate) 450mcg Proprietary Blend 6750mg Cinnamon, Gymnema Sylvestre leaves (Gurmar), Nopal cactus (Prickly Pear), American Ginseng, Fenugreek (Defatted Seeds), Bitter Melon Other Ingredients: Modified cellulose, vegetable stearic acid, silica and magnesium stearate Cinnamon 6 Directions for Use: Adults, 150 Lbs., take (3) capsules, 3 times a day, 10 minutes before meals (1 capsule per 50 Lbs. of body weight).
