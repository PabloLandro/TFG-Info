The weekend gardener is just as likely to be affected as the world-class athlete. Cramp is a muscular pain where the muscle suddenly contracts and cannot relax. Cramps are most common in the thigh, calf or foot, and can strike at any time, even during sleep. Muscle cramps are not the result of an injury, but no one knows exactly why they occur. The cause may be an imbalance in the minerals that govern muscle contraction and relaxation – calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium- or a lack of fluid. Exercising too strenuously during the day may lead to calf cramps painful enough to wake you from a sound sleep, as can wearing high heels or sleeping with your toes pointed up or with bedding wrapped too tightly around your legs. How supplements can help To balance minerals needed for proper muscle contraction, take supplements of calcium and magnesium on a routine basis. Most people get enough sodium in their diet, but many do not get enough potassium. This is best obtained by eating plenty of fruit and vegetables rather than from supplements. Add Vitamin E daily if you are prone to exercise related cramps or night time cramps. Did you know? Pregnant women should take care during exercise because they are at high risk of muscle cramps. The metabolic needs of the developing baby affect the normal balance of body fluids, making cramp more likely. To ease a cramp in your calf muscle, stand up, put your full weight on the affected leg and bend the knee slightly. Another way to obtain relief is to flex your foot, grab your toes and the ball of your foot, and then gently pull towards your knee as you lie down. Massage your calf at the same time to relax the muscles. Drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after exercise.
