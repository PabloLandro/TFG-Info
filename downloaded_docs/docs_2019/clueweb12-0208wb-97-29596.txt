teeth from decay.  These surfaces often decay because of the deep pits and 
grooves where the toothbrush bristles will not reach. By placing a thin plastic material over the grooves, the 
sealant keeps plaque and food out of the crevices, reducing the risk of 
decay Have sealants applied soon after the permanent molar teeth erupt, usually 
	between the ages of six and eight and then at twelve years of age.  
	Kids like it because it is easy and painless.  Sealants are less 
	expensive than fillings and usually last several years. Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Viewing /
