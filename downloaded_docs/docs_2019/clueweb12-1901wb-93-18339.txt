    & Research Cinnamon: 
    Proven to help Diabetics People with diabetes may help keep their 
bodies healthy by simply adding a dash of cinnamon to their diet, new research 
reports. In a study conducted by the American 
Diabetics Association, diabetics who incorporated less than one-quarter teaspoon 
of cinnamon per day for 40 days into their normal diets experienced a decrease 
in levels of blood sugar, cholesterol and blood fats. The 
current findings suggest that a small amount of cinnamon can help protect 
diabetics from excess blood glucose and other potential complications of their 
condition, study author Dr. Richard A. Anderson of the Beltsville Human 
Nutrition Research Center in Maryland told Reuters Health. Anderson 
noted that cinnamon may also help hold off the onset of type 2 diabetes in 
people at risk of the condition. Anderson 
and his team found that cinnamon-takers experienced a drop in blood levels of 
glucose, fats and cholesterol by up to 30 percent. No change was seen in the 
people taking placebo capsules. Anderson 
explained that cinnamon contains compounds that help make insulin more 
efficient, improving the hormone's ability to bring glucose to the cells that 
need it. As an 
added bonus, cinnamon contains virtually no calories, Anderson said, allowing 
diabetics to add zest to their meals without adding to their waistlines. Previous 
research has shown that cinnamon appears to help fat cells recognize and respond 
to insulin. In test tube and in animal studies, the spice increased glucose 
metabolism by about 20 times. Cinnamon Helps Treat Diabetes. Diabetes Care.
