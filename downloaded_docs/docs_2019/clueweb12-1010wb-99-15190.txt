Does Cinnamon Have Health Benefits | Health Alternative Home Gambling Health & Fitness Health Care & Medical Home Articles Does Cinnamon Have Health Benefits Does Cinnamon Have Health Benefits Before history was recorded, cinnamon was used as a commodity. In fact, it was considered so unique and precious that it was considered an appropriate gift for heads of state and royalty. An Antioxidant Experts do not yet agree on the health benefits of cinnamon, though it is agreed that cinnamon is full of antioxidants. The plant from which cinnamon is derived, C. zeylanicum, contains a host of various antioxidants making it a possibly viable food usable for managing oxidative stress. This could mean that cinnamon has a role to play in treatment of several chronic diseases associated with free radical damage. One of the easiest ways for people to utilize cinnamon in their diet is by making tea from its bark. Here is a list of some of the identified antioxidants contained in cinnamon camphene, proanthocyanidins, linalyl-acetate, myrcene, gamma-terpinene, methyl-eugenol, epicatechin, coumaric acid, caffeic acid, isoeugenol, mannitol, phenol and vanillan. For Pregnant women, undue amounts of cinnamon should not be taken as an herbal supplement. Diabetes Alternative Cinnamon is a dominant inducer of insulin sensitivity making it an effectual treatment for Type II diabetes. Though cinnamon has been reported to have amazing pharmacological effects in the treatment of Type II diabetes, the plant substance used in the study was mostly from cassia. I’ll tell you more about cassia in a moment. In 2003, a study published in Diabetes Care, outlined a test group of sixty men and women. The participants were given doses of 1, 3 or 6 grams of cinnamon daily in a pill form. This would be the equivalent of about one fourth to one teaspoon of cinnamon. Forty days after the study began, all three dosages of cinnamon proved to reduce fasting blood glucose levels by 18-29 percent. LDL cholesterol was reduced by 7-27 percent, triglycerides by 23-30 percent and total cholesterol from 12-26 percent. Cinnamon and Cassia The word cinnamon correctly refers to Ceylon cinnamon, also called true cinnamon from the botanical C. zeylanicum. Cassia or (Cinnamomum aromaticum) is often marketed as true cinnamon. This is true of Cinnamomum burmannii and Saigon Cinnamon or (Cinnamomum loureiroi) as well. Another clever marketing tactic used to signify cassia from true cinnamon are the names Chinese cinnamon, Vietnamese cinnamon or Indonesian cinnamon. True Ceylon cinnamon is produced only from the thin inner bark of the plant and is not considered as strong or harsh as cassia. Cassia is usually noted as having a stronger flavor than true cinnamon. In supermarkets in the United States, all of the powdered cinnamon sold is actually cassia. Cassia is also the type of cinnamon normally found in supplement form. It naturally contains a compound called coumarin. Coumarin is found in other plants like celery, chamomile, sweet clover, and parsley. Coumarin is a toxic element and European health agencies have of late warned against consuming large quantities of cassia. Coumarin is known to cause liver and kidney damage when consumed in high concentrations. True Ceylon cinnamon has trivial amounts of coumarin. Always check with your health practitioner before changing your diet.
