<30 days without evidence of improvement) predicted significantly abnormal radiographs (complete opacification, mucosal thickening of at least 4 mm, or an air-fluid level) in 80% of children. 31 For children 6 years of age
or younger, the history predicted abnormal sinus radiographs in 88% of
children. For children older than 6 years, the history of persistent
symptoms predicted abnormal sinus radiographs in 70%. The peak age for
acute bacterial sinusitis is in children 6 years of age or younger.
Accordingly, in this age group, because a positive history predicts the
finding of abnormal sinus radiographs so frequently (and because
history plus abnormal radiographs results in a positive sinus aspirate
in 75% of cases), radiographs can be safely omitted and a diagnosis of
acute bacterial sinusitis can be made on clinical criteria alone.
Approximately 60% of children with symptoms of sinusitis (persistent
or severe) will have bacteria recovered from an aspirate of the
maxillary sinus. In contrast to the general agreement that radiographs are not necessary
in children 6 years of age or younger with persistent symptoms, the
need for radiographs as a confirmatory test of acute sinusitis in
children older than 6 years with persistent symptoms and for all
children (regardless of age) with severe symptoms is
controversial. 32 ,33 Some practitioners may elect to
perform sinus radiographs with the expectation or suspicion that the
study may be normal. A normal radiograph is powerful evidence that
bacterial sinusitis is not the cause of the clinical
syndrome. 34 However, the American College of Radiology has
taken the position that the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated sinusitis
should be made on clinical grounds alone. 35 They support
this position by noting that plain radiographs of the paranasal sinuses
are technically difficult to perform, particularly in very young
children. Correct positioning may be difficult to achieve and therefore
the radiographic images may overestimate and underestimate the presence
of abnormalities within the paranasal sinuses. 36 ,37 The
college would reserve the use of images for situations in which the
patient does not recover or worsens during the course of appropriate
antimicrobial therapy. Similarly, a recent set of guidelines generated
by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership (representing numerous
constituencies) does not recommend either radiographs or computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scans to diagnose
uncomplicated cases of acute bacterial sinusitis in any age
group. 1 It is essential to recognize that abnormal images of the sinuses
(either radiographs, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging) cannot stand alone as diagnostic evidence of acute bacterial sinusitis under
any circumstances. Images can serve only as confirmatory measures of
sinus disease in patients whose clinical histories are supportive of
the diagnosis. Numerous investigations have demonstrated the high
frequency of abnormal images in the paranasal sinuses of children
undergoing imaging for indications other than suspected
sinusitis. 38-40 In a study by Glasier et
al, 39 almost 100% of young children who were undergoing
CT examination for reasons other than sinus disease and who had an
upper respiratory tract infection in the previous 2 weeks demonstrated
soft tissue changes in their sinuses. A study by Gwaltney et al in
1994 3 found that abnormalities of the paranasal sinuses on
CT scan are extremely common in young adults with acute (<72 hours)
uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infections. This study and others
serve to underscore that when abnormalities of the mucosa are present
on images they indicate the presence of inflammation but do not
disclose whether the inflammatory process is caused by viral infection,
bacterial infection, allergy, or chemical irritation (eg, chlorine
exposure in the swimmer). Recommendation 2b CT scans of the paranasal sinuses should be
reserved for patients in whom surgery is being considered as
a management strategy (strong recommendation based on good evidence and
strong panel consensus). Despite the limitations of CT scans, 3 38-40 they offer a
detailed image of sinus anatomy and, when taken in conjunction with
clinical findings, remain a useful adjunct to guide surgical treatment.
Computed tomography scans are indicated in children who present with
complications of acute bacterial sinus infection or those who have very
persistent or recurrent infections that are not responsive to medical
management. 33 In these instances, the image, preferably a
complete CT scan of the paranasal sinuses, is essential to provide
precise anatomic information to the clinician. These are instances in
which the physician may be contemplating surgical intervention,
including aspiration of the paranasal sinuses. Recommendation 3 Antibiotics are recommended for the management of acute
bacterial sinusitis to achieve a more rapid clinical cure (strong recommendation based on good evidence and strong panel consensus). To promote the judicious use of antibiotics, it is essential that
children diagnosed as having acute bacterial sinusitis meet the
defining clinical presentations of "persistent" or "severe" disease as described previously. 41 This will minimize the
number of children with uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract
infections who are treated with antimicrobials. In a study comparing antimicrobial therapy with placebo in the
treatment of children with the clinical and radiographic diagnosis of
acute bacterial sinusitis, children receiving antimicrobial therapy
recovered more quickly and more often than those receiving placebo. 31 On the third day of treatment, 83% of children receiving an antimicrobial were cured or improved compared with 51% of
the children in the placebo group. (Forty-five percent of children
receiving antimicrobial therapy were cured [complete resolution of
respiratory symptoms] compared with 11% receiving placebo.) On the
10th day of treatment, 79% of children receiving an antimicrobial were
cured or improved compared with 60% of children receiving placebo.
Approximately 50% to 60% of children will improve gradually without
the use of antimicrobials; however, the recovery of an additional 20%
to 30% is delayed substantially compared with children who receive
appropriate antibiotics. A recent study by Garbutt et al 42 has challenged the
notion that children identified as having acute sinusitis on clinical
grounds alone (without the performance of images) will benefit from
antimicrobial therapy. When children randomized to low-dose antibiotic
therapy were compared with those receiving placebo there were no
differences observed in outcome, either in the timing or frequency of
recovery. The discrepancy in results between this investigation and the
Wald 31 study may be attributable to the inclusion in this
study of a larger cohort of older children (who may not have had
sinusitis) and the exclusion of more seriously ill children with a
temperature >39°C or facial pain. Current recommendations for
antibiotic management of uncomplicated sinusitis vary depending on a
previous history of antibiotic exposure (in the previous 1-3 months),
attendance at day care, and age. Some of the children in the Garbutt
study might have qualified for high-dose
amoxicillin-clavulanate to overcome antimicrobial resistant pathogens.
    
    

    
    Comparative bacteriologic cure rates in studies of adults with acute
sinusitis indicate the efficacy of antimicrobial
treatment. 11 ,43 The findings of these studies indicate
that antimicrobials in adequate doses with appropriate antibacterial
spectra are highly effective in eradicating or substantially reducing
bacteria in the sinus cavity, whereas those with inadequate spectrum or
given in inadequate doses are not ( Table 1 ). View this table: [in this window] [in a new window] TABLE 1 Comparative Bacteriologic Cure Rates (as Determined by Sinus Puncture)
Among Adult Patients With Acute Community-Acquired Bacterial
Sinusitis * The microbiology of acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial
sinusitis has been outlined in several studies. 20-22 The
principal bacterial pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae , nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella
catarrhalis. S pneumoniae is recovered from approximately 30% of
children with acute bacterial sinusitis, whereas H influenzae and M catarrhalis are each recovered
from about 20%. 23 In the remaining 30% of children,
aspirates of the maxillary sinus are sterile. It is noteworthy that
neither Streptococcus aureus nor
respiratory anaerobes are likely to be recovered from children with
acute bacterial sinusitis. 22 Currently, approximately 50% of H influenzae and 100% of M catarrhalis are likely to be -lactamase positive
nationwide. 44 ,45 Upper respiratory tract isolates of S pneumoniae are not susceptible to penicillin in 15% to
38% (average 25%) of children; approximately 50% are highly
resistant to penicillin and the remaining half are intermediate in
resistance. 1 ,46 ,47 The mechanism of penicillin resistance
in S pneumoniae is an alteration of penicillin binding
proteins. This phenomenon, which varies considerably according to
geographic location, results in resistance to penicillin and
cephalosporin. Table 2 shows the
calculation for the likelihood that a child with acute bacterial
sinusitis will harbor a resistant pathogen and not respond to treatment with amoxicillin. The following should be considered: the
prevalence of each bacterial species as a cause of acute bacterial
sinusitis, the prevalence of resistance among each bacterial species,
and the rate of spontaneous improvement. Extrapolating from data
derived from patients with acute otitis media, 15% of children with
acute bacterial sinusitis caused by S pneumoniae will
recover spontaneously, half of the children with acute bacterial
sinusitis caused by H influenzae and half to three-quarters
of the children infected with M catarrhalis also will
recover spontaneously. 48 Furthermore, only S
pneumoniae that are highly resistant to penicillin will not
respond to conventional doses of amoxicillin. Accordingly, in the absence of any risk factors, approximately 80% of children with
acute bacterial sinusitis will respond to treatment with amoxicillin. Risk factors for the presence of bacterial
species that are likely to be resistant to amoxicillin
include 1) attendance at day care, 2) recent receipt (<90 days) of
antimicrobial treatment, and 3) age less than 2 years. 49 ,50 View this table: [in this window] [in a new window] TABLE 2 Calculation of the Likelihood that a Child With Acute Bacterial
Sinusitis Will Fail Treatment With Standard Doses of
Amoxicillin * The desire to continue to use amoxicillin as first-line
therapy in patients suspected of having acute bacterial sinusitis relates to its general effectiveness, safety, and tolerability; low
cost; and narrow spectrum. For children younger than 2 years of age
with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis that is mild to moderate
in degree of severity, who do not attend day care, and have not
recently been treated with an antimicrobial, amoxicillin is recommended at either a usual dose of 45 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses
or a high dose of 90 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses ( Fig 1 ). If the patient is allergic to
amoxicillin, either cefdinir (14 mg/kg/d in 1 or 2 doses),
cefuroxime (30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses), or cefpodoxime
(10 mg/kg/d once daily) can be used (only if the allergic reaction was
not a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction). In cases of serious allergic
reactions, clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses)
or azithromycin (10 mg/kg/d on day 1, 5 mg/kg/d × 4 days as a
single daily dose) can be used in an effort to select an antimicrobial
of an entirely different class. The Food and Drug Administration has
not approved azithromycin for use in patients with sinusitis.
Alternative therapy in the penicillin-allergic patient who is known to
be infected with a penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae is
clindamycin at 30 to 40 mg/kg/d in 3 divided doses. View larger version (39K): [in this window] [in a new window] Fig. 1. Management of children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis. Most patients with acute bacterial sinusitis who are treated with an
appropriate antimicrobial agent respond promptly (within 48-72 hours)
with a diminution of respiratory symptoms (reduction of nasal discharge
and cough) and an improvement in general
well-being. 11 ,23 ,31 If a patient fails to improve, either
the antimicrobial is ineffective or the diagnosis of sinusitis is not
correct. If patients do not improve while receiving the usual dose of
amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d), have recently been treated with
an antimicrobial, have an illness that is moderate or more severe, or
attend day care, therapy should be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (80-90 mg/kg/d of
amoxicillin component, with 6.4 mg/kg/d of clavulanate in
2 divided doses). This dose of amoxicillin will yield
sinus fluid levels that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of
all S pneumoniae that are intermediate in resistance to
penicillin and most, but not all, highly resistant S
pneumoniae . There is sufficient potassium clavulanate to inhibit all -lactamase producing H influenzae and M
catarrhalis . Alternative therapies include cefdinir,
cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime. A single dose of ceftriaxone
(at 50 mg/kg/d), given either intravenously or intramuscularly, can be
used in children with vomiting that precludes administration of oral
antibiotics. Twenty-four hours later, when the child is clinically
improved, an oral antibiotic is substituted to complete the therapy.
Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin-sulfisoxazole
have traditionally been useful in the past as first- and second-line
therapy for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis, recent
pneumococcal surveillance studies indicate that resistance to these 2 combination agents is substantial. 51 ,52 Therefore, when
patients fail to improve while receiving amoxicillin, neither trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole nor erythromycin-sulfisoxazole are appropriate choices for antimicrobial therapy. For patients who do
not improve with a second course of antibiotics or who are acutely ill,
there are 2 options. It is appropriate to consult an otolaryngologist
for consideration of maxillary sinus aspiration to obtain a sample of
sinus secretions for culture and sensitivity so that therapy can be
adjusted precisely. Alternatively, the physician may prescribe
intravenous cefotaxime or ceftriaxone (either in hospital or at home)
and refer to an otolaryngologist only if the patient does not improve
on intravenous antibiotics. Some authorities recommend performing
cultures of the middle meatus instead of aspiration of the
maxillary sinus to determine the cause of acute bacterial
sinusitis. 53 However, there are no data in children that
have correlated cultures of the middle meatus with cultures of the
maxillary sinus aspirate. 54 The optimal duration of therapy for patients with acute bacterial
sinusitis has not received systematic study. Often empiric recommendations are made for 10, 14, 21, or 28 days of therapy. An
alternative suggestion has been made that antibiotic therapy be
continued until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an
additional 7 days. 23 This strategy, which individualizes treatment for each patient, results in a minimum course of 10 days and
avoids prolonged courses of antibiotics in patients who are
asymptomatic and thereby unlikely to be compliant. Adjuvant Therapies No recommendations are made based on controversial and
limited data. Adjuvant therapies used to supplement the effect of antimicrobials have
received relatively little systematic investigation. 55 Available agents include saline nasal irrigation (hypertonic or normal
saline), antihistamines, decongestants (topical or systemic), mucolytic
agents, and topical intranasal steroids. Currently there are no data to recommend the use of H1 antihistamines
in nonallergic children with acute bacterial sinusitis. There is a
single prospective study in which children with presumed acute
bacterial sinusitis were randomized to receive either
decongestant-antihistamine or placebo in addition to
amoxicillin. The active treatment group received
topical oxymetazoline and oral decongestant-antihistamine syrup (brompheniramine and phenylpropanolamine). No difference in
clinical or radiographic resolution was noted between
groups. 56 There has been a single study of intranasal steroids as an adjunct to
antibiotics in young children with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis.
Intranasal budesonide spray had a modest effect on symptoms only during the second week of therapy. 57 A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel trial evaluating flunisolide spray as an adjunct to oral antibiotic therapy was reported
in patients at least 14 years of age. 58 The benefit of
flunisolide was marginal and of minimal clinical importance. There is
little reason to expect a substantial benefit from intranasal steroids
in patients with acute bacterial sinusitis when antibiotics work
effectively in the first 3 to 4 days of treatment. No clinical trials of mucolytics have been reported in nonatopic
children or adults with acute bacterial sinusitis. 59 Neither saline nose drops nor nasal spray have been studied in patients
with acute bacterial sinusitis. However, by preventing crust formation
and liquefying secretions, they may be helpful. In addition, saline
also may act as a mild vasoconstrictor of nasal blood
flow. 59 A method for performing a nasal saline flush was
reported anecdotally by Schwartz. 60 Antibiotic Prophylaxis No recommendations are made based on limited and
controversial data. Antibiotic prophylaxis as a strategy to prevent infection in patients
who experience recurrent episodes of acute bacterial sinusitis has not
been systematically evaluated and is
controversial. 59 Although previously successful in
children who experience recurrent episodes of acute otitis
media, 61 ,62 there is little enthusiasm for this approach
in light of current concerns regarding the increasing prevalence of
antibiotic-resistant organisms. Nonetheless, it may be used in a few
highly selected patients whose infections have been defined
meticulously (always fulfilling criteria for persistent or severe
presentation) and are very frequent (at least 3 infections in 6 months
or 4 infections in 12 months). Amoxicillin (20 mg/kg/d
given at night) and sulfisoxazole (75 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses) have
been used successfully to prevent episodes of acute otitis media.
Usually prophylaxis is maintained until the end of the respiratory
season. It is appropriate to initiate an evaluation for factors that
commonly predispose to episodes of recurrent acute bacterial
sinusitis such as atopy, immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, and
dysmotile cilia syndrome. Children with craniofacial abnormalities also
are at risk to develop acute bacterial sinusitis. Complementary/Alternative Medicine for Prevention and
Treatment of Rhinosinusitis No recommendations are made based on limited and
controversial data. A substantial number of children, adolescents, and their parents use
nonprescription cold medicines or simple home-based remedies such as
soups, fruit juices, or teas as alternatives or complements to
conventional therapy for the treatment of upper respiratory infections
including rhinosinusitis. 63 ,64 Others use herbal remedies
and nutritional supplements or seek care from acupuncturists,
chiropractors, homeopaths, naturopaths, aromatherapists, massage and
therapeutic touch practitioners, and a variety of other healing
modalities. 64-67 Few of these therapies for upper respiratory tract infection or
rhinosinusitis have been validated in randomized controlled trials.
Claims that homeopathic medicines, 68-70 vitamin C
preparations, 71 or zinc lozenges 72 prevent
upper respiratory infections or hasten their resolution are
controversial. A recently published study provides evidence that zinc
nasal gel is effective in shortening the duration of symptoms of the
common cold when taken within 24 hours of their onset. 73 Studies performed among adults indicating efficacy of Echinacea preparations in stimulating the immune system,
thereby reducing the incidence, duration, or severity of respiratory
infections, are debated 74 ,75 ; however, a recent
meta-analysis suggested a predominance of generally positive
effects. 76 Physicians treating children and young adults should be aware that many
of their patients are using complementary therapies, often without
informing them. Most of these remedies are harmless and, whether
through pharmacologic or placebo effect, a perception of efficacy in
providing relief from symptoms has stood the test of time.
Nevertheless, many herbal medicines sold in the United States are of
uncertain efficacy, content, and toxicity and carry a potential for
serious adverse effects. 77 Of particular concern is
the ability of the botanicals, either by direct interaction or by
altering excretion mechanisms, to magnify or oppose the effect of
conventional medicines that patients may be using
concurrently. 78 Physicians should inquire about the use of
complementary medicine for upper respiratory tract infections among
their patients, particularly those on long-term medication for chronic
conditions. Information on dietary supplements is available on a
regularly updated Internet site. 79 Recommendation 4 Children with complications or suspected complications of
acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively. This should include referral to an otolaryngologist usually with the
consultation of an infectious disease specialist, ophthalmologist, and
neurosurgeon (strong recommendation based on strong consensus of the
panel). The complications of acute bacterial sinusitis usually involve either
the orbit, the central nervous system, or both. Although rare,
complications can result in permanent blindness or death if not treated
promptly and appropriately. Periorbital and intraorbital inflammation and infection are the most
common complications of acute sinusitis and most often are caused by
acute ethmoiditis. These disorders are commonly classified in relation
to the orbital septum. The orbital septum is a sheet of connective
tissue continuous with the periosteum of the orbital bones that
separates tissues of the eyelid from those of the orbit. Preseptal
inflammation involves only the eyelid, whereas postseptal inflammation
involves structures of the orbit. Complications can be classified as 1)
periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis or sympathetic edema (periorbital
cellulitis is not a true orbital complication. The periorbital swelling
is attributable to passive venous congestion; infection is
confined to the paranasal sinuses), 2) subperiosteal abscess, 3)
orbital abscess, 4) orbital cellulitis, or 5) cavernous sinus
thrombosis. Mild cases of periorbital cellulitis (eyelid <50% closed) may be
treated with appropriate oral antibiotic therapy as an outpatient with
daily patient encounters. However, if the patient has not improved in
24 to 48 hours or if the infection is progressing rapidly, it is
appropriate to admit the patient to the hospital for antimicrobial
therapy consisting of intravenous ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d in 2 divided
doses) or ampicillin-sulbactam (200 mg/kg/d in 4 divided
doses). Vancomycin (60 mg/kg/d in 4 divided doses) may be added in
children in whom infection is either known or likely to be caused by S pneumoniae that are highly resistant to penicillin.
    
    

    
    If proptosis, impaired visual acuity, or impaired extraocular mobility
are present on examination, a CT scan (preferably coronal thin cut with
contrast) of the orbits/sinuses is essential to exclude a suppurative
complication. In such cases, the patient should be evaluated by an
otolaryngologist and an ophthalmologist. Suppurative complications
generally require prompt surgical drainage. An exception to this is the
patient with a small subperiosteal abscess and minimal ocular
abnormalities for whom intravenous antibiotic treatment for 24 to 48 hours is recommended while performing frequent visual and mental status
checks. Patients who have changes in visual acuity or mental status or
who fail to improve within 24 to 48 hours require prompt surgical
intervention and drainage of the abscess. Antibiotics can be altered,
if inappropriate, when results of culture and sensitivity studies
become available. In patients with altered mental status, neurosurgical consultation is
indicated. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (headache and
vomiting) or nuchal rigidity require immediate CT scanning
(with contrast) of the brain, orbits, and sinuses to exclude
intracranial complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis, osteomyelitis of the frontal bone (Pott's puffy tumor), meningitis, subdural empyema, epidural abscess, and brain abscess. Central nervous
system complications, such as meningitis and empyemas, should be
treated either with intravenous cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and
vancomycin pending the results of culture and susceptibility testing. AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH The extensive Medline searches to review the literature for the
diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in children uncovered the fact that there are scant data on which to base recommendations. Accordingly, areas for future research include the
following: 1. Conduct more and larger studies correlating the clinical findings of
acute bacterial sinusitis with findings of sinus aspiration, imaging,
and treatment outcome. 2. Develop noninvasive strategies to accurately diagnose acute bacterial
sinusitis in children. a. Correlate cultures obtained from the middle meatus of the maxillary
sinus of infected individuals with cultures obtained from the maxillary
sinus by puncture of the antrum. b. Develop imaging technology that differentiates bacterial infection from
viral infection or allergic inflammation. c. Develop rapid diagnostic methods to image the sinuses without
radiation. 3. Determine the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for children
with acute bacterial sinusitis. 4. Determine the causes and treatment of subacute and recurrent acute
bacterial sinusitis. 5. Determine the efficacy of prophylaxis with antimicrobials to prevent
recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. 6. Determine the impact of bacterial resistance among S
pneumoniae , H influenzae, and M catarrhalis on outcome of treatment with antibiotics by the performance of
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in well-defined
populations of patients. 7. Determine the role of adjuvant therapies (mucolytics, decongestants,
antihistamines, etc) in patients with acute bacterial sinusitis by the performance of prospective, randomized, clinical trials. 8. Determine the role of complementary and alternative medicine strategies
in patients with acute bacterial sinusitis by performing systematic,
prospective, randomized clinical trials. 9. Assess the effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the
epidemiology of acute bacterial sinusitis. 10. Develop new bacterial and viral vaccines to reduce the incidence of
acute bacterial sinusitis. CONCLUSION Top Abstract Background Methods Recommendation Conclusion References This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based
recommendations for the management of bacterial rhinosinusitis in children ages 1 to 21 years. The guideline emphasizes 1) appropriate diagnosis in children who present with persistent or severe upper respiratory symptoms; 2) the utility of imaging studies to confirm a
diagnosis; 3) treatment therapies such as antibiotic use including prophylaxis, adjuvant treatment, and alternative interventions; and 4)
management of complications. The guideline provides decision-making strategies for managing sinusitis to assist primary care providers in
diagnosing and treating children with this common health problem. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The subcommittee wishes to acknowledge the Agency for Healthcare
