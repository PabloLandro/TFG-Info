Ac. (NCCAOM) About My Acupuncture Practice The vision of Healing Points Acupuncture clinic is to provide exceptional health care, leaving every person with an ultimate experience of total well being. In order to provide relief for a wide variety of conditions, it is of utmost importance to address the root cause of imbalance.  Long-lasting results can only be achieved by assisting the body’s own innate ability to heal itself. This is accomplished through the use of several different acupuncture techniques to restore one’s body to a state of physical, mental, and spiritual balance. Several techniques used in the clinic are due to Dana’s close study of a variation of styles including Kiiko Matsumoto Style, Five Element Acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Acupuncture Physical Medicine. This allows the practice to offer treatments for numerous conditions with a gentle, caring, and effective touch. In addition, there are several specialties treated such as Chronic and Acute Pain Management, Anxiety and Stress, Depression,  Hormone Imbalances, Detox Acupuncture/Addiction (Smoking, Drugs, Alcohol), Menopause Syndrome, PMS, Facial Rejuvenation, Anti-aging Care, Skin disorders, Allergies & Asthma, Arthritis, Headache & Migraine, Gastro-Intestinal disorders, Colds & Flu, Autoimmune Disease, Sleep disturbances, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Immunity, and over-all Well Being, just to name a few.
