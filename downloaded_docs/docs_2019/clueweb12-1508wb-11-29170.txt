                                                        used to make

                                                        research suggests that
                                                        feverfew may be helpful

                                                        well-designed studies. One
                                                        study found that

                                                        medicines. It has been
                                                        suggested that feverfew
                                                        could help those with
                                                        milder symptoms. There

                                                        whether feverfew is
