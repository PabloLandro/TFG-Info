Acupuncture for Cancer Patients Those coping with cancer and other forms of disease often
look to acupuncture and other alternative therapies to provide relief for pain,
stress and anxiety. Practiced as early as the Stone Age, acupuncture has been a
source of relief for numerous conditions for thousands of years. The exact way the
technique was discovered or developed is not well-understood, but one legend
claims that Chinese soldiers receiving arrow wounds in battle reported relief
from pain in other body parts, which inspired further research. Acupuncture The National Cancer Institute (NCI) defines acupuncture as
the "application of stimulation such as needling, moxibustion, cupping, and
acupressure on specific sites of the body known as acupuncture points." They
report that acupuncture may work by inducing physical response in nerve cells,
the pituitary gland and certain parts of the brain. Some notable conditions that acupuncture has been known to
treat include allergies, gastrointestinal conditions, back pain, migraines and
infertility. Some proponents of modern Western medicine continue to doubt the
effects of acupuncture, but a growing body of scientific evidence has prompted
many medical professionals to consider the benefits of this treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) published a scientific
review of controlled clinical trials on acupuncture in 2003, and concluded it
was an effective method of treatment for 28 conditions. Some of the listed
conditions include adverse reactions to radiotherapy or chemotherapy,
depression, hypertension, nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain. They
also found evidence that suggests acupuncture could be effective for several
dozen more conditions, including abdominal pain, cancer pain, insomnia and
whooping cough. Due to the relief of symptoms associated with cancer, breast,
colon and mesothelioma cancer patients,
among others, have turned to acupuncture for relief of their cancer symptoms
and side effects. Acupuncture and
Cancer Acupuncture can be used as an additional and complimentary
treatment for the side effects that cancer patients experience, such as overall
pain and nausea (caused by other cancer treatments like chemotherapy). NCI
reports that clinical studies of acupuncture as a treatment for cancer show
that acupuncture can reduce vomiting and nausea caused by chemotherapy. They
also found that acupuncture may improve the immune system, helping cancer
patients to fight their condition and its side effects. The physical responses acupuncture can induce in nerve
cells, the pituitary gland and parts of the brain can cause the body to release
hormones, proteins and certain brain chemicals that affect a range of bodily
functions. Through this response, it is proposed that acupuncture can affect
blood pressure and body temperature, enhance immune system function, and
prompts the body to release natural pain killers (such as endorphins). Considered a natural form of treatment, acupuncture can help
to treat side effects of cancers that are caused by exposure to natural,
environmental forces, such as UV rays, radon or the toxic mineral asbestos.
Clinical research currently suggests that a number of cancers are caused by
exposure to environmental forces in those who happen to be genetically
predisposed. A notable example includes skin cancer, but other lesser-known
cancers, including the rare cancer mesothelioma, are also caused by exposure to
environmental toxins. Asbestos exposure is one of the only mesothelioma causes and it is
even linked to ovarian and prostate cancer. Patients coping with the symptoms
and side effects of these cancers have reported relief after receiving
acupuncture. Though the benefits of acupuncture are still questioned by
some medical professionals, numerous cancer patients have attested to the
healing effects of this age-old treatment approach. Acupuncture, along with
other forms of alternative medicine such as massage, meditation and yoga, have
certainly gained support from countless cancer patients, and clinical trials
continue to provide scientific evidence of the benefits of this treatment. « Online resources: January 2009 | Main Index | Archives | Online resources: September 2009 » August 2010: Monthly Archives August 2010 (1) March 2010 (1) December 2009 (1) November 2009 (1) September 2009 (1) June 2009 (1) January 2009 (1) September 2008 (1) August 2008 (2) Categories ASNY (3) Add category (1) CEU (18) Chinese Medicine (35) Chinese cooking (1) Chinese culture (11) Diseases (13) insomnia (1) sleep disorders (1) NYCTCM (30) Yemeng Chen (4) New York College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (7) Online resources (10) PTSD (3) TCM (15) TOEFL (1) acceptance (16) insurance (1) acupuncture-tcm (81) Korean 4 needle acupuncture (1) college (20) dementia history Chinese medicine (10) acupuncturists (31) admission (8) I20 (1) financial aid (5) international students (2) open houses (4) alumni (4) arthritis (3) back pain (2) benefits of acupuncture (17) diabetes (3) osteoarthritis (1) cancer (4) chinese herbs (22) clinic (13) clinical studies (10) continuing education (11) detox (2) diet (3) drug companies (2) ethics frozen shoulder (5) infertility (2) legal status (6) pain (9) physicians (4) prescription drugs (6) recipes (1) skin disease (4) stroke (1) students (19) tai chi (7) tennis elbow (3) tongue diagnosis (1) workers compensation (1) Monthly Archives November 2011 (3) October 2011 (2) September 2011 (3) August 2011 (1) July 2011 (3) June 2011 (1) May 2011 (5) April 2011 (2) February 2011 (5) January 2011 (6) December 2010 (4) November 2010 (9) October 2010 (8) September 2010 (7) August 2010 (6) July 2010 (1) June 2010 (2) May 2010 (6) April 2010 (8) March 2010 (3) February 2010 (2) December 2009 (4) November 2009 (6) October 2009 (1) September 2009 (1) August 2009 (1) July 2009 (4) June 2009 (6) April 2009 (4) March 2009 (7) February 2009 (4) January 2009 (5) December 2008 (6) November 2008 (4) October 2008 (3) September 2008 (3) August 2008 (8) Pages Clinical Training for Acupuncturists at NYCTCM Acupuncture-TCM Articles Acupuncture Applied to Treat Pain due to Whiplash Injuries Acupuncture in the Treatment of Brain Disorders Contributing to the future of Chinese Medicine Senile Dementia treated with Acupuncture Clinic Affordable acupuncture treatments - Mineola & Manhattan, at NYCTCM NYCTCM Acupuncture School About NYCTCM 紐約中醫學院簡介 Message from Yemeng Chen, NYCTCM President NYCTCM Core Values & Mission Statement Admission CEU Subscribe to this blog's feed Search About this Archive This page is a archive of entries in the Online resources category from June 2009 .
