< 0.01). Virtually all patients experienced adverse effects with each drug. 14 Gabapentin benefits at best a minority of patients with painful diabetic or post-herpetic neuropathy. Toxicity, but not analgesia, is dose-dependent. Stop the drug if pain relief does not clearly outweigh harm by 2 weeks. C) Local anaesthetics Mexilitine (Mexitil ® ) is an anti-dysrhythmic drug structurally related to lidocaine, with similar CNS, GI, and cardiovascular adverse effects. It is metabolized by the liver, with an average elimination half-life of 10 hours in healthy volunteers. The potential for dangerous drug interactions is significant, and mexilitine increased mortality in early trials of dysrhythmia suppression after MI. Although it has been used in painful diabetic and other neuropathies since 1988, we could find no double blind RCT of adequate quality to demonstrate an unequivocal benefit. Many small trials have serious design flaws. Such studies generally exclude patients with CHF, renal failure, abnormal EKG, or concomitant beta-blocker use, so that reported adverse event rates are undoubtedly lower than might be expected in typical elderly patients. 15 TABLE: Common analgesics and doses for chronic pain in the elderly.

Conclusions: Chronic pain, particularly  of musculo-skeletal origin, is a common problem for the elderly. Long-term controlled trials in older people with chronic pain are lacking and are needed to guide rational therapy. Physiological changes that occur with aging make older individuals more sensitive to the effects of drugs. Most analgesic drugs provide modest benefit to only a minority of patients. Start with low doses and titrate; symptomatic and functional benefits are evident early (usually within 1-2 weeks). Benefit of each analgesic must be established by a therapeutic trial and reassessed regularly. Overall goal of analgesic therapy is improved function and quality of life.
