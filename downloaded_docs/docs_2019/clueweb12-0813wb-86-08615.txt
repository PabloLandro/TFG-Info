It is a degenerative disease that affects the joints within the body. This causes mild to severe pain in the patient, and can limit mobility due to the excess pain the patient feels. If the condition is left untreated then the patient risks losing all of their mobility, crippling, and also large amounts of pain. A lot of old age people have this disease, although there are people who suffer from it earlier on in life. It is not life threatening, but it can be damaging.

Arthritis can be managed however, with the right medication or home remedies for arthritis patients. There is no cure for arthritis as well, it can only be managed, and kept under control while the patient has it. Arthritis is known mostly as inflammation of the joints. It evolves as a process and is generally described as being chronic since the pain can last for days on end. It has many different forms that it can develop such as osteoarthritis which involves the bones, and rheumatoid arthritis which affects the tissues, tendons, and muscles of the bodies. Both of these forms also affect the joints. Swelling and extreme joint pain are noticeable, and it can occur in any or all of the parts in the body where there are joints. The joints are what allow us to walk, move, sit, run, and do many normal everyday tasks. If these are affected by arthritis then it can seem near impossible to do anything while you have the disease or do not have the proper care for the disease at hand. It can damage these joints over time which calls for surgery to replace and revive them but will not get rid of the arthritis. The organs in the body can also be affected by arthritis depending on where the arthritis lays and how long the patient has suffered from it. Some of the arthritis types can be cause by the immune system turning on the body and acting against it. This allows your cells and tissues to start eating at each other instead of at infections and diseases within the body. This will cause pain, stiffness, and swelling within the muscles, tendons, joints, and other areas of the body that are being affected. An infection may also be a cause of arthritis, and it is mostly a cause in juvenile arthritis in small children. If an infection gets into the tissues, they do not fight it off, but rather fight at their own muscles and tissues causing the arthritis. The purpose of having any type of arthritis treatment is to ensure that there is no further degeneration of the joints and tissues in the body. This also means to increase mobility, and maintain the mobility that you gain. A combination of techniques should be used to treat and help with the management of arthritis.

Natural Anxiety Cures Anxiety, or "generalized anxiety disorder," is an affliction that can be debilitating. We all feel anxious on occasion, but when there is no apparent reason for worry or anxiety, or if the condition is chronic, then a medical approach may be necessary. Symptoms vary from person to person but often include tension, restlessness, irritability, and an inability to concentrate. Physical symptoms can include fatigue, tightness in the chest, sweatiness, headaches , insomnia , and indigestion . Before embarking on any course of treatment, it is best to consult with a doctor, who will be able to recognize other possible medical conditions that may be related to anxiety or that may point to other problems. Traditionally, doctors have prescribed various medications to alleviate generalized anxiety disorder. Such prescription medications, generally known as tranquilizers, include well-known drugs such as Valium and Xanax; these slow down the central nervous system and often bring fast relief , particularly when the patient is suffering from a panic attack. More recently, antidepressants such as Prozac and Zoloft have been prescribed to alleviate anxiety; these work by regulating the level of serotonin in the brain, but they require much longer to take effect. Unfortunately, the use of tranquilizers can lead to numerous side effects, from simple drowsiness or dizziness to disorientation, impaired thinking, memory loss, and depression . Also, continued use of tranquilizers can lead to physical dependence, and combining the use of tranquilizers with other substances such as alcohol, painkillers, or other prescription medications can be dangerous and even fatal. Antidepressants are also associated with side effects such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, and drowsiness; and, although not physically addictive, sudden withdrawal from antidepressants can lead to more serious complications such as depression. While they can be helpful, these prescription medications are not always the ideal solution for anxiety disorder, and are often just a short-term solution. Are there any natural remedies for anxiety that are just as effective as medications, but without the side effects and dangers of addiction? Simple improvements in one's lifestyle can be a good start. If you feel tremendous stress -- at your job, for instance -- consider scaling back your responsibilities, at least for the short-term. And take breaks -- even just 15 minutes away from your desk, in which you focus on pleasant, easy topics rather than your work at hand, can work wonders. Regular exercise provides a wealth of benefits -- it's not only great for relieving stress, but also helps you feel better about yourself and your physical condition, and improves your outlook on life. And a healthy, balanced diet helps the body cope with external stress. There are various herbal remedies that may help alleviate anxiety. Passionflower has been commonly used as a home remedy for anxiety as well as insomnia; studies have found the results of passionflower treatment to be similar to using benzodiazepine, a prescription drug. These studies have indicated improved job performance with passionflower, and less drowsiness. However, side effects may include nausea, and the use of passionflower may not be safe for persons with liver or kidney ailments. Valerian is an herb most commonly taken to treat insomnia; it is available in capsule form, but can also be consumed as tea or liquid extract. The use of valerian is suggested for cases of mild anxiety, and studies have compared results with those of Valium, with no statistical difference between valerian and Valium use. It takes longer -- up to three weeks -- for valerian to be effective, and side effects include dizziness, mild indigestion, and headache. Consultation with a health practitioner is recommended. Various other herbs, minerals, and natural substances have been used in the treatment of anxiety, among them kava, chamomile, magnesium, calcium, and B vitamins. For many of these cures, studies have been inconclusive, but a health care practitioner should be up-to-date on the latest research on a specific herbal or natural cure. Another natural remedy for anxiety that is increasingly popular is aromatherapy, particularly using essential oils from lavender but also bergamot, chamomile, jasmine, sandalwood, rose, cypress, and others. Chamomile oil can be mixed with bath water in the tub (8-10 drops); sandalwood and other oils can be massaged directly into the body, again in small quantities. The calming aromas of these oils help dispel tension and anxiety, and bring on a refreshing feeling. Bodywork, too, is an effective way of offering immediate relief from tension. Yoga, meditation, and deep breathing all serve to relieve stress, and to "teach" the body to remain calm even during periods of activity. Most communities have studios offering classes in these techniques, and a sustained regimen is recommended from sufferers of anxiety. Deep breathing, in particular, has a direct effect on how our bodies function. We tend to breathe from our chests, taking shallow breaths that contain only a teacup of oxygen. Deeper breaths, from the abdomen, contain as much as a quart of oxygen, improving circulation and also the function of the nervous system. Lie on your back on a firm mat on the floor, and take long, slow breaths: make sure that your belly is rising and falling with each breath, not your chest. Focusing carefully on each breath also serves to clear your mind of clutter and stressful thoughts. Massage therapy is another option: there are various techniques that serve to relax tension in the muscles, and calm the central nervous system. Generalized anxiety disorder affects many people, but many of us have simply learned to live with it. The above natural remedies may help alleviate our tension, and improve our quality of life. Natural Allergy Cures Can natural remedies be more effective See which ones work for you Many of us suffer from allergies, which are caused by our body's overreaction to otherwise harmless substances. Allergies are usually treated with medication or nasal sprays, but such medications can often have side effects. Can natural remedies be more effective? Many doctors believe that pharmaceuticals are still critical in the treatment of allergies, but that natural remedies can be used as a supplement. And, depending on the type of allergy and other conditions, natural cures can often be relied upon exclusively, doing away with the need for medications. What, specifically, causes allergies? Our bodies have effective immune systems that serve to block foreign substances from causing infections and other ailments. One way our immune systems work is to create antibodies, which are proteins that target foreign substances. There are many varieties of these antibodies, or "immunoglobulins," and they attack foreign bodies by directly attaching themselves to the foreign body's surface. A person who suffers from allergies, however, produces excessive quantities of a particular kind of antibody, "IgE" (immunoglobulin E), which tends to overreact to foreign invasions. The IgE antibodies are associated with "mast cells," specific cells of the immune system that are found in the nasal passage, eyelids, and other exposed areas. When IgE antibodies come into contact with, for instance, cat dander, the mast cell then releases chemicals such as histamine and leukotriene. It is these chemicals that cause inflammation and other allergic reactions. Doctors prescribe antihistamines for relief of allergic symptoms, but a natural allergy treatment program can often be just as effective, and there are a number of nutrients and herbs that can help. Butterbur, a shrub-like plant that has long been the source of various folk remedies, is often cited as one of the most effective natural remedies for allergies and hay fever. Butterbur extract can inhibit leukotriene, a chemical that causes swelling in the nasal passages. Some studies have shown that butterbur can be just as effective as common prescription drugs such as Allegra, with the added advantage of not causing drowsiness. Butterbur should not be taken in unprocessed form; it is commonly available as an extract, in tablet form. However, there may be side effects such as indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation; and pregnant women , and people with kidney or liver conditions, should consult with a doctor before taking butterbur. Quercetin is an antioxidant that is commonly found in fruits (the skin of apples, berries, and grapes), as well as red onions and black tea. Research suggests that quercetin is effective as an antihistamine, and it is available in supplement form. It can be thought of as an herbal substitute for nasal sprays such as NasalCrom. Stinging nettle is commonly used as a natural allergy treatment; look for extracts of the leaf, not the root. Many people find that taking stinging nettle, which includes carotene, vitamin K, and quercetin, at the first signs of an allergic reaction, can help bring relief. Stinging nettle leaf can also be taken as tea; be sure to let the teabag steep in a covered cup for 15 minutes to allow the oils to seep into the water before drinking. A saline nasal spray is an easy remedy that brings quick relief. A simple saltwater solution helps to wash away allergens and other irritants. Simply fill a squeeze bottle with a premixed packet of saline solution (from your drugstore), or, to make your own solution, mix one quart of distilled water (or boiled, then cooled water) with 2 or 3 teaspoons of non-iodized salt (commonly, kosher salt or sea salt) plus 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Using 8-ounce portions, tilt your head over a sink and squeeze the saline solution into one nostril; it will drain out the other nostril. Steam inhalation can be an easy remedy for nasal congestion. Heat a saucepan of water over your stove, bringing the water to a boil; then take the saucepan off the stove and add several drops of essential oils, which you can purchase at a health-food store. Essential oils from eucalyptus, rosemary, or tea trees are often used for this purpose. Then make a "tent" over the saucepan by covering your head with a bath towel and leaning over the saucepan, close so that you feel heat but don't get burned, and inhale for 5-10 minutes. Homeopathic treatments, too, can help relieve allergic symptoms. This technique uses diluted solutions of herb and flower essences, taken in tablet form. "Euphrasia" is known to alleviate burning or irritated eyes, while "Allium cepa" helps relieve congested nostrils. It's best to try one at a time, rather than both at once. Improving the environment in your home can also help relieve allergies. Cool-mist humidifiers can help clear the air in your home of allergens; the water droplets that are emitted by humidifiers bind to allergens that float freely throughout your living spaces, causing them to become heavy, so they fall to the floor rather than enter your nasal passages. Air purifiers can also remove pollens and spores from the air, and can be helpful in your bedroom, when you are sleeping. Allergies, particularly when severe, can be debilitating, but there are a wealth of natural allergy remedies that can supplement, and often replace, pharmaceutical solutions. See which ones work for you. Natural Home Cure For Back Pain All anyone needs to do is walk down an aisle in a drugstore to see how many products exist for lower back pain relief. As one might guess, there are so many products available to buy today because there are so many people suffering from lower back pain. The amount of people living with lower back pain is staggering. It's one of the most common complaints doctors deal with every day, in every doctor's office and hospital. Everyone is looking for ways to cure back pain that they experience. It's no wonder they are, either. Lower back pain can affect every aspect of a person's life. Sitting, standing, and even laying down.  All of those things and more can be made more difficult and infinitely more uncomfortable if you have an injured back. People wind up tired, cranky and in overall poor shape if they can't get the rest and relaxation they need. Poor rest means poor immune systems which results in increased sickness . Truly, lower back pain and everything it causes is a huge problem that needs to be addressed. Natural Home Cure For Back Pain Where can someone find lower back pain relief?  How can you cure back pain? As was stated earlier, drugstores usually have a wide assortment of products that promise relief but do they work? The answer is yes and no. It really depends on the type of injury you have that is causing your lower back pain. If you have a strain, heat tends to work very well. You can purchase disposable heat wraps that instantly activate the second the package is opened. Many of those kinds of heat wraps come with little pieces of Velcro or a cloth that can stick to itself that can be used to hold the heat wrap in place. That is especially handy if you need to be on the go while receiving a heat treatment. If you don't want something that is disposable, you can purchase regular heat wraps or make one yourself. An excellent natural home cure for back pain is a sock, stuffed with uncooked white rice, and tied at the end makes an excellent heat wrap when placed in the microwave for several minutes prior to using. Of course, medications can also work, especially if your pain is particularly intense. You might want to limit taking the pain medication to just before bed if you have to be able to drive during the day or otherwise have to function. Some medications can make a person rather dizzy or tired so it's always best to play it safe when looking for lower back pain relief. A natural home cure would be preferred for back pain, of course. Ultimately, the best back pain relief is to avoid getting injured in the first place. Keep your back muscles strong through stretches and exercises. Use proper techniques for bending and lifting at all times. Don't be afraid to ask for help or use tools such as dollies or belts that offer lower back support if you're moving something heavy. After all, you won't need lower back pain relief if you can avoid getting injured to begin with. Acai Berry – How to Lose Weight With Acai Berry By Reynaldo Thomas What is Acai Berry? The acai berry is a fruit of the acai palm tree. It has been harvested by native Americans for hundreds of years, forming a staple of the local diet. However, it became popular in the west only a few years ago when it was publicized in numerous TV shows, newspapers and magazine articles. Why these little berries got so much attention from the media? It turned out that acai berries contain an amazing combination of health-promoting nutrients, among them antioxidants, dietary fiber and monounsaturated fats. No wonder they have taken the world by storm! How Acai Berry Helps You Lose Weight? Acai berries are most known as a weight loss supplement, although they have a number of other benefits such as reducing the aging process and helping cell recovery. The weight loss properties of acai berry can be largely explained by the increased metabolic rate it causes. This happens because of the very large amount of antioxidants (substances, which prevent oxidative stress and cell damage) it contains. This leads to faster fat breakdown, increases energy levels and fights fatigue. Combined, these effects make the process of losing weight faster and easier without any side effects usually associated with synthetic chemicals. Many research papers suggest that eating a diet high in antioxidants is the key to successful weight loss. How to Choose the Right Acai Berry Supplement? The following are simple guidelines, which will help you choose the best acai supplement and not fall prey to scams. Choose products that contain 100% pure Amazonian acai berry extract. Other products are a waste of time and money. Steer clear of products that seem very cheap. Do not forget that acai berries are harvested manually in the Brazilian rainforest, which is a very labor-intensive task. A good price estimate is $40-50 per bottle and cheaper is not always better. Make sure that the vendor provides money back guarantee. In a few rare cases the product may not work, the money back guarantee makes sure you don't lose money. Search for any product or keyword.

Cancer New Alternative Treatment Created in the amazonian forest by a Brazilian monk, a new natural treatment to cure and to prevent cancer appears to be an effective alternative in the fight against cancer. The priest affirms he has obtained real results in several types to cancer : breast cancer , uterus, stomach, skin, prostate cancer, etc. The formula is simple, cheap and easy to prepare at home and even though extensive clinical studies do not exist on this alternative treatment, it seems to be a sensible option. One of the components of the formula is Aloe Vera (sà¹bila) whose medicinal properties has been investigated for a long time : It has been proven that Aloe Vera is effective in cancer in animals." In fact, in 1992, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the use of Aloe Vera for the treatment of soft tissue cancer in animals as well as feline leukemia. There is strong scientific proof that, in vitro, Aloe Vera suppresses the growing of cancer tumor, stimulates immune system response, raises tumor necrosis levels, and promotes healthy tissue. Aloe Vera helps to lower the damage done to the body by treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy, which destroy healthy immune system cells that are very important for the body's recovery. With the use of Aloe Vera, the immune system is boosted, tumors shrink and metastases are reduced so the cancer does not spread. In 1997, University of San Antonio researcher Jeremiah Herlihy, Ph.D., conducted a study to observe any negative effects of drinking aloe daily. Rather than exhibiting negative effects, however, test animals receiving daily aloe showed a remarkable reduction in leukemia, heart disease, and kidney disease. Dr. Herlihy concluded, "We found no indication of harm done to the rats even at high levels." In fact, the aloe-drinking animals actually lived 25 percent longer than those in the control group Other components are bee honey and "caà¹‘azo" (rum, or any distilled liqueur). HONEY Medicine may be increasingly high-tech, but the latest wonder treatment which is being offered to patients is honey. Recently it was announced that bandages soaked in manuka honey are to be given to mouth cancer patients at the Christie Hospital in Manchester to reduce their chances of contracting the MRSA superbug and to lessen wound inflammation following surgery. This is just the latest study investigating this particular type of honey's healing powers. It is used routinely at the Manchester Royal Infirmary for dressing wounds, and other research has found it can fight gum disease, ease digestive problems and soothe sore throats. All honey contains hydrogen peroxide, a substance once used as a wound disinfectant in hospitals it comes from an enzyme that bees add to nectar. It also contains the enzyme glucose oxidase, which boosts its anti-bacterial properties. This was recognised by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used honey to help heal burns and sores. Aloe, bee honey and rum are mixed and a syrup is obtained that must be consumed daily. It is important to use "fresh pulp of the plant Aloe Vera, including the rind. (to retire the thorns). In order to avoid the poisonous effect of the plant Aloe Vera, the treatment must be alternated between 10 days of treatment, 10 days free or of rest. The treatment can be used alone or complementing chemotherapy processes. Use For Other Diseases This treatment also can be useful for autoimmune and digestive diseases. (irritable bowl syndrome, ulcerative colitis, esophagitis, peptic ulcer, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, mouth lesions, sore throat , lupus, etc.) All information is general in nature and is not intended to be used as a substitute for appropriate professional advice. To learn more about alternative treatments for cancer updated for 2010 visit Cancer Truth 2010 Raw Food Diet As Natural Cure These days, we're seeing more and more instances of a variety of autoimmune disorders. Diseases like MS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and a host of others seem to be on the rise. Some say that it's merely due to better diagnostic tools; and others say that it's environmental factors: pollution and the foods we eat that are leading to more people being hit by these maladies. In response to this, many people feel that a raw diet, one that shuns the processed foods, the refined sugars, the high fructose corn syrup, and other additives is the key to good health. Now, an important point to remember here is that the diet is not necessarily made up solely of raw foods. The goal of the diet is for you to eat the foods in as close to their whole state as possible. That means either eating them as they are, or using boiling or steaming to prepare them. In every instance, you want to avoid foods that are highly processed. So, if you want to eat rice, as an example, go with brown rice as opposed to white rice. In terms of what food you'll want to eat, here's just a partial list of foods that are okay to eat on this diet: whole grain cereals, legumes, fermented soy products, fruits, vegetables, sea vegetables â€“ like seaweed, brown rice, soba noodles, all types of beans, and tofu. You may have noticed a lack of meats listed; this is deliberate. By and large, a raw diet does not include meats; only fish and other seafood are allowed. This diet believes in the concept of properly combining your foods. The belief is that this ensures that your food digests properly. The phrase often used is calling it the: yin and yang of the digestive process. So, a key aspect of this diet is that you do not eat too many yin foods. This means not overloading your meals with too much of the following: peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, beets, avocadoes, and eggplant. This way of eating has long been used as a sort of natural cure for many different symptoms. By eating a lot of fruits and vegetables which contain antioxidants, the free radicals are prevented from causing any harm to the human body. Aside from fruits and vegetables, you can also get antioxidants from green tea. As you can see, by drinking green tea and eating the right amount of fruits and veggies, you can prevent diseases and cell damage. Here again, you can see the heavy vegetarian aspects of this diet. In addition, you need to not partake of beverages that have stimulants like caffeine. So, don't drink a lot of soda or coffee. Instead, certain teas and lots of water are the best drinks. Another to remember about this diet is how you eat each meal. Keep your portions small, and you must chew your food well; this is most helpful in aiding your digestion. Not only does it break the food up into small manageable amounts for your stomach and intestines to handle, but it thoroughly drenches the food in saliva, the first step in digestion. So, when looking to determine what sort of portions you want for your meal, here's a rough outline: first, make about half your meal of whole grains, and that includes brown rice. This is especially important if you have an allergy to gluten, as rice doesn't have that. Next, you'll want about a third of the meal to be vegetables. Beyond that, some beans and legumes can be about ten percent, and then five percent for some kind of soup. To round things out, toss in some nuts, fish, juices and seasoning as you see fit. You really want to avoid red meat as much as possible. If you really like meat, and want some, at least aim to buy local, and thus avoid those with chemicals. In fact, when it comes to all of your foods, try to get only local produce. Follow these guidelines, and you'll see a real improvement in the state of your overall health and notice this diet acts as a natural cure for many different ailments. « Previous Page — Next Page » Recent Posts Medieval Medicine Strangest Home Remedies Natural Remedies for Stretch Marks Natural Remedies for Sunburn Natural Remedies for a Sore Throat Natural Treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Home Remedies for Arthritis Home Remedies for Kidney Stones Physical  Conditions or Problems Need to Relieve Arthritis Pain?
