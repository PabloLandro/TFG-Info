Ginnyblogs! - Organic Culinary Adventures: Honey & Tea, No Cough Syrup For Me skip to main | skip to sidebar Pages Home About Ginny The Story About Mindful Organics Thursday, December 8, 2011 Honey & Tea, No Cough Syrup For Me The Holiday season with all its glitz and glamor, is also the time of the
year where sickness spreads like wildfire. The problem with treating these symptoms with traditional
medicines is that they can lead to other kinds of disruptions. Decongestants and
their over-stimulating chemicals have the capacity to keep you up all night,
while many cold meds will put you down fast and give you medicine head the next
day, or in my opinion the equivalent to a hangover. Traditional medicines are
also really just a band aid to mask your symptoms while your body is busy fighting off these aliments naturally. Sometimes these medicines while masking are also prolonging the symptoms and making it harder on the body’s
natural healing process, which is totally counterproductive to a speedy recovery. Try turning to these natural remedies this
cold season to stay healthy and congestion free: Drink The Good Stuff Even when you do not necessarily feel thirsty, your body still needs water. Increasing
your water intake can help thin mucus levels and flush it from your system
faster, relieving a stopped-up nose. Liquids such as decaffeinated tea,
juice, and broths can also help do the job. While others like alcohol, coffee,
and caffeinated sugary soda only adds to the toxins and overall unhealthy free
radicals that can make us sick and keep us down longer by worsening dehydration
and making your nose an even drier place for bacterial infection. Kill it with Sweetness if congestion is in your nose, chances are it's in your chest, too. Compared
with the main ingredient in cough suppressants, honey may be just as effective
at decreasing cough frequency and severity, likely because of its antimicrobial
and antioxidant effects. It's also soothing to an irritated throat. Try this:
Before bed time, take two tablespoons of honey in place of cough syrup. You can
mix the honey with hot, caffeine-free tea, which can help open and hydrate
nasal passages as well. Hug Humidity Cold viruses thrive in dry nasal passages. The winter weather of cold, dry
outdoor air and warm, even drier indoor air, is the reason the cold is so
common this time of year. You can find some relief by jumping in a hot shower.
Steam acts as a natural decongestant, opening and moisturizing your nasal
passage. Also, a humidifier can add constant moisture to the air and your body. Chicken Soup Is Not Just an Old Wives Tale Chicken soup does wonders for a cold, it inhibits the production of
inflammatory compounds that are released in a viral infection, helping you
breathe easier. Plus, by increasing your hydration level, chicken broth can
loosen congestion and thin mucus. It doesn't hurt that the soup is packed with
antioxidant and nutrient rich ingredients such as chicken, carrots, and onions. Irrigate Several recent studies have found that nasal
irrigation can reduce symptoms of respiratory infections and is great for sinus
problems. As soon as you feel congestion coming on, start saline irrigation. It
literally washes out your sinuses, flushing away germs, mucus buildup, and even
pollutants and allergens that can contribute to congestion and cold like
symptoms. You can also use saline nasal sprays to moisturize your nasal
passages, helping them to clean themselves of infections naturally. And unlike
nasal decongestants, nasal irrigators and saline sprays don't lead to rebound
congestion. The best way to spend and celebrate the Holidays
is Happy and Healthy. This is not the time of the year to be out of commission
over a cough or cold you can’t kick, and the little ones should be joyful not
miserable throughout this beautiful season. So try these natural remedies for
protection against sickness and for healing quickly once you feel the sniffles
coming on or hear that cough from a loved one. Another way to show your love this season is
