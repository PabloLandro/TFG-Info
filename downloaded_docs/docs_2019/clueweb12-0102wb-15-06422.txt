        Surgery Advice - Research Into Obesity Surgery Bariatric Surgery for Severely Obese Adolescents A 1991 National Institutes of Health Conference concluded that severely 
        obese adults could be eligible for bariatric surgery if they had a body 
        mass index (BMI) > or =35 kg/m(2) with or > or =40 kg/m(2) without 
        obesity comorbidity. It was thought at that time that there were inadequate 
        data to support bariatric surgery in severely obese adolescents. An estimated 
        25% of children in the United States are obese, a number that has doubled 
        over a 30-year period. Very little information has been published on the 
        subject of obesity surgery in adolescents. Therefore we reviewed our 20-year 
        database on bariatric surgery in adolescents. Severely obese adolescents, 
        ranging from 12 to less than 18 years of age, were considered eligible 
        for bariatric surgery according to the National Institutes of Health adult 
        criteria. Gastroplasty & Gastric Bypass in Adolescents Gastroplasty was the procedure of choice in the initial 3 years of the 
        study followed by gastric bypass, which was found to be significantly 
        more effective for weight loss in adults. Distal gastric bypass (D-GBP) 
        was used in extremely obese patients (BMI > or =60 kg/m(2)) before 
        1992 and long-limb gastric bypass (LL-GBP) was used for superobese patients 
        (BMI > or =50 kg/m(2)) after 1992. Laparoscopic gastric bypass was 
        used after 2000. Thirty-three adolescents (27 white, 6 black; 19 females, 
        14 males) underwent the following bariatric operations between 1981 and 
        June 2001: horizontal gastroplasty in one, vertical banded gastroplasty 
        in two, standard gastric bypass in 17 (2 laparoscopic), LL-GBP in 10, 
        and D-GBP in three. Mean BMI was 52 +/- 11 kg/m(2) (range 38 to 91 kg/m(2)), 
        and mean age was 16 +/- 1 years (range 12.4 to 17.9 years). Preoperative 
        comorbid conditions included the following: type II diabetes mellitus 
        in two patients, hypertension in 11, pseudotumor cerebri in three, gastroesophageal 
        reflux in five, sleep apnea in six, urinary incontinence in two, polycystic 
        ovary syndrome in one, asthma in one, and degenerative joint disease in 
        11. There were no operative deaths or anastomotic leaks. Early complications 
        included pulmonary embolism in one patient, major wound infection in one, 
        minor wound infections in four, stomal stenoses (endoscopically dilated) 
        in three, and marginal ulcers (medically treated) in four. Late complications 
        included small bowel obstruction in one and incisional hernias in six 
        patients. There were two late sudden deaths (2 years and 6 years postoperatively), 
        but these were unlikely to have been caused by the bariatric surgical 
        procedure. Revision procedures included one D-GBP to gastric bypass for 
        malnutrition and one gastric bypass to LL-GBP for inadequate weight loss. Regain of most or all of the lost weight was seen in five patients at 
        5 to 10 years after surgery; however, significant weight loss was maintained 
        in the remaining patients for up to 14 years after surgery. Comorbid conditions 
        resolved at 1 year with the exception of hypertension in two patients, 
        gastroesophageal reflux in two, and degenerative joint disease in seven. 
        Self-image was greatly enhanced; eight patients have married and have 
        children, five patients have completed college, and one patient is currently 
        in college. Severe obesity is increasing rapidly in adolescents and is 
        associated with significant comorbidity and social stigmatization. Conclusion Bariatric surgery in adolescents is safe and is associated with significant 
        weight loss, correction of obesity comorbidity, and improved self-image 
        and socialization. These data strongly support obesity surgery for those 
        unfortunate individuals who may have difficulty obtaining insurance coverage 
        based on the 1991 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference statement. Source: Sugerman HJ, Sugerman EL, DeMaria EJ, Kellum JM, Kennedy C, Mowery Y,

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
