For those who are obese, it often starts as a young child. Unaware that he or she has done something wrong, the child will be teased mercilessly until one day, they will cry themselves to sleep at night wondering what they could have done to prevent this horrible thing from happening to them. Being overweight is not a choice, but often times can be an inherited disease. While for many people, even those who inherit it can recover from it, it is a painful road. There are many results to being overweight. There are many things that can happen to individuals who are or become overweight. In any case, it is sad, hard to deal with, and regrettably often a deadly condition. First of all, let us talk about the conditions of this little child who was teased for so many days while at school. He or she did not cause themselves to be in the condition they are in. Many are active in sports, playing, and other actives. It is simply the way they have always been. But, what happens to them is what the problem is. Being teased and ridiculed in an environment that is supposed to be healthy can in fact be worse than being overweight themselves. Their weight has caused irrevocable scars on their emotions, on their souls. They will be the ones who struggle with weight their entire lives because they have built up a hatred for those who have done this to them. It is one of the hardest circumstances to deal with. Now, let us talk about how we could have helped this child to succeed in weight loss. The good news is that more and more parents and teachers are seeing the need to help out. Instead of allowing children in this circumstance to be ridiculed, we need to find a way to help. Teaching proper eating habits and insuring the necessary exercise is received is one of the first steps we can do. Before the pain starts and becomes damage, we need to stop it and protect the child through helping him or her lose the weight. For older people, the consequences of being overweight are much more devastating than this. They are life threatening. For those who spend their entire lives over weight, they will be more likely to develop conditions like heart disease and other organ failures. Think of it this way. Your heart can only work so hard before it can't work any harder. The larger the body is, the more it has to pump and work. Being obese or overweight makes it work harder. While you may not realize it, this does take a tremendous toll on the body, leaving the person in dire straits. In this situation, weight loss must be obtained. For those who are severely overweight, the solutions may be harder to come by. For many people who are overweight, they simply are physically unable to exercise. It causes them to be too tired because it taxes the heart and muscles just too much. So, if you can't exercise what can you do? First of all, you start by eating correctly. The bad foods, such as fatty, calorie rich foods need to be eliminated. Not only do these foods make you maintain or gain weight but they are loaded with cholesterol and fat that can clog up the heart making either condition that much worse. Then, the person will need to begin an exercise regimen. This could be just small, simple exercises at first. When combined with eating the right foods in the right amounts, even this small amount of exercise can be beneficial. It is hard work, no matter what, but it is necessary work nonetheless. Increasing the amount of exercise as the person is able is the next step. Slowly but surely they will be able to get in the amounts of exercise they need. Yet another solution to weight loss is weight loss surgery. This should be the last step to losing weight, though, as it is one of the most life altering things you can do. You can actually not make it through the surgery either. But, what it is, is a process by which doctors shrink the size of the stomach. This allows you to not be able to eat nearly as much causing you to lose weight. Weight loss in all stages of life can be effective in many means. By no means are we telling you that the most beneficial weight loss is not diet and exercise. But, using herbal remedies, different diet plans, and using different types of eating plans can in fact help people as well. There are many solutions that can work, it is a matter of finding one and sticking with it to make it work. What are the results of being overweight then? The emotional scars are one of the most painful to deal with. This can in turn lead to more emotional problems and often helps to increase the condition because people end up hiding behind their weight problem. Simply not dealing with it is easier. But, the most life threatening results of being overweight are those that we need to concern ourselves with. The most abused organ in our bodies is the heart. The foods we eat, the physical condition our body is in, and the emotional state of our mind all effects how the heart works. The worse we treat it, the worse weight loss will affect our lives. So, what do we do, then to dig out of this road of weight? It is by far one of the most challenging aspects of our lives, but somehow we must find within ourselves the will power and the determination to make the weight loss a reality. Dieting, exercising, supplements can all help to accomplish this goal. No matter what, we must find it within ourselves to solve this problem for ourselves and for our children. Or, we may not be here to love our families or to live our lives. Weight loss just has to happen. The results are catastrophic otherwise.
