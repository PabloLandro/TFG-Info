Davis #2009-08-28 Dr.Scholl's has so many orthotics that I contacted a podiatrist who has a reputation of being incredibly successful in helping even the most challenging cases.He recommends the tri-comfort orthotic because of the excellent arch support combined with excellent cushioning.They also are thin enough as not to cause crowding and tightness inside the shoe. Work good, when they stay in the right place Jon Smith #2009-04-16 I work as a bartender and usually go through insoles quickly. These work really well, but the only way I can get them to stay in place is if I use duck/duct tape to keep them in place. When they stay in place they work really well, but not staying in place on their own is really irritating to deal with. Awesome!!! Robert Wilson "bigro #2009-10-18 I have read the other reviews, and the people saying about slippage, honestly with these insoles I have never felt any slippage as I did with other one such as the gel ones. I love these things, I swear by them, it relieves a lot of irritations, and honestly it helps out my lower back pain as well. I would highly, highly recommend these insoles. Comfortable arch support for moderate pronation Brent Cox #2010-06-10 I have mild to moderate over-pronation and wear these inserts with my Converse shoes that otherwise have no arch support. They're comfortable and provide good, firm but flexible arch support. I'm male, 6'.1" and weigh about 200 pounds. These Are Great Veil_Lord #2010-07-06 I just grabbed a pair of these on an urge.  I'd always used the cheap foam ones, but these were on sale.  I'm so glad I gave them a chance!  Not only do they last longer than those foam ones, but they're much more comfortable. For one thing, you don't have to cut these down shorter like you do with most.  If you're in the size range they'll fit in your shoes.  They do a good job of not only cushoning your heel, but also the ball of your foot.  The arch support is good too. I've been using sets of these for about a year now.  I even used one in a pair in a $15 cheapo shoes to make them extremely comfortable.  I may have worn them longer than most people, but mine stayed comfortable to me for about 6 months, so they were ultimately cheaper than the cheap foam ones I'd been buying.  Great product! DECENT - You get what you pay for... T. Ward #2010-03-08 I'm on my feet all day and I have lots of different shoes so I wanted to get a few more pairs of inserts.  The Price is low so I put them underneath the sole that comes with your shoe and they wont move around.  (for those that don't understand why they would move around, these inserts don't run all the way to the toe of the shoe, they are only support for the heal and arch) Work Great Alex #2009-05-25 I put these in both my work shoes and sneakers. They work great with no problems. from the orthotics I have tried... James L. Otts "the c #2010-06-23 From the orthotics I have tried, these are the best. These work in the range of my dress shoes for work, on to my hiking boots.  Keep in mind these have to be replaced every 6 months or so. I've not had the slipping issues reported before. 8-12 men's size? NO, WRONG! Marcos K #2011-08-19 I am a size 10 1/2-11 (depending on brand of shoes). This insole barely reaches from my heel to the balls of my feet (which is what I needed this insoles for, ball of foot pain). So you can imagine how angry I was after I bought these. I took them, lined them up with their brand of Massage Gel insoles (which are ALSO branded size 8-12 in mens) and guess what? The very tip of the Tri-Comfort insole barely touches the Massage Gel insoles 8' line. Dr. Scholls you better stop lying to your customers about this insole. It is NOT 8-12 men's size. I hope ANYONE who is a size 10 or larger reads this and DOESN'T BUY IT. You will not get any comfort with an insole too small! Just as nice as I hoped Jonathan Barrios #2010-06-07 I was suffering from soar feet, which was a tough combination considering I have to be on my feet a lot of the time for work.  My sister recommended these for me.   They fit nicely in each of the 3 pairs of shoes I typically wear and give me support to my arches and otherwise flat feet.  you cant go wrong for the price. Very comfortable Andy #2010-03-24 I don't know how I used to walk around in the stock shoe padding, but man was I blind! These are very comfortable and you get three pairs! One for work, play, and church. Haha. Pretty comfy SFDolceVita #2009-08-28 Like one of the other reviewers, I have experienced a bit of slippage with these inserts, but they usually stay in place and are comfortable when they do. good cushion, but make shoes tight fitting Tool Junkie "Tool Ju #2009-11-16 The cushion is very good.  However, it makes my shoes fit a little tight.  I still prefer to have them in my shoes than not.  It's a trade off. like it Raju #2011-08-25 hi i like theis prodect is i like so good i m fell so good after proudect ok bofour i buy this proudect is so good and my legs is now no hearting thank for this stuf Life Saver Kristofer L. Takach #2011-08-06 Every day i would wake up with back pain and i wasn't sure why.  Finally after doing some online research, many people suggest these orthotic inserts.  I tried them and have been almost pain free since.  These really support the arches of my feet.  My quality of life has been improved by a $5 product.  Who would have known?  I have these on subscription every 6 months. Good Deal on the Zon Pat Clor #2011-07-27 I have been using these in my running shoes for three years.  Buying them from Amazon to save a few bucks. BEST FOR ALL TYPES OF SHOES Gregory W. Luft "GMV #2011-07-22 AFTER TRYING MANY DEFFERENT TYPES OF INSERTS, THIS BRAND, AND TYPE, SEEM TO WORK BEST FOR ME. THEY ARE NOT TO BIG AND STILL GIVE GOOD SUPPORT. I BOUGHT THE MULTIPAC SO I CAN REPLACE ALL THE SHOES I WEAR EVERYDAY WITH NEW INSERTS. Good, but they slip down David Suescun Ramire #2011-04-09 These are good, if you add some double side tape on the heel side.. otherwise they slip down the shoe as you push your feet... they are quite comfortable once they are in place though.. Nice product but size 8-12 is a bit of a stretch Jason #2011-02-07 I like the support and feel but I agree with others who think this is too short to be marketed up to size 12. I wear size 10.5 and have to make sure they are slid all the way back against the heal before I put my shoes on. Dr. Scholl's should make these for 8-9 and have larger sizes available. I bought these despite the warnings from others because I needed 3 pair and the price was right. Other than the size I'm happy with the product. If only it stayed put.... E. Sikorski #2010-11-16 I can certainly agree with other reviewers, this is a great product when it stays in the right place. If they manufactured them in smaller size ranges (like 8-9, 10-11, etc.) then I think it would solve the problem. As I wear a size 12, the insoles are just too small and slip around throughout the day. When they are placed correctly, they do provide excellent support to my flat feet. I spend most of the day on my feet on hard floors and must use insoles to go home happy. This is one of the good insoles I have found...I am still looking for the perfect one though! Good news is..they are a great value on Amazon! excellent! ray333 #2010-11-01 a real bargain, no more pain, no more tire, i can stand all day long with these on. Cheaper than custom orthotics J. Pawlicki "Walker" #2009-10-30 Can't really tell if these are helping me recover from a fractured heel bone, but they are a whole lot cheaper than $300 that they want for custom inserts. i dont know Salman #2011-07-23 Ive had flat feet for a couple of years now and none of this stuff really works. I think you need to actually strengthen your feet by tennis balls and other exercises. for the tootsie's Jeff F #2010-07-20 These pads are ok. I have heel problems and they seem to reduce the pain but don't relieve the pain 100% but i can at least walk now so i would say ok by me. Avoid these!! Love good deals!! #2011-07-15 As a big fan of the Dr. Scholls gel insoles I figured I'd give these a shot. All I got was foot pain as these just made my feet sore and tired. They are too firm, more like cement insoles. OUCH. I'd rather walk barefoot Erebor #2010-07-09 Even when they do stay in place(which is rare) it feels like there is something angular pressing on the arch. I wouldn't wear them if they were free. Big Ripoff! S. Hochman #2009-11-11 These soles are nearly double the price of Profoot's, but unlike Dr. Scholl's Profoot actually works.  Dr. Scholls puts all its money into fancy advertising and making the soles look colorful.  Don't be fooled by the gimmicks.  There product is little better than insoles that come with your shoes.  In fact, these soles are a podiatrist's best friend, because that is where you will end up after wearing these shody soles!
