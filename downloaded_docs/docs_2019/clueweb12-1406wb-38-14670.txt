In its milder form bronchitis can be very similar to a common cold in which dry and phlegm cough erupts leaving the individual tired and sleepy. In a person who has healthy lungs, such cough can be treated with over the counter drugs like acetaminophen and a mild bronchodilator. Oral steroids may be prescribed by a doctor if persistent cough exists. Some of the best remedies for bronchitis lie in the kitchens of our homes. Chronic bronchitis treatments may involve consumption of prescription antibiotics which are useful in controlling infection due to bronchitis. Vaccines and inoculations always help in protection from pneumonia and flu which cause infection in people suffering from bronchitis. Oxygen supplements help bronchitis patients to breathe easily if they, during the course of their disease find it difficult to breathe and are tired more often. Instances of surgery are rare yet may be necessary for patients suffering from chronic bronchitis. This may require removal of the damaged lung tissue. It is important for bronchitis patients to continue being active as this helps in lung capacity. It may seem difficult at first to bring them to do mild exercises as they tire easily and initially its better that they take complete rest and recuperate before doing these exercises. People with the highest risk of getting bronchitis are those who smoke and those who are exposed to dust and air pollutants. It is important to drink plenty of fluids as this hydrates the body and helps in expelling the mucus from the body. Yet another bronchitis treatment is a mixture of clove powder, powdered ginger and pepper powder with a little honey or in a cup of tea. Onions too can be made into an excellent cough syrup due to its expectorant properties. Sesame seeds taken with a teaspoon of linseed, salt and honey help relieve bronchitis. Bronchitis treatment like chicory makes an excellent remedy for bronchitis, the root of this herb can be powdered and half a teaspoon of powdered chicory mixed with a teaspoon of honey will prove immensely beneficial for treatment of bronchitis . Turpentine oil is also known to be an effective antidote for bronchitis. Turmeric is known to provide a considerable amount of relief when mixed with warm milk and consumed on an empty stomach. It can help in providing a temporary relief for bronchitis treatment. Yoga too has a rich reserve of bronchitis treatment which have been handed down from time immemorial. Yoga asana like Kapalbharati, Pranayama, and Nadi sodhana and surya bhedana help in strengthening the nasal tract and the lungs and are effective in the treatment of bronchitis . Asanas must however, be conducted under a trained yoga practitioner. Related Articles What is Bronchitis, Know About It!
