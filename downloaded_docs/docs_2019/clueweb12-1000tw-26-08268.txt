Those suffering from diabetes are constantly in a struggle to control their sugar level. Insulin is the hormone that controls sugar levels in the body. When insulin levels are insufficient or absent, diabetes sets in. The two common types of diabetes are: type 1 and type 2. Treating diabetes naturally is a great way to deal with the negative side-effects that arise from taking chemical medications. Certain herbs and vitamins like cinnamon and chromium can stabilize blood sugar levels and help prevent the large swings that can be caused by diabetes. Cinnamon is helpful because it allows our body to process sugar more effectively. Having cinnamon in the morning over toast or oatmeal can be a effective diabetes natural cure. There are also cinnamon capsules for those who have a hard time getting enough. Chromium has been shown to stop sugar cravings as well as leveling our sugar levels. There are no specific symptoms and if they show up they are similar to those of type 2 diabetes, which are; feeling hungry and thirsty all the time, frequent urination, cuts and bruises taking long to heel and skin infection which keeps recurring.To prevent this condition from worsening or maturing to type 2 diabetes you can put yourself into a serious diet which is considered to as pre diabetes diet, let all the vegetables and fruits be your favorites, avoid simple carbohydrates like; white rice, honey or sugar from this pre diabetes diet because they will lead you to food craving which results to weight gain. People with diabetic neuropathy might be able to treat the symptoms of it using ginkgo biloba. The reason why ginkgo biloba is one of the herbs for diabetes treatment is that it contains potent antioxidants that help prevent nerve damage, inflammation and cardiovascular disease. This herb for diabetes even helps stimulate the pancreas so it is able to produce the insulin needed by a diabetic. Cinnamon is one of the popular herbs for diabetes. It helps turn glucose in the bloodstream into energy safely, fast and affectively so it does not have time to accumulate in the bloodstream causing damage to the heart and nerves. This herb can also help fat cells respond to insulin better and lower blood sugar levels. Cinnamon is excellent to use as well to help improve cholesterol levels in people with diabetes, which means heart disease and heart attacks are less likely to occur. In diabetes type II insulin may be necessary on the long term basis to control glucose levels if diet and oral agent fail. A number of insulin preparations are available. They vary according three main characteristics time course of action species and manufacture. Oral ant diabetic agents are effective for patients who have diabetes type II that cannot treated by diet and exercise alone.
