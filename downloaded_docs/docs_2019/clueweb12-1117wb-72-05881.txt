  the last straw. “I was telling a joke in front of everyone and I
  got completely drenched,” remembers the 54-year-old oncology
  nurse from Ancaster, Ont. She had struggled with stress urinary incontinence
  (SUI) — leaking urine when she laughed, sneezed, coughed or exercised — ever since a very long labour with her second child when she was 31. ©2010 Jupiterimages Corp. At the time, doctors told her she was too young to have SUI (a common misconception).
        Hilda diligently did Kegel exercises, designed to strengthen the pelvic
        muscles that help control urine, but unfortunately had limited success. “SUI was
        horrible. I was always concerned about odour; I always had to wear a pad, and it
        was just a huge nuisance,” she says. “Plus, it felt like a taboo topic. I was uncomfortable
      bringing it up with other people, even with my doctors.” Dr. Sender Herschorn, a Toronto urologist and head of the Urodynamics
        Laboratory at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, agrees. “Primary
        health-care providers can be reticent about talking to patients about incontinence,”
        he says. and “They may think it’s a really complex issue, when it usually isn’t. Other myths are that incontinence affects only
        women, that it’s only an issue for older
        people and that it’s just a normal part of
        aging. But you don’t have to live with it:
        there are lots of good treatments available.” Tip Before you meet with
              your health-care provider
              to talk about incontinence,
              keep a bladder diary for a few
              days and jot down what you drink,
              how often and how much you
              urinate, and when you have
              leakage or incontinent
              episodes. When Hilda first developed SUI, corrective
        surgery was a fairly major procedure, but
        when a minimally invasive sling technique
        (see “Treatment options”) was developed,
        Hilda decided it was time to act. She had the surgery in 2004 and was ecstatic with the Human bladder anatomy
        results. “My life has improved immensely,
        and I can enjoy all my favourite activities again
        because I’m dry,” says Hilda, who now acts as
        a spokesperson for the Canadian Continence
      Foundation ( www.canadiancontinence.ca ). “Now I am passionate about getting the
        word out. There is help, and there is nothing
        to be embarrassed about!” she says. “When I
        started sharing my experience with friends
        and family, I was surprised at how many
        women, including my neighbours, actually
        came out of the closet.” If you’re one of the
        3.3 million Canadians (33% of women over
        age 40, according to the Canadian Urinary
        Bladder Survey) living with incontinence,
      read on to discover the causes and remedies. Little Leaks, Big Gushes The most common causes of persistent
              incontinence are pelvic floor muscles and
              supporting tissues that have become weakened
              over time and damaged. Nerves in the
              pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles — picture
              a hammock of muscle that runs from your
              pubic bone to the base of your spinal
              column, supporting the bladder, bowel and,
              in women, the vagina — may be damaged
              during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as
              by any surgery in the pelvic area. This
              damage can lead to incontinence shortly
              afterwards or many years later. ©2010 Jupiterimages Corp. Declining levels of estrogen at menopause
        can also contribute to incontinence because estrogen
        plumps up the tissues of the urethra (the tube
        through which urine leaves the body), leaving
        them better able to contain urine. Other types
        of incontinence can be seen with diabetes,
        stroke, spinal injury or a neurological disease
        such as multiple sclerosis, which can interfere
        with nerve signals between the brain and
        urinary tract. In men over 40, an enlarged
        prostate can lead to urge or overflow incontinence.
        (See “The incontinence spectrum” to learn more about the different kinds of incontinence.) Finally, bladder cancer and
        bladder stones (accompanied by bladder pain and blood in the urine) are
      occasionally incontinence triggers. “In men over 40, an enlarged prostate can lead to urge or overflow incontinence.” Temporary incontinence can be caused by a urinary tract or bladder
        infection, pressure on the bladder due to constipation or pregnancy, dietary
        diuretics (which increase the amount of urine produced) such as caffeine,
        alcohol, pop or fruit juice, and medications such as prescription diuretics
        and certain antidepressants, muscle relaxants and heart medications. Treatment Options ©2010 Jupiterimages Corp. Lifestyle choices can often help bladder health. Maintain a healthy body weight
        with a balanced diet and exercise, because extra pounds put pressure on
        the bladder and the urinary sphincter, muscles that control the flow of
        urine out of the bladder. Avoid bladder irritants such as citrus,
        artificial sweeteners and caffeine. And butt out — nicotine may
        stimulate the muscle of the bladder wall to void. Should you be
        limiting liquids? Don’t go overboard, because too little to drink
        can affect your kidneys. Make sure you drink enough liquid to
        stay healthy and keep the urine lightly coloured. Aim for six to
        eight glasses of liquid a day. Behavioural changes can help your bladder, too. Kegel exercises,
        which help strengthen the pelvic-floor muscles, can be quite effective for
        stress or mixed incontinence. Here’s how to do Kegels: to locate the correct
        muscles, imagine you’re trying to hold back urine or gas. Squeeze those muscles,
        without tightening your stomach or buttocks, for five to 10 seconds, then release
        for 10 seconds. Breathe normally. Repeat 15 to 20 times, three to five times a day.
        If you have urge incontinence, your health-care provider may suggest bladder
        retraining (learning how to suppress the urge for frequent urination and keeping
      to a regular bathroom schedule). Prescription medications may be used in combination with behavioural changes to
        help improve bladder function. These medications work in different ways: blocking
        the chemicals that tell the bladder muscle to contract (e.g., oxybutynin) for symptoms
        of urgency and urge incontinence. Other medications may work by decreasing
        the amount of urine you produce at night (e.g., desmopressin) or relaxing the
        prostate during voiding (e.g., tamsulosin or terazosin). Still others may or relax the
        bladder wall and strengthening the urinary sphincter (e.g., imipramine). Estrogen , as part of menopausal hormone replacement therapy, has often been prescribed
        because the decrease in natural estrogen at menopause can cause the urethra
        to thin somewhat, leading to urine leakage, says Dr. Herschorn. “However, it’s not
        clear if it works. The suspicion is that there’s no benefit.” He points to a landmark
        study of more than 27,000 women, published in the Journal of the American Medical
        Association in 2005, which revealed that taking conjugated equine estrogen
        therapy, with or without
        progestin, actually increased
        the risk of incontin ence in
        continent women and made
        symptoms worse for incontinent
        women. Topical estrogen, such as a
        cream applied to the vagina, may be of some
        help for some symptoms, though. Silicone or collagen injections are another
        option for stress incontinence. “These
        bulking agents help build up the internal
        structure of the urinary passage, so it closes
        a little tighter,” explains Dr. Herschorn. The
        injections are given directly into the
        urethra through a telescope-like device. Mechanical treatments are another option
        for some forms of incontinence. Women with
        pelvic organ prolapse (where the bladder,
        bowel and/or uterus sag into the vagina)
        may use a pessary, a device made of rubber
        or silicone that is placed against the cervix
        to hold up the organs. Surgery may be called for if less invasive
        treatments have been unsatisfactory. The
        most common surgery is a sling procedure,
        a minimally invasive outpatient procedure
        performed under general anaesthetic in which
        a synthetic mesh tape is placed under the
        urethra to support it and prevent leakage,
        explains Dr. Herschorn. Recovery time is
        short. The sling procedure has a good success
        rate in women with stress incontinence and is
        currently under study for men. Another procedure,
        called bladder-neck suspension, lifts
        the sagging supports under the urethra. It is
        more invasive and may require a recovery
        time of up to six weeks. Surgery for men
        usually addresses damage due to prostate
        cancer surgery issues and may involve the
        use of an artificial sphincter or inflatable
        implant around the urethra. The incontinence spectrum There are several different types of incontinence. Stress incontinence refers to leaking urine when you laugh, sneeze, cough, lift something
                heavy, exercise or otherwise put pressure on your bladder. It’s most common in women. Urge incontinence means that you leak urine following a sudden, overwhelming urge to
                urinate. It may be triggered by the sound of running water. Mixed incontinence is the combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence. Functional incontinence is the result of a mental or physical disability, such as Alzheimer’s
                disease, Parkinson’s disease or severe arthritis, which prevents you from reaching the
                bathroom in time. Overflow incontinence refers to a frequent or constant small leaking of urine, caused by
                an overly full bladder that is not completely emptied during urination. Privacy | Terms and Conditions | © Copyright 2006-2012, Canadian Medical Association Canadian Health magazine is p
