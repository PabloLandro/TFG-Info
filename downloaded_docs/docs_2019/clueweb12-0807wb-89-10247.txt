Non-Surgical Weight Management Program FAQ Ongoing Motivation Surgery Alone is Not Enough! It's up to You. LAP-BAND surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity that has numerous advantages. However, the surgery itself is not enough to make anyone shed extra pounds. Patients must be extremely motivated to live a healthy lifestyle if they are to continue losing weight after the LAP-BAND速 procedure has been completed. The LAP-BAND速 System is only one ingredient in lasting weight loss results. It helps patients lose weight by limiting food intake, reducing appetite and slowing digestion. For long-term weight loss to occur, however, you must be motivated and committed to a new, healthy lifestyle. After LAP-BAND速 surgery, you must maintain a special LAP-BAND速 diet and exercise plan to stay healthy. This weight loss surgery demands significant lifestyle changes, and for this reason it is only suitable for those who understand its lifestyle implications and are highly motivated to live healthfully and lose weight.
