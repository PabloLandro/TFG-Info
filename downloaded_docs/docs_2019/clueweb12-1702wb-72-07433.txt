More ENGLEMED HEALTH NEWS Wound bacteria "checked" by honey Wednesday April 13th, 2011 New research suggests that honey should be better exploited by modern 
        medicine, a British scientist says today. Professor 
        Rose Cooper and colleagues at the University of Wales, Cardiff, UK, investigated 
        the effect of manuka honey on bacteria. They say that honey "has long been acknowledged for its antimicrobial 
        properties", and was used by ancient civilisations in traditional 
        wound-healing remedies. Manuka honey, made by bees that collect nectar 
        from the manuka tree in New Zealand, is currently used in some licensed 
        wound-care products. The team looked at how manuka honey interacts with three common types 
        of wound bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Group A Streptococci and Meticillin-resistant 
        Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). They found that honey "interferes with the growth of these bacteria 
        in a variety of ways", and describe it as "an attractive option" 
        for treatment. It could even help reverse bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Findings will be presented at the Society for General Microbiology's 
        Spring Conference in Harrogate, UK, today (April 13). "Our findings with streptococci and pseudomonads suggest that manuka 
        honey can hamper the attachment of bacteria to tissues which is an essential 
        step in the initiation of acute infections, inhibiting attachment also 
        blocks the formation of biofilms, which can protect bacteria from antibiotics 
        and allow them to cause persistent infections," Professor Cooper 
        said. "Other work in our lab has shown that honey can make MRSA more sensitive 
        to antibiotics such as oxacillin - effectively reversing antibiotic resistance," 
        she added. "We need innovative and effective ways of controlling wound infections 
        that are unlikely to contribute to increased antimicrobial resistance. 
        This research indicates that existing antibiotics may be more effective 
        against drug-resistant infections if used in combination with manuka honey." Presented on April 13, 2011, at the Society for General Microbiology 
        Spring Conference held at Harrogate International Centre, UK. Tags: Alternative Therapy | MRSA
