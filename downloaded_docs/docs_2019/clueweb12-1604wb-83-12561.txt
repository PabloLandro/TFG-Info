Get your own chart! Monday Headache as a Migraine Trigger, Prevention How-To In my daily search for migraine and headache -related information I happened to stumble on an article that describes some simple steps to prevent developing a headache while at work. This piece is not aimed at the migraine crowd, mind you; just simple, garden variety headache one gets toiling 9-to-5 in the office cubicle or wherever you place of enslavement is at. My first reaction was the obvious - "Oh, the normals, they amuse me so." Then I started thinking - there's many a time when a proper migraine can be triggered by a minor headache. We, migraine people, don't usually say that the head hurts until it hurts so much that we are ready to put a bullet through the said head. (It's a migraine thing; normals, ask your " silently disabled " friend for an explanation.) Still, and I repeat, a "normal" headache is often a trigger. The article I mentioned lists several pretty easy to do things that might prevent that trigger from developing: Don't get de-hydrated Do some stretches from time to time De-stress yourself (easier said than do but needs mentioning). And the most interesting of all- Practice some simple Chi Kung breathing exercises Here's the excerpt from the article on how to practice that particular kind of breathing: "To do it simply sit at your desk and place your right elbow on the table. With your right thumb block your right nostril and with your right index finger press firmly on your “third eye”. The third eye is simply the point right in between your two physical eyes and up a bit on the forehead. Hold your fingers in this position and breathe in slowly through your unblocked left nostril. Try and bring the air all the way down into your deep stomach. Breathe out slowly and imagine sending the air up your spine to your third eye. Repeat this for about a minute with each nostril." Look through that article with an open mind, my gentle readers. We could always learn something new, even if it comes from the "normals" :P. link: 9 Effective Ways to Beat a Headache at Work technorati tags: Chi Kung migraine prevention migraine hacks breathing migraine migraines headache headaches icerocket tags: Chi Kung migraine prevention migraine hacks breathing migraine migraines headache headaches Posted by rain gem at 12:47 AM Labels: alternative migraine treatments , breathing , Chi Kung , migraine hacks , migraine prevention , thedailymind.com 6
comments: The Daily Minder said... Thanks for the link! I actually wrote this post because my girlfriend suffered from serious migraines for her whole life. I finally convinced her to get regular acupuncture and they have now gone completely. No doctor has ever been able to do this for her. Have you tried it? The Daily Minder April 21, 2008 5:16 PM rain gem said... Thank you for writing a detailed article like that. There are some success stories with acupuncture but they are low in numbers, unfortunately. Glad it worked for your girlfriend and it's really great she got rid of her migraines. Please tell her "good going" from the "migraine crowd" :P Don't have a good acupuncture practitioner in my area. Acupressure helps to remove symptoms from time to time though.

said... Hey this stuff really does help!  I've kept migraines from developing beyond early warning signs with yoga breathing - can't do it every time, but it's worth trying every time! - Megan April 22, 2008 7:29 PM rain gem said... Yah, I gotta do a pranayama article one of this days. I just have hard time finding a kitteh picture that would fit the theme :P. April 23, 2008 10:14 PM MaxJerz said... Thanks for posting this - I sent this (and the original article) to DBF, one of the "normals", since he's been complaining of headaches at work more often lately. Not sure if he'll heed any of the tips, but hey, I tried. -MJ April 23, 2008 10:21 PM rain gem said... Haya Max, welcome to the site and thank you for the comment :) Who's DBF?
