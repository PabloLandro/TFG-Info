Pick's disease is a rare disorder similar to senile dementia/Alzheimer's type. What differentiates it from Alzheimer's disease is that it seems to affect predominantly circumscribed areas of the brain, not all regions. Alzheimer's disease is a more diffuse process that can affect any part of the brain as it progresses. Pick's disease affects about 1 out of 100,000 people. It affects both sexes, but it is more common in women than men. It may occur as early as 20 years old, but usually begins between ages 40 to 60. The average age of onset is 54 years. The onset is usually slow and insidious. The disorder involves shrinking of the tissues (atrophy) of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, "fronto-temporal dementia". The neurons (nerve cells) in the affected areas contain abnormal material (Pick's bodies). These are tangles made of tau protein. The exact cause is unknown. The symptoms may be similar to senile dementia/Alzheimer's type, with aphasia (loss of language abilities), agnosia (loss of ability to recognize objects or people), and apraxia (loss of skilled movement abilities). Behavioral changes are prominent with loss of inhibition and change in personality as opposed to Alzheimer's Disease where memory loss is often the primary feature. Risk factors may include a having a personal or family history of Pick's disease or senile dementia, though the genetic basis of the disease has not yet been determined. More information on dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, lewy body dementia, Pick's disease) What is dementia? - Dementia is a deterioration of intellectual function and other cognitive skills. Dementia may involve progressive deterioration of thinking, memory, behavior, personality and motor function. What types of dementia are there? - Types of dementia include Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementias, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, alcohol-related dementia, and Pick disease. What're the risk factors for dementia? - The main risk factor for dementia is age. People who have sustained serious head injuries through boxing are prone to dementia pugilistica. What causes dementia? - Dementia is caused by degeneration in the cerebral cortex including death of brain cells, conditions that impair the vascular or neurologic structures of the brain. What're the symptoms of dementia? - The early symptom of dementia is diminished short-term memory. Patients with severe dementia cannot perform activities of daily living. How is dementia diagnosed? - Diagnosis of dementia begins with a thorough physical exam and complete medical history, and followed by information-concentration-orientation test of Blessed et al. and the mini-mental state exam of Folstein et al. What's the treatment for dementia? - The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of dementia. Treatment of dementia begins with treatment of the underlying disease. What's the long term dementia care? - Long-term dementia care may be needed for some patients with dementia. Possible options include in-home care, boarding homes, adult day care, and convalescent homes. What's alcohol-related dementia? - Alcohol related dementia is a form of dementia related to the excessive drinking of alcohol. Alcohol abuse can lead to several forms of dementia. What's frontal lobe dementia? - Frontal lobe dementia is a set of degenerative diseases producing many of the same symptoms as vascular dementia. The frontal lobe governs people's mood and behaviour. What's senile dementia? - Senile dementia is the mental deterioration (loss of intellectual ability) that is associated with old age. Senile dementia is often used when referring to Alzheimer's disease. What's early onset dementia? - Early onset dementia is a term that covers a range of diseases affecting memory and thinking in people under the age of 65. What's AIDS related dementia? - HIV associated dementia (HAD) is comprised of a spectrum of conditions from the mild HIV-1 motor cognitive-motor disorder to severe and debilitating AIDS dementia. What's Alzheimer's disease? - Alzheimer's disease is a form of degenerative brain disease resulting in progressive mental deterioration with disorientation, memory disturbance and confusion. What types of Alzheimer's disease are there? - Types of Alzheimer's disease include early onset Alzheimer's, late-onset Alzheimer's, and familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). What're the stages of Alzheimer's disease? - Stages of Alzheimer's disease include no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive decline, moderate cognitive decline, moderately severe cognitive decline... What causes Alzheimer's disease? - The ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer's disease are still unknown, there are several risk factors that increase a person's likelihood of developing the disease. What're the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease? - The risk for Alzheimer's disease increases with age. People with a family history of Alzheimer's have a greater risk. What're the warning signs of Alzheimer's disease? - The warning signs of Alzheimer's disease include memory loss, difficulty performing familiar tasks, problems with language, poor or decreased judgment. What're the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? - The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include memory lapses, perform routine tasks, loss of judgment, and personality or behavior changes. How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed? - Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is complex. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease begins with a thorough physical exam and complete medical history. What's the treatment for Alzheimer's disease? - Some treatments for Alzheimer's disease that can be used to help manage and ease the symptoms. Medications help alleviate the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and delusions. What medications treat Alzheimer's disease? - Four medications, tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine tartrate and galantamine, are used to improve intellectual function in some patients with Alzheimer's disease. What's the dietary therapy for Alzheimer's disease? - Dietary therapy for Alzheimer's disease involves appropriate intake of darkly colored fruits and vegetables, soy, alcohol, folate and vitamin B12. What's the exercise therapy for Alzheimer's disease? - Aerobic exercise is very important for helping to protect against mental decline during aging due to Alzheimer's disease. What's the prognosis of Alzheimer's disease? - A person with Alzheimer's disease lives an average of eight years and as many as 20 years or more from the onset of symptoms. What's vascular dementia? - Vascular dementia is a common form of dementia in older persons that is due to cerebrovascular disease, usually with stepwise deterioration. What types of vascular dementia are there? - There are a number of different types of vascular dementia. Two of the most common are multi-infarct dementia, binswanger's disease. What's multi-infarct dementia? - Multi-infarct dementia is the most common form of vascular dementia. Multi-infarct dementia is associated with atherosclerosis. What is Binswanger's disease? - Binswanger's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by injuries to the blood vessels supplying the deep white-matter of the brain. What causes vascular dementia? - Vascular dementia can be caused in several different ways. Most commonly there is blockage of small blood vessels (arteries) deep within the brain.

What're the symptoms of vascular dementia? - Symptoms of vascular dementia include memory loss, difficulty doing usual daily activities, and a tendency to wander. How is vascular dementia diagnosed? - Vascular dementia is diagnosed based on history, symptoms, signs, and tests, and by ruling out other causes of dementia. What's the treatment for vascular dementia? - Treatment of vascular dementia is aimed at reducing the risk factors including stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and heart disease. What's lewy body dementia? - Lewy body dementia is a progressive cause of dementia characterised by both cognitive problems and motor impairments. What causes lewy body dementia? - Lewy body dementia is caused by abnormal microscopic deposits of protein in nerve cells. Lewy bodies appear in deteriorating nerve cells. What're the symptoms of lewy body dementia? - Symptoms of lewy body dementia include a gradual loss of mental abilities, including orientation and memory, reasoning and intelligence.
