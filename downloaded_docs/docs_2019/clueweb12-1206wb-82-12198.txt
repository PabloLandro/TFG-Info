    on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism	No. 27	PH 355	January 1995 Alcohol-Medication 
    Interactions Many medications can 
    interact with alcohol, leading to increased risk of illness, injury, or death. 
    For example, it is estimated that alcohol-medication interactions may be a 
    factor in at least 25 percent of all emergency room admissions (1). An unknown 
    number of less serious interactions may go unrecognized or unrecorded. This Alcohol Alert notes some of the most significant alcohol-drug interactions. 
    (Although alcohol can interact with illicit drugs as well, the term "drugs" 
    is used here to refer exclusively to medications, whether prescription or 
    nonprescription.) How Common Are 
    Alcohol-Drug Interactions? More than 2,800 prescription 
    drugs are available in the United States, and physicians write 14 billion 
    prescriptions annually; in addition, approximately 2,000 medications are available 
    without prescription (2). Ap proximately 
    70 percent of the adult population consumes alcohol at least occasionally, 
    and 10 percent drink daily (3). About 60 percent of men and 30 percent of 
    women have had one or more adverse alcohol-related life events (4). Together 
    with the data on medication use, these statistics suggest that some concurrent 
    use of alcohol and medications is inevitable. The elderly may 
    be especially likely to mix drugs and alcohol and are at particular risk for 
    the adverse consequences of such combinations. Although persons age 65 and 
    older constitute only 12 percent of the population, they consume 25 to 30 
    percent of all prescription medications (5) . The elderly are more likely 
    to suffer medication side effects compared with younger persons, and these 
    effects tend to be more severe with advancing age (5). Among persons age 60 
    or older, 10 percent of those in the community--and 40 percent of those in 
    nursing homes--fulfill criteria for alcohol abuse (6). How Alcohol and 
    Drugs Interact To exert its desired 
    effect, a drug generally must travel through the bloodstream to its site of 
    action, where it produces some change in an organ or tissue. The drug's effects 
    then diminish as it is processed (metabolized) by enzymes and eliminated from 
    the body. Alcohol behaves similarly, traveling through the bloodstream, acting 
    upon the brain to cause intoxication, and finally being metabolized and eliminated, 
    principally by the liver. The extent to which an administered dose of a drug 
    reaches its site of action may be termed its availability . Alcohol 
    can influence the effectiveness of a drug by altering its availability. Typical 
    alcohol-drug interactions include the following (7): First, an acute dose of alcohol (a single drink or several drinks over several hours) may 
    inhibit a drug's metabolism by competing with the drug for the same set of 
    metabolizing enzymes. This interaction prolongs and enhances the drug's availability, 
    potentially increasing the patient's risk of experiencing harmful side effects 
    from the drug. Second, in contrast, chronic (long-term) alcohol ingestion 
    may activate drug-metabolizing enzymes, thus decreasing the drug's availability 
    and diminishing its effects. After these enzymes have been activated, they 
    remain so even in the absence of alcohol, affecting the metabolism of certain 
    drugs for several weeks after cessation of drinking (8). Thus, a recently 
    abstinent chronic drinker may need higher doses of medications than those 
    required by nondrinkers to achieve therapeutic levels of certain drugs. Third, 
    enzymes activated by chronic alcohol consumption transform some drugs into 
    toxic chemicals that can damage the liver or other organs. Fourth, alcohol 
    can magnify the inhibitory effects of sedative and narcotic drugs at their 
    sites of action in the brain. To add to the complexity of these interactions, 
    some drugs affect the metabolism of alcohol, thus altering its potential for 
    intoxication and the adverse effects associated with alcohol consumption (7). Some Specific Interactions Anesthetics. Anesthetics are administered prior to surgery to render a patient unconscious 
    and insensitive to pain. Chronic alcohol consumption increases the dose of 
    propofol (Diprivan)1 required to induce loss of consciousness (9). Chronic 
    alcohol consumption increases the risk of liver damage that may be caused 
    by the anesthetic gases enflurane (Ethrane) (10) and halothane (Fluothane) 
    (11). Antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat infectious diseases. In combination with 
    acute alcohol consumption, some antibiotics may cause nausea, vomiting, headache, 
    and possibly convulsions; among these antibiotics are furazolidone (Furoxone), 
    griseofulvin (Grisactin and others), metronidazole (Flagyl), and the antimalarial 
    quinacrine (Atabrine) (7). Isoniazid and rifampin are used together to treat 
    tuberculosis, a disease especially problematic among the elderly (12) and 
    among homeless alcoholics (13). Acute alcohol consumption decreases the availability 
    of isoniazid in the bloodstream, whereas chronic alcohol use decreases the 
    availability of rifampin. In each case, the effectiveness of the medication 
    may be reduced (7). Anticoagulants. Warfarin (Coumadin) is prescribed to retard the blood's ability to clot. 
    Acute alcohol consumption enhances warfarin's availability, increasing the 
    patient's risk for life-threatening hemorrhages (7). Chronic alcohol consumption 
    reduces warfarin's availability, lessening the patient's protection from the 
    consequences of blood-clotting disorders (7). Antidepressants. Alcoholism and depression are frequently associated (14), leading to a high 
    potential for alcohol-antidepressant interactions. Alcohol increases the sedative 
    effect of tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil and others), 
    impairing mental skills required for driving (15). Acute alcohol consumption 
    increases the availability of some tricyclics, potentially increasing their 
    sedative effects (16); chronic alcohol consumption appears to increase the 
    availability of some tricyclics and to decrease the availability of others 
    (17,18). The significance of these interactions is unclear. These chronic 
    effects persist in recovering alcoholics (17). A chemical called 
    tyramine, found in some beers and wine, interacts with some anti-depressants, 
    such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, to produce a dangerous rise in blood 
    pressure (7). As little as one standard drink may create a risk that this 
    interaction will occur. Antidiabetic 
    medications. Oral hypoglycemic drugs are prescribed to help lower 
    blood sugar levels in some patients with diabetes. Acute alcohol consumption 
    prolongs, and chronic alcohol consumption decreases, the availability of tolbutamide 
    (Orinase). Alcohol also interacts with some drugs of this class to produce 
    symptoms of nausea and headache such as those described for metronidazole 
    (see "Antibiotics") (7). Antihistamines. Drugs such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl and others) are available without 
    prescription to treat allergic symptoms and insomnia. Alcohol may intensify 
    the sedation caused by some antihistamines (15). These drugs may cause excessive 
    dizziness and sedation in older persons; the effects of combining alcohol 
    and antihistamines may therefore be especially significant in this population 
    (19). Antipsychotic 
    medications. Drugs such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) are used to 
    diminish psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Acute alcohol 
    consumption increases the sedative effect of these drugs (20), resulting in 
    impaired coordination and potentially fatal breathing difficulties (7). The 
    combination of chronic alcohol ingestion and antipsychotic drugs may result 
    in liver damage (21). Antiseizure 
    medications. These drugs are prescribed mainly to treat epilepsy. 
    Acute alcohol consumption increases the availability of phenytoin (Dilantin) 
    and the risk of drug-related side effects. Chronic drinking may decrease phenytoin 
    availability, significantly reducing the patient's protection against epileptic 
    seizures, even during a period of abstinence (8,22). Antiulcer 
    medications. The commonly prescribed antiulcer medications 
    cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac) increase the availability of 
    a low dose of alcohol under some circumstances (23,24). The clinical significance 
    of this finding is uncertain, since other studies have questioned such interaction 
    at higher doses of alcohol (25-27). Cardiovascular 
    medications. This class of drugs includes a wide variety of medications 
    prescribed to treat ailments of the heart and circulatory system. Acute alcohol 
    consumption interacts with some of these drugs to cause dizziness or fainting 
    upon standing up. These drugs include nitroglycerin, used to treat angina, 
    and reserpine, methyldopa (Aldomet), hydralazine (Apresoline and others), 
    and guanethidine (Ismelin and others), used to treat high blood pressure. 
    Chronic alcohol consumption decreases the availability of propranolol (Inderal), 
    used to treat high blood pressure (7), potentially reducing its therapeutic 
    effect. Narcotic 
    pain relievers. These drugs are prescribed for moderate to 
    severe pain. They include the opiates morphine, codeine, propoxyphene (Darvon), 
    and meperidine (Demerol). The combination of opiates and alcohol enhances 
    the sedative effect of both substances, increasing the risk of death from 
    overdose (28). A single dose of alcohol can increase the availability of propoxyphene 
    (29), potentially increasing its sedative side effects. Nonnarcotic 
    pain relievers. Aspirin and similar nonprescription pain relievers 
    are most commonly used by the elderly (5) . Some of these drugs cause stomach 
    bleeding and inhibit blood from clotting; alcohol can exacerbate these effects 
    (30). Older persons who mix alcoholic beverages with large doses of aspirin 
    to self-medicate for pain are therefore at particularly high risk for episodes 
    of gastric bleeding (19). In addition, aspirin may increase the availability 
    of alcohol (31), heightening the effects of a given dose of alcohol. Chronic alcohol 
    ingestion activates enzymes that transform acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) 
    into chemicals that can cause liver damage, even when acetaminophen is used 
    in standard therapeutic amounts (32,33). These effects may occur with as little 
    as 2.6 grams of acetaminophen in persons consuming widely varying amounts 
    of alcohol (34). Sedatives 
    and hypnotics ("sleeping pills") . Benzodiazepines such as diazepam 
    (Valium) are generally prescribed to treat anxiety and insomnia. Because of 
    their greater safety margin, they have largely replaced the barbiturates, 
    now used mostly in the emergency treatment of convulsions (2). Doses of benzodiazepines 
    that are excessively sedating may cause severe drowsiness in the presence 
    of alcohol (35), increasing the risk of household and automotive accidents 
    (15,36). This may be especially true in older people, who demonstrate an increased 
    response to these drugs (5,19). Low doses of flurazepam (Dalmane) interact 
    with low doses of alcohol to impair driving ability, even when alcohol is 
    ingested the morning after taking Dalmane. Since alcoholics often suffer from 
    anxiety and insomnia, and since many of them take morning drinks, this interaction 
    may be dangerous (37). The benzodiazepine 
    lorazepam (Ativan) is being increasingly used for its antianxiety and sedative 
    effects. The combination of alcohol and lorazepam may result in depressed 
    heart and breathing functions; therefore, lorazepam should not be administered 
    to intoxicated patients (38). Acute alcohol consumption 
    increases the availability of barbiturates, prolonging their sedative effect. 
    Chronic alcohol consumption decreases barbiturate availability through enzyme 
    activation (2). In addition, acute or chronic alcohol consumption enhances 
    the sedative effect of barbiturates at their site of action in the brain, 
    sometimes leading to coma or fatal respiratory depression (39). Alcohol-Medication 
    Interactions--A Commentary by NIAAA Director Enoch Gordis, M.D. Individuals who drink 
    alcoholic beverages should be aware that simultaneous use of alcohol and medications--both 
    prescribed and over-the-counter--has the potential to cause problems. For 
    example, even very small doses of alcohol probably should not be used with 
    antihistamines and other medications with sedative effects. Individuals who 
    drink larger amounts of alcohol may run into problems when commonly used medications 
    (e.g., acetaminophen) are taken at the same time or even shortly after drinking 
    has stopped. Elderly individuals should be especially careful of these potential 
    problems due to their generally greater reliance on multiple medications and 
    age-related changes in physiology. 1The U.S. Government
