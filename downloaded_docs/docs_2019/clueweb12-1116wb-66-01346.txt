infected with HIV and more than 1 million contract a sexually transmitted
infection (STI). Currently, an estimated 33.3 million people are living with
HIV today, and in Sub-Saharan Africa—the region hit hardest by the pandemic—the
majority of 15- to 24-year-olds living with HIV is female. Today, 23% of all
people living with HIV are under age 24, while 35% of all new infections happen among people between 15 to 24 years of age. Clearly, the need for quality HIV, AIDS, and
STI services is more important than ever. While HIV treatment is becoming more widely
available in developed countries, such treatment still eludes many people
living in the world’s poorest communities. Current health care systems in most
of the developing world struggle to provide even the most basic health
services. In these places, not only is medication often unavailable, but health
care providers are not adequately trained to help patients prevent HIV or STIs
or to treat or counsel patients living with HIV or AIDS. Additionally, health
workers often discriminate against people living with HIV and perpetuate the
stigma surrounding HIV in their workplaces and communities. EngenderHealth is addressing these inequities
in care by training health providers, improving health services, and advocating
for national policies that respond to the needs of people living with HIV.
EngenderHealth is: Improving
     access to critical HIV services, including voluntary counseling and
     testing for HIV; treatment,
     care, and support ; and prevention
     of mother-to-child transmission of HIV Reducing
     stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS in health care settings Improving the safety and
effectiveness of existing clinical services, including reducing the risk of
transmitting HIV and other STIs Integrating
     HIV and AIDS services with sexual and reproductive health services to
     better meet clients’ comprehensive needs Promoting
     the right of people living with HIV to access sexual and reproductive
     health care, including family
     planning Providing
     women, men, and youth with comprehensive information needed to make
     informed and voluntary decisions about ways to prevent HIV and other STIs Increasing
     access to adult male
     circumcision , a procedure proven to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV from
     a female partner Engaging
     men as partners in reproductive health By joining forces with government health
ministries, community-based organizations, and local health facilities,
EngenderHealth is implementing HIV and AIDS programs that are effective and
sustainable in countries such as Ethiopia , Ghana , India , Kenya , South
Africa , Tanzania , Uganda ,
and more. © 2011 EngenderHealth, all rights reserved. Read our terms of use and privacy policy . Photo credit: M. Tuschman/EngenderHealth Vis
