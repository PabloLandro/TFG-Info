My ears itched really badly a few years ago. I've been known to use Q-tips just to get to the itching. That's NOT a good idea, because if you push them too far into the ear, it can cause problems, even hearing loss. And it compacts the ear wax towards the ear drum. I was having a problem with my ears, and went to the doc. Turns out I had fluid in my inner ear. Got that taken care of, and he flushed my left ear out with water to remove a plug of wax. But the itching... The doc told me I should drop two to three drops of cooking oil into each ear , and it would soften the skin so the ears wouldn't itch as badly. It works! I bought an eye dropper at the pharmacy, filled it up with olive oil, and use it fairly regularly. At the beginning, I had a lot of wax buildup, and removed that gently with a Q-tip (not too far in!). Warning: Don't get the inside of the ear too moist for too long, as those are good conditions for a fungus infection, if the skin is already irritated (which it would be, or you wouldn't use the oil!). So be careful, and if your ears get painful, ask the doc if it could be fungus. Don't assume he'll know. Not all docs know what a fungus infection in the ear looks like.
