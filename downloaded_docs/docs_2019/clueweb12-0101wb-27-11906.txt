        weight is reduced by 50 percent and the weight loss is sustained for five 
        years. So how effective are surgeries like Lapband® gastric 
        banding or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass? Do these operations really help patients 
        to lose weight and keep it off? The truthful answer is: we don't really 
        know. What we do know is: Weight loss success following surgery varies by type of procedure, 
          the effectiveness of pre-surgery screening for suitable candidates, 
          the age, starting weight and ability of patients to change their eating 
          and exercise behaviors after surgery. Most patients who undergo stomach surgery (whether banding or bypass) 
          lose some weight. Most patients who undergo gastric bypass typically lose up to 60 percent 
          of their excess body weight. Many patients regain weight between 3 and 5 years following surgery. Expert Views on Gastric 
        Surgery Success Rates The American Medical Association advised surgeons in the April 9, 2003, issue of JAMA to work around the 
        scientific issues by telling patients weight loss surgery is "investigational" and informing them that "it is not known whether these procedures 
        will help them." The National Association to Advance 
        Fat Acceptance says: "There is no conclusive evidence that 
        gastrointestinal surgery for weight loss increases longevity or improves 
        overall health." See: How Effective

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. © 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
