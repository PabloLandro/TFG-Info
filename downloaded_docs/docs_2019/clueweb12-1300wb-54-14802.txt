View all columns in series Copper can trigger a migraine, especially if you have an abnormal copper metabolism or consume high quantities. Some alcoholic beverages, such as red wine, beer, and whiskey, are distilled in copper stills and some water supplies travel  through copper pipes. Foods high in copper include shellfish, wheat germ, chocolate, and nuts. Citrus increases your body's absorption of this mineral. Talk with your health-care practitioner about getting a hair analysis or other assay of your copper levels. Avoid the above foods and beverages and make sure your multivitamin is free of copper. Magnesium . If you're a long-term reader of my newsletter, Women's Health Letter, you know I'm a big advocate of magnesium. I find that a magnesium deficiency is implicated in an unusually high amount of health problems including migraines. Magnesium helps smooth muscles relax, and is needed to produce serotonin. Low magnesium reduces blood flow to the brain and changes the way serotonin receptors work. Magnesium helps reduce inflammation and prevents veins from spasming. The body uses up its stores of magnesium when youâre under stress. It's no wonder that brain magnesium levels were 19 percent lower in people having a migraine headache than in people with no headaches. A number of scientific studies found low levels of magnesium in people with migraines. Over a decade ago, Dr. Guy E. Abraham conducted studies on women with PMS and found many women with monthly migraines have low blood levels of magnesium.  Magnesium is difficult to measure accurately through regular blood tests, so you may want to simply increase your magnesium intake. Feverfew: Feverfew reduces inflammation and improves blood vessel tone. Its leaves contain a chemical called parthenolide that seems to reduce headaches. Some herbalists suggest you chew a few fresh feverfew leaves, but the bitter leaves have caused mouth ulcers, a sore tongue, and swollen lips. Instead, use a standardized extract or capsules with 0.2 percent parthenolide. Some commercial products have been found to have little or no parthenolide. Numerous studies have shown that taking the herb feverfew  (Tanacetum parthenium) can reduce the frequency and severity of migraines and their symptoms or even stop them completely. This herb inhibits the release of substances from platelets that cause blood vessels to dilate. Feverfew also reduces the production of inflammatory hormone-like chemicals called prostaglandins. You can take either 150 mg of freeze- dried feverfew extract or 200-400 mg of feverfew in capsules two or three times a day to prevent migraines. But you may need more than this. Higher amounts ââ one to two grams a day ââ might be necessary if you are having an attack. A study reported in The Lancet (July 23, 1988) noted that one capsule of feverfew per day was enough to reduce the number and severity of  attacks in participants. I suggest you begin with the smaller amounts and increase the dosage until you get the results you need. Feverfew is a prolific perennial with small daisy-like flowers and strong-smelling chartreuse leaves. The active ingredient is in the leaves, which can be chewed, or dried and ingested. You may want to grow some feverfew in your garden to have your own supply, if you find itâs effective in preventing your headaches. Traditionally, migraines are treated with various pharmaceuticals from ibuprofen and antihistimines to stronger drugs such as Inderal and Imitrex. These medications tend to have unpleasant side effects.
