There are several techniques you can try out to get used to the teas. * Drink shots down fast. Divide the tea into 2-3 manageable shots * Mix the tea with apple, orange juice or ... drink the juice right after you ingest the tea * Eat some figs, nuts or raisins right after you drink the tea * Hold the nose while drinking the tea, though that creates vacuum in the ear * For sour drinks try to add some spicy taste to it (e.g. let it simmer a few minutes with 2-3 slices of ginger). For bitter tasting teas try to add some salt to it * Add honey or sugar to it Explain to the practitioner what tastes you like the most(e.g.salty, sweet, bitter, sour). Describe what makes the tea terrible for you. If nothing works the practitioner could modify the formula.
