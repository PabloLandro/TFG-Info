<200 lux), 
        expressed rhythmicity will free-run.  This situation can occur in 
        constantly illuminated intensive care units where the patient’s 
        circadian phase will drift from that of care providers.  This may 
        result in perceptions of abnormal behavior.  The interpretation of 
        time-of-day dependent tests e.g., cortisol levels also will be 
        inaccurate in this setting.  Thus, to prevent free-running rhythms, 
        cycled lighting of adequate intensity is needed. DETECTING BIOLOGICAL 
        CLOCK DISORDERS A history of regular sleep and wake times in an individual is 
        reassuring that the biological clock is functioning normally.  The 
        lack of regular sleep or awakening time may reflect abnormal clock 
        function.  Surprisingly, despite the socially disruptive effects of 
        arrhythmic behavior, clock-related behavioral problems may not be 
        brought to medical attention. Yet upon inquiry, families will give clear 
        histories of abnormal activity patterns. To assess clock function, diaries of sleep and waking times 
        are useful.  If the time the patient awakens and retires to sleep 
        is consistent from day-to-day, this suggests normal clock function.  
        However, if sleep patterns are irregular, or are out of synchrony with 
        those of other family members, clock lesions may be present. To provide objective assessments of behavior patterns, 
        periods of rest and wakefulness can be assessed using monitors worn on 
        the wrist that collect activity information for extended periods ( actigraphy ).  
        Analysis of activity patterns collected over 2-3 week periods ( actograms ) 
        can then be used to determine if there is normal rhythmicity or altered 
        phase-relationships. CHRONOTHERAPY Over the past several years, considerable progress has been 
        made in the treatment of biological rhythm disorders.  Light has 
        been recognized to regulate circadian rhythmicity in humans. 2 Exposure to bright light (10,000 lux) during the night is a strong 
        stimulus that produces rapid shifts in circadian phase in humans. 2 Not surprisingly, light therapy is now being considered as a potential 
        therapy for jet lag and other circadian phase disorders. The concept that bright light resets the circadian clock is 
        also important for night-shift workers.  By providing an 
        environment with bright light exposure during work at night and darkness 
        during the daytime when the worker rests, it is possible to shift the 
        endogenous circadian cycle to that of the work schedule. 22 Light therapy is also used in the 
        treatment of certain forms of depression. 23 Behavioral paradigms 
        can be used to treat circadian- phase disorders. Delayed sleep-phase 
        insomnia can be treated by progressively delaying sleep onset over 
        several days until the patient’s sleep-wake cycle is in phase with the 
        desired time of day.  Alternatively, imposing regular waking times 
        each morning can help resynchronize circadian phase. MELATONIN Melatonin has received much attention as a “ chronotherapeutic ”.  
        Melatonin is an endogenous indolamine that is produced by the pineal 
        gland at night in proportion to the duration of darkness. 24 In mammals, melatonin exerts its effects through specific high-affinity 
        receptors that include Mel 1a (mel 1) and Mel 1b (mel 2) receptors. 25 These receptors consist of seven transmembrane spanning domains and 
        couple with guanosine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). 25 In humans, the melatonin receptors have been identified in the 
        SCN. 26 In non-human primates, melatonin receptors have 
        been identified in the hippocampus, brainstem, thalamus and cerebral 
        cortex. 27 Melatonin has been touted as a therapy for a variety of 
        conditions ranging from aging to cancer.  Yet, as reviewed , 28 most of these claims have little credible scientific support.   
        Melatonin, however, may have legitimate use in treating sleep disorders.   
        Melatonin has well documented hypnotic properties, and is therefore 
        effective in facilitating sleep onset. 29-31 The hypnotic effects of melatonin are most 
        pronounced when melatonin is given in the evening. 32 It has also been suggested that melatonin can acutely shift 
        circadian phase and may have a role in treating clock disorders such as 
        jet lag. 33 This issue remains controversial.  
        Modest melatonin-induced phase shifts have been detected in some rodent 
        species, but not in others. 34 In humans, using the onset of melatonin secretion to mark 
        circadian phase, it has been suggested that melatonin induces small 
        shifts in circadian phase. 33 ,35 However, when primates are studied under rigorous conditions that are 
        very difficult to achieve in humans, no phase shifting effects of 
        melatonin are apparent. 32 These observations suggest 
        that melatonin action in the treatment of jet lag 36,37 may be 
        related to hypnotic effects, rather than phase-shifting properties. Although melatonin may not acutely shift circadian phase , 32 melatonin administration at the same time each day may entrain 
        free-running circadian phase.  In blind individuals, nocturnal 
        melatonin administration has been shown to entrain activity patterns to 
        the 24-hour day. 20 ,37,38 SUMMARY Increasing evidence 
        show that the circadian system exerts profound effect on human 
        physiology. In parallel with increases in our understanding of the clinical 
        importance of circadian biology, there has been an explosion in our 
        understanding of the genetic mechanisms that contribute to the workings 
        of the circadian clock.  Elucidation of abnormalities of the 
        circadian system has also lead to the discovery of new clinical 
        disorders that can now be identified and treated. REFERENCES Weaver DR. J Biol Rhythms 1998;13(2):100-112. Shanahan TL, Czeisler CA. Semin Perinatol 2000;24(4):299-320. Foster RG.
