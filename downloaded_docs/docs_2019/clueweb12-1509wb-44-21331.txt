Left untreated, bacterial vaginosis can lead to permanent complications. Prevention is the best way to combat the problem. Bacterial vaginitis, or vaginosis, is an imbalance of normal bacteria levels in the vagina. It is the most common type of vaginal infection. Your doctor typically treats bacterial vaginitis with antibiotics. However, for some women as soon as the infection clears, it returns. If you suffer from reoccurring bacterial vaginitis, go after the problem naturally. Signs and Symptoms of Bacterial Vaginosis: - A symptom is something the patient senses and describes, while a sign is something other people, such as the doctor notice. For example, drowsiness may be a symptom while dilated pupils may be a sign. Approximately 50% of all women with BV have no symptoms (asymptomatic). If a woman does have symptoms, she does not need to get tested to find out. The main sign is in the vaginal discharge: - • Vaginal discharge may become watery and thin • Vaginal discharge may become grey or white • Vaginal discharge may have a strong and unpleasant smell, often described as fishy The following symptoms are possible, but much less common: - • Burning sensation during urination • Itching around the outside of the vagina Bacterial vaginosis is caused by the PH balance being thrown off. As long as your system is not balanced this can continue to come back. Here’s how to cure bacterial vaginosis the natural way. • The most important step in treating bacterial vaginosis is to avoid sugar. Eating sugar actually feeds the bacteria of vaginitis. You should also avoid refined carbs and alcohol. • Adding yogurt to your diet helps to feed the healthy bacteria, which helps to fight against bad bacteria.

Try eating more fresh garlic, or take some in supplemental form. • Put the sweet tooth away and take up anything that will help keep the stress level down. High intakes of sugar and stress can trip up the PH balance. • Mostly the chief Bacterial vaginosis causes are thought to be a biological and chemical imbalance of the flora that occurs normally in a healthy vagina. • Avoid sexual contact with anyone for at least 7 days.
