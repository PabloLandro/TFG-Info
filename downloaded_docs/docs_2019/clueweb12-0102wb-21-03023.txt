Free Veteran Clinic on Fridays | Acupuncture & Massage Blog Acupuncture & Massage Blog Skip to content Home About Subscribe ← Counting Calories May Cause Weight Gain Spring Cleaning For Health → Free Veteran Clinic on Fridays Posted on May 14, 2010 by Dr. Richard Browne Fridays from 1pm to 4pm, veterans can receive free acupuncture treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at Acupuncture & Massage College’s Community Clinic, located at 10506 N. Kendall Drive, Miami. Call (305) 595-9500 to schedule an appointment. Classified as an anxiety disorder, PTSD can result from the experience or witnessing of traumatic or life-threatening events such as terrorist attack, violent crime, torture, genocide, natural disaster, and military combat. Symptom clusters of PTSD include re-experiencing of the event (intrusive memories, flashbacks), emotional numbing, behavioral avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and hyper-arousal (difficulty sleeping, irritability, being easily startled). According to the National Center for PTSD (US Department of Veterans Affairs), about 30 percent of the men and women who have spent time in recent war zones experience combat-induced PTSD, a categorization of PTSD more difficult to treat than PTSD caused by other traumas. Acupuncture can be an effective addition to treatment regimens for PTSD, alleviating symptoms. PTSD symptoms acupuncture treats include: •	Insomnia. •	Stress. •	Anxiety. •	Depression. If you are a veteran, call today to schedule your free acupuncture appointment at (305) 595-9500. For information about AMC’s Oriental Medicine and Massage Therapy programs ask for Joe Calareso, Admissions Director. This entry was posted in Acupuncture .
