about Muscle Spasms and Approach Treatment Muscles of the back may produce spasm or extreme muscle stiffening after a
traumatic injury or repetitive strain.  The difference between a repetitive
strain and a traumatic injury is that with a repetitive strain the muscles are
being irritated over a long period of time until they reach a point that finally
triggers the spasm.  The muscles then spasm to protect the area from
further injury.  For example, a person who has improper posture at a
computer on a regular basis, or a golfer who plays frequently with bad form may
have their muscles tighten over time, but the muscles may not start to spasm
until something as simple as reaching for a glass of water occurs. This
spasm can be extremely painful and lead to tearing of the muscles if undue
stressors are placed on them.  This tearing will than lead to guarding of
the back musculature through extreme stiffening to protect the area from further
harm.  With proper care for the area, the pain in the back musculature
should lessen over three weeks, but it should be noted that the healing of the
area continues and doesn't even peak until at least six weeks following the
initial injury.  This is due to scar tissue formation which initially acts
like the glue to bond the tissue back together.  Scar tissue will continue
to form past six weeks in some cases and as long as a year in severe back pulls. 
The initial approach to treating a muscle pull is to support and protect the
muscles, help them to loosen up and lessen the pain and minimize any
inflammation.  After the scar tissue has begun to accumulate, it will be
important to perform procedures which help break down the scar tissue in the
muscle so as to let the muscle regain its normal flexibility and lessen the
chance of further injury.  While exercise is appropriate for breaking down
scar tissue once the area has healed, it may further irritate the area during
the initial stages.  Therefore, other methods such as ultrasound, massage,
and gentle chiropractic adjustments may be safely used to accomplish this early on in
the injury.  The listed Therapies, Products and
Activities section will give more information on how to help your condition,
however, as each Muscle Spasm condition is different, always consult your doctor
to determine what treatment is right for your particular situation. Therapies,
Products, and Activities to Help Your Condition: Choosing the Correct Mattress A good mattress will protect the back for the many hours that you are in bed. 
A mattress that properly supports the body will also be a very important element in helping relieve
stress on the muscles and joints of the back.  The most important information needed for finding a
correct mattress to support the back involves knowing what position you sleep in. 
The menu below will help you to search for a mattress that is right for you. Choose a sleeping position: Back Side Stomach All Positions Finding
the Right Chair or Seat Insert Cushion Whether you sit for minutes or hours, you can't underestimate the value of
proper posture while sitting.  It has been demonstrated that at times there
can be as much as six times the amount of stress on your back when you sit than
while lying down.  Fortunately you can lower the amount of stress placed
on the spine with proper back support.  To accomplish this, first you must
decide whether the chair you use presently is adequate for your needs.  A
good chair will be able to provide your lower back with proper lumbar pressure. 
This pressure will keep the curve of the spine in this area supported in the
normal position.  When a proper lumbar support is not provided with your
chair, an insert lumbar cushion can accomplish this.  The size of the
cushion is very important, as too much lumbar support can compress and irritate
the spine.  A good working ergonomic type of chair can be adjusted to allow
tilting and height control of the seat and chair back.  Here are some tips
for adjusting your chair properly:  Adjust the height of the chair to allow
your feet to rest comfortably on the floor.  Adjusting the tilt angle of
the seat will change the position of your pelvis, thereby shifting the back
towards or away from the seat back.  Tilting the front of the seat downward
will bring your lower back into extension and thus increase the lower lumbar
curve.  Tilting the front of the seat upward will bring your lower back
into flexion and thus decrease your lumbar curve.  Combine the seat angle
tilt with the seat back tilt for optimal support of the back.  If the seat
back height can be adjusted, make sure the small of your back fits with the part
of the seat back which curves outward to support the lower back.  If these
adjustments still do not support the spine properly, you will definitely need a
lumbar insert cushion or more ergonomically correct chair.  Insert cushions
will need to have height adjustability to fit correctly.  This is usually
achieved with a strap that allows you to set the height of the cushion to the
thickest part against the small of your back. Each person's spine curves
differently , so another important feature that some back support cushions
provide is the ability to adjust the size of the lumbar thickness to customize
the fit .  We found two different types of backrest cushions that meet the
strict criteria of what we look for when helping patients to properly support
their posture while sitting (see link below). Click Here to purchase the recommended backrest for your spine with the adjustable air cushion found at Relief-Mart . Soft Back Braces Back braces can be necessary when an injury creates instability to the spinal
column, as it will protect the back from further injury.  Soft back braces
can be useful for support of fatigued muscles and allow temporary relief to the
irritated tissue in the initial stage of injury.  However, wearing a back
brace for prolonged periods after the area has finished with the initial healing
stage can also weaken the back musculature over time, as the muscles will rely
on the brace to keep good posture.  While too much movement of the back may
cause exacerbation of the muscle spasms , completely preventing movement
of the area has been shown to hinder the healing process.  The best
solution is to find a brace that puts pressure directly over the irritated area
only, thereby protecting the tissue, but also allowing the rest of the back
muscles to still be used.  Short term use of a back brace will not cause
any weakening of the back muscles.  If the muscles are completely not used
for prolonged periods they will weaken over time.  To avoid this, once the
injury has healed sufficiently enough, use a back brace only to support the back
during any activity that requires protection for the spine.  It can be
noted that the use of a brace while sleeping should not cause the muscles to
weaken, but many patients find that overusing the brace can become irritating to
the skin underneath. Most of the patients we survey tell us that using
a back brace which puts direct pressure over the irritated area provides instant
relief .  The back brace which we believe accomplishes this the most
proficiently is one of the types depicted below with the patented adjustable air
pressure bladder incorporated in the belt.  It also offers attachable ice
gel pads for direct ice therapy (see the Ice Packs section for more information on ice therapy). Click
here to purchase the recommended back brace supports for your spine with the patented adjustable air pump system found at Relief-Mart Traction
Devices Caution should be taken when applying traction to any newly injured area, and
should not be performed in these cases unless specifically recommended by
your doctor.  Lumbar (low back) traction can be accomplished through
various products which keep the pelvis stationary while using gravity to force
separation of the vertebrae and thereby open the spinal canals that the nerves
exit through.  However, the multifidous muscle which attaches to the lumbar
vertebrae may not allow the separation of the vertebrae if the muscle is in too
much spasm.  Some types of traction allow for better separation when the
multifidous muscle is in spasm.  One such type of traction is performed by
doctors of chiropractic through applying pressure manually to the spine while a
flexing table tractions the spine in a downward motion.  In the earlier
stages, light traction can provide an unloading of the spine, thereby releasing
the nerve pressure between each segment created from a decrease in circulation
and an increase of inflammation within the joint space.  In later stages,
traction combined with body movement may also help to break up scar tissue build
up between the joints.  When the muscles are in too much spasm to allow for
this type of traction, upright types of traction units can enable a person to
move their body during the therapy to avoid further muscle spasm, while
providing a relieving therapy to the spine.  Home traction units may be
beneficial, but caution should be taken not to apply too much traction too
quickly to the back, as this may initiate a spasm to the surrounding
musculature. For home use we
recommend a weight bearing traction therapy where a person is able to move the 
body to help avoid any muscle spasm of the back while taking pressure off 
the spine. However, there is a real advantage to being able to exercise while 
decompressing the spine.  Therefore, using an apparatus like the 
Disc-Traction belt below will allow you to exercise and stretch the low back 
without the added gravitational stress in a recumbent position as well
(see link below). Click Here - to purchase the recommended support and traction unit that takes pressure off the spine in any weight bearing or non-weight bearing position found at Relief-Mart Electric
Stimulation Devices Electric stimulation is an effective way to reduce pain.  This is
accomplished though blocking the same pain receptors that cause the nerves to
irritate due to the muscles spasm .  Micro-current is a specific type
of electric stimulation which has been shown to stimulate healing to the injured
tissue.  Some electric stimulation units can charge the muscles to contract
when the intensity is raised or it is placed over a motor point of the muscle. 
At times, this contraction causes the muscles of the back to loosen up by
fatiguing them, while other times it may cause further irritation to the tissue. 
Home electric stimulation devices may not always be as effective as the more
costly type usually found in a health practitioner's office. Ultrasound Ultrasound is an extremely effective way to stimulate proper tissue healing. 
Sound waves are generated from a crystal vibrating inside the head of the
ultrasound wand and then transmitted through sound conducting gel to the tissue. 
This allows the sound waves to break down unwanted scar tissue, increase
circulation to the area, and help relax the musculature.  This can be
extremely beneficial in the case where the Muscle Spasm has caused soft
tissue irritation to the back.  Ultrasound can only be used in the presence
of a licensed health practitioner. Ice
Packs Ice can be used in the initial 72 hours of an injury to reduce inflammation
and numb the pain associated with Muscle Spasms .  One potential
problem with ice is that temporarily it will tighten the musculature even more. 
Also it should be noted that ice should not be used for longer than 20 minutes
to an area, as it will cause a reversal reaction which will allow the tissue to
become more inflamed.  For low back inflammation we recommend using a
combined brace and ice gel pad to put a more firm pressure over the irritated
area.  This will also provide support over the injured area while providing
ice therapy.  Patients we surveyed feel that the brace and ice gel pad
combination below works extremely well (see Soft
Back Brace section for more information on bracing). Click
here to purchase the recommended Ice gel pads which attach to the adjustable air back brace found at Relief-Mart Hot
Packs Hot packs are useful for increasing circulation and thereby
loosening up the muscle tissue.  Waiting to use heat therapy until three
days after the onset of when the initial irritation first occurred will give the
swelling a chance to go down, as heat increases the inflammation to the area. 
It is believed that moist heat is better than dry, as there is less possibility
for dehydration to the musculature.  We found a simple to use moist heat
pack (depicted below) which contains beads that activate upon being heated up in
a microwave to give off moist steam without adding water.  This occurs from
a natural process by which the beads retain moisture from the air.  The
ease of use, combined with the comfort of this product, make it a very popular
therapy with the patients we surveyed. Click here to purchase the recommended Therabeads moist heat packs found at Relief-Mart Whirlpool
and Jacuzzi Water Therapy As previously mentioned, moist heat therapy is useful for increasing
circulation and thereby loosening up the muscle tissue.   In the case
of a heated whirlpool, the heat will completely surround the area.  Add to
this the jet massaging action of a Jacuzzi and you have a great way to relax the
muscles of the back.  Waiting to use heat therapy until three days after
the onset the Muscle Spasm first occurred will give the swelling a chance
to go down, as heat increases the inflammation to the muscles. Mechanical
Massage Devices Many of the same benefits seen with regular massage can be accomplished with
mechanical massage devices that penetrate deeply through a tapping action called
percussion, and thereby disperse lactic acid in the soft tissue and increase
circulation, giving an overall relaxing effect to the musculature.  This
can be very effective for the "knotted up" type of musculature. 
More superficial massage devices that just vibrate may serve to increase
circulation to the tissue, but lack the other aforementioned benefits.  It
should be noted that the stretching of the muscular fibers will not occur like
it does in manual massage.  Percussive massagers should be used on slower
speeds when the soft tissue is very inflamed, as it is less irritating to the
area.  We found an extremely effective, yet affordable variable speed
percussive massager that can be used on the neck and back (pictured below) and
feel that it meets every criteria we look for in a home massager. click here to
purchase the recommended percussive variable speed massager found at Relief-Mart Topical Analgesics for Pain Relief Over-the-counter sprays, sports creams and ointments that have analgesic
properties can be useful for pain control of the Muscle Spasm , without
any intestinal side-effects.  Menthol is the active ingredient which works 
to block pain receptors and help relieve pain in the soft tissue and joints.  
The higher the menthol percentage, the stronger the formula.  Some 
companies use as much as 16 percent menthol, but that much is not necessary to 
achieve results and can cause burning side effects.  Menthol can be derived 
naturally from peppermint or be synthetically produced.  Natural menthol 
penetrates the skin more effectively.  Other
ingredients such as capsaicin, peppermint and eucalyptus can also help to block
pain.  Keep in mind that capsaicin or capsicum are responsible for the 
burning/tingling sensation that occurs in the same pepper spray that police use 
to stop attackers.  Use of these Cayenne pepper derivatives can leave 
residual numbness and tingling in an area for days after each use.  Some companies are also using other herbs believed to have natural
healing, relaxing and mild anti-inflammatory properties such as MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) and Glucosamine , but most only add trivial amounts.  
Glucosamine and MSM are usually taken in oral pill form.  Dosages usually 
range between 1,000-1,500 mg a day.  Glucosamine is currently undergoing many trials to
determine effectiveness for helping cartilage repair.  Studies have 
demonstrated that patients with deterioration of joint cartilage halt and even 
regenerate the tissue after taking Glucosamine for at least six weeks. For a topical pain reliever to
work effectively it needs to have a good transport mechanism (ability to let
ingredients be able to pass through the first layer of skin down to the deeper tissues 
below).  In theory, supplements such as Glucosamine Sulfate and MSM have small enough molecules to pass through the skin barrier and not 
just affect the top of the skin, but rather penetrate deeper down.  Because 
Glucosamine and MSM absorb so well, they also make great skin conditioners.  
Where as taking Glucosamine and MSM will affect your whole body, placing it over an 
area can add 28 times more than a pill would provide over a specific area.  
Topical pain relievers with
oils and waxy substances like glycerin, strearic acid and cetyl alcohol would 
make a poor transport mechanism for ingredients like Glucosamine and MSM, yet 
some companies continue to use this ingredient.  While methyl and propyl 
paraben are preservatives that offer an indefinite shelf life, they also lessen 
the penetration of a topical pain reliever. Therefore, the best type of topical analgesic is one that combines good 
powerful natural ingredients, with a good transport mechanism that has no 
preservatives, but also no oils to block penetration or eventually turn the 
formula rancid.  Therapain Plus (shown below) meets the above criteria and 
has proven successful with the patients we surveyed. click

Supplementation Certain vitamins and herbs can be used as supplementation for the body's
natural healing and defense system.  The RDA recently increased some of its
recommended daily values for certain vitamins, and has listed tolerability
ranges (See RDA's website for further information).  It has been a long
standing debate as to how much extra supplementation can be utilized by the
body, and many contributing factors may play a part in this process.  These
factors may include weight, smoking, exercise, stress, pregnancy, and
quality/type of the supplementation.   While the FDA does not approve
any of the following vitamins and herbs for use of pain or inflammation, many
doctors surveyed are currently using some or all of the following in their
practice to target muscle and connective tissue: Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Zinc , Calcium, Copper, Boswellin, Bromelain, Curcumin,
Hops, Valerian Root, Kava Kava, MSM and Glucosamine Sulfate. *Glucosamine and MSM have the most consistent scientific evidence that 
support its use for many conditions.  For more information on Glucosamine and MSM, click here . Nutritional Aid in the Healing
Process While nutritional changes will not usually produce immediate results, there
can be no better way to make long term changes in the body than eating right. 
Some foods have properties which have been shown to change inflammatory levels. 
Acidic fruits can mildly block the body's inflammation process, whereas red meat
and shellfish increase arachidonic acid, which is known to increase inflammation
levels.  As new nutritional studies are constantly being performed, more
information will be continually added to this site on this topic and addressed
in our free monthly newsletter. Medications One of the most frequent questions our health experts encounter is whether
medication should be taken, and which one would be right for them.  It is
important to remember that medications are aimed at temporarily reducing pain,
inflammation, and relaxing the body, but have not been proven to increase
healing to the area.  Here are some of the most commonly mentioned
medications: For over-the-counter medication, Ibuprofen has been indicated for temporary
pain relief.  Studies have also shown that in higher amounts, Ibuprofen can
act as an anti-inflammatory, but a medical doctor's prescription is needed for
this dosage.  Aspirin and acetaminophen are also indicated for muscle pain
relief, but do not show anti-inflammatory properties in prescription dosages. 
Acetaminophen does not have warnings about adverse reactions for people with
aspirin allergies, as it is not an aspirin derivative.  It has also been
demonstrated to be better tolerated by people with weak intestinal systems. 
While Aspirin is known to be more abrasive on the intestinal system, it may have
other side benefits such as blood thinning that prevents the blood clots which
can lead to strokes and myocardial infarctions. As these medications work to block pain and inflammation temporarily, it
stands to reason that the need for these medications can occur when a person can
no longer function due to the pain or when it hinders sleep  and thereby
impedes the body's natural healing process.  A person on pain medication
should consider that they may more easily overdo it during the temporary relief
period, which could cause further injury to the muscles. *As side effects can occur, always consult your medical doctor to determine
if and what medication is appropriate for your situation.* Exercises and Stretches for the Back All general exercises and stretches listed will can help to increase back
stability and flexibility.  However, as each Back Spasm condition is
different, always consult your doctor to determine
what is right for your particular situation. Click on the Following Picture to go to the section on general
back exercises: Yoga and Meditation to Relax the Back Regardless of the current situation your back is in, relaxing could be
key to helping it heal.  While meditation can always be useful for
achieving this, Yoga can at times be irritating if caution is not taken. 
Yoga is a series of slow movements combined with stretches and meditation to
allow for an increase in flexibility and relaxation to the muscles and joints,
as well as to help optimally integrate the connection between the mind and
body.  However, what might seem to be easy maneuvers should still be
treated cautiously, as your individual situation may prohibit certain Yoga
moves.  One simple meditation practice that is usually met with good success
is to close your eyes and visualize yourself in the most happy and relaxing
place you know of.  Sometimes just taking the time to do this can be what
you need to begin the healing process. Correct Shoes for Avoiding Back
Pain While walking is one of the overall best exercises for your health, the shoes
you choose to stroll in may just be the difference between hurting your back
and helping to keep it strong and loose.  High heel shoes put your spine in
extension, which can impact the joints further when the vertebrae are already in
a compressed state.  Lack of shock absorption will further impact the
joints with every step you take.  Shoes that contain proper arch support
can help take the pressure off those tired feet and add to increase overall
shock absorption.  Shoes with pressurized air or other cushioning chambers
are necessary to protect the spine during the much harder impact a person will
experience during exercise. When to Use a Heel Lift During standing a proper balance is needed between both hips to keep the back
in correct alignment.  When one leg is slightly longer, or the hip becomes
fixated in a higher position, it may be necessary to supplement the lower side
of the hips with a heel lift worn inside the shoe.  When the spine is
tilting to the lower hip side, a lift may allow the spine to realign properly,
and thus take pressure off the back.  If one leg actually grew shorter than
the other, a lift may be needed on a permanent basis to prevent the spine from
moving back to its incorrect position.  A health practitioner should be
the one to evaluate the situation and assess the correct size heel lift
needed. Deciding
on the best health care for you Chiropractic Care Chiropractors have the level of education befitting their title as
doctors. Their focus is primarily on diagnosing and treating dysfunction of the muscles, nerves, and skeletal system without the use of drugs or
surgery.  As a particular back condition may at times warrant more aggressive
forms of treatment, many chiropractors have developed good working relationships with medical doctors to
enable a system of cooperative care to optimally benefit their
patients.  Chiropractic care helps increase the
flexibility of the soft tissue of the spine and reduces the pressure that occurs
from any restricted and minor misalignments of individual vertebral joint
segments.  This in turn helps to
eliminate any nerve interference created from the dysfunctional area.  This
can
be achieved by breaking down scar tissue through techniques which adjust the
spine,  re-aligning the attached vertebrae, as well as performing release techniques to
the fibrous portion of the soft tissue.  Many doctors of chiropractic also use therapeutic measures such as ultrasound, electric stimulation, and heat
therapy.  A doctor of chiropractic should take the time to diagnose your
condition and help determine its cause. Massage
Therapy Many chiropractors have recognized the benefit of working in conjunction with
massage therapists to loosen their patient's muscles as a precursor to
treatment.  This relationship works so well because the patient can be
treated after becoming more relaxed and euphoric due to the natural release of
endorphins, as well as the loosening of the musculature due to all the benefits
of massage.  Other benefits of massage depend on the type of massage being
given. Swedish massage is usually a more superficial, relaxing form, and therefore
is less likely to break down scar tissue and trigger a release of spasmodic
musculature as a deeper type of massage would accomplish.  It should be
noted that due to the increase in circulation and release of lactic acid (a
natural chemical irritant that is a byproduct of muscle utilization without
oxygenation) with massage, it is possible that the area can feel more inflamed
and tender temporarily. Acupuncture Eastern philosophy proposes that acupuncture utilizes needles to stimulate
energy points and  are referred to as meridians.  The Western
scientific explanation is that the stimulation from the needle puncture triggers
natural pain relieving chemicals from the brain, a reduction in inflammation to
the area through an increase in circulation, and a relaxation response to the
musculature.  As no scar tissue is being broken down from the injured
tissue, increase in flexibility will be less likely than with a manual tissue
and joint mobilizing type of therapy. Physical
Therapy Physical Therapy utilizes a variety of modalities such as ultrasound,
electric stimulation, massage, and thermal therapy to help relieve muscular
spasms.  Manual tissue and joint mobilizing types of therapy can be used to
help increase tissue flexibility.  Physical Therapy excels in the use of muscular strengthening
exercises to build stability to weaken tissue.  It should be noted that
irritated muscles can become further damaged with strengthening exercises that
are premature to the healing of the area.  A prescription from a doctor is
often needed prior to treatment with a physical therapist for most health
insurances to pay for any care rendered. Medical
Practitioners A doctor of medicine can take the time to evaluate your condition and confirm your specific
diagnosis.  Medical doctors prescribe either over the counter or
prescription only medication.  They can prescribe medications that
temporarily relieve inflammation, temporarily relax muscles, and temporarily
relieve pain.  Many medical doctors work with physical therapists and
chiropractors to provide conservative management for the many back pain
conditions a patient can experience.  Orthopedic doctors have extended training in joint-related conditions such as
this.  While Orthopedic doctors can perform back surgery, this drastic step
should only be used when all other treatment options have been exhausted, as
back surgery carries many risks, and not usually recommended for most
conditions. Learn why a Memory Foam mattress is exactly what the doctor ordered Learn Why Glucosamine and
