Stretching prior to starting your exercise routine is extremely important. Stretches help relax muscles and thus prevent leg cramps. When beginning a workout regime, it is imperative that you do so gradually. A sudden increase or changes in physical activity levels can cause leg cramps. Keep rolled up bed sheets or blankets at your feet to prevent your toes and feet from pointing downward while you are asleep.    Riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before bedtime could prevent cramps from developing during the night. Knowledge and Persistence leads to success
I have always been fascinated by the question ,why some people can and others cant. I spent years trying to figure this out. At first it was mainly for myself. I remember growing up with little confidence and under the impression that others were more capable than I was. The fact was that this impression was true. It was true because i believed it.
