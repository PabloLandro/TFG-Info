Unfortunately, medical practitioners cannot find a specific cause of the pain in about 85 percent of lower back pain sufferers. To alleviate some of the pain and, at times, eradicate it altogether, try establishing a regular routine of lower back pain exercises. Between 10 and 30 minutes of lower back pain exercises helps patients recover, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Of course, check with your physician before attempting any of the following exercises. Wall squatting Stand with your back against a sturdy, firm wall, heels wedged at the floor and wall’s corner. Step away from the wall, forward, until your feet are positioned about 12 inches in front of you. They should be shoulder-width apart. Create a 45-degree angle by slowly bending your knees, while tightening your ab muscles. Hold this squat for 5 seconds. Return to the starting position with your back against the wall. Repeat this exercise 10 times. Cat and camel stretches Get on all fours on top of a yoga mat or towels. Your hands should be under your shoulder and knees under your hips. Rest your head by releasing your neck, allowing your head to flop downward. While you do this motion, round your back by tucking your hips under yourself, making a curve that points upward. Count to five and release. Do this 10 times. Return to the starting position. Look toward the ceiling while dropping your stomach toward the floor, making your back arch. Count to five and release. Do this 10 times. Knee to chest stretching Lie on your back on a yoga mat or towel, with knees bent pointing toward the ceiling and feet flat on the floor. Use both hands to pull your right knee to your chest and hold this position for 30 seconds. Release and return to starting position Repeat the same exercise with the left leg. Lastly, pull both knees toward your chest and hold them, one in each hand, for 30 seconds. Start an exercise routine today. These simple lower back pain exercises might just give you the relief you need.
