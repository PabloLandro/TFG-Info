the counter foot pain relief remedies, such as shoe insoles , shoe inserts , cushions, braces, and shoes?
Most of these type of shoe 
insoles only provide temporary relief, have limited durability,
and need to be replaced frequently. Archatomics provides a rewarding and long term solution to the search for
QUALITY FOOT PAIN RELIEF and FOOT BALANCE products without the
high cost of Custom Arch Support Orthotics. Our  CUSTOM ARCH SUPPORTS  STOP - Foot Pain, Bunions, Hammer Toes, Flat Feet,
Metatarsalgia, Plantar Fasciitis, Over Pronation/Supination, and High or Fallen Arches . Our custom fit arch supports and shoe inserts provide Stability and Balance through Proper Support
to all four arches of the foot.  Material thickness of 4mm allows our supports
to remain semi-flexible with minimum displacement while maintaining the
spring-action, extending the life for years to come.
With a slight flexibility that keeps our custom arch supports
comfortable, lightweight, and multi-functional.
