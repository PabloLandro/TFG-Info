Asthma Relief Home What can I do to aid my asthma symptoms? May 26, 2010  by admin · 3 Comments Filed under: Astma Relief , Blog I had to stay over at my boyfriend’s house for a few days. I’m an asthma patient, but rarely get symptoms so I forgot my inhaler and I have no way to reach it. I’ve heard there are remedies I could do at home, can anyone tell me the most effective? Please and thank you! Caffeine is considered to be the worst enemy of asthma. It is highly recommended to stop the intake of coffee and other caffeine products as soon as possible. Honey is an effective asthma attack home remedy. In case you suffer from an attack, breathe directly from a jar of honey. This will help you breathe more easily. Lime juice is believed to be an extremely effective asthma attack remedy. Squeeze an entire lemon in a glassful of water and consume this concoction after each and every meal. Vitamin C and zinc help prevent an asthma attack to a great extent. Foods containing high levels of vitamin C include citrus fruits, Brussels sprouts and broccoli among many others. Red meat contains high levels of zinc, but it should be consumed in small portions as they create further health problems. These are some of the effective asthma attack home remedies.

As the third  largest health profession, behind medicine and dentistry, chiropractic care  for low back pains became common. With  their license, practitioners in the field are reliable enough given the  education and training they obtained. My Chiropractor has been taking care of me for ages now and without his  help, I would not be able to function properly nor write this blog post without  pain. So, if you even need chiropractic care, do your research because getting  a good chiropractor may just be your saving grace too. The Unexpected Benefits of a Good Colon Cleanse! Why are so many people  looking for the perfect colon cleanse? Given all of our unhealthy diets and  unhealthy lifestyles, colon cleansing is a great way to regulate and improve  the function of the colon. A regular colon cleanse is also helpful in  preventing constipation. A good colon cleanser, coupled with a healthy diet  rich in fibers gets rid of undigested waste as well as the hardened fecal mater  that is blocking the passageway of the colon. Waste has no problem passing  through the intestinal organs, preventing constipation . There are many benefits associated with colon  cleansers, but perhaps one that people do not expect is the significant weight  loss that may come with it. The average colon weighs at about 4 pounds, but it  has the amazing ability to store up to 30 pounds of fecal matter. Once the  colon is rid of this, it is only natural for a person's weight to go down too!

The best solution is still to go with something natural, which poses less  threat to side effects.
