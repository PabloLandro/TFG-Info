        Joe Hing Kwok Chu Neuropathology 
        of human Alzheimer disease after immunization with amyloid-beta peptide: 
        a case report. Nicoll JA , Wilkinson D , Holmes C , Steart P , Markham H , Weller RO . Division 
        of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. J.Nicoll@soton.ac.uk Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 
        disease (AD). Immunization with Abeta in a transgenic mouse model of AD 
        reduces both age-related accumulation of Abeta in the brain and associated 
        cognitive impairment. Here we present the first analysis of human neuropathology 
        after immunization with Abeta (AN-1792). Comparison with unimmunized cases 
        of AD (n = 7) revealed the following unusual features in the immunized case, 
        despite diagnostic neuropathological features of AD: (i) there were extensive 
        areas of neocortex with very few Abeta plaques; (ii) those areas of cortex 
        that were devoid of Abeta plaques contained densities of tangles, neuropil 
        threads and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) similar to unimmunized AD, 
        but lacked plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and astrocyte clusters; 
        (iii) in some regions devoid of plaques, Abeta-immunoreactivity was associated 
        with microglia; (iv) T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis was present; and (v) 
        cerebral white matter showed infiltration by macrophages. Findings (i)-(iii) 
        strongly resemble the changes seen after Abeta immunotherapy in mouse models 
        of AD and suggest that the immune response generated against the peptide 
        elicited clearance of Abeta plaques in this patient. The T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis 
        is likely to correspond to the side effect seen in some other patients who 
        received AN-1792 (refs. 7-9). PMID: 12640446 
        [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Explanation 
        of the abov e treatise by Joe Hing Kwok Chu : Amyloid-beta peptide: is 
        an antimicrobial peptide. It is a precursor of b eta-amyloid. b eta-amyloidis, a starch - like 
        protein which can helps eliminate infection but can also damage the healthy 
        brain cells. Aβ ( beta -amyloid) 
        plays a key role in the cause of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ can adjust itself 
        to a variety of environmental stressors, and able to induce pro-inflammatory 
        activities.[2] Immunization with an A-beta vaccine in 
        mice that were genetically induced Alzheimer's disease reduces the age -related 
        accumulation of beta -amyloid in the brain 
        and associated cognitive impairment. The researchers immuniz ed a human patient with A-beta vaccine, using the drug called AN-1792. ( N-1792 was 
        developed to stimulate the immune system to "recognize" and attack 
        the amyloid plaques that are a characteristics of Alzheimer brain abnormality ) . Compared to 7 un-immunized cases, it was found that despite the diagnostic sickness of the nerves/brain 
        of Alzheimer's disease : there were extensive areas 
          of the top layer of the brain hemispheres ( neocortex ) with very few A-beta 
          ( beta-amyloid) 
          plaques ; those areas of cortex that 
          were devoid of A-beta plaques contained densities of tangles , neuropil threads and cerebral 
          amyloid angiopathy (CAA) similar to unimmunized AD, but lacked plaque-associated 
          dystrophic (degenerated) neurites and astrocyte clusters ; in some regions devoid of plaques, 
          Abeta-immunoreactivity was associated with microglia ; T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis 
          (inflammation of the brain and the membrane) was present; and cerebral white matter showed 
          infiltration by macrophages (large white cells that defend against bacteria 
          and other foreign matters).. Findings (1)-(3) strongly resemble 
        the changes seen after A-beta immunotherapy in mouse models of AD and suggest 
        that the immune response generated against the peptide elicited clearance 
        of A-beta plaques in this patient. The T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis 
        is likely to correspond to the side effect seen in some other patients who 
        received AN-1792. Neuropil is the nervous tissue consisting of a fibrous network of nonmyelinated 
        nerve fibers; gray matter with few nerve cell bodies; usually a region of 
        synapses between axons and dendrites. (click here to go back ) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is also known as congophilic angiopathy or cerebrovascular amyloidosis . It is a disease of small blood vessels in the brain in 
        which deposits of amyloid protein in the vessel walls may lead to stroke , brain hemorrhage, or dementia . Amyloid protein resembles a starch and is deposited in tissues 
        during the course of certain chronic diseases. (answers.com)  (click here to go back ) Microglia is any of the small neuroglial cells of the central nervous system having

        either an axon or a dendrite . The term is frequently used when speaking of immature or developing 
        neurons, especially of cells in culture , because it can be difficult to tell axons from dendrites in

        Treatmen t (from Shanghai) Stimulating β2-adrenergic 
          receptor ( β2腎上腺素受體) can increase the activity of γ-Secretase （γ- 分 
          泌酶）and can cause the increase of the production of  Amyloid beta-Protein 
          (Aβ) (β澱粉樣蛋白). This discovery shows a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease 
          and therefore γ-secretase is potential target for the 
          treatment of Alzheimer's disease. [1] 中國科學院上海生命科學研究院生物化學與細胞生物學研究所裴鋼院士領導的研究小組經多年研究後發現，β2腎上腺素受體被激活後，可增強γ分泌酶的活性，進 
        而能夠增加導致阿爾茨海默病的β澱粉樣蛋白的產生。該發現揭示了阿爾茨海默病致病的新機制，並且提示β2腎上腺素受體有可能成為研發阿爾茨海默病治療藥物 
        的新靶點。11月19日，國際著名學術期刊《自然·醫學》網絡版在線發表了這項關於β澱粉樣蛋白產生過程新機制的最新研究成果。 [1] Reported by Pei Gang et al of Bio-chemistry and Cell
