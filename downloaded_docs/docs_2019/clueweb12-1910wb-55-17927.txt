            Natural Hemorrhoid Cure            in Health & Fitness: Diseases Jan 8th, 2011            | no responses In the world of back surgery, there are what are called “home run” procedures and then there are sometimes “strike outs”. Contraindications to Spinal Decompression Therapy Spinal Decompression Therapy is a revolutionary treatment involving intermittent traction which can help relieve, back pain, neck pain, arm and leg pain. Developed in the 1990’s, it has grown tremendously in popularity as more and more patients realize the benefits of pain relief and surgery avoidance. It is highly effective (over 80%), low cost (less than 5% the cost of surgery), FDA cleared, and very safe with an extremely low risk profile. The same is typical for surgery for spinal stenosis. A laminectomy is a very good operation for leg pain, but does not help much with leg pain. In fact, a typical complication in 50% of patients after a laminectomy is resultant back stiffness and pain. Surgery for a degenerative disc, however, is a different story.  That should be considered somewhere between a strike out and a home run, we’ll call it a ground rule double. There are some patients who are not candidates for spinal decompression however.  Common problems that benefit include lumbar disc herniation, cervical disc herniation, facet syndrome, failed spine surgery, ruptured discs, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, and spinal stenosis. If a surgery is of considerable magnitude, such as an adult degenerative scoliosis operation, complication rates approach 70%. Success rates are usually over 75%, but looking at the complication profile the decision for surgery needs to be made very carefully. Has the patient tried physical therapy? What about chiropractic treatment, pain management injections like facet injections, spinal decompression therapy, pain medications? Spinal decompression therapy has saved many people from spinal surgery. According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, surgery is no more effective than non-invasive treatments, including chiropractic care, for patients with lumbar disc herniation causing sciatica. However, if a patient has had a previous spinal fusion with instrumentation then spinal decompression is contraindicated.   The concern is the unlikely event that the instrumentation may shift.  However, at times the end result is no pain even though the fusion did not occur and the instrumentation is holding the bones together. The intermittent traction from the neck decompression, even though slight, could cause a screw to shift and the plate to move.
