However, there are some women who report significantly impaired sexual function after pregnancy, including complaints of dyspareunia or HSDD, that are not the consequence of the challenges of caring for an infant Sexual function should be assessed at the post-partum visit SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS Research suggests that diagnosis and treatment of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) can result in sexual problems in up to 55% of women (and 35% of men) Psychosexual vulnerability particularly manifested as depression, anger, guilt, shame and anxiety may accompany the STI diagnosis and decrease sexual satisfaction for months to years thereafter It is important for clinicians to emphasize that most STIs are manageable conditions, and should not be viewed as a punishment or judgment  Involvement in support groups can be very helpful for individuals who struggle with their diagnosis HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES Many women enjoy sexual activity more freely without the fear of pregnancy Although there are some reports of sexual side effects in women using a range of hormonal contraception, there is no consistent pattern of effect Some published data has indicated that premenopausal women who take oral contraceptive pills may have a lower average frequency of sexual thoughts, interest, and days of sexual activity/month Other studies, show that sexual interest scores do not change significantly for women on oral contraceptive pills Further research is required to clarify the effect of oral contraceptive pills on sexual function Caution should be exercised if one is attributing poor sexual health directly to OCs alone; a comprehensive and individualized assessment is warranted BODY IMAGE Body image may have a profound impact on a womans ability to enjoy a satisfying and positive sexual life Negative thoughts about ones body (e.g., feeling overweight or unattractive) or self-consciousness about aspects of ones body (e.g., breast size, facial features) will diminish a womans enjoyment of sexual encounters Heterosexual women are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction than heterosexual men, and lesbian-identified women have as much body dissatisfaction as heterosexual women MENOPAUSE The menopausal transition is marked with lowered sex steroid levels and atrophic vulvar vaginal changes, which may contribute to lowered sexual enjoyment and increased reports of pain during sexual activity A comprehensive assessment and physical examination is often required for diagnosis Minimally absorbed, local vaginal estrogen products (rings, creams, and tablets) can reverse changes in the vaginal mucosa Changes in sexual desire are also seen The menopausal period can include many lifestyle changes (e.g., diagnosis of chronic illnesses, retirement, empty-nest syndrome, divorce, the impact of psychosocial stresses) that should be considered when assessing sexual function All  site content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non  Commercial-NoDerivs License.
