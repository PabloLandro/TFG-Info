Gastric bypass surgery (most commonly the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) is a procedure which aims to reduce the amount of calories absorbed from your food whilst helping you to feel full after eating smaller meals. This weight loss procedure works in two ways: By restricting the capacity of your stomach, and by Bypassing part of your digestive system Why do people choose to have gastric bypass surgery? Gastric bypass surgery can help people with obesity lose a substantial amount of weight, after other methods like diet and exercise have failed. Obesity is associated with multitude of health problems and losing weight can also help to reduce them. Gastric bypass surgery may be appropriate for you if: You are morbidly obese (have a BMI of over 40) You have a BMI of over 35 and suffer from a condition that poses a serious health risk (e.g. diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure) all appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried but have failed to achieve or maintain adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss You are generally fit for anaesthesia and surgery and commit to the need for long-term follow-up. Benefits of gastric bypass The main benefit of gastric bypass surgery is its ability to help patients lose a significant amount of weight. Each patient is unique; however there are a number of positive effects of losing weight which are commonly experienced: Reduction in the health risks associated with obesity Improved health and mobility Improved mental wellbeing Boost to self esteem and self confidence What happens during gastric bypass surgery? Firstly, a small compartment is created at the top of your stomach using staples. A piece of your intestine is then joined to this compartment, which bypasses the rest of your stomach and the upper part of the intestine, where most nutrients and calories are usually absorbed. The small top part of your stomach fills up quickly with food, giving you a sensation of fullness, and then passes directly to the middle part of your small intestine and through the rest of your digestive system. As the digestive system has effectively been made shorter you should absorb fewer calories. Is gastric bypass surgery available on the NHS? NHS funding for this procedure is limited and varies by area. For this reason, many people find that getting a private gastric bypass operation is the best option.
