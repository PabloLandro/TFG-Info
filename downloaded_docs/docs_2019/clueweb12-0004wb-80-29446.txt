                          that combine to produce a calming, sedative effect. 
                          Approved by the German Commission E to treat nervousness 
                          and insomnia.6 Valerian reduces the length of time to 
                          achieve sleep.6 In addition to its sedative effects, 
                          studies have shown that valerian helps relax smooth 
                          muscles which has direct implications for cardiovascular 
                          disease or hypertension.4 Balch notes that valerian 
                          is also useful for anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, 
                          menstrual cramps, muscle cramps, nervousness, pain, 
                          spasms, stress and ulcers.2 According to Barney, "Valerian 
                          tranquilises and regulates the autonomic nervous system, 
                          enhances higher brain functions and eases childhood 
                          psychosomatic disturbances and Behavioural disorders."4 
                          Valerian improves the quality of sleep, according to 
                          one study. Subjects were given 600 mg of valerian root 
                          one hour prior to bedtime or a placebo and then asked 
                          to fill out two sleep questionnaires. At the study's 
                          conclusion, 66 % of the valerian root group rated the 
                          therapeutic effect of this herb as either "good" or 
                          "very good," The control group reported a 29 % equally 
                          positive rating.6 Products: NR1-Restful and SX1. Herbs home Basic
