  & Mortality Gastrointestinal weight loss surgery is 
        a viable option for people who remain severely obese after trying nonsurgical 
        approaches, or who suffer from serious obesity-related health problems. The surgery promotes weight loss 
              by restricting food intake and, in some operations, interrupting 
              the digestive process. As in other treatments for obesity, 
              the best results are achieved with healthy eating behaviors and 
              regular physical activity. Candidates for Weight Loss Surgery People who may consider gastrointestinal 
        surgery include: Those with a body mass index (BMI) above 
          40 - about 100 pounds of overweight for men and 80 pounds for women. People with a BMI between 35 and 40 
          who suffer from type 2 diabetes or life-threatening cardiopulmonary 
          problems such as severe sleep apnea or obesity-related heart disease. Weight Loss Surgery - No Guaranteed Cure 
        for Obesity There are no guarantees for any obesity-treatment 
        method, including gastrointestinal surgery, to produce and maintain weight 
        loss. Success is possible only with maximum cooperation and commitment 
        to behavioral change and medical follow-up - and this cooperation and 
        commitment must be carried out for the rest of your life. Return to Articles About Losing Weight INFORMATION ABOUT BODY WEIGHT and BODY FAT Weight Estimate - Healthy
