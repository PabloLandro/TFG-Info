Exercises For Sciatica & The Lower Back? Exercises for Back Relief Many people believe that rest is best for a painful back,
but actually, what your back really needs when it’s hurt is steady & gentle exercise. Regular exercise relieves
back pain by strengthening and stretching the muscles that
support the spine and helps to prevent future injury and
sciatica. This is a use it or lose it situation: the more you
rest, the weaker your back gets, even if it is hurt. Studies have actually shown that you can heal your back pain
faster and get back to your regular activities with just two
days of rest. This article will focus on Yoga Exercises.
Remember to contact your doctor before beginning any exercise
program. Yoga Exercises for your Sciatica
& Back A good, regular yoga practice will go far in relieving the
stress and tension that sometimes cause mild back pain, and in
fact, studies have shown that yoga is the number one most
effective exercise for relieving sciatica and back pain.
However, not all yoga poses relieve back pain, and some can in
fact aggravate existing pain, so it is important to know which
poses will be most helpful in relieving back pain. It is best to do these exercises under the supervision of a
certified yoga instructor, and if you encounter any problems
with these poses, you should consult an expert. Even just one
or two sessions with a yoga instructor can help, as an
instructor will help you with your form and posture during
poses. Here are some of the best yoga poses for relieving back
pain. Each pose should be held from five to ten seconds,
depending upon your level of comfort, and should be done on a
mat or other soft, supportive surface. CORPSE: Lie flat on your back in a
    relaxed position, arms resting at your sides, palms down,
    and legs lying naturally, with knees turned out slightly.
    If it hurts your back to have your knees turned outward, do
    this pose with knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Breathe
    in and out for a few seconds while allowing any tension to
    leave the body. CAT STRETCH: Start out on your hands
    and knees with a flat back. Your hands should be directly
    under your shoulders with fingers spread. Knees should be
    directly under the hips. Head is held loosely so that you
    are looking at the floor between your hands. Inhale, and as
    you exhale, arch your back toward the ceiling, tuck your
    chin in to your chest so that you are looking at your
    navel, and tuck your tailbone underneath. Hold, then
    release back into your original position. WIND-RELEASING POSE: Lie flat on your
    back as in Corpse pose. As you inhale, bend your knee,
    place your hands right below the knee, and draw your leg
    towards your chest. Your left leg should remain flat on the
    floor. Exhale and bring your forehead up to touch your
    knee. Inhale, and then as you exhale, return to your
    original position. Repeat with the other leg. SAGE TWIST: Warning for this pose—it
    involves twisting your back, so you should take particular
    care not to twist too far or you risk aggravating any
    existing back pain. This should be a gentle stretch; twist
    just as far as is comfortable. Sit on the floor with both legs out in front of you.
    Bend your right knee, lift your right leg over your left,
    and place your right foot on the floor next to your left
    knee. Sitting with spine straight, place your left elbow on
    the right side of your right knee. Bend your left arm so
    that your left fingertips are touching your right hip,
    while at the same time, twisting to look over your right
    shoulder. This is where you need to be careful not to twist
    too far. Hold for a few seconds, release, and repeat on the
    opposite side. PALM TREE: Stand with feet facing
    forward, arms at your sides, weight distributed evenly on
    both feet. Raise both arms over your head, interlock your
    fingers, and turn your hands so that your palms are facing
    upward. Next, place your palms on your head and turn your
    head so that you are looking slightly upward. Stretch your
    arms upwards, and at the same time, come up onto your toes
    if you can do so without pain. Stretch your entire body
    upward and hold, if you can. Some people have difficulty
    balancing during this pose, so just do the stretching part
    if you need to. FISH POSE: Lie on your back with knees
    bent and arms at your side. Arch your back as far as you
    comfortably can and raise it off the ground by pushing the
    floor with your elbows. If you can, tilt your head
    backwards and rest the crown of your head on the floor.
    Breathe deeply from the diaphragm and hold pose for one
    minute if you can. LOCUST: Lie face down with arms at the
    side, palms down, and elbows slightly bent with fingers
    pointing towards the feet. Raise your legs and thighs as
    high off the ground as possible without causing your back
    any pain. Hold for one second and repeat up to twelve
    times. This can be a vigorous exercise so you must take
    care to strain already injured muscles. BENDING FORWARD POSTURE: Stand up straight with feet together and arms hanging
    loosely along your sides. Breathe in deeply and raise your
    arms straight above your head. While breathing out, bend
    forward and touch your toes if you can. If you can’t reach
    your toes, grab hold of your ankles or calves. To complete
    the pose, you should touch your head to your knees, but
    this may be too difficult for many who suffer from lower
    back pain. Your movements during this pose should be
    smooth, not jerky. Written by Shelley Hitz, Licensed Physical Therapist and
