          Drugs Muscle Relaxants or muscle relaxers are drugs that relax certain muscles in
    the body. We cannot say that muscle relaxants belong to a single class of
    drugs, but rather they refer to a group of various drugs and each drug has
    its own significant effect on the body. They are available in tablet forms
    and also in injection form. Muscle relaxers are prescription drugs. Muscle
    relaxants over the counter are also available. Uses of Muscle Relaxant Drugs The muscle relaxant drugs are taken
    to take care of various pain problems: Acute muscle spasms associated with sprains, stroke Strains Pain due to physical therapy Spinal cord injury Other musculoskeletal conditions Fibromyalgia Low-back or neck pain Myofascial pain syndromes Leg cramps Tension headaches How do Muscle Relaxant Drugs Work? Muscle relaxers do not act
    directly on the muscles. They act centrally in the brain. They are used as
    total body relaxants. They are divided into two groups: centrally acting and
    peripherally acting. The first group comprising 10 muscle relaxant drugs,
    which are chemically different, and they work by acting on the central
    nervous system and the other which act periperally comprises just one
    medicine, that is only dantrolene. This drug has a direct action at the
    level of the nerve-muscle connection. Popular Muscle Relaxers Chlorphenesin (Maolate) Carisoprodol (Soma) Chlorzoxazone (Paraflex) Diazepam (Valium) Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) Metaxalone (Skelaxin) Methocarbamol (Robaxin) Orphenadrine (Norflex) Muscle Relaxants Drugs Over The Counter Though muscle relaxers are prescription drugs ,
    they are also available over the counter, that is without any prescription.
    However, muscle relaxers whether taken through prescription or over the
    counter are intended to be used on a short-term basis only. These muscle
    relaxers can be taken to treat any kind of muscle disorder, like, pain or
    swelling in muscles, muscle cramps, etc. However if there is severe pain or
    discomfort increases, it is necessary to consult a doctor for necessary
    medications. Some of the popular OTC muscle relaxant drugs are: Tramaden Lioresal Robaxin (Methocarbamol) Zanaflex (Tizanidine-Oral) Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Tegretol (Carbamazepine) Baclofen Toradol (Ketorolac) Celebrex (Celecoxib) Imitrex Methotrexate Pain relief patch Medrol etc. Side Effects of Muscle Relaxant Drugs It is to be noted that the
    muscle relaxant drugs help in reducing pain but they are not helpful in
    treating the problem and they are not effective for all kinds of pain. There
    are also a number of side effects associated with this medicine. The common
    side effects are dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision, confusion,
    clumsiness or steadiness. In such cases the patient should avoid activities,
    like, driving, operating machines, etc. that require alertness. Some other
    mild side effects of skeletal muscle relaxants are dry mouth, cramps,
    nausea, constipation and diarrhea, hiccups, trembling, muscle fatigue,
