The mat is believed to increase circulation and blood oxygenation and is suitable for people with low levels of energy, high levels of stress, insomnia, backache and depression. Blockages and tension in the physical body can create problems in both body and mind. By releasing this ‘inner tension’, we release a lot of the problems from depression to tense neck / shoulders and poor digestion. Regular use of the mat will help with this. With its Indian origin dating back thousands of years, the bed of nails is a well tested tool for healing the body.
