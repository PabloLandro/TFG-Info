Acupuncture for Asthma | Acupuncture & Massage Blog Acupuncture & Massage Blog Skip to content Home About Subscribe ← Stop Smoking Program at the Acupuncture & Massage College ACUPUNCTURE REDUCES KNEE PAIN → Acupuncture for Asthma Posted on May 22, 2008 by Dr. Richard Browne Asthma, a condition often diagnosed as incurable and chronic, can be managed effectively with acupuncture. Acupuncture is a non-toxic therapy that enhances the body’s natural healing mechanisms. Acupuncture therapy is an alternative for treatment of complex physical disorders like asthma for individuals who experience medication side effects or drug allergy. Individuals often find that asthmatic symptoms can be improved after a series of acupuncture treatments, with medication gradually being reduced. A constitutional and holistic approach is adapted in which the acupuncture treatment is tailored to the individual’s health history and physical, emotional and mental symptoms. By treating the individual holistically, an acupuncture physician can reduce symptoms associated with the primary asthma condition, such as eczema. The use of acupuncture can be very helpful to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of allergic and irritant asthma and sinus disease. Acupuncture also treats the root cause of the condition, which aids in general health recovery. Like other holistic practitioners, your acupuncture physician will consider all lifestyle and environmental factors before commencing treatment. Acupuncture therapy is a safe and effective treatment for both intrinsic asthma caused by factors such as chemicals, cold air, exercise, infection, and stress and extrinsic asthma triggered by pollen, dust and mold. Application of acupuncture during acute onset can alleviate asthmatic symptoms. During the remission stage, acupuncture aids in balancing underlying deficiencies and preventing recurrence. Because there are different forms of asthma, each individual has a different imbalance. Your acupuncture physician will develop an individualized treatment plan. A comprehensive program may be recommended by your acupuncture physician which combines acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, diet modification, and supplements. A comprehensive acupuncture treatment program can decrease inflammation, constriction of bronchial passages, congestion, and reactions to allergens. After an initial therapy plan of weekly treatments, occasional and seasonal maintenance visits are recommended. Acupuncture enhances the flow of chi (vital energy) and reduces wheezing, nasal congestion and itching after the first few acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture also increases energy and biochemical balance, which strengthens the body’s natural healing abilities. Certain allergic disorders such as asthma, eczema and hay fever are partially regulated by brain chemicals and hormones released into the bloodstream in response to stress. Stress can also exacerbate nasal airway inflammation. Stress reduction interventions can be effective in the management of allergic disorders by modulating the immune system response and stabilizing mood states. Acupuncture therapy minimizes fatigue, sinus headache and other allergic reactions while strengthening the body’s capacity to process allergens. Acupuncture treatment corrects the immune system imbalance and increases levels of endorphins and other chemicals that reduce congestion by improving blood circulation. By boosting the immune system, acupuncture can prevent asthma recurrence, especially beneficial for those who experience chronic asthma.

I found your article very informative and have found research which supports your claims. I do have a question –> Based on an article on Chinese Herbs for Asthma which I found on Azmacare.com, do you recommend certain supplements over others? Do you recommend supplements at all? The same site has an article on Lingzhi or Reishi Mushrooms for asthma . Do you recommend their use? Have you ever heard of Ashmi? Thanks in advance for your reply.
