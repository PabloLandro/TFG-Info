Symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal can turn into dangerous health risks, such as seizures. To understand why an individual encounters benzo benzodiazepine withdrawal when they stop taking benzos, let’s look at a few factors. How Diazepam works - a benzodiazepine acts in the brain by making the nerve synapse more porous to GABA, and makes it less porous to Calcium. GABA is the primary neurotransmitter that is inhibitory. It dampens the intense impulses of nerves. Use of a benzodiazepine medication causes the body system to use as much GABA as possible, but when the GABA is exhausted and all gone, everything is over-stimulating. When a person is withdrawing from this medication, it has spent all of their GABA and therefore, the body is unable to regulate stimulus. Diazepam withdrawal GABA is the body’s acute inability for dampening of nerve impulse, and every sight, noise and sensation can feel torturous. The importance of having Diazepam withdrawal help is crucial during this time. Protracted Diazepam withdrawal syndrome is when withdraw symptoms are prolonged or drawn out over an extended period of time. Protracted withdrawal is generally blamed as the drug’s fault for still leaving the persons system, or attributed to damaged receptors. However, what the person is probably experiencing is the chemical toxicity which is often what led to the initial use of this medication, and additionally now there are drug residues and damaged receptors. Such residual toxins can be still acting in the individual’s neurology as excito-toxins, and will continue to do this unless they are removed. At Alternative to Meds Center, we have found in the greater part of anxiety cases, that what the individual is suffering from is an accumulated buildup of neurotoxins including heavy toxic metals that over-stimulate the nervous system. Benzodiazepines are the most commonly addressed medications at Alternative to Meds Center, as unguided Diazepam side effects of withdrawal can be almost impossible and can present with protracted withdrawal, extreme anxiety, and seizures. We use diverse techniques for this certain class of drug, which include: a removal of collected neurotoxins that are due to use of the medication or the individuals environment, careful medication taper methods, peer support, naturally occurring substances that create neurochemical stability, and the relaxing benefits of several therapies including acupuncture sauna, meditation and massage therapy. Do you ever feel like even though you have tried every way to stop taking Diazepam or other benzos, nothing helps?
