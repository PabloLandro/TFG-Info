        Aloe Vera for Dental Health Aloe Vera: An Ancient 
          Plant for Modern Dentistry Bill Wolfe D.D.S., N.M.D. History In 1980 my dental laboratory technician suggested that Aloe Vera gel 
          might have some uses in dentistry. I was not even sure what Aloe Vera 
          was, so I decided to do some personal research. Through my readings, 
          I discovered that the Aloe Vera plant had many medicinal uses dating 
          back to pre-Christian times, and was even referred to in the Bible, 
          as well as in many technical and professional journals over the past 
          few decades. I learned that the Aloe Vera plant is remarkable because it is one 
          of the most durable plants known to mankind. The plant has a miraculous 
          ability to self-seal and self-heal, and contains all the nutrients within 
          its leaf in order to survive. When the leaf is damaged, the plant seals 
          the wound and regenerates in accelerated time. Also, it thrives in an 
          arid environment and can withstand extreme heat and physical abuse. 
          Ancient Hebrew tribes used to uproot their aloe plants when they migrated, 
          replant them upon arriving at their destination, and the plants would 
          flourish again. With such a prestigious history, I wondered why I had 
          not heard about Aloe Vera before. There are basically two reasons why 
          the use of Aloe Vera for medicinal purposes was not widespread. Although the plant is one of the most durable plants in the world, 
          it is a succulent, and cannot survive extreme cold, damp, freezing climates. 
          Therefore, knowledge of Aloe Vera did not spread into Northern Europe 
          or Great Britain, where there are profound freezing winters. In these 
          areas of the world, familiarity with the plant and its uses is still 
          limited. The second reason tor its limited usage was due to the inadequacy of 
          Aloe Vera gel as a commercially viable product, because of it's "perishability." 
          When a leaf is harvested, it is dissected to gain access to its gel. 
          Exposure to air causes Aloe Vera to oxidize, and its potency is only 
          maintained for about 48 hours at room temperature. Beyond this time, 
          the plant can become contaminated, which often led to disappointing 
          results on the part of people who were unaware of the shelf-life problem 
          of the gel. A resurgence of interest in the healing capabilities of the Aloe Vera 
          plant developed in the 1950's. Through the work of Drs. Collins, Wright, 
          and Crewe with radiation burns, the Aloe Vera plant assumed a degree 
          of medical credibility. In 1959 the FDA concluded from studies conducted 
          by the Atomic Energy Commission at the radiation burn center at Los 
          Alamos Laboratories in New Mexico that aloe gel did have a healing effect 
          on skin tissue. Further studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
          plant's gel, but perishability was still a problem. I was particularly interested in studies from Russia in 1976 reporting 
          success in treating periodontal (gum and bone) disease with Aloe Vera, 
          and the 1979 studies performed at the University of Chicago Burn Center. 
          Then I ran across the name of Dr. Eugene Zimmerman. Dr. Zimmerman had 
          been my oral pathology professor at Baylor College of Dentistry, and 
          unknown to me, was conducting research on Aloe Vera and its properties 
          at the same time I was attending dental school there in 1969. I telephoned Dr. Zimmerman and asked him about his past Aloe Vera research. 
          He expressed his positive feelings about the healing potential of the 
          plant's gel for dentistry, especially since a "stabilization" 
          process had been developed to preserve the Aloe Vera gel. The gel was 
          now a viable commercial entity, with the ability to maintain its potency 
          for years. However, Dr. Zimmerman felt that more research was required 
          in order to substantiate its dental uses. I was now really curious. After using the gel on various conditions with my dental patients, 
          I phoned Dr. Zimmerman once again to tell him of our experiences, and 
          asked him if he would be willing to perform any further dental research 
          with the gel. His positive answer gave me the motivation and commitment 
          to fund a grant to Baylor College of Dentistry to further investigate 
          Aloe Vera and its oral health benefits. The following presentation is 
          a synopsis of the results of research performed at Baylor (to A.O.A.C. 
          standards) under the guidance or Dr. Zimmerman. Bactericidal studies Various percentages of Aloe Vera gels were tested in culture media consisting 
          of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, 
          Candida albicans, Corynebacterium xerosis, and the five strains of Streptococcus 
          mutans most commonly found in dental plaque. The gel was bactericidal 
          against the above bacteria and fungicidal against Candida albicans (the 
          cause of moniliasis or 'denture sore mouth.') An important finding by 
          Zimmerman was that the dramatic effects of the aloe gel were not apparent 
          until there was at least a 70% concentration of the gel. To achieve 
          a 70% or greater concentration, an Aloe Vera gel must be stabilized 
          with anti-oxidants in order to minimize the otherwise necessary preservatives 
          which lessen the percentages of Aloe Vera in the product. Virucidal studies The Aloe Vera gel formula was found to be virucidal against Herpes simplex 
          and Herpes zoster viruses. Anti-inflammatory studies Prednisolone and Indomethacin (common anti-inflammatory drugs) were 
          utilized in a comparative study with the Aloe Vera gel to observe the 
          effects on tissue culture cells. The gel was found to be just as effective 
          as Prednisolone and Indomethacin, without having the long term toxicity 
          of either drug. Cell cytotoxicity studies Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK cells) were utilized to determine 
          the effectiveness of aloe gel on cellular longevity. The cellular death 
          rate was found to be reduced by 2/3 when cultured with the aloe gel. 
          Note: It is important to acknowledge research by Dr. Wendell Winters, 
          Associate Professor of Microbiology at the University of Texas Health 
          Science Center, San Antonio, Texas. Dr. Winters found that although 
          Aloe Vera promoted the growth and healing of healthy human cells, the 
          gel did not have the unwanted effect of stimulating the growth of cancer 
          cells. Dr. Zimmerman's studies proved the Aloe Vera gel formula to be nontoxic, 
          bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal against a broad range of micro-organisms, 
          and a stimulator of cellular life-extension. This research and the clinical 
          effects which I had witnessed in my office resulted in a commitment 
          on my part to discover the uses of the aloe gel in all aspects of dental 
          health. Now that I had laboratory and clinical evidence of the effectiveness 
          and biocompatibility of my Aloe Vera formula, I felt that the next step 
          for oral health should be to develop an Aloe Vera-based toothpaste. Because a tooth paste or a tooth gel must include abrasives (of which 
          examples are listed below), a surface active agent (foaming agent), 
          a sweetener to counter the taste of the various ingredients (including 
          the pungent taste of aloe gel), and a breath freshener, I was concerned 
          about how much the healthful properties of the gel might be compromised 
          by being combined in such a formula. Relative Abrasiveness of Various 
          Compounds on Tooth Enamel Abrasive Surface

              (lowest index of abrasiveness) * Abrasive used in the Aloe Vera toothpaste formulation The bactericidal effects on dental plaque are a primary concern in evaluation 
          and measuring the effectiveness of a toothpaste. Such bactericidal potency 
          can be measured in the laboratory by means of a 'sensitivity disc' method 
          of analysis. This method utilizes agar plates ("Petri" dishes) 
          upon which are grown bacterial cultures of the various micro-organisms 
          to be tested. The next project tested the Aloe Dent toothpaste formula 
          against the various bacterial components of dental plaque (LM-7, BHT, 
          AHT, 6715, and GS-5 strains of Streptococcus mutans bacteria.) After 
          two hours of incubation, sterile paper discs were placed on the inoculated 
          dishes. On each disc 0.3 grams of sample toothpaste was used in each 
          experiment. Each dish was examined after 24 and 48 hours to detect zones of clearing 
          for inhibition (kill) of the Streptococcus mutans bacteria. The measurement 
          from the edge of the disc to the end of the clear zone surrounding the 
          disc indicates the depth of 'kill' of the bacteria, i.e., the larger 
          the number of millimeters, the more potent the bactericidal effects. 
          The chart below demonstrates the results after 48 hours of bactericidal 
          analysis, comparing the Aloe Vera toothpaste formula to two popular 
          brands of flourided toothpaste. Streptococcus Mutans Bacteria Strain Numbers Aloe 
              Vera toothpaste Brand

          toothpaste against the 5 strains of Streptococcus mutans bacteria in 
          dental plaque. The fact that the Aloe Vera toothpaste™ range was 
          greater than that of either Brand 1 or Brand 2 is very noteworthy, as 
          the bactericidal results from the Brand 1 or Brand 2 testing are due 
          to fluoride. Aloe Vera toothpaste was able to achieve equal or better 
          results without the addition of fluoride, which is controversial due 
          to its wide range of potentially harmful systemic effects. Conclusion The previous research is only a partial indication of the potential 
          benefits which Aloe Vera can provide for dentistry. I encourage health 
          professionals to investigate, experiment, and conclude for themselves 
          as to the effectiveness, new uses, and exciting future which Aloe Vera 
          has in dentistry. References 1) Kent CM. Aloe Vera. Arlington VA. 1979:14. 2) Goats BC. The Silent Healer: A Modern Study of Aloe Vera. Garland,
