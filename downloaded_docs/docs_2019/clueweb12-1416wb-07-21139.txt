Many treatments can relieve these issues.  Most of these treatments are very easy and non-invasive, but surgery may be required in instances where the spinal column or cord has been damaged. By far the most common way that sciatica pain is treated is with pain killers.  These sorts of drugs are non-steroid, anti-inflammatory muscle relaxers. Opiate-based painkillers are used for the more severe cases only, because of their high risk of addiction and other side effects. Health care providers also recommend regular daily exercise to reduce sciatica pain.  Stretching and strengthening the back and leg muscles associated with sciatica will ease the pressure on the sciatic nerve.  However the best treatment for sciatica pain is to change some habits within your lifestyle to prevent, or relieve sciatica symptoms. If you can change your posture, you will ease sciatica pain and back injuries.  Bad posture may be putting a lot of extra strain on your spine, disks, muscles, ligaments, joints, and nerves.  When you are sitting, make sure that you are not slouching.  You should not be leaning too far back, or sitting too straight.  You also should not have your head too far forward.  Your head weighs about 15 pounds (7Kgs).  If it is not properly supported by your neck muscles, you are creating an excessive amount of strain on your back muscles, ligaments, disks, and spine. It is very important to have good back support too.  Make sure that you use a chair that gives your back support.  Be sure that you are not sitting for too long, take a break every thirty to sixty minutes. Check how you are standing.  Do you stand and push your pelvis forward or backward?  Do you let your shoulders hang forward?  The way that you stand can also impinge on your sciatic nerve.  If you want to avoid common sciatica symptoms , try to avoid standing for long periods of time.  Ensure that you are standing up straight and keep your feet slightly apart.  If you don not know if you are standing straight, check the position of your shoulders.  Are they in alignment with your ears?  Is your chin parallel to the ground?  If not, that tells you that you’re not standing straight. Posture also matters when you are sleeping, too.  It is awful for your back to lie down with a stack of pillows propping you up, or to sleep lying on your stomach.  You will be able to keep your spine in proper alignment by placing a pillow under your knees, to keep them slightly elevated when you are lying on your back. Place a pillow between your knees when you are sleeping on your side.  You should also always use your pillow to keep your head straight, not allowing it to sag, or to tilt your head too far up.  And your pillow should be giving your neck support while you sleep on your back. Suitable exercise is also an extremely important part of your sciatica treatment.  Strengthen your stomach, back and leg muscles to avoid them pressing on your sciatic nerve. That way, you can alleviate or avoid sciatica problems altogether.

Most sciatica cases do not require a radical form of treatment, such as surgery.  Many cases of sciatica are treated with pain killers.  In mild cases, ibuprofen, aspirin, or other over-the-counter medication will reduce the sufferer’s pain. Some sciatica sufferers are also prescribed non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce symptoms and pain that comes with sciatica and the lower back in general.  If the pain does not subside, stronger pain killers such as codeine can be prescribed, but medications such as this come with the risk of addiction and side effects and therefore should not be taken lightly. Muscle relaxers should definitely not be taken lightly.  They will provide some pain relief for sciatica pain, but they can also make the user drowsy, putting them at risk when driving, or operating any heavy machinery.   They can also reduce your capacity to work, as you are too sleepy to concentrate and risk dozing off. Exercise is undoubtedly the best way to reduce sciatica symptoms in the long run.  With an appropriate exercise regime , you will be able to train your muscles to become relaxed, flexible and strong and as a result reduce the amount that these muscles are pressing on the sciatic nerve that runs through them. If all other options have failed, a health care provider might offer you the option to perform spinal surgery.  When herniated discs are the cause of sciatica pain, your doctor might recommend doing a microdisectomy.  This is a procedure to physically remove what is pressing on the sciatic nerve. Occasionally sciatica pain and other symptoms result from a condition known as spinal stenosis.  This condition causes nerve compression and can be reduced with a surgical procedure called a lumbar laminectomy.  A lumbar laminectomy involves giving more space to the nerve bundles in the spinal column by removing bones from the vertebra. One of the oldest surgical measures to alleviate back pain is called a diskectomy.  This procedure involves removing the disc that is causing the problem, or that is diseased, from the spine.  Once the disc has been removed, the pressure on the nerve is relieved and sciatica pain and other symptoms are reduced. One of the last resorts for sufferers with sciatica and back pain is to undergo a spinal fusion.  When a spinal fusion takes place, the doctor joins two or more vertebrae together in order to reduce irritation and compression.  But, this procedure is only done when the spine has endured years of physical injury, or if osteoporosis has set in.  The reason this option is left as a last resort is because once done, the patient is left with very reduced movement within the spine. Even though the advances in medicine have been great for sciatica sufferers, pain relief is different for everyone.  What might work for one person may not work for another. So, you should always seek medical advice when it comes to finding pain relief for sciatica pain.

These days, most sufferers find relief through exercise.  However it is most important to see your health care professional regarding which stretches and exercise routines will work best for you.  Also, your health care provider will be able to rule out any other severe problems that may be causing your symptoms. Stretching exercises that offer you relief of sciatica pain must target the muscles that cause the pain, because they are tight and inflexible.  The sciatic nerve runs through several muscles in the back and legs.  If these muscles are tight, they will compress the sciatic nerve, which causes you pain.  Your health care provider can also give you advice on an exercise routine that can be tailored to address the underlying cause of your sciatic pain, for example a lumbar herniated disc , or spinal stenosis. As well as an exercise routine, you should reduce daily stress on your lower back in order to avoid sciatica flare ups.  This should include using appropriate ergonomics while lifting, sitting and standing, always preserving good posture. Maintaining good posture relates to sitting, standing and lying down.  In order to preserve good posture while you are sitting, you should ensure that your lower back is supported.  Being able to lightly rest your back on the back of your chair when you are sitting will improve matters. You do not want to sit too straight, or lean too far back.  You should also improve your sitting posture by getting a footrest to raise your knees to the same level, or a little higher than your hips. Ensure that your head is not leaning too far forward in an attempt to see what you are working on.  Make sure that your reading material is at a position and height where you can read it easily without bending forward or back.  You must also adjust the height of your computer screen, so that you can look at it straight on, not angled and not too low, again without bending forward or back. To retain a healthy back, you also should avoid sitting, or standing for long periods of time.  Take frequent breaks from prolonged sitting, every thirty to sixty minutes.  If you need to stand for long periods of time, you should periodically shift your weight from one foot to the other, and if you can, keep the resting foot a little raised on a box, or a curb. If you can, avoid lying on your stomach while you sleep.  This position puts needless strain on your muscles, ligaments, and disks.  If you absolutely can not sleep without lying on your stomach, experiment with putting a pillow under your hips to keep your spine aligned. When sciatica tribulations are a part of your life, it is vital to find permanent relief from your pain by taking the actions that will care for your lower back every day and give you relief of sciatica pain.

Even though it is always best to see your doctor first when you experience sciatica pain, or other symptoms, it is not always obligatory to fill your body with chemicals such as pain killers.  As well as everyday life changes such as exercise, you can experiment with a variety of natural choices to reduce or even eliminate sciatica symptoms. Get your free Symptoms and Relief of Sciatica Mini-Course Here Sciatica Relief Information Sciatica is an all too common condition where pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness originates from the lower back. It travels down through the buttocks, and then down the back of the leg, or hamstring.  Many people who experience sciatica pain and symptoms get better within a few weeks or months and sometimes days, with simple non-surgical treatments.  But others feel symptoms and pain so intense that they are debilitated and unable to perform their daily activities. Sciatica sufferers unfortunately experience a wide range of symptoms.  The sciatic nerve runs through several muscles from the lower back and into the leg, causing a wide range of potential symptoms.  You may notice that you have pain on one side of your buttock or in one leg that is worse when sitting, or standing for long periods.  The sciatic nerve divides in two and runs down each leg at the tail bone, therefore symptoms are not always mirrored on both sides of the body.  Some sufferers feel a burning or tingling down one or both legs.  There can also be weakness, numbness, or difficulty moving a leg or foot.  Symptoms might also be as severe as sensing a constant pain on one side of the rear, or a sharp pain that may make it hard to stand up or walk. The term sciatica is not really a medical diagnosis.  It is a symptom of a basic problem in the lower back.  It could be a herniated disc, or spinal stenosis that is pressing on or irritating the sciatic nerve roots.  It is most important to understand the underlying diagnosis, rather than just dealing with the symptoms of sciatica, because the real cause of the symptoms will need to be treated in order to relieve sciatic nerve pain permantly. Even though sciatica most often occurs in people between the ages of thirty and fifty, it is often unrelated to a particular event or injury.  The sciatic pain tends to develop over time as a result of general wear and tear on the structures of the lower spine.  The clinical diagnosis of sciatica is usually referred to as a “radiculopathy.”  This simply means that a disc within the spine has protruded from its normal position in the vertebral column.  As a result of this, it is putting pressure on the nerve root (radicular nerve) in the lower back, which forms part of the sciatic nerve. Symptoms are most frequently reduced by exercising, to strengthen muscles within the back, abdomen and legs.  An easy way to do this is by regular walking.  Begin by walking slowly but surely and progress to walking up to three miles (2Kms) a day at a vigorous pace.  It is great for your lower back and is a pretty low-impact exercise that can provide strength and flexibility to muscles, and ultimately relieve sciatica pain.  Aerobic exercise is another great way to relieve your sciatica symptoms and pain.  It strengthens the muscles related to sciatica pain, plus it is great for overall body fitness . But watch out for any heavy impact, as this could make matters worse. The most important thing that you can do for sciatica relief is to seek the advice of a medical professional.  Your health professional will be able to give you the correct diagnosis for your pain and rule out any more serious problems.  The suitable treatments differ based on the condition that is causing the sciatic pain, so you should not try to self-treat your sciatica without consulting a health professional.
