Posted in Acupuncture on 03/25/2009 10:18 pm by JeanPaul Double Lutz asked: I’m wondering if anyone else has tried acupuncture for injuries?  I cracked my knee cap as a part of my figure skating routine, and acupuncture brought the swelling down really quickly (my orthopaedic doctor said it would be swollen for a long time).  It also helped with a torn quad muscle that wouldn’t heal properly and that I kept re-injuring.  Acupuncture got it healed up quite quickly. I found the treatments to be really relaxing and without any discomfort at all.Any good or bad experiences/views about acupuncture?
