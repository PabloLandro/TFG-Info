                                      REVIEWS: 1) I looked online for a while to find a back brace that would give  me both the support and flexibility that I needed. This brace supports the very  lower back from the small of your back up to just below the middle (at least on  me). The brace fits right against your skin, so you can wear it under your  clothes and it has adjustable velcro sides so it can be made to fit just about  anyone. This brace really helps when I have to stand for long periods of time. 2) Good quality and effective when you play sports with it. I've had no back   injuries since I started using it. Its works by holding in heat and keeping the   muscles warm and through physically providing support. | Home | The Swede-O Story | Products | Hablo Espanol | HCPCS Information | Injuries/Ailments | Instructions | | Medical Professionals | Sizing Guide | Where to Purchase | Contact Us | Copyright © 2010
