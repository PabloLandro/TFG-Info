Not all honey is created equal, according to a manufacturer of skin care products. Honeymark International has a product line containing a unique type of honey called “Manuka Honey” which is derived from particular floral source found in New Zealand. This natural ingredient is now being viewed as a miracle substance, considering the fact that it is being used to successfully treat conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, infected wounds, pain, ringworm, athlete’s foot, etc. Manuka Honey has gained its well-deserved notoriety in Europe and is quickly becoming a household name in the U.S. With consumers having easy access to the Internet, they are scouring the web for answers and more viable alternatives to their health conditions. For example, WebMD.com, a very popular website for individuals to obtain information about medical conditions receives over 1 million hits per day. Among the most requested ailments are questions about Staph infections and MRSA. In addition to the fact that some of these infections are considered life-threatening, antibiotics just aren’t working on them any more. However, the microorganisms associated with these infections have not been able to develop a resistance against Manuka Honey, making it one of the only options available. Patients suffering from eczema their entire lives are finding that products containing Manuka Honey are actually working when all other products have failed. Manuka Honey is not only capable of eliminating the dry blotches associated with dermatitis but it actually heals damaged skin and regenerates new skin growth. Even psoriasis that has been virtually untreatable up until now is having a hard time resisting the powerful healing properties of Manuka Honey. Manuka Honey gets its healing power from strong antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. All types of honey contain hydrogen peroxide, a known antiseptic. However, Manuka Honey has additional properties that provide more potency to its effectiveness. Unlike standard honey, Manuka Honey is not affected by heat or light. It also remains stable when diluted as will happen when applied to the skin. Consumers also find comfort in knowing that Manuka Honey is an all-natural, organic ingredient that has been found to have no negative side effects when used for medical purposes. Bacteria is the cause of many skin irritations as well as malodor. Because Manuka Honey’s main claim to fame is destroying bacteria, it has become quite a commodity. Manuka Honey destroys bacteria by drawing water out of the microbes, making it impossible for them to survive. This is different than the way antibiotics destroy bacteria. Since bacteria have the ability to mutate and become resistant to elements that are attempting to destroy them, we are slowly starting to see antibiotics become less effective. There have been no reports have any kind of bacteria being resistant to Manuka Honey which means that this natural resource may be finding a permanent place in the world of modern medicine. As if all of this wasn’t impressive enough, Manuka Honey has also been known to have anti-inflammatory properties, making it possible to relieve pain. Products are now being developed to treat arthritis as well as other types of muscle and joint pain. “Manuka Honey has natural antibacterial, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties, making it an extremely valuable substance,” says Frank Buonanotte, CEO of Honeymark International. “In all of my years in the health care industry, I haven’t seen any one substance be more effective in treating such a wide variety of symptoms so efficiently and without side effects. This is why Manuka Honey is now gaining a competitive edge over pharmaceuticals and other traditional forms of medicine.” buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in clean , cleocin-t gel , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , elidel , gris-peg , honey , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , nizoral , nummular , penlac , pharmacy , protopic , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , sumycin , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » Acne Skin Care Basics Saturday, June 28th, 2008 When you have an acne outbreak, do you know how to take care of your skin? Unknowingly, many people tend to use acne skin care methods that aggravate their present condition further. Take for example the notion that a patient must seriously scrub his face to take away dirt. Is this the correct way for acne skin care? Not quite. Here is the scoop. First, it is important to understand the cause of acne before knowing what acne skin care measures to use. Acne is neither a direct result of dirt or uncleanness. However, your acne problems worsen when dirt mixes with sebum and other skin debris to create a mixture which may settle in the pus of the pustules. Medically speaking, acne is caused by many internal body factors such as a weak immune and digestive system, impaired internal detoxification system, and stress. Outside influences like weather elements, pollutants, humidity and the bacteria thriving on the human skin contribute to aggravate your acne. Ultimately, all these factors may not have effectively produced acne if it were not for the “Propionibacterium acnes”, which digest excess sebum. The effect results in inflammation, swelling and pain. It is not easy to pin point the cause of acne on your own. It is best to solicit the help of a dermatologist to help you determine the cause of your acne and to recommend an appropriate acne treatment. Notwithstanding, there are a couple of tips on proper acne skin care that you should be aware of. The first step to good acne skin care is to minimize the sebum production to a level to sustain normal skin. However, in most cases, to treat acne, more needs to be done. If skin oiliness persist, it is best to keep the pores open. The principle behind this acne care is to release the clogs in the pores and wash them out. The only way to achieve this is to wash the face with extremely hot water. Repeat this procedure to help repel skin bacteria. It is also recommended that you do not zealously wash your face with harsh scrubs or cleansers. By doing this, you may only aggravate the severity of your acne. Actually, washing your face gently two times a day is enough. In terms of acne skin care products, choose the ones that work best best for you. Select the acne care product that gently clears away the oil and dirt without leaving your skin dry and irritated. In fact, ,mild acne care works best for all skin types. This will require some trials and consequently, some errors. It is best to trust your dermatologist recommendation first. If his recommended product does not work, then shift to other acne skin care products. This way, you are experimenting with acne care products that may suit you best. It is important to note that during your first applications, use small amounts on a small area so that any damage is at best limited. Also, avoid alcohol-based cleansers as these may only dry out your skin. Dry skin is more vulnerable to serious acne outbreaks. On the other hand, minimize the use of oil-based products as these in themselves may add up to the pre-existing oil content of the skin. At any rate, an acne patient must avoid applying cosmetics, however oil-free they may appear to be. Proper acne skin care methods can go a long way to help you in your acne problems. Good diet and lifestyle habits are other measures that you can also adopt for better glowing skin. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in acne , bacteria , causes , clean , cleocin-t gel , cream , diet , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , elidel , gris-peg , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , nonprescription , nummular , penlac , pharmacy , pimple , prevent , protopic , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , stress , symptoms , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » Suffering From Acne?

Anti aging skin care therefore has always been a main product for the beauty and cosmetics products manufacturers. Even long ago, Cleopatra, Queen Victoria and many other famous women and others throughout time and the world sought to remain young. But still, the fountain of youth is far beyond our reach… However, there is one product that can be considered the ultimate anti aging skin care product. A deep cleansing treatment can be done every five weeks and this is highly suited for those with oily skin. The skin gets nourished in using masks containing evening prime rose and rosemary leaf oil. The skin around the eyes is the most prone to premature aging, showing signs of stress with wrinkles, crows feet and sagging. Rapid weight loss can also cause wrinkles by reducing the volume of fat cells that cushion the face. Relax; a tense face encourages the formation of wrinkles, especially around the outer eyes, bridge of nose, and on the forehead. By the age of 20 early signs of damage and wrinkles in skin are visible. Protecting your skin from exposure to ultraviolet radiation is the most significant thing you can do to prevent wrinkles, sagging, and discoloration. UV light creates free radicals, which induce lipids per oxidation, which leads to skin damage, wrinkles and skin cancer. Your skin’s texture will become visibly less smooth and you will most likely begin to see age spots. You’ll appreciate the early care you’ve given to your skin because the signs of aging will be minimal, however, if you haven’t started early you’ll clearly notice the effects of neglect. While it’s never too late to take care of your skin the damage you already have will be difficult to reduce without special medical treatments such as botox or perhaps surgical procedures. All the above should continue to be applied but it is wise to consult your physician on advanced treatments. For teens, their skin changes very frequently. It may be oily, dry or a combination, making it hard to concentrate on just one type of natural skin care products. Teens have a lot of trouble finding the right solution for their skin and because of that they waste a lot of money each year finding the right skin care that works best on their skin.Girls wear makeup and that can clog pores and leave their skin looking shiny from the oil. Boys have the same problem with their pores becoming clogged and the shine that may form on their skin after each day. Natural skin care products help teens as well.
