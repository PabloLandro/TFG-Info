Nutrients also see Nutritional Glossary Guide entry for: Overview Boron Calcium Chromium Copper Iodine Iron Magnesium Manganese Molybdenum Phosphorus Potassium Selenium Silica Zinc Trace Minerals Mineral Overview As important as vitamins are, they can do nothing for you without minerals. Vitamins cannot be assimilated without the aid of minerals. Although the body can manufacture a few vitamins, it cannot manufacture a single mineral. All tissue and internal fluids contain varying quantities of minerals. Minerals are constituents of the bones, teeth, soft tissue, muscle, blood, and nerve cells. They are vital to overall mental and physical well-being. HOW THEY WORK: Minerals act as catalysts for many biological reactions within the body, including, muscle response, the transmission of messages through the nervous system, and the utilization of nutrients in
food. See References . Reference Guide for: Vitamins MINERALS Amino Acids Herbs Special Nutrients Anti-Oxidants Dietary Fibers Nutritional Greens Digestive

Nutrients also see Nutritional Glossary Guide entry for: Overview Boron Calcium Chromium Copper Iodine Iron Magnesium Manganese Molybdenum Phosphorus Potassium Selenium Silica Zinc Trace Minerals CALCIUM IMPORTANCE: Builds strong bones and teeth; treats and prevents osteoporosis; important in the maintenance of a regular heartbeat and in the transmission of nerve impulses; lowers cholesterol levels and helps prevent cardiovascular disease; an effective treatment for PMS; recommended for attention deficit disorders, migraine headaches and periodontal disease; reduces the risk of colon cancer, by neutralizing the toxic effects of cancer promoting fats; reduces the formation of polyps; lowers blood pressure; prevents leg cramps, maintains bone density and strength; helps prevent insomnia and anxiety. A deficiency may lead to aching joints, brittle nails, eczema, elevated blood cholesterol, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, insomnia, muscle
cramps, nervousness, numbness in the arms and/or legs, rheumatoid arthritis, rickets, and tooth decay. A high protein diet, caffeine from coffee, carbonated beverages, alcohol, and antacids can diminish calcium levels in your body. Calcium Carbonate - An excellent form of calcium and the most common found in food supplements. It is refined and purified and contains no toxic metals, such as lead and aluminum. This form of calcium is a little harder to absorb if you have low stomach acid, therefore should be taken with meals to improve absorption. Calcium Citrate - Is calcium carbonate bound with Citrate Acid. It is easily absorbed regardless of the output of stomach acid. Calcium Aspartate - Is calcium carbonate bound with Aspartic Acid. It is easily absorbed regardless of the output of stomach acid. Calcium Lactate - Is calcium carbonate bound with Lactic Acid. It is easily absorbed regardless of the output of stomach acid. DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: May result in arm and leg muscles spasms, softening of bones, back and leg cramps, brittle bones, rickets, poor growth, osteoporosis ( a deterioration of the bones), tooth decay, depression.
