We prospectively evaluated the ability of aspirin resistance status, determined by PFA-100, to predict new thrombotic events in patients with stable ischemic cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: We studied 129 consecutive patients with stroke , transient ischemic attack (TIA) or vascular cognitive impairment. We assessed relationships between aspirin resistance, risk factors for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and occurrence of new thrombotic events (composite of stroke , TIA, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death). RESULTS: Aspirin resistance, found in 26 (20.1%) cases, was unrelated to any of the examined vascular risk factors. During mean follow-up of 56 months, new thrombotic events occurred in 19 patients (14.7%), four with aspirin resistance (15.4%) and 15 (14.6%) without aspirin resistance (p=1.00). CONCLUSION: Aspirin resistance determined by PFA-100 does not predict new thrombotic events in patients with stable ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
