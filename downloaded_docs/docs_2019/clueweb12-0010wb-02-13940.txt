Dental Amalgam and Alternate Restorative Materials: Trends DENTAL AMALGAM AND ALTERNATE
    RESTORATIVE MATERIALS Trends In the Use of Amalgam & Other Restorative Materials A critical factor in the formulation of national policy as it
relates to the use of health care products is the extent and frequency of use. Dental
amalgam and alternative restorative materials are no different. The 1993 USPHS report on
amalgam indicated that "[I]n 1990, over 200 million restorative procedures were
provided in the United States; of these, dental amalgam accounted for roughly 96 million,
a 38 percent reduction since 1979. This trend is expected to continue." This 4-year old prediction appears to be holding true. Although comprehensive data
on amalgam usage and reliance on other substitute materials is not readily available,
limited survey and anecdotal information tends to support the thesis that amalgam use
continued to decline. One source of information is a quarterly survey performed by the
American Dental Association of 1250 member dentists, divided into two groups: "all
dentists" (i.e., general practitioners and specialists combined) and "general
practitioners." (Source: American Dental Association, Survey Center, 4th Quarter 1990
through 3rd Quarter 1995 - Quarterly Survey of Dental Practice . One area of inquiry among the 22 dental procedures about which clinical practice
information is solicited is restorations of posterior teeth, which are more routinely
treated with dental amalgam. Data from this survey show "a slow downward trend from
[the] fourth quarter [of] 1990 until [the] third quarter [of] 1995." Since the first
quarter [of] 1993, the trend has been essentially stable. In numerical terms, the data
show the following: For "all dentists," the mean number of posterior restorations performed in a
    typical week was 19.51 for the fourth quarter of 1990, compared to 17.08 in the third
    quarter of 1995. For "general practitioners," the mean number of posterior restorations was
    23.11 in the fourth quarter of 1990, compared to 19.76 in the third quarter of 1995. Another indicator of a continuing downward trend in the use of dental amalgam and other
restorative materials is an article published in the February 1997 edition of the Journal
of the American Dental Association. Based on a survey of 750,000 residents of Michigan
covered by dental insurance, the article by Dr. Stephen Ecklund, et. al. reported
"Â… profound improvements in oral health. These improvements are evident in all
age groups, and the effect of the caries decline in children that began about 20 years ago
has moved well into the adult population. As those born since about 1950 continue to age
and represent an ever-increasing pro-portion of the population, the overall need for
restorative care of all types will continue to diminish." These trends are consonant with anecdotal information shared at dental professional
meetings which Working Group members have attended. Of special note are comments made by
pediatric dentists indicating a move away from amalgam in favor of resin (plastic),
tooth-colored materials that are bonded to the tooth, may release fluoride and are mercury
free. Moreover, a greater number of dental practitioners are relying on dental sealants as
a preventative measure to thwart the onset of dental caries. Indeed, data from the USPHS
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study bears out this
information. A paper prepared by the NIDR and entitled "The Prevalence of Dental
Sealants In the U.S. Population: Findings From NHANES III, 1988-91" reported the
following: A national survey of oral health in children, for the period 1986-1987, showed that
    7.6 percent of children had received sealant treatments. According to the NHANES III-Phase 1, which covered the time period 1988-1991, the
    prevalence of sealant use rose to 18.5 percent in children aged 5-17 years (i.e., one or more
    teeth treated with sealants), with molar teeth most frequently treated. The rising use of sealants, combined with community fluoridation, an ever-growing
selection of fluoride-containing dental products, improved oral hygiene practices on the
part of the general public and greater access to dental care are the major reasons why
amalgam use is declining. It is planned for trends in dental restorative procedures to
continue to be monitored using the NHANES IV survey, which will begin in 1998 and include
queries on dental caries rates, types of restorative materials used and the tooth surfaces
that are treated with amalgam and its alternatives.
