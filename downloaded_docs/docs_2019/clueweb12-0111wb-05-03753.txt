We use a whole leaf aloe vera, certified organic, both in liquid form and as a concentrated powder, that are produced by the “orchestra concept” method—that is, each step in production has an equally important role. Both liquid and powder whole leaf aloe capture the rich mucilage material under the rind which contains over 200 biologically active constituents. A few of the rich components are vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and glycoproteins. Notably, there are 10,000 - 13,000 milligrams per liter of mucopolysaccharides, which are classified as complex carbohydrates. There are so many benefits of whole leaf aloe vera that we will only highlight them here, with many cross- referencing with each other: Aloe vera has been called the first aid plant. Topically used, it is very helpful with wounds, cuts, scrapes, and burns—whether it be sunburn or heat burn, providing in addition soothing pain relief. It penetrates the skin by rehydration, increasing soluability, allowing wound healing components to be absorbed. It encourages general cell growth as well as collagen production, therefore helps to accelerate wound healing. Aloe vera is also used by hospitals for the internal wounds suffered by soldiers in the battlefield. It has a dental application both in temporary infection prevention and cleaning maintenance. Aloe vera is antipathogenic, having antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiamoebic properties, so therefore aids against a whole multitude of infectious diseases. Countless topical skin, facial, and hair formulas contain aloe vera. With the use of whole leaf aloe vera, the immune system, aided by the liver, increases macrophage activiity, which engulfs and destroys infected and damaged cells and foreign proteins. Aloe vera therefore aids in fighting inflammation, stimulating new, healthy cell growth. It has an immunomodulating effect on the immune system, meaning, it helps the immune system in responding appropriately to changing internal conditions. Aloe contains cinnamic acid, a proteolytic enzyme that helps in the digestion of foreign protein and undigested food traveling in the bloodstream. This, then, helps alleviate extra stress on the immune system by taking away toxic burden on the liver. It benefits gastrointestinal conditions by decreasing the permeability of intestinal membranes so that waste material does not leak out, but nutrients can be absorbed properly. Aloe also helps the liver in the reduction of cholesterol concentrations, and is beneficial in regulating lipid peroxidation. It benefits the heart and circulatory system via its metabolic free radical scavenging activity. Aloe helps regulate blood sugar by relieving oxidative stress, and lowering blood sugar levels, so is beneficial for diabetic conditions. Its enzymatic benefits also include increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase, two antioxidant enzyme nutrients. Aloe also increases the bioavailability of vitamins C & E. >From growing to bottling, it is important that the processing of whole leaf aloe vera preserve the potency of all the 200 plus active components that make it unique. We use whole leaf aloe vera in our Liquid Life Day and Land & Sea formulas. Whole leaf powder we use in Inflazyme and Supremely Green, and in the mineral co-factors for our probiotic Friendly Colonizer.
