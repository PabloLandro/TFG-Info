Posted by Evan Labels: crohn's disease , Crohn's Disease Diet , probiotics Suggested Approach to Crohn's Disease Diet Inflammatory Bowel Disease IBD, including Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis, is an inflammation of the intestines. These diseases cause the intestines to form ulcers and become inflamed, scarred and easy to bleed. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, acute abdominal pain, cramping, fever and fatigue. A special diet is very important in exercising IBD management to prevent malnutrition and extreme weight loss. Nutritional Diet for Crohn's Disease & Colitis Drink lots of fluid (8 - 10 servings daily) to keep body hydrated and prevent constipation Your doctor or your registered dietitian may recommend a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement to replace lost nutrients Eat a high fiber diet when IBD is under control. Follow here for a list of high fiber foods. Some patients find cooking and steaming the vegetables more tolerable than eating them raw During a flare up, however, limit high fiber foods and follow a low fiber diet or even a low residue diet to give the bowel a rest and minimize symptoms. Avoid lactose-containing foods such as dairy if you are lactose intolerant. Otherwise, you may use lactase enzymes and lactase pretreated foods. It is very important to continue nourishing your body even during a flare-up. Try small frequent meals. Eating a high protein diet with lean meats, fish and eggs, may help relieve symptoms of IBD. Your registered dietitian may recommend pre-digested nutritional drinks (elemental diet) to give your bowel a rest and replenish lost nutrients so that your body can repair itself Limit caffeine, alcohol and sorbitol (a type of sweetener) as these may exacerbate IBD symptoms. Limit gas-producing foods such as cabbage-family vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and brussels sprouts), dried peas and lentils, onions and chives, peppers and carbonated drinks Reduce fat intake if part of the intestines has been surgically removed. High fat foods usually cause diarrhea and gas for this group of patients. If the ileum (part of the small intestines) has been resected, a Vitamin B12 injection may be required. Some studies found that fish oil and flax seed oil may be helpful in managing IBD. Some also suggested the role of prebiotics such as psyllium in the healing process. Furthermore, probiotics (live culture) may also be helpful in aiding recovery of the intestines. comments 0 Responses to "Crohn's Diet & Nutritional Supplements" Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) Enews & Updates Sign up to receive breaking news as well as receive other site updates!
