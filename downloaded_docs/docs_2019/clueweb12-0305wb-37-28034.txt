Home Remedies Muscle Relaxants to Treat Pain and Inflamation Muscules » Soma and Lower Back Pain Medicines Lower Back Pain Medicines Soma and Tramadol are muscle relaxants that belong to the wide range of medicines that function differently, though in the end they have the same effect. Patients who present with lower back pain can choose from many different remedies, including muscle relaxant drugs. About 42% of visits to physicians in a year are because of lower back pain, the most common complaint during consultations. One of the most commonly prescribed remedies is muscle relaxants. When it comes to acute lower back pain, muscle relaxants aid in improving the problem by reducing pain signals, relieving tension of the muscles, and improving mobility. Studies have consistently shown them to work better than placebos. The primary benefit of these medications is pain relief; most doctors will cite this as the first and foremost step to improve patients’ conditions. Some side effects, however, are nevertheless prone to appear. Many factors contribute to thee effects, which are of various likelihoods, frequencies, and strengths. A category of pain medications called antspasmodics are utilized to reduce muscle spasms that are frequently linked to conditions that cause back pain . There are two major types of antispasmodic: benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines are widely sedative types of medications, with anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants being among them, this is aside from skeletal muscle relaxants. The other type works on the spinal cord through methods that are not yet fully understood by scientists. Two of these, Carisoprodol and metaxalone, are moderate antispasmodics as well as mild sedatives. Carisoprodol works by stopping activity between the neurons of one’s spinal cord and brain. Carisoprodol metabolizes into the anti-anxiety agent meprobamate, which relieves the muscle spasms that often accompany anxiety attacks.
