 medicines may be required to treat the underlying problem. 
 Cough suppressants are used to prevent a dry cough and should 
 only be used if there is no mucous present. Expectorants are 
 used to treat a productive cough, causing the person to "expectorate" 
 or cough-up the secretions. When deciding on a cough treatment, 
 it should always be clearly ascertained if it is a dry or 
 a productive cough that is being treated. Suppressing a productive 
 cough will result in secretions remaining within the chest, 
 which become a medium for further viral or bacterial growth 
 and just worsen the problem. While mistakenly using an expectorant 
 to treat a dry cough, could just make the user cough even 
 more. Traditionally codeine has been widely used to treat 
dry cough and it is effective in the suppression of cough. It is available in 
linctus form or as an ingredient in BENYLIN WITH CODEINE ™ 
and DIMOTANE CO™ . However it is constipating and 
can cause dependence and drowsiness.Newer agents such as 
Dextromethorphan and pholcodine are effective cough suppressants and have fewer 
side-effects. Dextromethorphan , which does 
 not cause drowsiness, is often recommended as a cough suppressant. 
 Available in a sugar-free formulation as ROBTUSSIN DRY COUGH ™ and as BENYLIN 
 NON-DROWSY FOR DRY COUGHS ,™ the usual adult dose 
 is two 5ml spoonfuls up to four times daily. DELSYM ™ 
 is a sustained release formulation of dextromethorphan, which 
 is administered to adults and children over 2 years twice 
 daily. Pholcodine ( EXPULIN 
 DRY™, PHOLCOLIN™, EXPULIN PAEDIATRIC ™, 
 which also contains an anti-histamine) is also an effective 
 cough suppressant, but can, in some cases, cause drowsiness. 
 Children from one year upwards can take PHOLCOLIN™ and EXPULIN PAEDIATRIC™ . Post nasal drip can be treated with a combination of a cough 
 suppressant and a decongestant, such as ACTIFED 
 CO LINCTUS™ , which also contains an anti-histamine. 
 This product can cause drowsiness which may induce a better 
 nights sleep. The use of an antihistamine alone in the treatment 
 of dry cough is no longer considered to be effective and thus 
 dextromethorphan, codeine and pholcodine are often formulated 
 with an antihistamine ( DIMOTANE CO™, 
 BENYLIN DRY COUGH™, EXPULIN PAEDIATRIC™ ). 
 In practice the anti-histamine serves, to cause drowsiness 
 which can be useful at night, when the dry cough can prevent 
 the sufferer from getting to sleep. Cough suppressants should not be taken continuously and if 
 the cough persists, your doctor should be consulted. Cough 
 suppressants should only be used by asthmatics on their doctors 
 advice. In addition to cough suppressants, dry coughs can be treated with demulcents, 
which contain soothing substances such as syrup or glycerol to soothe the irritated 
airways. VENOS HONEY AND LEMON™ , or GLYCERINE, 
HONEY AND LEMON . These can be taken by both adults and children. references More Related Health Tips >> Health Tip Group > Smoking Health Tip Name Full Details Dry Coughs more > Breast Cancer in Ireland: An overview more > Quitting Smoking more > Smoking more > Chesty Cough more > Health Tip Group > Child Health Tip Name Full Details Colds more > Measuring Temperature more > Chesty Cough more > Sticky Eyes more > Dry Coughs more > BCG Vaccines more > Head Lice more > Coughs more > Diarrhoea more > Baby High Temperatures more > Sunburn more > Health Tip Group > General Health Health Tip Name Full Details Colds more > Cold Sores more > Cystitis more > Diarrhoea more > Dry Coughs more > Head Lice more > Motion Sickness more > Sore Throats more > Chesty Cough more > Health Tip Group > Coughs & Colds Health Tip Name Full Details Chesty Cough more > Colds more > Coughs more > Dry Coughs more > Sore Throats more > Flu Vaccination more > :: Home :: Sports :: Health Tips :: Health             Monitor :: Register :: Stores :: Sitemap :: Contact             Us :: :: About Us :: Press :: Disclaimer :: Eirpharm was last updated on                   the                   2011-12-31 Copyright © 2000 - 2012 eirpharm.com .
