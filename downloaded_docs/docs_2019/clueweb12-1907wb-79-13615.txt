Controlling gestational diabetes can not be possible with some women. adviceondiabetes.com Home Privacy Sitemap Controlling gestational diabetes can not be possible with some women. Controlling gestational diabetes can not be possible with some women.  But there are ways to lower the risk in developing gestational diabetes in most women. Gestational diabetes is when blood sugar levels are too high during pregnancy.  It usually goes away after the baby is born.   It can cause problems with both the mother and the baby.  The baby may grow too large which causes problems during delivery.  The baby may be born with low blood sugar.   The cause of gestational diabetes is that the placenta produces hormones that make insulin harder to work which is called insulin resistance. During pregnancy, gestational diabetes can be controlled by diet and exercise.   The mother will also need to check her blood glucose level at home on a regular basis and will need to see her doctor on a regular basis also.  She may need to learn to give herself insulin injections to help to control levels of blood glucose. If you have already had gestational diabetes with an earlier pregnancy, you will be at risk of it developing again with future pregnancies.  You also are at risk of developing Type-2 diabetes which is one of the permanent types of diabetes.  Again, the best way to prevent this is exercise and to maintain a healthy weight during your pregnancy. If you have had gestational diabetes you should avoid any medications that increase your resistance to insulin.  Examples of these are nicotinic acid and glucocorticoid (prednisone and dexamethasone).  It is advised to avoid progestin only birth control pills as they can raise you risk of developing Type-2 diabetes.  Birth control pills that contain low dose combination of estrogen and progestin do not have the added increase risk of Type-2 diabetes. A child born to a woman who has gestational diabetes is at a greater risk of being overweight and developing Type-2 diabetes.  Breast-feeding your baby can lower the risk to the baby of becoming overweight.  As your child grows older, it is up to you as a mother to teach and encourage your child to eat healthily and to get regular exercise to prevent Type-2 diabetes. Controlling gestational diabetes can not be possible with some women.  But there are some ways to lower the risk in developing gestational diabetes in most women.
