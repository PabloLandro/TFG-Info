  & Reference Resources Valerian (herb)-From Wikipedia, the free
  encyclopedia Valerian (plant) Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae Division: Magnoliophyta Class: Magnoliopsida Order: Dipsacales Family: Valerianaceae Genus: Valeriana Species: V. officinalis Binomial name Valeriana officinalis L. & Maillefer Valerian (Valeriana officinalis, Valerianaceae) is a hardy
  perennial flowering plant, with heads of sweetly scented pink or white
  flowers. This "sweet" smell is quite overpowering when the flower
  is placed into a vase. The flowers are in bloom from June to September. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, Valerian has been
  introduced into North America. It is consumed as food by the larvae of some
  Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including Grey Pug. Other names used for this plant include garden valerian
  (to distinguish it from other Valeriana species), garden heliotrope (although
  not related to Heliotropium) and all-heal. Valerian, in Pharmacology and Phytoterapic Medicine, is
  the name of an herb or dietary supplement prepared from roots of the plant,
  which, after maceration, trituration, dehydration processes, are conveniently
  packaged, usually into capsules, that may be utilized for certain effects
  including sedation and anxiolytic effect.

  meaning "to be strong or healthy", generally thought to refer to
  its medicinal use, though many references suggest that it also refers to the
  strong odor. Biochemical composition The biochemical active components of valerian extract are: Alkaloids: actinidine, catinine, isovaleramide, valerianine
  and valerine; Gama Aminobutiric acid (GABA), neurotransmitter connected
  to the sedative plant effects; Valeric acid; Valepotriates, esters non-glicosidic, firstly acevaltrate,
  isovaltrate and valtrate. Volatile oil containing active sesquiterpenes (acetoxivalerenic
  acid, valerenic acid); Mechanism of Action Due to valerian's historical use as a sedative, anti-convulsant,
  migraine treatment and pain reliever, most basic science research has been
  directed at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA
  neurotransmitter receptor system. These studies remain inconclusive and all
  require independent replication. The mechanism of action of valerian in
  general, as a mild sedative in particular, remains unknown. Valerian extracts
  appear to have some affinity for the GABAA (benzodiazepine) receptor,[1][2]
  but this activity does not appear to be mediated by valerenic acid, but
  rather by the relatively high content of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
  itself. Preparation Valeriana officinalisThe chief constituent of Valerian is
  a yellowish-green to brownish-yellow oil which is present in the dried root
  varying from 0.5 to 2 per cent though an average yield rarely exceeds 0.8 per
  cent. This variation in quantity is partly explained by location: a dry,
  stony soil, yielding a root richer in oil than one that is moist and fertile.
  [3] The volatile oils that form the active ingredient are extremely pungent,
  somewhat reminiscent of well-matured cheese or wet dog. Valerian tea should
  not be prepared with boiling water, as this may drive off the lighter oils. Medicinal use Valerian is used for insomnia and other disorders.[4] [5]
  [6] In the United States Valerian is sold as a nutritional
  supplement. Therapeutic use has increased as dietary supplements have gained
  in popularity, especially after the Dietary Supplement Health and Education
  Act was passed in 1999. This law allowed the distribution of many agents as
  over-the-counter supplements, and therefore allowed them to bypass the
  regulatory requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Valerian is used against sleeping disorders, restlessness
  and anxiety. Valerian seems only to work when taken over longer periods
  (several weeks). Some studies have demonstrated that valerian extracts
  interact with the GABA and benzodiazepine receptors. Valerian is also used
  traditionally to treat gastrointestinal pain and spastic colitis. Long term
  safety studies are missing. As valepotriates may be potential mutagens,
  valerian should only be used after consultation with a physician. Valerian medication is sometimes recommended as first line
  when benefit-risk relation requires so. Valerian is often indicated as
  transition medication during discontinuation processes involving bromazepan, clonazepam
  and diazepam, among others. Valerian has uses in herbal medicine as a sedative. The
  main current use of valerian is as a remedy for insomnia, with a recent
  meta-analysis providing some evidence of effectiveness.[7] It has been
  recommended for epilepsy but that is not supported by research. Large doses
  are known to cause withdrawal symptoms when stopped, as it, as well as most
  all sleep aids, may result in dependency. .[4] While shown to be an effective remedy for the reduction of
  anxiety, it has also been reported to cause headaches and night terrors in
  some individuals. This is due to the fact that some people lack a digestive
  conversion property necessary to effectively break down Valerian. In these
  individuals, Valerian can cause agitation.[8] One study found that valerian
  tends to sedate the agitated person and stimulate the fatigued person,
  bringing about a balancing effect on the system.[9] Oral forms, usage and adverse effects Oral forms Oral forms are available in both standardized and unstandardized
  forms. Standarized products may be preferable considering the wide variation
  of the chemicals in the dried root, as noted above. When standarized it is
  done so as a percentage of valerenic acid or valeric acid. Physician Formulas
  makes a 300 mg capsule standardized to 0.8 % valerenic acid (2.4mg).[10]
  Nature's Sunshine Time-Release Valerian tablet contains 500 mg of valerian
  root extract standardized to 0.8 % valerenic acid (4mg).[11] Nature Made
  makes a 400mg capsule standardized to only 0.28 % valerenic acid
  (0.56mg).[12] Nutraceutical makes two 50mg capsules under the names Solaray
  and Thompson standardized to 0.8 % valeric acid (0.4mg).[13] Usage Dosage is difficult to determine due to the lack of
  standardization and variability in available forms. Adverse effects Few adverse events attributable to valerian have been
  reported.[4] Effect on Cats and Rats An unusual feature of valerian is that the dried root
  affects the domestic cat in a similar way as that of catnip. If valerian root
  is left in a place to which cats have access, they will roll in it, salivate
  onto it and eat it. [3] Burmese cats are attracted to the dried herb and will
  deliberately destroy containers to obtain it. However, some cats will not go
  near valerian root.[citation needed] Valerian's effect on cats is featured as a clue in two
  works by Agatha Christie.[citation needed] Valerian is also very attractive to rats, so much so that
  it has been used to bait traps. Some versions of the legend of the Pied Piper
  of Hamelin have him using valerian, as well as his pipes, to attract the
  rats. [3] Notes ^ Holzl J, Godau P. (1989). "Receptor binding studies
