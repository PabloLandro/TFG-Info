We'd love to hear it. Help others get the care they need. Click here to leave your feedback . Testimonials Simply put, Sharon Yeung has changed my life. For several years I struggled with intense stomach pain, acid reflux and digestive issues. I tried everything (or so I thought)- changing my diet, taking prescription drugs- nothing worked until I met Sharon. I originally went to see Sharon to deal with severe anxiety and depression. I was at a point where nothing I was doing was making me feel better. I was willing to try anything, despite my skepticism about Eastern Medicine. She made me feel comfortable from the first day I met her. Sharon not only worked with me to ease my stress and negativity, but also treated my digestive tract with acupuncture and herbs. Almost immediately, I started noticing a difference. She is a great listener, a wonderful healer and confidant. She geniuinely cares for her patients, which is why I have recommended her to many friends and co-workers. I am happy to saythat they have had life-changing experiences as well. Thanks to Sharons care and support, my digestive issues have been treated and I am no longer struggling with anxiety and depression. I highly recommend giving Sharon a try. I hope that you will be as blessed with her healing care as I have been.
