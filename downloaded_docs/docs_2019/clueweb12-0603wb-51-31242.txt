Stop Smoking See also anxiety , depression , diabetes , fear , heart health , high blood pressure , infertility , pain management , stress . Stop Smoking Today ! Tobacco, in the form of cigarettes, is the most addictive drug in the world . Nicotine is one of the strongest stimulants known, and smoking is one of the most efficient drug-delivery systems. Smoking actually puts drugs into the brain more directly than intravenous injection. It is true that one of the "benefits" of smoking is the brief relief of internal tension; unfortunately, within 20 minutes the tension is back stronger than before, demanding another fix. Many of the chemicals in tobacco smoke also affect the nonsmoker inhaling the smoke, making "secondhand smoking" another important cause of lung cancer. It is responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths annually. Lung Cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women. An estimated 180,900 new cases of lung cancer and an estimated 160,880 deaths from lung cancer will occur in the United States in the following year. Smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer . Lung cancer may also be the most tragic cancer because in most cases, it might have been prevented - 87% of lung cancer cases are caused by smoking. Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000 different chemicals, many of which are proven cancer-causing substances, or carcinogens. Smoking cigars or pipes also increases the risk of lung cancer. The more time and quantity you smoke, the greater your risk of lung cancer . But if you stop smoking, the risk of lung cancer decreases each year as normal cells replace abnormal cells. After ten years, the risk drops to a level that is one-third to one-half of the risk for people who continue to smoke. In addition, quitting smoking greatly reduces the risk of developing other smoking-related diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis may result from prolonged exposure to bronchial irritants. Cigarette smoking, environmental toxins, and inhalant allergens can all cause chronic irritation of the bronchi. The cells lining the bronchi produce excess mucus in response to the chronic irritation; this excess mucus production can lead to a chronic, productive cough. Bronchitis can be particularly dangerous in the elderly and in people with compromised immune systems. These individuals should see a doctor if they develop a respiratory infection. Low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes offer no great advantages . People tend to smoke more of them, or inhale more deeply to get the same amount of nicotine. Pipes and cigars, if not inhaled, do not cause lung cancer and emphysema, but do increase the risk of oral cancer (as do snuff and chewing tobacco). There are many programs available to help you quit: acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and support groups. There are also a many products - nicotine patches and gum, for instance - on the market that work for some. None of these methods works reliably for everyone. Most successful quitters do it on their own after one or more unsuccessful attempts. Going "cold turkey" also seems to work better than gradually cutting down. Don't get discouraged . If you can't quit today, you may be able to tomorrow. You want to be motivated. You need to do this for yourself, not because someone else wants you to. You have to believe that you can!! Stop Smoking Kit There is both a physiological and psychological component to smoking .

Dopamine is a natural substance in your body that dulls pain and increases the feeling of pleasure. This is actually triggered when you are smoking. When you smoke, you elevate your dopamine levels. So when you don�t smoke, your body craves a cigarette.  If you can quit, you can switch your dopamine levels back to normal.  Smoking also becomes a behavioral addiction. You get used to the action of picking up something and putting it in your mouth. Start by cutting your cigarettes in half. This limits the amount of nicotine by decreasing the size and intake. The hardest part of quitting comes in the first week . You feel sluggish, have cravings and start expelling phlegm and mucus from the lung�s lining. This is the process your body endures as you start detoxing your system. Begin with Andrew's incredible Stop Smoking Kit ! Top 10 Tips for Detoxing 1. Eating a diet that focuses on fresh vegetables and fruits . 2. Eat whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. 3. Adopt a healthy lifestyle including regular exercise . 4. Avoiding drugs and excessive alcohol . 5. Taking a high potency multiple vitamin and mineral supplement. 6. Take nutritional/herbal supplements to protect and enhance organ functions. 7. Fasting is one of the quickest ways to increase elimination of waste and enhance the healing process of the body. 8. Go on a three day fast , four times per year (fasting at the change of the seasons is a good rule to remember). 9. Take care of your skin and know your skin type. 10. Consider a self empowering affirmation to clear your mind. In general, it is usually recommended that you begin with the intestines (see detoxing the organs in Chinese Medicine ). The reason for this is if you focus on the liver first, the stored toxic substances that are released from the body tissues may become reabsorbed if the bowels are not moving adequately enough to expel them and can monitor your progress throughout the program. The most easiest, inexpensive and effective methods of detoxification are fasting and specific dietary regimens. Keep in mind that the goal is to achieve a healthier way of eating, not weight loss, or to rid the body of all bacteria.   In fact, "the good bacteria," known as probiotics, is necessary in order to remain in good health. Lifestyle Changes 1. Exercise is encouraged and dietary and support systems are recommended to rid the body of toxins and avoid relapses. 2. Get plenty of fresh fruit and  vegetable juices and miso soup to neutralize and clear the blood of nicotinic acid and to fortify blood sugar. Carrots, carrot juice, celery, leafy green salads and citrus fruits promote body alkalinity and decrease cravings. 3. Managing cravings Plan what you will do during a craving. Examples: Chew licorice root sticks or gum; repeat your affirmation; breathe deeply; exercise; call support person.
Begin with Andrew's incredible Stop Smoking Kit ! 4. Avoid junk food, sugar, chocolate, coffee and cooked spinach .

Drink water - Research shows that dryness causes cravings. Sip water frequently throughout the day. 7. Deep Breathing Exercises to increase body oxygen 8. Support Person - Ask someone to act as a sounding board and provide encouragement when needed. 9. Affirmations - An affirmation is a positive statement repeated often to create desired changes in your life.

Setting Boundaries - Avoid contact with other smokers  This includes loved ones. Stay away from smokers during the first few weeks, especially. 11. Curbing the Oral Fixation The need to have something in our mouth is a habit that must be broken. This is apart of the desire and addiction.

More Water : Not only will you loss water, the more you drink, but as you exercise, drinking water makes you feel full, therefore, keeping you hydrated. 5. More Fiber : Dietary fiber is an important part of our daily diet. Although most fiber is not digested, it gives us many important and healthy benefits. Fiber retains water, which allows for softer and bulkier stools which in turn prevents constipation and hemorrhoids. Fiber binds with cholesterol and eliminates this substance from the body. A high-fiber diet, 30 mg or more, can also reduce colon cancer risk as well as keep our digestive tract clean. 6. More Music : Bring this motivational tool BACK into your life.

I think it is most important to go to sleep with a "Quiet Mind". Sleep rejuvenates, detoxes and regulates the body. Discover how to have restful, rejuvenating sleep . 9. Believe : Your belief system has everything to do with the mental and spiritual aspects of your will power. Fight anxiety with relaxation exercises rather than food. Utilize meditation, yoga, stretching. By creating healthy eating habits and regular exercise, you are sure to stop smoking without depriving yourself. And if you continue those good habits after you reach your goal, you will have an excellent chance of maintaining your good habits and see it more as maintaining a lifestyle as opposed to not smoking. Learning to have a more structured and disciplined lifestyle can make all the difference in your progress. You deserve it! 10. Reward Yourself : with an occasional treat. Talk to yourself by complementing your efforts daily. Honor who you are each day. Use the mirror when you do this. Address who you are and who you are willing to become.

E-mail Me Now Exercise Exercise is crucial to successful smoking cessation . Not only does it help burn excess calories, but by increasing your physical activity you can modify the way your brain regulates hormones, making you less susceptible to cravings. Consider Power walking, Aerobics, Swimming or any cardiovascular exercise that you do consistantly for 20-40 minutes. It is important to keep the heart rate up in your target zone during this time in order for cardio exercise to work effectively. Stimulate your metabolism . Adding weight training and/or cardiovascular exercise to your routine will boost your metabolsim. Cardio will burn extra calories while you're doing it. Resistance training will actually increase the rate at which your body uses calories. Exercise during the day to exhaust the muscles and the mind. The moving is good when we are depressed too! Aerobics, power walking, weight training, swimming are all great for working the muscles and the mind. Exercise gets the blood flowing and makes us move past many issues. Exercise early in the day . Twenty to thirty minutes of exercise every day can help you sleep, but be sure to exercise in the morning or afternoon. Exercise stimulates the body and aerobic activity before bedtime may make falling asleep more difficult. See a doctor before starting any kind of exercise program if you have never exercised before or have any other illnesses. Nutritional Advise Often, when people are trying to quit smoking , they use food as an alternative addiction. Unfortunately, it is the wrong foods that seem to fill that need or craving. This includes too much sweets, too much salt and an excess of empty calories. The need to replace the oral and tactile fixation can result in you picking up (and eating) the wrong foods, which are calorie rich and nutritionally void of what you need. I often recommend to my patients that they use either rou gui or gui zhi sticks . Rou gui and gui zhi are the bark and twig respectively from the Cinnamomum cassia tree. Cinnamon sticks sold in grocery stores are usually also Cinnamomum cassia bark which is either much younger than rou gui or has the rough exterior scraped off. They are often far more inferior in their medicinal grade than the Chinese version.  These barks and twig work as a tactile substitute when you need something to fiddle with. Chewing on this herb works well for treating the oral fixation and helps regulate blood sugar. Having a bag of carrot sticks or celery sticks at the ready can also help with the need to touch and chew on something. Carrots are slightly sweet and celery is water dense. The crisp of the vegetables also helps with the need to want to crunch on something. I also recommed 1 - 2 glasses of fiber a day . Drinking your fiber is a good way to get your daily dose and the water helps to keep you full. Water should be a very important part of any nutritional program. Distilled water is best. 6-8 8 ounces per day. Water allows for the cleansing and hydrating of the system. It is also filling and a good substitute for soda or sugar-laden drinks. Although it may seem counterintuitive, drinking water helps you burn fat. Studies have shown that a decrease in water intake, will cause fat deposits to increase. Without water, the kidneys cannot effectively filter out the waste products and other chemicals which build up in the bloodstream and interfere with the liver's ability to metabolize fat. As a result, you become more likely to store fat and less likely to burn it. Smoking dries out your internal organs.  When your body is low in water, you retain pockets of salt and water under the skin, as a defense mechanism. For your body does not know when it will get its next drink. This stored water and salt under the skin will create a puffiness and looks like fat. Drink plenty of distilled water or low sodium water and avoid high- sodium foods. The FDA recommends limiting your intake of fat to 65 grams per day . By safely and carefully selecting your foods so that your fat consumption is about 30 grams per day , you can see a significant amount of weight loss, depending on your body mass index. Your body expends a certain amount of calories upon digestion . Proteins are burned at the highest rate-20-25%, Carbohydrates 8-10%, and Fats only about 2%. This is known as the Thermic Effect of Food . This fact cannot be stressed enough : EAT five or six small meals a day will prevent hunger pangs, provide constant energy, increase your metabolic efficiency, improving your fat losing abilities and decrease your risk of heart attack. Consme lean sources of protein such as skinless white meat poultry or fish, with fibrous water rich vegatables such as string beans, tomatoes, cucumbers. 
Protein shakes or meal replacement bars work well as one of your small meals. Be aware of the carbohydrates in most bars and shakes for they can be extremely high. Medium to low amounts of carbs 2-14 grams a bar is sufficient. Reducing fat in the diet is an important component for smoking cessation. As we stop the nicotine, we desire something to replace the oral cravings. Foods with a high proportion of calories from fat should be eliminated or limited in the diet; these include red meat, poultry skins, dark poultry meat, fried foods, butter, margarine, cheese, milk (except skim milk), junk foods, and most processed foods. Vegetable oils should also be restricted, as should nuts, seeds, and avocados (although these foods are healthful for people who have no weight problem). Instead, the diet should be based on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and non-fat dairy products (and low-fat fish for non-vegetarians). Hydrogenated oils are very bad, for two reasons . First reason is that hydrogenated fats are saturated fats, and saturated fats raise total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Second reason is that hydrogenation also produces what are called "trans" fatty acids. Although these are unsaturated, with one double bond, they act the same as saturated fats. Some margarines are now available without trans fatty acids, these are better. a lot of convenience foods are made with hydrogenated fat, like cookies, crackers, etc. Avoid artificial sweeteners and synthetic fat substitutes and the foods made with them. They are unhealthy and not conducive to the kind of good eating habits you need to form in order to slim down and stay that way. Stevia is a natural sweetener that is 300 times sweeter than sugar but contain NO calories. It is also safe for people with diabetes and hypoglycemics. Eating adequate amounts of fiber is believed to be important for individuals wishing to stop smoking. Fiber contains bulk and tends to produce a sense of fullness, which allows people to consume fewer calories.  Different types of dietary fiber are available from a variety of sources, and the amount recommended depends on the kind being used. Juice Therapy is an excellent way to get your fruits and vegetable fresh and in their natural form. Blending fruits and/or vegetables into a great juice creation or smoothie can be an excellent snack or meal replacement. Consider Andrew's great juice and smoothie recipes ! What You Should Avoid : What you don't eat may be even more important than what you do eat. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and sugar, because they tend to accumulate in the system. If you can't avoid them, then at least cut down. Reduce or Avoid Caffeine : Caffeine is something many people in America and Europe are used to bringing in their daily lives. Though many studies have shown that this addictive stimulant can help produce symptoms of anxiety, insomnia and the like. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, chocolate, many sodas and even certain medications. Always ask your doctor about a medication before using it. Also, ask the doctor if there is an alternative medication if your medicine contains caffeine. Reduce Processed and Refined Foods : Processed food can rob your food of nutrients and vitamins that your body needs to fight off stress and promote good health. Try to buy whole foods, unprocessed foods and try and stay away from "instant" foods, preservatives, artificial flavors, saturated fat and MSG. Reduce Sugar Intake : Too much sugar can rob our body of essential nutrients. Yet don't be so fast as to replace the sugar with Stevia the natural sweetener from the Stevia plant. Artificial sweetener can also cause anxiety as well as other health concerns. Reduce Alcohol Intake : In small amounts, alcohol can be good for your heart but too much alcohol is not a good thing for your body and too large of an intake increases your body's need for extra vitamins. The body has a harder time using oxygen. As a result, you can become more sensitive to stress - which in turn can cause anxiety reactions. It can also cause depression. The Effects of Alcohol on the Body : How does alcohol contribute to toxicity? Research has shown that alcohol in high doses has numerous health hazards. As well as many other things, it can increase your need for extra vitamins due to disturbed eating patterns interfere with the body's ability to use oxygen, to process food and absorb vitamins. As a result, high alcohol consumption makes you more sensitive to stress . Chronic abuse of alcohol - often associated with depression-like symptoms, which can reduce the ability to solve problems, which in turn can lead to anxiety. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to poor work performance, relationship difficulties & financial difficulties. This can produce stressors that worsen the situation.

Water cleanses, refreshes and restores all life. We are always drawn to water.  Be it a soothing fountain or majestic waterfall. Water is a carrier. It flows. It moves along the line of least resistance to find its way to the ocean where comes and goes in the ebb and flow of tides and waves.  The appeal is inexplicable!  We crave water, maybe because our bodies are made up of a large percent of it. Maybe beacuse we instinctively know how it can heal us. Hydrotherapy is the use of water in any form ,  in the treatment of dis-ease. Hydrotherapy was used by the ancient Greek physicians. The use of baths for such purposes as well as for religious purification, personal cleanliness, and private or social relaxation dates from at least the time of ancient Greece. A German, Vincenz Priessnitz, popularized the use of spas in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, where they are still popular today. Hydrotherapy has a number of uses . Warm water will relax spasm; thus, hydrotherapy has been useful in treating such conditions as muscular strains and sprains, muscular fatigue, and backache. Heat is often used in conjunction with massage or other manipulative or stimulative treatments, such as the whirlpool bath. Sitz baths (sitting in hot water) are effective in the treatment of many disorders. Water is also useful in physical therapy because patients who exercise in a buoyant medium can move weak parts of their bodies without contending with the strong force of gravity.

This often leads to a complete recovery from the dis-ease, as well as, providing an improved understanding of the patient's situation. This type of healing makes it easier and possible to avoid recurrence or relapses in the future and homeopathy stimulates the body's natural defense system by reestablishing normal immune system and cell functioning.

Curiosity and imagination may be the bottom line that makes the difference between wellness and illness. If you give your subconscious enough data, it seems to filter through and find what it needs. The beginning of religions have all been attributed to the attempts of interpreting and understanding dreams. These visual images that appear during sleep cycles can convey many messages. Based on a particular culture, the meaning of dreams can vary in their scope and interpretation. One book, "Oneirocritia", was written by Artemidorus- a Roman philosopher in the 2nd century A.D., has served as the foundation of many other dream interpretation books. 
Psychologist Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, who have both embrassed the important significance of dream interpretation, have given credit to Artemidorus' work. Freud, the father of psychoanalysis , interpreted people's dreams in order to help them unearth hidden feelings. Jung, a Swiss psychologist, who initially followed in Freud's footsteps, developed theories of Anima (women) and Animus (men) involving the feminine and masculine principles and the collective unconscious symbols known as Archetypes. Each dream is a message from the subconscious mind relating a message about the dreamer�s current state of awareness. The dream message has immediacy, applying to the thoughts and attitudes of the previous 24 to 48 hours. Everything in the dream, each person, place or thing represents some aspect, quality or way of thinking of the dreamer. In this picture language of dreams, what has been studied and taught for the past quarter century at the School of Metaphysics as the Universal Language of the Mind, lies truth that will open the dreamer�s eyes to the reality of his own thinking, to the consciousness of the Self and to the ideals of the soul. We seek detachment from a chaotic, confusing, baffling world. And we seek it in dreams, and fantasy. By living with imagination , and learning to make real our dreams, we come to realize that ours is not a single, unique, isolated experience, but related to others dreams. Our myth has been dreamed by others. This is a myth that comes from the unconscious, which is not isolated and unique, but universal. Dream analysis can help with stressful situations. It can help to explain your anxiety or fears that are getting in the way of your productive life. Consider a Dream Interpretation . Yoga Therapy: Yoga poses can be good alternatives to "traditional" health remedies because they relax the body and mind, improve circulation and respiration, reduce tension and help the body through it's healing process. Stress Control : The Yogic breath exercise can be done without instruction, without danger, and with a good chance that your discomfort and stressful feelings will be reduced. Relaxation Breath is the most powerful tool for stress management. Sit up, with your back straight in any position.  
Place your tongue against the ridge of tissue just behind your upper front teeth and keep it there throughout the exercise. 
Exhale completely through your mouth. Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four. 
Hold your breath for a count of seven.  
Exhale completely through your mouth, to a count of eight.  Repeat this cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.  Try to do this breathing exercise at least twice a day. You can repeat the whole sequence as often as you wish, but don't do it more than four breaths at one time for the first month of practice. This exercise is fairly intense and has a profound effect on the nervous system. Deep Diaphram Breath Sit with your legs crossed in a comfortable position. Breathe slowly and evenly from your diaphragm, through your nose. Fill your lower abdomen, lungs, then chest with air. Hold for a four count then slowly exhale the air out from your chest, lungs, then lower abdomen. Repeat 3 or 4 times. That's it!  Just allow your shoulders to drop and your face relax as you breath, deep. Also consider Breath Exercises, Child's Pose, Cat, Head to Knee, Knee to Chest, Laying Down Twist, Standing and Seated Forward Bends, Standing Back Bends.. Meditation Therapy: Meditation is a time-honored technique that can take you into infinite dimensions of consciousness. One major principle to meditation is in the ability to completely quiet your mind. Quieting the mind comes as a result of meditating over a long period of time, but any time you are looking within, you are meditating. There are many meditation methods . Some are passive and others are active -- not in the physical sense, but in the sense that you actually do something during meditation. Meditators learn to focus their awareness and direct it onto an object: the breath, a phrase or word: a mantra, repeated silently, a memorized inspirational phrase, an image in the mind's eye. Researchers have documented immediate benefits in terms of lowered blood pressure, decreased heart and respiratory rate, increased blood flow, and other measurable signs of the relaxation response. Meditation will calm an agitated mind , creating optimal physical and mental health, undo our sense of separateness, which is the common root of fear and misery, unify consciousness, putting us in touch with our higher self and connect us to higher consciousness. Meditation restructures the mind, allowing us to achieve our full potential as human beings. Fold your hands gently in your lap and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. Then just sit. If you have never meditated before, you will probably feel as if your mind is full of thoughts. Don't try to stop the thoughts, just watch them. Imagine that you are on the bank of a river and that your thoughts are the river going by. Don't try to stop the river, just watch it. Within a week, you will see the river begin to slow down. You may become impatient, or even bored. That's okay. If you find yourself complaining, just watch the thoughts pass by. Do this for 5 to 10 minutes. You may find that you fall asleep because you are so relaxed. That's good because, in many ways, you have begun to let go. Continue at this pace and each day allow just alittle more time for yourself to meditate. Doing this allows you to relax and forget about time.

Music/Sound Therapy: Vibrational medicine , which validates that everything in the universe is in a state of vibration and the frequency at which an object or person most naturally vibrates is called resonance. The chakras, bones, and organs in the body all possess a different resonant frequency. When an organ or part of the body is vibrating out of tune or non-harmoniously, it is called "dis ease" or disease. A body is in a healthy state of being when each cell, each organ creates a resonance that is in harmony with the whole being. Music is a powerful tool that can be used in so many ways. It has been proven that the type of music that makes a person relax or become receptive is not any one kind. It all depends on the individual and their affinity with it.

Metaphysical Remedies: The power of your mind and your belief system has everything to do with the condition, the speed and the way that you heal. * Our Belief System is one of the major factors that can get us through situations or can cause our life to crumble around us!  I do believe that there is a lot of innate goodness and balancing our minds do subconsciously to get us through hard times.  The other portion of this is how we "program" ourselves to deal with any given situation. * Our self-confidence and self-love are often the key to opening and strengthening this portion of our thoughts which in turn emanates from ourselves! * Energy follows thought .  Program thought to be positive and your energy will reflect it! * Really appreciating what we DO have as opposed to what we would like to have, sometimes makes a signifcant difference. This is always an important element in healing that is often neglected. Crystal Remedy Reference Crystals have both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties .
