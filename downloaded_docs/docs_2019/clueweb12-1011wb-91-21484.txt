        relieve migraine, but scientific studies have only recently show how it 
        works. Migraine pain is caused by the constriction and swelling of blood 
        vessels in the head that are partly triggered off by the body chemical 
        called Serotonin reducing the blood to the brain. Feverfew has a natural 
        chemical called Parthenolide that inhibits the release of Serotonin from 
        small cells called Platelets, thereby allowing a more regular blood flow. Many people who have suffered from migraine claim to have benefited from taking Feverfew.  Some have found that they don't need to take it continually - a course of up to three months will leave them free for long periods of time before they have to take more Feverfew.
