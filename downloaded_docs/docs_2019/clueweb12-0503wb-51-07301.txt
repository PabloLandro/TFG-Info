        Knowledgebase Topic Contents Topic Overview Related Information Credits Complications of Whooping Cough Topic Overview Complications that can develop from whooping cough include lung infection ( pneumonia ), pulmonary hypertension , ear infections , seizures , weight loss, dehydration , or exertion-related injuries from severe
		coughing (such as cracked ribs or a hernia ). When these complications are severe, they may
		require additional treatment or hospitalization. Pneumonia and other types of
		lung infections or problems may be treated with antibiotics, oxygen, and
		assisted ventilation. Improved treatment procedures have made complications of whooping
		cough less threatening than in the past. But the disease and its complications
		remain a serious health issue, especially for children younger than 4 months of
		age. Adults ages 60 and older also are at increased risk for severe symptoms
		and complications. Related Information Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Credits By Healthwise Staff Primary Medical Reviewer Susan C.
