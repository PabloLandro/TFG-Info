<0.001) and more were uncircumcised (risk ratio = 10; P <0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk of seroconversion was
    independently associated with being uncircumcised (risk ratio = 8.2; P <0.0001),
    genital ulcers (risk ratio = 4.7; P = 0.02) and regular prostitute contact (risk
    ratio = 3.2; P = 0.02). The cumulative frequency of seroconversion was 18% and was
    only 2% for men with no risk factors, compared to 53% for men with both risk factors. Only
    one circumcised man with no ulcer seroconverted. Thus 98% of seroconversion was associated
    with either or both cofactors. In 65% there appeared to be additive synergy, the reason
    being that ulcers increase infectivity for HIV. This involves increased viral shedding in
    the female genital tract of women with ulcers, where HIV-1 has been isolated from surface
    ulcers in the genital tract of HIV-1 infected women. It has been suggested that the foreskin could physically trap HIV-infected vaginal
    secretions and provide a more hospitable environment for the infectious innoculum. Also,
    the increased surface area, traumatic physical disruption during intercourse and
    inflammation of the glans penis (balanitis) could aid in recruitment of target cells for
    HIV-1. The port of entry could potentially be the glans, subprepuce and/or urethra. In a
    circumcised penis the dry, cornified skin may prevent entry and account for the
    findings. In this African study the rate of transmission of HIV following a single exposure was 13%
    (i.e., very much higher than in the USA). It was suggested that concomitant STDs,
    particularly chancroid [9] ,
    may be a big risk factor, but there could be other explanations as well. Studies in the
    USA have not been as conclusive. Some studies have shown a higher incidence in
    uncircumcised men. Others do not. In New York City, for example, no correlation was found,
    but the patients were mainly intravenous drug users and homosexuals, so that any existing
    effect may have been obscured. A study in Miami, however, of heterosexual couples did find
    a higher incidence in men who were uncircumcised, and, in Seattle homosexual men were
    twice as likely to be HIV positive if they were uncircumcised [28] . The reason for the big difference in apparent rate of transmission of HIV in Africa and
    Asia, where heterosexual exposure has led to a rapid spread through these populations and
    is the main method of transmission, compared with the very slow rate of penetration into
    the heterosexual community in the USA and Australia, now appears to be related at least in
    part to a difference in the type of HIV-1 itself [29] . In 1995 an article in Nature Medicine discussed findings concerning marked differences in the properties of different HIV-1
    subtypes in different geographical locations [37] . A class of HIV-1 termed ?clade E? is prevalent in Asia and differs from the ?clade B?
    found in developed countries in being highly capable of infecting Langerhans cells found
    in the foreskin, so accounting for its ready transmission across mucosal membranes. The
    Langerhans cells are part of the immune system and in turn carry the HIV to the T-cells,
    whose numbers are severely depleted as a key feature of AIDS. The arrival of the Asian
    strain in Australia was reported in Nov 1995 and has the potential to utilise the
    uncircumcised male as a vehicle for rapid spread through the heterosexual community of
    this country in a similar manner as it has done in Asia. It could thus be a time-bomb
    about to go off and should be a major concern for health officials. To summarize: Lack of circumcision: Is the biggest risk factor for heterosexually-acquired AIDS virus infection in men
        (8-times higher risk by itself, and even higher when lesions from STDs are added
        in). Is responsible for a 12-fold higher risk of urinary tract infections. Carries a higher risk of death in the first year of life (from complications of urinary
        tract infections: kidney failure, meningitis and infection of bone marrow). One in ~600-900 uncircumcised men will die from cancer of the penis or require at least
        partial penile amputation as a result. (In contrast, penile cancer never occurs in
        men circumcised at birth). (Data from studies in the USA, Denmark and Australia, which are
        not to be confused with the often quoted, but misleading, annual incidence figures of 1 in
        100,000). Often leads to balanitis (inflammation of the glans), phimosis (inability to retract the
        foreskin) and paraphimosis (constriction of the penis by a tight foreskin). Up to 18% of
        uncircumcised boys will develop one of these by 8 years of age, whereas all are unknown in
        the circumcised. Means problems that may result in a need for circumcision late in life:
        complication risk = 1 in 100 (compared with 1 in 1000 in the newborn). Is associated with higher incidence of cervical cancer in the female partners of
        uncircumcised men. There is no evidence of any long-term psychological harm arising from circumcision. The
    risk of damage to the penis is extremely rare and avoidable by using a competent,
    experienced doctor. Surgical methods use a procedure that protects the penis during
    excision of the foreskin. As an alternative, for those who might prefer it, a device
    (PlastiBell) is in use that clamps the foreskin, which then falls off after a few days,
    and so eliminates the need to actually cut the foreskin off [20] . For some, cultural or religious beliefs
    dictate the method. Sociological aspects Finally, a brief mention of other findings relating to circumcision in the setting of
    Australia. In a survey of circumcised vs uncircumcised men and their partners that was conducted by
    Sydney scientist James Badger [4, 5] (who regards himself as
    neutral on the issue of circumcision) it was found that: 18% of uncircumcised males underwent circumcision later in life anyway. 21% of uncircumcised men who didn't, nevertheless wished they were circumcised. (There
        were also almost as many men who wished they hadn?t been circumcised and it could be that
        at least some men of either category may have been seeking a scapegoat for their sexual or
        other problems. In addition, this would no doubt be yet another thing parents could be
        blamed for by their children, whatever their decision was when the child was born.) No difference in sexual performance (consistent with Masters & Johnson). Slightly higher sexual activity in circumcised men. No difference in frequency of sexual intercourse for older uncircumcised vs. circumcised
        men. Men circumcised as adults were very pleased with the result. The local pain when they
        awoke from the anaesthetic was quickly relieved by pain killers (needed only for one day),
        and all had returned to normal sexual relations within 2 weeks, with no decrease in
        sensitivity of the penis and claims of 'better sex'. (Badger?s findings are, moreover,
        consistent with every discussion I have ever had with men circumcised as adults. The only
        case to the contrary was a testimonial in a letter I received in the mail from a member of
        UNCIRC.) Women with circumcised lovers were more likely to reach a simultaneous climax. Women with uncircumcised lovers were 3 times as likely to fail to reach orgasm. (These
        data could, however, possibly reflect behaviours of uncircumcised males that might belong
        to lower socio-economic classes and/or ethnic groups whose attitudes may differ from
        groups in which circumcision is more common.) Circumcision was favoured by women for appearance and hygiene. (Furthermore, some women
        were nauseated by the smell of the uncircumcised penis, where, as mentioned above bacteria
        and other micro-organisms proliferate under the foreskin.) The uncircumcised penis was found by women to be easier to elicit orgasm by hand. The circumcised penis was favoured by women for oral sex. Why are human males born with a foreskin? The foreskin probably protected the head of the penis from long grass, shrubbery, etc when
    humans wore no clothes, where evolutionarily our basic physiology and psychology are
    little different than our cave-dwelling ancestors. However, Dr Guy Cox from The University
    of Sydney has recently supplemented this suggestion with a novel idea, namely that the
    foreskin could be the male equivalent of the hymen, and served as an impediment to sexual
    intercourse during adolescence [11] . The ritual removal of the foreskin in diverse human traditional cultures, ranging from
    Muslims to Aboriginal Australians, is a sign of civilization in that human society
    acquired the ability to control through education and religion the age at which sexual
    intercourse could begin. Food for thought and discussion! Conclusion The information available today will assist medical practitioners, health workers and
    parents by making advice and choices concerning circumcision much more informed. Although
    there are benefits to be had at any age, they are greater the younger the child. Issues of
    ?informed consent? may be analogous to those parents have to consider for other medical
    procedures, such as whether or not to immunize their child. The question to be answered is
    ?do the benefits outweigh the risks?. When considering each factor in isolation there
    could be some difficulty in choosing. However, when viewed as a whole, in my opinion the
    answer to whether to circumcise a male baby is ?yes?. Nevertheless, everybody needs to
    weigh up all of the pros and cons for themselves and make their own best decision. I trust
    that the information I have provided in this article will help in the decision-making
    process. Brian J. Morris, PhD DSc Fax: +61 2 9351 2058 University Academic (in medical sciences) Email: brianm@physiol.usyd.edu.au References Agarwal SS, et al . Role of male behaviour in cervical
