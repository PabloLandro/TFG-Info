Does Apple Cider Vinegar Cure Ovarian Cysts Ovarian Cyst Skip to content Home Privacy Policy Site Map ← Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy Procedure Code Ovarian Cyst Constipation → Does Apple Cider Vinegar Cure Ovarian Cysts Posted on November 23, 2011 by Sometimes it is a very difficult to find a bacterial vaginosis cure. Oftentimes antibiotics and other remedies just don't work anymore. So, I am going to save you time and heartache by sharing with you a few bacterial vaginosis cures. Then you will be able to get rid of your BV within a few days, permanently. Here are the cures for bacterial vaginosis: 1. You should start by taking a couple of supplemental pills that will help you get rid of BV. I am talking about taking garlic and tracheal pills. Garlic pills help fight bacteria that causes BV and the tracheal pills help you get rid of toxins in your body. In order to get the best results, you need to take two garlic pills two times daily. You will take the two tracheal pills right before bed. 2. Apple cider vinegar is another bacterial vaginosis cure. Apple cider vinegar helps fight the toxins that cause you to have BV. All you have to do is pour a cup or two of the apple cider vinegar into your bathwater and then soak in it for twenty minutes. 3. Bacterial Vaginosis can also be cured by yogurt. Yogurt can be used in two ways. You have the choice of eating a couple of cups of yogurt a day. Or, you can opt to insert the yogurt into your vagina using a tampon. It's my recommendation that you use it both ways. Yogurt has naturally occurring good bacteria that will help you get rid of the bad bacteria in your vagina. Which is why it's a great bacterial vaginosis cure.
