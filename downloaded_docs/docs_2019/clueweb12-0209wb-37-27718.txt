                autoimmune diseases Omega-3 
                fatty acids from fish oil can offer significant benefits to 
                patients suffering from inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and 
                depression, researchers concluded in the December 2002 Journal 
                of American College Nutrition. After 
                reviewing the evidence, the researchers noted that animal 
                experiments and clinical intervention studies demonstrated that 
                the fish-oil derived omega-3s, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
                docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), act as anti-inflammatories and 
                consequently might be useful in the management of inflammatory 
                and autoimmune diseases. They also pointed out that patients 
                with diseases characterized by an increased level of the 
                proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1)—such as coronary 
                heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer—may benefit 
                from consuming omega-3s found in fish oil. Arthritis, 
                Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis also 
                are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 
                and other proinflammatory substances produced by omega-6 fatty 
                acids. It is thought that an overabundance of omega-6s and a 
                lack of omega-3s in the diet may be responsible for 
                inflammation. This may explain, the researchers wrote, why 
                dietary supplementation with fish oils in clinical trials have 
                alleviated the symptoms of several inflammatory and autoimmune 
                diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's 
                disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, 
                multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. In fact, many of the 
                placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory 
                diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease 
                activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs. Reference: Simopoulos
