This pain can have negative influences on a person's daily life. Physical Therapy can assess and address the musculoskeletal dysfunction that can cause pelvic pain. Incontinence is a condition in which there is an involuntary loss of control of the bowel or bladder. Weakness of the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder, urethra and rectum can lead to incontinence. Purpose The Men's Health program is individually designed to meet the unique needs of each patient. The goal is to educate and train patients to manage and, in some cases, eliminate their pelvic pain, incontinence or other musculoskeletal dysfunction as it relates to their diagnosis. Service Overview Beginning with an evaluation, licensed therapists with specialized training formulate a treatment program based on each individual's situation. Treatment may include patient education, manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, biofeedback training and/or electrical stimulation therapy. As with any Physical Therapy, a prescription from a physician is required prior to starting Physical Therapy. Skills and Licensure of Clinicians Beaumont Physical Therapists are licensed by the State of Michigan and have undergone specialized training to provide high quality specialized pelvic floor rehabilitation for men.
