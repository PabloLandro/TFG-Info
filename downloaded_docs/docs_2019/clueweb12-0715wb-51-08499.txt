              London NW7 lAA, UK. Introduction The human ß-globin gene cluster spans a region of70 kilobases (kb) 
              containing five developmentally regulated genes in the order 5'-epsilon,YGY 
              A ,delta,ß-3' (Fig. 1 ). The haematopoietic tissue in the early 
              stages of human development is the embryonic yolk sac and the epsilon-globin 
              gene is expressed. This is switched to the y-globin genes in the 
              foetal liver and the delta- and ß-globin genes in adult bone marrow 
              (Fig. 2; for review, see [9]). High levels of these genes are expressed 
              in circulating red blood cells (RBC), giving rise to 90 % of the 
              total soluble protein. RBC are derived from a pluripotent stem cell 
              which can differentiate along alternate pathways to erythrocytes, 
              platelets, granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes. During the 
              transition to erythroblasts which have lost the capacity to proliferate, 
              the ß-globin genes become transcriptionally activated achieving 
              messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of more than 25000 copies per cell. 
              A large number of structural defects have been documented in the 
              ß-globin gene locus (for review, see [9,44]). These defects are 
              responsible for a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases collectively 
              known as the ß-thalassaemias, which are classified into ß, delta 
              ß, y delta ß, etc. thalassaemia subgroups according to the type 
              of gene affected. In a related condition, hereditary persistence 
              of foetal haemoglobin (HPFH), Y-globin gene expression and hence 
              HbF (fetal haemoglobin) production persist into adult life. These 
              clinically important diseases provide natural models for the study 
              of the regulation of globin gene regulation during development. 
              Most interesting in terms of transcription are the promoter mutations 
              and deletions. The delta ß thalassaemias and a number of the HPFHs 
              are associated with an elevated expression of the y-genes in adult 
              life as a result of deletions of varying size. Analysis of these 
              deletions has suggested that they act over considerable distances, 
              to influence differential gene expression within the human ß-globin 
              domain. The Locus Control Region The existance of a region that activates the entire ß-globin gene 
              cluster first became apparent from the study of a heterozygous Y-ß-thalassaemia 
              (Fig. 1 ) [31]. This patient contained one deletion allele which 
              lacked lOO kb, eliminating the entire upstream region but not the 
              ß-globin gene [57], which was shown to be completely normal [31, 
              64]. The other allele was expressed in the patient and it was therefore 
              not a lack of trans-acting factors which silenced the mutant chromosome 
              but an important control region had be missing. A set of developmentally 
              stable, hypersensitive sites, 5' HS 1, 2, 3 and 4, were shown to 
              be present upstream in the deleted region, and these Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the ß-globin locus. 
              Boxes indicate the different genes which are all transcribed from 
              left to right. The vertical arrows indicate DNase hypersensitive 
              sites. Thefour arrows mark the LCR containing 5' HS 1, 2, 3 and 
              4 upstream of the epsilon-gene. Fig. 2. Schematic representation of the developmental 
              expression patterns of globin genes in human and mouse. The curves 
              refer to the ß-like genes only were potential candidates for such a locus control region (LCR; 
              Fig. 1) [17,27 ,60]. Linkage of this region to a cloned ß-globin 
              gene resulted in erythroid-specific high-level expression of the 
              gene in transgenic mice and in tissue culture cells. This expression 
              is dependent on the copy number of the transgene and independent 
              of the integration site in the host genome [3, 27], a phenomenon 
              which had not previously been observed in transgene expression. 
              This posed two questions: How is independence of the site of integration 
              achieved? And how is the LCR involved in globin gene switching? 
              Position independence and copy number dependence can theoretically 
              be explained by at least two independent mechanisms; either positive 
              activation by the LCR is always achieved, overriding position effects 
              that could be present, or (and) the region contains a locus border 
              element(s) (LEE) that insulate it from neighbouring regions. Matrix 
              attachment sites (MAR) [22, 30] or " A " elements [4, 53] could 
              be LEEs, and we initially speculated these were part of the LCR 
              in addition to activating sequences [27]. However, preliminary experiments 
              indicate that this is not the case and that such a border may be 
              located further upstream. The latter is based on the fact that the 
              DN aseI sensitivity of chromatin is strongly decreased in the sequences 
              25 30 kb 5' to the LCR (Fig.1) [19, 31, 57]. At least 150 kb of 
              chromatin in the 3' direction is sensitive under the control of 
              the LCR [19], suggesting that such sequences are not present for 
              a considerable distance 3' (Fig.1). The position independence we 
              observe is therefore due to a dominant activation of transcription 
              by the LCR, perhaps by creating very stable interactions between 
              the LCR and the genes. Consequently, positive position effects would 
              only be present in the background and only become apparent in situations 
              where the linked gene is suppressed [12] (see below for discussion). 
              Position effects are not observed at low levels of expression when 
              part of the LCR or mutations in the LCR are used. This indicates 
              that the interaction between the LCR and the promoter is dominant 
              except when the promoter is suppressed [10, 12, 18, 20, 49, 54]. 
              In agreement with the deletion observed in a Hispanic y ß-thalassaemia 
              (Fig. 1) [13], the main activity of the LCR is associated with HS2, 
              3 and 4 [10, 18, 20, 54, 61], which can each activate a linked transgene, 
              independent of the site of integration. A number of protein binding 
              sites have been mapped to these fragments, in particular, sites 
              for two erythroid-specific factors and several ubiquitously expressed 
              factors. A number of the binding sites are present in all three 
              active sites (Fig. 3) [43, 45, 55]. One of the shared factors is 
              the erythroid/megakaryocyte-specific factor GATA-1 [38,48], which 
              has been shown to be essential for erythroid development [42]. Deletion 
              of GA T A-1 binding sites prevents erythroid-specific induction 
              of the ß-glo bin gene [ 11 ], and the protein has been shown to 
              have transcriptional activation properties [38]. However, the presence 
              of GATA-1 binding sites per se is insufficient to give position-independent 
              expression, e.g. the flanking regions of the human ß-globin gene 
              contain at least six GATA-1 binding sites [11,63], but do not confer 
              integration site-independent expression [32,34,58]. However, all 
              three active 5' HS contain two closely spaced GA T A-1 sites in 
              opposite orientations. This arrangement is also observed in the 
              chicken ß-globin enhancer, which appears to provide position-independent 
              expression [47]. Possibly an inverted double GATA-1 site is a key 
              component in erythroid -specific, posi tion -independent activation 
              and GA T A-1 can interact with itself or one of the other GA T A 
              proteins to achieve this [ 66] .Classical enhancer activity is only 
              associated with 5'HS2 [41, 61], and not with the others. Dissection 
              of the HS 2 showed that a number of proteins are bound to the core 
              fragment (Fig. 3) [55]. Attention has been focused on a double consensus 
              sequence for the jun/fos family of DNA binding proteins which appeared 
              crucial for HS 2 activity [41, 52, 55]. Several pieces of evidence Fig.3. Summary of factor binding sites to the minimal 
              fragment of 5'HS2, 3 and 4, which provide position-independent expression 
              in transgenic mice. Individual factors are described in the text. 
              Black boxes indicate erythroid-specific factors; open boxes indicate 
              ubiquitous factors. GT indicates a GT -rich motif [43] show that the functional activator which interacts with the jun/fos 
              binding site is NF-E2, originally described as interacting with 
              another erythroid-specific gene, that for porphobilinogen deaminase 
              [39, 40]. Two NF-E2 molecules and at least one other protein binding 
              at two nonequivalent sites are involved [56]. However, the presence 
              of this double NF-E2 sequence alone is insufficient to provide high 
              levels of expression [55] and when the jun/fos binding site is removed 
              from the 300 bp core fragment, HS2 retains the ability to activate 
              a linked ß-globin gene in a copy number dependent fashion, albeit 
              at low levels (Fig. 4) [56]. We therefore conclude that the 5'HS2 
              NF-E2 region has strong enhancer activity but that it is not necessarily 
              required to obtain position-independent globin gene activation. 
              All the other factors which have been shown to interact with LCR 
              sequences, including the factors H-BP and J-BP, are ubiquitous proteins 
              [56]. This suggests that a combination of erythroid-specific and 
              ubiquitous factors may be required to render the ß-globin gene independent 
              of its site of integration. The (abundant) ubiquitous factors shared 
              by the three HS of the LCR which have been studied to date are Sp 
              1 and TEF -2 [23, 65], but a simple multimerized combination of 
              a GATA-l and a Spl/TEF-2 binding site is not functional (S. Philipsen, 
              unpublished results). We therefore think that other, as yet less 
              well characterised factors may be involved in LCR function. The LCR and Disease The discovery, characterization and mapping of the LCR has enabled 
              the pursuit of two novel approaches to the study of globin-related 
              diseases. Firstly it allows high-Ievel expression of disease genes 
              such as the ß gene which is responsible for sickle cell disease. 
              By linking this gene in combination with human alfaglobin genes 
              several laboratories have succeeded in producing transgenic mice 
              which show sickle cell disease [26, 50, 59]. High levels of human 
              haemoglobin Scan be obtained in mice and the RBC of these mice show 
              a pronounced change in shape when deoxygenated (Fig. 5). We are 
              presently improving this model for two reasons, firstly, to study 
              the effects of sickle cell disease on the progression of infection 
              by different malaria strains, and secondly, to be able to study 
              the progression of sickle cell disease and the treatment thereof 
              by new protocols, in particular the development of gene therapy. 
              The latter has been given new hope by the mapping of the minimal 
              elements that give the full activity of the LCR. The LCR can now 
              be incorporated into retroviral vectors to develop therapy protocols 
              and preliminary experiments (F. Meyer, personal communication) indicate 
              that the LCR will provide high levels of expression in this context 
              in mice. Fig. 4. S 1 nuclease analysis of HS 2 constructs containing 
              the NF -E2 sites (13) or not (1113) in transgenic mice. Foetal liver 
              RNA (day 13.5) was assayed using a mixed probe S 1 nuclease experiment 
              using the 5' human ß-globin probe and the mouse ß maj probe [56]. 
              Specific activities were 10: 1 for H u ß : M ß .Protected products 
              are indicated on the left. The 200 series of transgenic mice contains 
              the 1113 construct and the 300 series contains the 13 construct. 
              Copy numbers are shown in parentheses. Lower pnael depicts a quantitation 
              experiment of the S 1 protection analysis using the Huß5' probe 
              and a mouse alfa-globin probe as an internal control. The % expression 
              is given as the total Hu ß-globin signal divided by the total mouse 
              alfa-globin signal (adjusted for specific activities). This was 
              plotted against the copy number. The line represents the result 
              of a linear regression analysis on the data points. The R value, 
              the correlation coefficient, indicates very high correlation with 
              a straight line (R = 1 ). The dashed line in the 1113 graph represents 
              the minimallevel that can be measured accurately Developmental Regulation of the ß-Globin Locus Genetics. The study of globin gene switching has been assisted by the characterization 
              of deletions and point mutations which affect expression of the 
              y and ß-genes. Point mutations in the ypromoters have been linked 
              to HPFH phenotypes and these can be divided into two groups (Fig. 
              6). Those clustered around the distal CAA T box appear to result 
              in the loss of factor binding sites [21, 36], suggesting that this 
              region may contain a binding site for a negative regulator. For 
              example, a 13-bp deletion which removes the distal CAA T box results 
              in a very strong HPFH (60%) [25]. Interestingly, a recently described 
              Japanese HPFH (20%) is associated with a point mutation in the CAA 
              T sequence of the distal CAA T box Fig. 5. Sickle cell disease in transgenic mice. The top 
              line shows the arrangement of genes and the LCR that was injected 
              into fertilized mouse eggs to obtain transgenic mice. The top panel 
              shows sickled cells from one of the transgenic mice [26]; the bottom 
              panel shows control nontransgenic red blood cells Fig. 6. Summary of mutations occurring in the y-globin 
              promoter resulting in HPFH phenotypes (see [44]) [21] which reduces affinity for the transcription factor CP 1. The 
              -117 mutation associated with Greek HPFH ( 40% ) has been reported 
              to cause reduced binding of the erythroid-specific factor NF-E3 
              [36]. These findings suggest a model for y silencing in which factors 
              binding to the distal CAA T box (at -115) compete for interaction 
              with factors bound to upstream promoter sequences preventing the 
              proximal CAA T box (at -87) from forming such interactions. The 
              distal CAA T box is located outside the normal optimal position 
              for CAA T elements, and this is likely to prevent it from functioning 
              as an effective positive promoter element. One would expect this 
              type of silencing mechanism to depend on the topology of the promoter 
              region and it is also likely to be affected by the creation of extra 
              factor binding sites in the upstream sequences. Such sites may partially 
              bypass the competition between the proximal and distal CAA T boxes, 
              resulting in suboptimal transcription. Indeed, a second group of 
              mutations, upstream of -150, result in new or improved binding sites 
              for transcription factors, e.g. Sp1 [16,28] and GATA1 [35, 37]. 
              Activation of y transcription in the nondeletion HPFHs is associated 
              with down regulation oftheß-gene. The reduction in ß expression 
              (to around 60% in Southern Italian HPFH) is approximately equivalent 
              to the rise in expression of the cis-linked y-globin gene, with 
              only a slight reduction in overall transcriptional output from the 
              locus [24, 62]. This suggests that competition is taking place between 
              the genes and that this is tightly linked to the process of transcription. 
              However, a drastic reduction or loss of ß transcription due to point 
              mutations and deletions in the ß-promoter does not significantly 
              increase y expression (less than 5%; Fig.7) [44]. Clearly, a y-gene 
              exerts a negative effect on the ß-gene (coupled to transcription) 
              but this effect is not reciprocal. Some ß-gene deletions show higher 
              levels of y expression (Fig. 7) but these deletions are always large 
              (> 10 kb). Of these, the Ay delta ß thalassaemias all have deletions 
              which extend into the region of y transcription. They are uninformative 
              for competition models because enhancers found near the deletion 
              breakpoints may be responsible for the high level, pancellular y 
              expression observed in the deletion HPFHs [1, 15]. Some increased 
              y expression is also observed in the delta ß- and Dutch ß thalassaemias, 
              but the broad range of values between patients with the same deletion 
              and the heterocellular distribution of y-protein among the red cells 
              suggest that the increase in y expression is not solely at the transcriptional 
              level. This is supported by the observation that nontranscriptional	
              defects (e. g. RNA processing) in heterozygous ß-thalassaemias cause 
              elevated levels of y chains (up to 5 %). Selection of a small proportion 
              of cells expressing y is a likely mechanism for this increase. Deletion 
              of the delta-gene (which is normally expressed at only 2% 3% of 
              the level of ß) also does not seem to be required for the y-expression 
              observed in the delta ß-thalassaemias, since it is intact in Dutch 
              ß-thalassaemia, which has a very similar phenotype. Instead, the 
              requirement appears to be a minimum size of deletion (> 10 kb). 
              Probably these large deletions perturb the chromatin structure of 
              the locus, resulting in a small increase in y transcription which 
              is further amplified by the chain imbalance. In conclusion, the 
              genetic data show that strong downregulation of the ß-gene can result 
              from an increase of y-gene transcription, while there does not seem 
              to be any significant link between transcription of the ß-gene and 
              silencing of the y-genes in adult life. Fig. 7. Schematic representation of the different deletions 
              occurring in the ß-globin locus in thalassaemias and HPFHs. Black 
              bars indicate the size of the deletion; numbers in parentheses indicate 
              the levels of y-globin expression in heterozygotes Transgenic Mice. Attempts to study switching of globin genes have also made use of 
              transgenic mice as a model system. Mice do not possess separate 
              foetal globin genes but instead switch directly from embryonic to 
              adult ß-globin expression at 11-13 days of gestation (Fig. 2). The developmental regulation of the human epsilon-gene has been 
              analysed in both embryonic stem cells and transgenic mice. In mice 
              the epsilon-gene is expressed at high levels during the embryonic 
              stage only when linked to the LCR and is completely silenced thereafter 
              [33, 46, 51]. Based on the studies by Cao et at. deletion mutants 
              lacking the -200 to -300 promoter region show a small increase in 
              epsilon expression in adult transgenic mice but the low level indicates 
              that other sequences may also be involved in silencing epsilon (P. 
              Fraser, unpublished observations). The human y-transgene without 
              the LCR is expressed like the mouse embryonic genes [7, 32]. It 
              was initially reported that linkage to the LCR resulted in y expression 
              at all developmental stages and that the y-gene was silenced in 
              adult mice only when the ß-gene was also present. This appeared 
              to support a competition model where the ß-gene is required for 
              silencing of the y-gene [2, 14]. However, a different result was 
              obtained when the single y-gene experiments were carried out on 
              animals carrying only one or two copies of the LCR-y-gene con Fig.8. Microlocus (µLCR) y ß and ß y constructs 
              [29]. Genes are represented as shaded boxes. All genes are in the 
              same trancriptional orientation, 5' to 3', with respect to each 
              other and the LCR. The dotted LCR lines indicate the situation in 
              multicopy animals to illustrate the distance from a promoter to 
              a 5' and 3' LCR. These distances are indicated by dotted lines below 
              the constructs. Plus and minus symbols indicate high, medium, and 
              very low levels of expression struct. y expression persisted in the early foetal liver, but was 
              silenced at adult stages, independent of the presence of the ß-gene 
              [12]. Transcription of the LCRlinked y-gene can therefore also be 
              blocked completely by stage-specific negative regulators acting 
              on the sequences immediately flanking the gene, and this removes 
              the basis of the argument that the ß-gene would be needed for y 
              silencing. The elements responsible for y silencing have not yet 
              been identified but the mutations associated with the nondeletion 
              HPFHs suggest that at least the sequences around the distal CAA 
              T box are likely to be involved (see above). The availability of 
              a transgenic mouse model for y-gene silencing should allow this 
              to be tested and possibly lead to novel approaches for treating 
              thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia. If y-gene expression were 
              understood at the level of the transcription factors, it might be 
              possible to develop novel therapies that could specifically interfere 
              with the adult suppression of the y-gene and alleviate the clinical 
              problems associated with severe chain imbalance or sickling. Linkage 
              of the adult ß-gene to the LCR results in inappropriate expression 
              at the embryonic stage [2,3, 14,29,33], albeit at a low level. Placing 
              a y-gene or a human alfa globin gene between the ß-gene and the 
              LCR blocks this expression [2, 14, 29], supporting the idea that 
              competition plays a role in preventing premature ß expression. However, 
              when the order is reversed and the ß-gene is placed in the first 
              position, it is expressed at a level similar to that observed for 
              the ß-gene in the absence of the y- or alfa-gene (Fig. 8) [29]. 
              Silencing of the ß-gene at the embryonic stage is therefore not 
              caused by reciprocal competition only, but relative distance between 
              the LCR and the genes (i.e. position and polarity) is also important. 
              Polarity in the locus has long been suggested by the fact that the 
              genes are arranged in the order of their expression during development. 
              The order of the genes is conserved among mammals but there is some 
              divergence in the other vertebrate loci. In chicken, the embryonic 
              epsilon- and delta-genes are located at opposite ends of the locus, 
              with the adult ß-genes between them. However, it is important to 
              note that the chicken ß-globin LCR may have been split as part of 
              an epsilon translocation such that part of it is located between 
              the ß- and epsilon-genes [8,47] and that the epsilon-gene contributes 
              only 20 % of the total embryonic haemoglobin compared to 80% for 
              delta [5]. The data reviewed above indicate that developmental regulation 
              of the human Fig. 9. Model for stage-specific regulation of the genes 
              of the ß-globin locus. Solid lines indicate activation of genes 
              by the LCR. The symbol O indicates stage-specific negative factors 
              silencing the gene. The location of these is not accurate and there 
              may be more than one factor for each gene ß-globin locus is a complex process which centres around developmentally 
              specific suppressors and the polarity of the locus (Figs. 9, 10). 
              The earliest gene to be activated, the epsilon-gene, is also the 
              one closest to the LCR. The y- and ß-genes may be suppressed by 
              competition with epsilon; alternatively, or in addition, the y- 
              and ß-genes may bind embryonic stage-specific factors which keep 
              their promoters suppressed. The epsilon-promoter is silenced in 
              the foetal liver by one or more suppressor factors, negating its 
              competitive ability (Fig. 9). As a result the y-genes are expressed, 
              and they in turn keep expression of the ß-gene suppressed by competition. 
              The y-genes are switched off during the period around birth, again 
              by stagespecific negative regulators, and as a consequence the ß-gene 
              is activated and expressed in the bone marrow. We propose that loop 
              formation between regulatory elements is the crucial parameter to 
              explain the suppression of the late genes by the early genes at 
              early stages but not vice versa. The frequency of interaction between 
              the promoters and the LCR will depend on the effective volume in 
              which these elements operate. This effect would be most pronounced 
              if the LCR and the genes were all present on one structural chromatin 
              loop several times the distance between the LCR and the genes. The 
              fact that the LCR controls DNase hypersensitivity of the ß-globin 
              locus over at least 150-kb [19] suggests that the entire ß locus 
              may be present on one very large chromatin loop. If we assume that 
              to be the case, the frequency of interactions between any of the 
              promoters with the LCR would be proportional to their effective 
              concentration relative to the LCR (Fig. 10). On basis of ring closure 
              probabilities with naked DNA, the effective concentration of two 
              points on the DNA will be related to the volume of a sphere and 
              will be proportional to the power of3/2 of the distance. Applying 
              the rule to the ß-locus, the ß-gene is twice as far as the Gy-gene 
              from the HS 2 enhancer of the LCR. Therefore, the ß-gene occupies 
              an approximately eight-fold larger volume relative to the HS-2 enhancer 
              of the LCR than the Gy-gene, which should give it a three-fold lower 
              frequency of interaction with the LCR (Fig. 10). This effect will 
              work in favour of the proximal gene, decreasing the affinity differences 
              required for competition, but it will work against the distal gene. 
              Distal genes would be incapable of suppressing upstream genes under 
              similar circumstances unless the downstream gene promoter increased 
              its affinity by several orders of magnitude relative to the upstream 
              gene. The transgenic mouse data on the expression of the ß-globin 
              gene at the embryonic and foetal/adult stages argue strongly against 
              this possibility. Instead, the problem is solved by local suppression 
              of the upstream promoters to allow expression from the downstream 
              gene (Fig. 9). Experiments to substantiate or disprove this prediction 
              are presently in progress. Fig.l0. Schematic representation of the relative volumes 
              occupied by the Gy- and ß-genes relative to the LCR. For simplicity

              of the sphere. Only half the ß-globin gene outer sphere is shown References 1. Anagnou NP, Perez-Stable C, Gelinas R, Costantini F, Liapaki
