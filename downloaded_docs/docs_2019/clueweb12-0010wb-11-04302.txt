ALETRIS Scottsdale | Acupuncture ACUPUNCTURE at Aletris Center in Scottsdale, AZ The ancient Chinese believed that there is a universal life energy called chi or qi present in every living being. This energy is said to circulate throughout the body along specific pathways called meridians. As long as qi flows freely throughout the meridians, health is maintained; once the flow of energy is blocked, the system experiences imbalance and pain and illness occur. Acupuncture works to restore optimal functioning by stimulating certain points on the meridians in order to free up or unblock the qi energy. From a biochemical perspective, we know that acupuncture has many positive effects on the body. It increases the body's natural production of endorphins, stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (which shuts down in chronic stress), and increases blood flow to local areas.
