Search This Website Login Login Feverfew Tea Feverfew has a well-documented historical use mentioned by the  Greek herbalist Dioscorides, English physician Culpeper and the famous  herbalist John Hill. The traditional uses of this herb have covered many ailments, but it  was not until 1973 at the suggestion of a friend, Mrs Anne Jenkins of  Wales started taking three fresh leaves of feverfew to relieve recurrent  migraines. Her favourable findings eventually lead Dr Stewart Johnson, a  migraine specialist, to start a detailed survey. Today there have been  at least six randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical  studies confirming the benefits of feverfew, in the prevention of  migraine headaches. Medicinal Use Clinical studies show that feverfew (when taken regularly) reduces  the frequency and symptoms of migraine headaches. It may also be taken  for the symptomatic relief of tension headaches. For best results take  feverfew for a few months or longer, if required.
