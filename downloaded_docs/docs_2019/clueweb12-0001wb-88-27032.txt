I had a number of health problems including allergies, insomnia, and high levels of stress and anxiety from my work situation. I often found myself lying awake at night unable to sleep. It seemed that the less sleep I got, the more other health problems began to arise. However, I did not want to have to take sleeping or other medications to get through this difficult time in my life. Eastern medicine seemed like my last chance. When I first came to see Sharon, she took a very thorough initial evaluation, asking lots of questions about my general health and history. The whole process was so comprehensive---very different from other doctors I have been to before. Sharon quickly determined that certain systems in my body, like digestion, were in a sense "victims" of my stress and anxiety. She first worked to get those back in check by administering weekly acupuncture treatments and then herbal medicine. Sharon worked closely with me until I felt like my old self again. She is very knowledgeable and really looks at the body as a whole. She is also an extremely caring and compassionate practitioner. I would highly recommend her to others!
