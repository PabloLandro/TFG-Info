These drugs include carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam. None of these medications are considered better than the others for treating muscle pain. If your doctor determines that muscle relaxers are the best course of treatment for you, he or she will decide which drug to prescribe to you based on the side effects associated with the different medications, how well you tolerate each of the drugs, and the medication's cost. What Are Muscle Relaxants? Muscle relaxants have the ability to affect skeletal muscle function and decrease muscle tone. Muscle relaxants are effective at easing muscle spasms because they have a sedative effect. Rather than work directly on the muscle that is experiencing the spasm, these medications depress the central nervous system, causing the entire body to relax. For this reason, muscle relaxers are also known as sedatives. What Are Muscle Relaxants Used to Treat? Muscle relaxers are used to treat pain and spasms. Exactly how they relieve pain is not entirely understood, but it is believed that by relaxing painful muscle spasms, pain in the area is reduced overall. The idea is that pain causes muscles to seize up, or spasm, and then the spasm itself leads to reduced motion and increased pain. Muscle relaxers are often given to you shortly after the onset of your back pain. They are also sometimes prescribed to help ease muscle tension and speed the progress of physical therapy. However, in most cases, muscle relaxants are limited to short-term use. They are often prescribed along with narcotic pain relievers, acetaminophen or one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). NSAIDs have been proven to be especially effective for back pain, in part because they reduce inflammation as well as relieving pain. Common Side Effects of Muscle Relaxants Typically, physicians do not prescribe muscle relaxers for long-term use. One reason for this is that some muscle relaxants carry a risk of dependency, especially with long-term use. Muscle relaxers may not be the right choice for people who have a history of drug or alcohol dependence. In addition, these medications are not recommended for use by pregnant women, older people or those suffering from depression. Since most muscle relaxers affect the central nervous system and operate by relaxing the entire body, drowsiness and dizziness are very common. Anyone taking muscle relaxers should not drive or operate machinery while taking them. Many people find it is best to take their medication before going to bed. Other common side effects include dry mouth and urinary retention. All muscle relaxers have adverse effects, but because several different types of drugs are used as muscle relaxers, some people may be able to tolerate some of them better than others. Since some side effects can lead to serious complications, like heart failure or paralysis, it is important that you communicate with your doctor about any unusual symptoms you have while taking muscle relaxers. You should also make sure that your doctor knows about any other medications you are taking. Deciding if Muscle Relaxants Are Right for You If you have acute back pain accompanied by muscle spasms, tell your doctor about your symptoms and ask whether muscle relaxants might be a good treatment option for you. Your doctor can help you determine the best course of treatment for your back pain and spasms.
