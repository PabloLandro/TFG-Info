Managing Your Child's Eczema How to Have 'the Talk' Font Size A A A Whooping Cough (Pertussis) - Treatment Overview The aim of treatment is to make
		 symptoms less severe and reduce the spread of infection to close
		 contacts. Whooping cough is generally treated with antibiotics , which may help shorten the course of the
		 disease if they are taken early in the first stage of illness. But they may not
		 be prescribed right away, because it's hard to tell the difference between the
		 first symptoms of whooping cough and the symptoms of a common cold . As symptoms
		 progress, they become more distinctive of whooping cough. Antibiotics are
		 usually given at this point. Antibiotics can help reduce the spread of
		 infection while you are waiting for PCR or culture results to confirm the diagnosis. Results may
		 take up to 10 to 14 days to get back. Family members and others who have had
		 close contact with someone infected with whooping cough are usually prescribed
		 antibiotics before any symptoms start. Recommended Related to Children Prevent Lead Poisoning Lead poisoning occurs over many months or years of exposure to lead in the
environment. It is especially harmful to children under 6, and more so for
children under 3.
In children, lead poisoning can stunt growth, cause brain damage, kidney
damage, hearing damage, and can permanently damage mental development. In
adults, it can increase blood pressure, cause digestive problems, kidney
damage, nerve disorders, sleep problems, and muscle and joint pain.
Poisoning can be determined by a test... Read the Prevent Lead Poisoning article > > Severe coughing spells can
		 significantly decrease the blood 's oxygen supply. If a pulse oximeter measurement finds that blood oxygen
		 levels are low, oxygen may be given for a short time through a nasal cannula or an oxygen mask. Infants,
		 especially those younger than 4 months, are typically hospitalized.
		 Hospitalization allows health professionals to make sure the baby is getting
		 enough fluids and nutrients. Also, the baby is monitored and evaluated for how
		 well he or she tolerates and recovers from coughing episodes. If needed, a baby
		 also may receive oxygen therapy and have mucus suctioned from his or her nose
		 and throat. Because suctioning mucus may trigger coughing spells, it is only
		 done in certain situations. Emergency treatment Call 911 or other emergency services immediately if a person stops breathing, turns blue, or becomes
			 unconscious. Start rescue breathing immediately or follow instructions given by
			 emergency services while you wait for help. For more information, see the
			 Rescue Breathing section of the topic Dealing With Emergencies . WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise Last Updated:
