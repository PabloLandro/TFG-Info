His wealth of knowledge helps Petsecure pet insurance with products, ongoing claims and advice to members, such as: Dear Dr. Webster , We have a new puppy - an 8 week old golden poodle who's adorable, which we got from the breeder at 7 weeks. We're crate-training her and she's doing very well with the toilet training. However, she's gotten into the habit of biting us all the time, especially our youngest daughter. We tell her a firm NO, but nothing works. Would you have any suggestions? Also, what are the signs to look for that she's ready to be let out freely in the rest of the house? She now spends most of her time in her crate, her play area in the mudroom and the backyard. Dr. Webster says : It is normal for puppies to nip and chew as they get there teeth. All you can do is give one thing to play and chew and keep it simple. Discourage her from biting and she will stop in time. It usually takes a few months to completely train a pup. I would give her access to more space in the house on a limited and progressive basis in an area where least damage can be done. ﻿﻿If you have any questions or concerns about your pup, email Dr Webster at: askavet@petsecure.com For more information about your pup's health, training or caring needs, visit Petsecure's Pet Healthipedia at: www.pethealthipedia.com ﻿ Go comment! Healing Your Pet: Common types of alternative therapies covered by Petsecure pet insurance by 
                Mika Sanson
                 | Mar 20, 2011 For some, the most common ways of managing pain or healing disease is through modern medicine. A visit to the doctor, a drug prescription along with a healthy diet and exercise may be a solution to better health.  For others, who suffer from aching joints, tight muscles, back pain or serious illness, a drug prescription may not be enough. Humans have discovered other forms of therapy that focus on healing problematic areas using manual therapy. Over the years, these types of therapies have been proven to help our furry loved ones as well. As alternative therapy became increasingly recommended by the veterinarian community to help heal animals, Petsecure pet health insurance recognized the importance of this type of therapy and offers this type of coverage to all their members. Here are some of the most common types of alternative therapies for pets: PHYSIOTHERAPY Similar to human treatment, physiotherapy is used for prevention and rehabilitation of injured muscles and joints.  Physiotherapy is usually recommended for tissue injuries, fractures and trauma or after surgery. The techniques used to help heal the wounded area include stretches, heat and ice treatment, ultrasound and underwater treadmill activity to help strengthen the muscles with little strain or pressure. Physiotherapy is used to help alleviate discomfort caused by hip dysplasia, arthritis, joint deformities, back pain and spinal surgery. CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic therapy focuses on aligning the vertebrae so that the rest of the body, from nerves to muscles and joints, performs in its ideal state. Chiropractic therapy may be required if your pet is showing signs such as discomfort while sitting, sensitivity to touch or abnormal posture while standing. One technique used to help the veterinary chiropractor with treatment is with the help of a new instrument called the ‘Activator’. This spring loaded instrument, similar to a syringe in appearance, when deployed gives a shock-like feel to help set the alignment in place. Through repeated treatments and specific stretches, chiropractic therapy helps to relieve tension and realign the body. MASSAGE Massage therapy is a versatile treatment used for relieving discomfort, aiding in metabolic and other digestive conditions and soothing after abuse or trauma. Massage therapy encourages healing through blood flow, tension relief, loosened muscles and stimulated nerves. Overtired and overworked muscles are manipulated using either long and slow strokes or deep pressure strokes. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment, sometimes hot and cold treatments are incorporated to help loosen muscles, reduce swelling or relieve tension, all in an effort to regain a healthy strong status. It’s important to note, massage therapy doesn’t heal disease. It simply offers relief. In some cases, a veterinary massage therapist may incorporate acupuncture for further treatment of pain relief. ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture derives from traditional Chinese medicine and has been in existence for over 3,500 years. By using smooth, thin needles, inserted into specific pressure points in the affected area, the nerves become stimulated, increasing blood flow and redirecting energy within the body to heal itself. Because it offers short term relief, acupuncture does require repeated treatments and is usually combined with massage therapy and physiotherapy, depending on the veterinarian. Hip dysplasia, digestive conditions and epilepsy are some conditions that have been treated with acupuncture.  Studies have shown positive changes in a pet’s personality after acupuncture treatments; however research is ongoing to determine the effectiveness of this treatment in relation to the healing process. Other forms of Alternative Therapy There are two less common forms of alternative therapies that are worth noting, due to their increasing popularity and recent research. Homeopathy is a more organic way of treating an unhealthy body. It focuses on balancing energy levels within the body so that the body can heal itself. By consuming plants, herbs, vitamins and minerals and following a natural diet and eliminating processed foods, some believe that this is an effective and safer way of treating disease. VetStem RC Regenerative Cell Therapy is being researched due to its controversial findings. Stem Cell Therapy involves extracting valuable cells from a pet’s harvested fat and given back to the pet to help heal their disease. This treatment is used to help mobility in arthritis sufferers and in pets with joint and ligament injuries. Some researchers believe this is a risky procedure as there are no guarantees that the regenerated cells are indeed healthy and therefore may cause more harm than good. Alternative therapy aids in the healing process of your pet’s health. Each form of therapy requires repeated treatment which can range from months to years, depending on the severity of your pet’s condition. Alternative therapy requires a recommendation from a veterinarian to determine which form of therapy is best for your pet’s condition.

Petsecure pet insurance - Celebrating all things Irish on St. Patrick's Day including our favourite breeds! by 
                Mika Sanson
                 | Mar 16, 2011 Today, as we celebrate St Patrick’s Day, we thought we’d also take this time to celebrate some of our favourite Irish dog breeds. Meet some of the most popular Irish breeds insured with Petsecure pet insurance (and one not so common breed)!  All with a history and background of work and companionship, they can make great pets for the right family! Most Common Irish Breeds insured by Petsecure pet insurance. Irish Setter (Red and White) The Irish Setter is an energetic breed and can be difficult to train, though excellent with children and non-aggressive. The name ‘setter’ refers to its common crouching stance when prey is near, whereas ‘red’ or ‘white’, in the name, refers to the colour of if its coat. Irish Setters are known for roaming, therefore being confined to an apartment will make the Setter hyperactive and destructive. They do much better with room to run! Some common ailments of the Irish Setter are hip dysplasia , bloat, metabolic bone disease, perianal fistulae, melanoma and osteosarcoma. Irish Wolfhound The Irish Wolfhound dates back to 100BC. One of the first purebred dogs, the Irish Wolfhound is known to have travelled with Christopher Columbus. The Irish Wolfhound has a laid back personality, is very quiet, rarely barks and is a true gentle giant. The Wolfhound is a dog of great dignity and cannot bear to be laughed at. Similar to other Irish breeds, some common ailments the Irish Wolfhound are bloat, metabolic bone disease, cardiomyopathy, and osteosarcoma. Irish Water Spaniel The Irish Water Spaniel has been known since the 1800s. It’s known as the clown of the dog world, upbeat, cheerful, great with kids and has a great sense of humour. The Irish Water Spaniel, of course, loves water. Their feet are webbed and their coat is oily and repels water. The Irish Water Spaniel can be prone to hip dysplasia , follicular dysplasia and severe skin and thyroid problems. A Not so Common Irish Breed insured by Petsecure pet insurance. The Glen of Imaal Terrier The Glen of Imaal Terrier became recognized by the CKC only recently in 2009. Due to its height and size, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is a good ‘ground’ dog and was used to chase badgers and fox. Its short, bowed legs were ideal for working the dog wheel – a treadmill device used to churn butter or turn meat on a fire. The Glen of Imaal Terrier is easy-going, excellent with children, intelligent and good natured. This is a dog with lots of pep and little bark. Its coat is non-shedding, making it an ideal breed for families with allergies. Unlike other Irish breeds, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is a fairly healthy breed and generally doesn’t suffer from the common ailments as the others.

True Tail: Petsecure pet insurance helps a 2 year old pup with a skin condition, hip dysplasia and epilepsy! by 
                Mika Sanson
                 | Mar 15, 2011 Truman suffered from a skin condition, hip dysplasia and was diagnosed with epilepsy,all by the age of 2! Read how Petsecure pet insurance helped to make sure he and his family were... All taken care of. Dear Petsecure, When I got my brand new lab puppy in January of 2000 I thought he would be my perfect puppy. I got him from a very reputable breeder and thought he would be as healthy as a horse. I was horrified when at 7 months of age his hips started clicking and cracking. X-rays revealed he had hip dysplasia. We consulted with a specialist and it was decided to do corrective surgery. He had both hips done by the time he was 1 year old and to add to my horror he was now diagnosed with a very severe skin mass which has now been removed 3 times. To top it all off he was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 2. Because of Petsecure, my beautiful boy runs and plays with the best of them, is now 16 months in remission from the skin disease, and has been seizure free for 1 year. There is no way that he would even still be alive if I hadn't signed up for this plan. I wouldn't have been able to pay for his surgeries and treatments on my own. Thanks Petsecure for giving my dog the chance to live. Jan Kitchener, ON Tell us how Petsecure pet insurance helped you!
