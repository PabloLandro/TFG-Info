Honey that heals is antibacterial, antimicrobial and antiseptic and has been proven to be useful in treating a wide range of ailments and injuries. Studies have shown that honey is an effective treatment for cuts, wounds, burns, bites, eczema, fungal infections, psoriasis, ulcers, sore throats, cholesterol problems, digestive upsets and arthritis. For severely infected wounds, there really is no treatment like a strong manuka honey(20+ UMF). There are also no side effects like those you can experience when using antibiotics or other drugs or chemicals. There's an enzyme in honey that produces hydrogen peroxide, which we all know as a strong disinfectant. This is one reason honeys have such high antimicrobial, antibacterial and antiseptic properties. Hydrogen peroxide is also partly responsible for regulating oxygen supply to cells, so it helps speed up the healing process. The overall viscosity of healing honey means that it can get through infections. It will also provide a protective barrier over wounds without damaging the skin by sticking and it is water-soluble. Honey is packed with vital nutrients that are needed for tissue to regenerate in a healthy way. The amino acids, minerals, vitamins and sugars are invigorating and stimulate collagen production in the skin as well as supporting the growth of new capillaries. The ph level also encourages wound healing. And you thought it was just something sweet to put in your tea! And that's not even all it does! Healing honeys have anti-inflammatory actions, reduce pain and odor and are excellent for cleaning wounds. It is a fantastic dressing for burns and ulcers and some surgeons prefer it to any other modern day dressings. Taking an active manuka honey is a fantastic idea for people who just feel unwell. If you are someone who experiences an upset stomach, indigestion, constant coughs and flues or skin breakouts and irritations, you should take at least a 10+ UMF selection according to the directions. Elderly people who are ill and have trouble sleeping can have manuka honey in warm milk half an hour before bed and they will find they sleep the best they have in ages. Many people report noticing the effect instantly, like hundreds of little bees buzzing around repairing cells and fighting germs. Apart from the hydrogen peroxide, active manuka honey has secondary antibacterial activities that are measured by the UMF scale. They range from 1-20, with any honey over 10 UMF being considered as active. This secondary antibacterial activity is seemingly indestructible and is unaffected by time, heat, light or cold. It can kill Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori and E. coli. It is used as an effective treatment for any persistent bugs that are resisting antibiotics and is a proven aid for allergy sufferers. Initially, most healing honeys will recommend a dose taken four times a day. However, once you have recovered, you can take your honey medicine once a day. It is a good idea to start with a 10+ UMF manuka honey when using internally and gradually work up from there. For wounds or ulcers, you can use the highest rated product. The higher the active content, the more expensive it is, but you usually require less of the stronger products. Always ensure your healing honey has been certified by the appropriate regulations and given a genuine activity rating. Honey's that heal are a miracle of nature. They can be given as medicine once a child turns one and are a fantastic treatment for the elderly who are fragile and unable to cope with toxic medications. Adding a good active manuka honey to your daily health routine will stop any potential germs in their tracks. You will feel revitalized and your immune system will become more robust.
