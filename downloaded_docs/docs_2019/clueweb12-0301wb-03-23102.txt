Drug Nutrient Interactions Current research does not indicate that this supplement should be taken to avoid depletions when taking any of the drug categories included in this table. Current research does not indicate that this supplement provides additional therapeutic benefit's when taking any of the drug categories included in this table. Anticoagulants / Antiplatelet Drugs Green tea contains vitamin K which can compromise the therapeutic effects of warfarin and increase the risk of clotting.  Conversely, caffeine in green tea may have antiplatelet activity.  Due to these opposing and complex effects, use with caution if combining green tea with anticoagulants. Oral Hypoglycemics (Antidiabetic Drugs) Green tea catechins have been reported to decrease serum glucose concentrations and caffeine in green tea may increase glucose utilization.  Monitor blood glucose levels closely and adjust dosing for  oral hypoglycemic agents or green tea supplement if necessary. Antihypertensive Drugs Caffeine in green tea can increase heart rate and blood pressure and thus compromise the benefits of some antihypertensive drugs.  Monitor for changes in therapeutic efficacy of antihypertensive therapy and discontinue supplement if necessary. Acid-Suppressing Drugs Tagamet (cimetidine) can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine in green tea and significantly reduce its clearance, increasing the potential for caffeine-related adverse effects. Antibiotics Advise patients that fluoroquinolone antibiotics can reduce the clearance of caffeine and theophylline (present in green tea) and may increase risk of associated side effects.  Side effects from caffeine and theophylline include nervousness, insomnia, and palpitations. Oral Contraceptives Oral contraceptives can decrease caffeine clearance by 40-65% and may increase the adverse effects of caffeine in green tea (as well as other sources of caffeine.)  Be aware of potential side effects and reduce dose or discontinue supplement if necessary. Asthma Medications Caffeine in green tea may increase the risk of side effects (nervousness, agitation, anxiety, insomnia) from beta agonist bronchodilators.  Use with caution in patients being treated for asthma. Drugs for Weight Loss The caffeine in green tea may increase the risk of side effects (nervousness, agitation, anxiety, insomnia) from drugs that have "stimulant" properties like appetite-suppressants (Meridia, Tenuate, etc.)  Caution patients of potential for additive side effects if using with appetite-suppressing drugs. Current research does not indicate that this supplement should be avoided when taking any of the drug categories included in this table. Nutrition and Health State There may be interactions between certain vitamins, minerals, supplements, or herbs with prescription medications used for this health state.  View the drug interaction section for more information. Oral Contraception Oral contraceptives can decrease caffeine clearance by 40-65% and may increase the adverse effects of caffeine in green tea (as well as other sources of caffeine). Hypertension (high blood pressure) Caffeine in green tea can increase heart rate and blood pressure and therefore could compromise the health status of those with hypertension. Blood clotting/ thrombosis Green tea contains vitamin K which can compromise the therapeutic affects of warfarin and increase the risk of clotting. Conversely, caffeine in green tea may have antiplatelet activity. Due to these opposing and complex effects, use with caution if combining green tea with anticoagulants. back to top Home | About Us | Contact Us | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions Vitamin Information | Herb Information | Minerals Information | Dietary Supplements Drug Herb Interaction | Continuing Education Pharmacy Programs | Site Map ©2003-2009 Pharmavite® LLC.
