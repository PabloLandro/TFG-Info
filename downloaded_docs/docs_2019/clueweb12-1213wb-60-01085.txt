Scientific Proof for Stop Smoking Hypnosis Smoking Cessation Hypnosis (Excerpts)

 A comparative review of the effectiveness of hypnosis, an advanced
  method of hypnosis, and other interventions used for the cessation of
  smoking. by Michael O' Driscoll B.Sc., M.Sc. (Oxon) This paper presents some of the findings from a
  study looking at all methods of smoking cessation, including standard
  hypnotherapy techniques and compares those to a specially developed advanced
  method of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. High quit smoking rates for hypnosis compared to other methods A larger meta-analysis of research into hypnosis
  to aid smoking cessation (Chockalingam and Schmidt 1992) (48 studies, 6,020
  subjects) found that the average quit rate for those using hypnosis was 36%,
  making hypnosis the most effective method found in this review with the
  exception of a programme which encouraged pulmonary and cardiac patients to
  quit smoking using advice from their doctor (such subjects are obviously
  atypical as they have life-threatening illnesses which are aggravated by
  smoking and therefore these people have very strong incentives to quit). Table 1. Effectiveness of different types of intervention to achieve smoking cessation

  trials, carried out between 1975 and 1988, of hypnosis in smoking cessation.
  They found that the effect of hypnosis was highly statistically significant1. The research they
  examined involved 646 subjects and cessation rates at 6 months post-treatment
  ranged from 10% to 38% (the average figure was 24%). Table 2.

  Law and Tang confirms, to a large extent, the meta-analysis of Chockalingam
  and Schmidt (1992); in both cases hypnosis appears as the most effective form
  of intervention to achieve smoking cessation with the exception of groups who
  are highly motiviated to quit for medical reasons, such as those with
  existing heart or pulmonary problems. A more recent study, by Ahijevych et al (2000),
  produces a similar overall figure for the success of hypnosis. This study
  looked at a randomly selected sample of 2,810 smokers who participated in
  single-session, group hypnotherapy smoking cessation programs sponsored by
  the American Lung Association of Ohio. A randomly selected sample of 452 participants
  completed telephone interviews 5 to 15 months after attending a treatment
  session. 22 percent of participants reported not smoking during the month
  prior to the interview. Tailored Hypnosis—Taking It to the Next Level The results discussed so far indicate that when
  the bulk of random trials are considered hypnosis is shown to be the most
  effective intervention for achieving smoking cessation. Yet this is only half
  the story—many of the trials discussed so far have used very brief
  sessions, using standardised hypnosis techniques, many have in fact taken
  place in group sessions (making it difficult to tailor to each individual's
  needs) and have not necessarily been carried out by expert practitioners of
  hypnosis. If, under these circumstances, hypnosis can achieve such positive
  outcomes in terms of enabling smokers to quit, then what might be achieved
  using programmes of hypnosis which are carried out by expert hypnotists and
  are tailored to the needs of the individual who wants to stop smoking? Nuland and Field (1970) found an improvement
  rate of 60% in treating smokers with hypnosis . The increased effectiveness was achieved by a more personalised
  approach, including feedback (under hypnosis) of the client's own personal
  reasons for quitting. These researchers also employed a technique of having
  the client maintain contact by telephone between treatments and utilized
  self-hypnosis in addition. Von Dedenroth (1968) devised an innovative unique
  approach which appears to have been extremely successful. He began by
  inquiring how long the individual had smoked, whether they recalled why they
  had begun, whether they had ever tried to stop smoking, why they wanted to
  stop smoking at this particular point in time, what benefit, if any, they
  felt that they derived from smoking, at what specific times they felt the
  need most strongly (after meals, before breakfast etc.), and finally he asked
  them how many cigarettes they smoked. Von Dedenroth believed that answering
  these questions not only tended to increase rapport but also revealed, at
  least in part, the smoker's own feelings regarding his smoking and his
  reasons for wanting to give up the habit. The therapy proper did not begin
  until the second session, and at this time the smoker was told that 'Q Day'
  or 'Quitting Day' would be 21 days from that point. The smoker was also told
  to change his favourite brand of cigarettes and resolve to never smoke that
  brand again. The smoker is then told that they are not to smoke at all: Before breakfast For one half-hour after each meal For 30 minutes before retiring The smoker was told that, at the times mentioned
  above, he was to get into the habit of going to the bath-room, gargling with
  mouthwash and cleaning his teeth. He should have a glass of fruit juice upon
  awakening and he was told to notice the fresh feeling in his mouth in the
  morning and following each of these routines. After his breakfast, he was to
  clean his teeth again and use the mouthwash, paying close attention to the
  clean feeling in his mouth. Thirty minutes later he was allowed to have a
  cigarette, but not before. This tended to break the association between the
  taste of food and the inevitable cigarette that usually followed a meal. He
  was also told to get a small note-book to carry with him, and to write down,
  from time to time, his reasons for giving up smoking (physical, financial and
  personal). Then a trance state was induced and the above suggestions, given
  in the waking state, were repeated and consequently greatly reinforced.
  Following the trance, the patient was encouraged to ask questions, and the
  next appointment arranged. The third session occurred around one week later
  (and a week before 'Q day')—in this session the smoker was told that
  they should not drink alcohol at all, or at least to drink alcohol only with
  meals, with the intention of breaking the association between alcohol and
  smoking. A trance state is again induced and all the previous instructions
  reinforced. It is also suggested that smoking will no longer be enjoyable. In
  particular the smoker was told that the first puff of a cigarette may be
  enjoyable, the second less enjoyable, and the third may possibly irritate the
  nose, throat or chest. The aim of this is that by the time 'Q Day' arrives
  the smoker may only be taking a few puffs of each cigarette a day; as the
  number of cigarettes smoked, and the amount of each of those cigarettes
  smoked, has declined, then it should be less painful for the individual to
  quit. Von Dedenroth believed that the fact that the
  individual is able to reduce and stop smoking (with the aid of hypnosis)
  gives the individual a great feeling of self-accomplishment. 'Q day' begins
  with the induction of a trance state and it is emphasised continually to the
  smoker that bad habits have been replaced by good ones, and that for several
  weeks cigarettes have become more and more unpleasant. Von Dedenroth found that his use of hypnosis
  enabled 94% of 1000 subjects to stop smoking (when checked at 18 months) . Practice Builders Study (2000) This research was carried out on 300 subjects
  (beginning in January 2000 and continuing until March 2002) who responded to
  an advertisement. A 'blind trial' technique was used—subjects were not
  aware that they were taking part in a research project although they all
  ticked a box on their intake forms saying that they understood that the
  hypnotist's methods were always being measured tested and improved, and that
  results would be collated and studied. Client confidentiality was assured so
  that their data could be used but not their names and these subjects were
  randomly allocated to receive either 'standard' hypnotherapy or a special
  formulation of hypnotherapy which Practice Builders has termed 'advanced
  therapy'. 51% of respondents were male and 49% female; the median age of all
  subjects was 44 years. No respondents had previous experience of
  hypnosis—51% of subjects had tried nicotine patches, 14% had tried
  nicotine gum, 7% had tried acupuncture, 6% had tried using a nicotine inhaler
  and 30% had previously tried to quit using will-power alone. 11% of subjects
  had not previously tried to quit smoking. For all subjects: The client was interviewed to make sure that they
  wanted to stop smoking for their own reasons, and were not being pressured
  into it by someone else (doctor, loved one etc.). The price was kept high to establish commitment,
  and to avoid people who were casually or speculatively trying hypnosis (as
  opposed to those who have some commitment, confidence or belief that hypnosis
  would help them to stop smoking). Before the actual hypnosis, the client (or
  subject) is asked a series of questions about their smoking habit and their
  beliefs. They are asked, for example: - 'What fears do you have about stopping?' - 'What do you know about hypnosis?' Hypnosis was then fully explained to the client,
  as well as how the conscious and the subconscious mind works, and any myths
  debunked (such as, you cannot make someone do something they don't want to
  do, hypnosis is not sleep or unconsciousness, you will be aware of everything
  that is going on and will remember everything that happened in hypnosis after
  the session, you can stop the session at any time, etc.). This is called the
  "pre-talk". A hypnotic contract is then entered into, in which
  the client agrees to go along with all techniques and to accept all the
  suggestions that are for their benefit. For subjects treated with the standard technique: A basic stop smoking technique is used. This type
  of standard technique doesn't allow for much in the way of personalising a
  session, as it is the same for every client. The wording of some of the best
  basic techniques uses hypnotic language patterns (Neuro Linguistic
  Programming). The client is then emerged. For subjects treated with the advanced technique: Hypnosis is induced using a progressive test
  induction tailored to the client. Ideo motor techniques are used to gain
  subconscious communication. The client's own motivations, Meta programmes, and
  values are utilised in the session using a combination of metaphor and
  suggestion. NLP sub-modality and anchoring techniques are used according to
  the client's processing style. At the end of the session, the client is
  emerged from hypnosis and the change is tested, then future paced and
  ratified. Findings Quit rates were established through telephone
  interviews 1 month and 6 months after the first session of treatment. Of those who received 'advanced therapy', 95%
  had quit smoking after 1 session - considering working with a hypnotherapist in this fashion an easy way to stop smoking.
  The remaining 5% received a second session of treatment leading to a further
  1.3% of the group quitting smoking. In total therefore, at 6 months, 97%
  of those who received 'advanced therapy' had quit smoking . Of those who received 'standard therapy' 51% quit
  smoking after one session and a further 6% quit after a second session—a
  total of 57% had quit smoking at 6 months. Those who were still smoking at 6 months did not
  differ from those who had successfully quit in terms of gender, age or
  therapies previously tried. These results mean that for both standard
  treatments and the 'advanced treatment' quit rates are extraordinarily high
  and well above what has hitherto been reported in the literature. Results for
  both treatments were significant at the 0.001 level (chi-square). Outcomes for the 'advanced therapy' are
  considerably higher than any findings previously reported in the literature .
  In addition, the success rate achieved using the standard technique was
  considerably higher than expected and this may be due to the fact that the
  elements that the standard treatment and 'advanced treatment' have in common
  have powerful effects on outcomes. References/Bibliography Public health focus:
