Gestational diabeties is a common misspelling of gestational diabetes . Gestational diabetes is one of the most common health problems for pregnant women. The disease is treatable (especially if it is found early in the pregnancy), but health problems for the mother and fetus can occur if it is left untreated. Certain women are at an increased risk for gestational diabetes, including those who are overweight, have had the condition before, or have a family history of diabetes. Treatment should involve a meal plan, physical activity, and insulin (if needed). (Click Gestational Diabetes for more information about the causes, effects, and treatment of this type of diabetes. You can also click on the various links in the box to the right to access specific topics on gestational diabetes.)
