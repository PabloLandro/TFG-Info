< 25 years, normal prepregnancy weight, not a
                     member of an ethnic/racial group with a high prevalence of diabetes (e.g.,
                     Hispanic American, Native American, Asian American, African American, or
                     Pacific Islander), no known diabetes in first-degree relatives, no history of
                     abnormal glucose tolerance, and no history of a poor obstetric outcome. A
                     woman is considered intermediate risk if she does not fall into either the
                     high- or low-risk category. If a woman is high risk, glucose testing should be done as soon as
                     possible. If the initial testing is negative, the woman should be retested
                     between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. If she is intermediate risk, she should
                     undergo glucose testing at 24 to 28 weeks. If she is low risk, the ADA does
                     not recommend screening for
                     GDM. 1 - 3 An additional possible risk factor for GDM not mentioned in the list above is
                     a history of polycystic ovary
                     syndrome. 23 , 24 However, other studies have not confirmed this
                     finding. 25 , 26 The ADA recommends two approaches to screening for GDM if a woman has one
                     or more risk factors—a one-step or a two-step approach. The more
                     commonly used two-step approach involves initial nonfasting screening with the
                     50-g oral glucose challenge test, followed by a 1-hour serum glucose
                     concentration. If the glucose level exceeds the glucose threshold value on
                     this test, the patient is further evaluated with the diagnostic OGTT described
                     previously under diagnostic criteria. A 1-hour glucose value > 140 mg/dl
                     identifies ∼80% of women with GDM. A 1-hour glucose value > 130 mg/dl
                     identifies ∼90% of women with GDM, but it has a higher false positive
                     rate. 1 - 3 Either value is accepted by the ADA and the American College of Obstetricians
                     and Gynecologists (ACOG) as
                     abnormal. 1 , 2 , 27 The one-step approach requires a diagnostic OGTT without prior screening
                     with the 50-g 1-hour glucose challenge test. This may be cost-effective in
                     some high-risk patients. Of note, if a patient has a fasting plasma glucose
                     level > 126 mg/dl or a random plasma glucose level > 200 mg/dl, this
                     meets the threshold for diabetes mellitus and should be confirmed on a
                     subsequent
                     day. 1 - 3 Screening, whether it is universal or selective, remains a controversial
                     subject. Contradictory to the ADA recommendations described above, the United
                     States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was insufficient
                     evidence to recommend for or against screening for GDM. Although they found
                     fair to good evidence that screening and treatment of GDM reduced the rate of
                     fetal macrosomia, they found insufficient evidence that screening
                     significantly reduced important adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, including
                     outcomes related to macrosomia. In addition, they had concerns about the
                     potential harms and costs of screening, especially given the high
                     false-positive rate (> 80%) of the 50-g glucose challenge
                     test. 4 Previous Section Next Section TREATMENT Glucose Monitoring Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended for women with GDM. The
                     goal of monitoring is to detect glucose concentrations elevated enough to
                     increase perinatal mortality. The Fourth International Workshop-Conference on
                     Gestational Diabetes Mellitus recommends maintaining the following capillary
                     blood glucose values: preprandial glucose < 95 mg/dl, 1-hour postprandial
                     glucose < 140 mg/dl, and 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120
                     mg/dl. 3 ACOG
                     guidelines are the same except that the 1-hour postprandial glucose value is
                     considered acceptable at either 130 or 140
                     mg/dl. 27 Jovanovic-Peterson et
                     al. 28 suggest
                     guidelines that are a little stricter: fasting glucose < 90 mg/dl and
                     1-hour postprandial glucose < 120
                     mg/dl. 28 One prospective study of 668 patients (334 with GDM and 334 control
                     subjects) found that women with GDM who had a mean blood glucose level between
                     87 and 104 mg/dl had incidence rates of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)
                     and large for gestational age (LGA) infants comparable to the control group.
                     However, women who had mean blood glucose values < 87 mg/dl had a higher
                     incidence of infants with IUGR, whereas women who had mean blood glucose
                     values > 104 mg/dl had a higher incidence of LGA infants. This study
                     suggests that although it is important to treat hyperglycemia in GDM, it is
                     also important not to overtreat because this can increase the risk of
                     IUGR. 29 It is important for women to check postprandial glucose levels because
                     these have been shown to correlate more with macrosomia than do fasting
                     levels. The Diabetes in Early Pregnancy Study found that third-trimester
                     postprandial glucose levels were the strongest predictor of percentile birth
                     weight. 30 In women
                     with GDM who require insulin therapy, adjustments of their insulin regimens
                     based on postprandial, rather than preprandial, glucose levels decreased the
                     incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia, and cesarean delivery for
                     cephalopelvic
                     disproportion. 31 Medical Nutrition Therapy The goals of MNT are to provide adequate nutrition for the mother and
                     fetus, provide sufficient calories for appropriate maternal weight gain,
                     maintain normoglycemia, and avoid ketosis. In general, there is not an
                     increased energy requirement during the first trimester of pregnancy. However,
                     most normal-weight women require an additional 300 kcal/day in the second and
                     third
                     trimester. 32 In normal-weight women with GDM, the recommended daily caloric intake is 30
                     kcal/kg/day based on their present pregnant
                     weight. 33 In women
                     with GDM who are overweight (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ), a 33% calorie
                     restriction of their estimated energy needs is recommended (∼25
                     kcal/kg/day based on their present pregnant weight). This level of calorie
                     restriction is not associated with an elevation of free fatty acids or
                     ketonuria. 32 , 34 Some authors recommend further calorie restriction for women who are morbidly
                     obese. 33 However,
                     caution must be taken to avoid ketosis, which can be seen with more aggressive
                     calorie
                     restriction. 34 Ketonemia in mothers with diabetes during pregnancy has been associated
                     with lower IQ levels and impaired psychomotor development in their
                     children. 35 , 36 Monitoring with prebreakfast ketone measurements is recommended for patients
                     who are on a hypocaloric or carbohydrate-restricted
                     diet. 32 Carbohydrates should be distributed throughout the
                     day. 32 Eating three
                     small- to moderate-sized meals and three snacks per day is recommended.
                     Limiting carbohydrates to 40% of the total daily caloric intake has been shown
                     to decrease postprandial glucose
                     levels. 33 Further
                     limitation of carbohydrates at breakfast to 33% may be required to meet the
                     desired postprandial glucose goals because insulin resistance is greatest in
                     the morning. 37 In
                     addition, carbohydrate restriction to < 42% in patients with GDM resulted
                     in a decreased incidence of LGA infants, a decrease in cesarean deliveries for
                     macrosomia and cephalopelvic disproportion, and a decreased need for insulin
                     therapy compared to patients on a diet with a higher carbohydrate content
                     (45-50%). 38 Consuming carbohydrates with a low glycemic index also results in lower
                     postprandial glucose levels, especially late in
                     gestation. 39 Exercise The role of exercise in women with GDM has been controversial in the past
                     because maternal exercise on a bicycle ergometer has been associated with
                     fetal bradycardia. Subsequent small
                     studies 40 , 41 have shown small transient increases in fetal heart rate after maternal
                     exercise. There were no fetal complications in either study. Durak et al. 42 found that uterine activity, defined as contractions with an external
                     tocometer deflection of > 15 mmHg above baseline for > 30 seconds,
                     varied in response to different types of aerobic exercise, even at comparable
                     levels of exertion. The bicycle ergometer, treadmill, and rowing ergometer led
                     to uterine activity in 50, 40, and 10% of exercise sessions, respectively. The
                     recumbent bicycle and upper body ergometer did not lead to any increase in
                     uterine activity. Therefore, the authors concluded that the recumbent bicycle
                     and upper body ergometer were the safest forms of aerobic exercise for
                     pregnant women. In addition, they recommended teaching women to palpate their
                     uterus during exercise to detect subclinical contractions and to discontinue
                     the exercise if contractions occur. A potential benefit of exercise in women with GDM is improved glycemic
                     control. One small trial randomized women with GDM to diet and exercise with
                     an arm ergometer versus diet alone for 6 weeks. Researchers found that the
                     diet-and-exercise group had a significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin
                     levels and in both fasting and 1-hour plasma glucose levels during a glucose
                     challenge test compared to the diet-alone
                     group. 43 Another
                     trial, in which women with GDM were randomized to a partially home-based
                     exercise program, did not find any reduction in blood glucose level, although
                     the women did have an improvement in cardiovascular
                     fitness. 40 Based on
                     the potential benefits of exercise in women with GDM, the ADA recommends
                     starting or continuing a program of moderate exercise in women without medical
                     or obstetrical
                     contraindications. 2 Insulin Insulin therapy is the most commonly used treatment when MNT fails to
                     maintain blood glucose levels at the desired ranges or when there is evidence
                     of excessive fetal growth. Small studies have demonstrated a decrease in
                     macrosomia 44 , 45 as well as related morbidities including operative deliveries and birth trauma
                     in women with GDM who were treated with
                     insulin. 45 A large, prospective, population-based study of almost 2,500 women with GDM
                     compared the effect of intensive versus conventional management of GDM. The
                     women randomized to the intensive management group were given memory
                     reflectance meters and instructed to monitor their blood glucose seven times
                     per day (fasting, preprandial, 2-hour postprandial, and bedtime). The women in
                     the conventional management group were instructed to monitor four times per
                     day (fasting and 2-hour postprandial) in addition to weekly fasting and 2-hour
                     postprandial glucose measurements during clinic visits. Both groups were
                     treated with diet and insulin as needed to reach the following goals: overall
                     mean blood glucose 90-100 mg/dl, fasting blood glucose 60-90 mg/dl, and
                     postprandial blood glucose < 120 mg/dl. Overall, 66% of the women in the
                     intensive management group were treated with insulin versus 36% of women in
                     the conventional management group. This study demonstrated a decreased rate of macrosomia, cesarean section,
                     fetal metabolic complications, shoulder dystocia, neonatal intensive care unit
                     days, and respiratory complications in the intensive management group. Another
                     important consideration of this study is that GDM was defined as only one or
                     more abnormal OGTT values, rather than the current standard of two or more
                     abnormal glucose
                     levels. 46 Other
                     studies have also shown improvement in rates of macrosomia and other maternal
                     and fetal complications by treating women who do not meet the criteria for GDM
                     but who have evidence of impaired carbohydrate tolerance as determined by an
                     abnormal screening 50-g glucose challenge test and/or one or more abnormal
                     results on
                     OGTT. 47 - 49 Because there are no data demonstrating an optimal insulin regimen, the
                     type and dose of insulin must be tailored to meet each patient's
                     requirements. 3 , 27 Human insulin is currently recommended by the
                     ADA. 2 , 50 However, one study of 42 women with GDM diagnosed at 14-32 weeks of gestation
                     found that insulin lispro was as effective as regular insulin in controlling
                     glucose levels with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia. Anti-insulin antibody
                     levels were similar in the two groups. Additionally, the results of umbilical
                     cord blood in four patients who received continuous intravenous insulin lispro
                     and dextrose infusions intrapartum to assess placental insulin transfer did
                     not detect any insulin
                     lispro. 51 Although
                     insulin lispro appears to be safe in pregnancy if started after 14 weeks of
                     gestation, it is considered to be in Pregnancy Category B by the Food and Drug
                     Administration (FDA), and the official recommendation of the ADA is to use
                     human insulin until further studies verify the safety of insulin
                     lispro. 2 The short-term efficacy of insulin aspart was evaluated in a small study of
                     15 women with GDM during standardized meal tests. Although this study found
                     that insulin aspart was effective in decreasing postprandial glucose
                     concentration, further studies need to be done to ensure the safety of this
                     medication in pregnant
                     women. 52 Insulin
                     aspart is considered to be in Pregnancy Category C by the FDA. The use of insulin glargine in humans has only been reported in case
                     reports. There have been no clinical trials evaluating the use of insulin
                     glargine in pregnancy. It is currently considered to be in Pregnancy Category
                     C by the FDA. 53 Oral Agents Currently, oral hypoglycemic agents are not recommended by the ADA or
                     ACOG. 2 , 27 The older sulfonylureas chlorpropamide and tolbutamide could cross the
                     placenta, stimulate the fetal pancreas, and cause fetal
                     hyperinsulinemia. 22 , 54 However, the transfer of glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, across
                     the human placenta was insignificant in experimental
                     models. 54 , 55 This finding led to a clinical trial of 404 women with GDM randomized to
                     either glyburide or insulin therapy at 11-33 weeks of gestation. There were no
                     significant differences in glycemic control or adverse fetal outcomes. In
                     addition, glyburide was not detected in the cord serum of any infants in the
                     glyburide
                     group. 56 Smaller studies have also supported the safety of glyburide use in
                     pregnancy. 57 - 59 In one of these trials, women with GDM who were treated with glyburide had
                     fewer asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes compared to women with GDM treated
                     with insulin, although the clinical significance of these hypoglycemic
                     episodes is
                     unknown. 59 Thus, although glyburide appears to be safe in pregnancy based on the above
                     studies, it is important to recognize that these studies in aggregate are
                     small and not adequately powered to detect clinically important, relatively
                     rare outcomes in pregnancy. Furthermore, glyburide is considered to be in
                     Pregnancy Category C by the FDA, and therefore it is not currently recommended
                     by the ADA or ACOG until larger studies confirm its
                     safety. 2 Another
                     potential concern with the use of glyburide in GDM is possible impairment of
                     myocardial ischemic
                     preconditioning. 60 Metformin has also been used to treat pregnant women with GDM. A
                     retrospective cohort study found an increased prevalence of preeclampsia and
                     perinatal mortality in women treated with metformin. However, the women in the
                     metformin group were more obese and older, and their treatment was begun later
                     in gestation. 57 Recent studies involving women with polycystic ovary syndrome or women with
                     type 2 diabetes who continue metformin in pregnancy have found no adverse
                     pregnancy
                     outcomes. 61 , 62 Although previous studies have been small, there is an ongoing prospective,
                     randomized controlled trial in New Zealand and Australia comparing metformin
                     with insulin in women with GDM. This study will help to answer questions about
                     the safety of metformin during
                     pregnancy. 62 Metformin is listed as Pregnancy Category B by the FDA. Previous Section Next Section ANTEPARTUM FETAL ASSESSMENT ACOG recommends antepartum fetal assessment in women whose blood glucose is
                     poorly controlled, who require insulin therapy, who have a history of an
                     adverse obstetrical event, or who have a history of a hypertensive disorder.
                     Providers can determine which type of antepartum test to use (biophysical
                     profile, nonstress test, or contraction stress test). The role of antepartum testing in women with well-controlled GDM is less
                     clear. 27 The
                     recommendations of the Fourth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational
                     Diabetes Mellitus are to consider nonstress testing starting at 32 weeks of
                     gestation in patients on insulin and at or near term in patients managed by
                     diet alone. 3 Recent trials have assessed the usefulness of fetal ultrasounds to help
                     guide the management of patients with GDM. One study found that a fetal
                     abdominal circumference > 70th percentile at 30 weeks of gestation was
                     associated with an increased risk of
                     macrosomia. 63 A
                     subsequent trial randomized 199 women to management based on maternal glycemia
                     alone or glycemia plus ultrasound. The glucose thresholds for the initiation
                     of insulin differed in the two groups. The thresholds in the glycemiaalone
                     group were fasting glucose repeatedly > 90 mg/dl or 2-hour postprandial
                     glucose > 120 mg/dl. The thresholds in the glycemia-plus-ultrasound group
                     were fasting glucose > 120 mg/dl, 2-hour postprandial glucose > 200
                     mg/dl, or fetal abdominal circumference > 75th percentile. Ultrasound
                     examinations were performed at entry and every 4 weeks starting at 20 weeks of
                     gestation. Researchers found that neonatal outcomes were equivalent and
                     proposed that including fetal growth in the assessment of women with GDM may
                     decrease glucose testing in low-risk pregnancies. Therefore, antepartum fetal
                     assessment with ultrasound may play a role in the future management of
                     patients with
                     GDM. 64 Previous Section Next Section PERIPARTUM CONSIDERATIONS When glycemic control is acceptable and there are no other known
                     complications, routine delivery before 40 weeks of gestation is not
                     recommended. 27 One
                     randomized trial of women with insulintreated diabetes (93% of whom had GDM)
                     found that although induction of labor at 38 weeks of gestation resulted in a
                     smaller proportion of infants who were large for gestational age, there was no
                     difference in the rates of cesarean delivery or shoulder
                     dystocia. 65 If a
                     delivery is indicated before 39 weeks, pulmonary maturity should be assessed
                     by amniocentesis before induction if
                     possible. 27 The rate of cesarean deliveries is much higher in women with GDM compared
                     to women without GDM. The increase in rate is higher than would be expected
                     based solely on the associated obstetric complications. Therefore, part of
                     this increase is likely influenced by physician knowledge of a history of
                     GDM. 13 ACOG
                     recommends counseling women about the possibility of cesarean section without
                     labor when the estimated fetal weight is > 4,500 g. If the estimated fetal
                     weight is 4,000-4,500 g, additional risk factors for shoulder dystocia, such
                     as clinical pelvimetry, progression of labor, and patient's past delivery
                     history, should be
                     considered. 27 Previous Section Next Section POSTPARTUM CONSIDERATIONS Women with GDM have an increased risk of developing diabetes, most commonly
                     type 2 diabetes, after pregnancy. Although follow-up studies on the cohort of
                     patients used to derive the O'Sullivan and Mahan criteria for GDM found
                     diabetes in 50% of women who had previously had
                     GDM, 27 the reported
                     prevalence varies. A recent systematic literature review of 28 studies found
                     that the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes ranged from 2.6 to > 70%
                     in studies with postpartum follow-up ranging from 6 weeks to 28
                     years. 66 A
                     meta-analysis calculated the relative risk for developing diabetes after GDM
                     to be 6.0 (95% CI
                     4.1-8.8). 67 Factors associated with an increased risk of progression to diabetes within
                     5 years of the diagnosis of GDM include gestational age at diagnosis, the
                     level of glycemia at diagnosis and at the first postpartum assessment,
                     impairment of β-cell function, obesity, and further
                     pregnancy. 3 Ethnicity may also be a risk factor for progression to diabetes. However,
                     further studies are needed to clarify this
                     issue. 66 Maternal glycemic status should be reclassified 6 weeks or more after
                     pregnancy ends and every 3 years thereafter as either diabetes mellitus,
                     impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or
                     normoglycemia. 1 Normal values for a 2-hour OGTT are fasting < 100 mg/dl and 2-hour
                     post-75-g glucose load < 140 mg/dl. Glucose values that meet the criteria
                     for diabetes mellitus are > 126 mg/dl or 2-hour post-glucose load > 200
                     mg/dl. Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance fall between
                     these thresholds. All patients with a history of GDM should be educated about
                     MNT, exercise, maintenance of normal body weight, the need for family
                     planning, and symptoms suggestive of hyperglycemia. Previous Section Next Section CONCLUSION GDM is a common medical problem that results from an increased severity of
                     insulin resistance as well as an impairment of the compensatory increase in
                     insulin secretion. Pregnancy, in essence, serves as a metabolic stress test
                     and uncovers underlying insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. GDM is
                     associated with a variety of maternal and fetal complications, most notably
                     macrosomia. Controversy surrounds the ideal approach for detecting GDM, and the
                     approaches recommended for screening and diagnosis are largely based on expert
                     opinion. Controlling maternal glycemia with MNT, close monitoring of blood
                     glucose levels, and treatment with insulin if blood glucose levels are not at
                     goal has been shown to decrease fetal and maternal morbidities. In addition,
                     certain types of exercise appear to have potential benefits in women without
                     any contraindications. Other treatment modalities, such as oral agents, need further study to
                     validate their safety and efficacy. Additionally, more research on the use of
                     antepartum fetal assessment to help guide treatment in women with GDM is
                     needed. Finally, postpartum management of women with GDM is critical because of
                     their markedly increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future. Previous Section Next Section Footnotes Tracy L. Setji, MD, is an endocrinology fellow; Ann J. Brown, MD, is an
