freedentalsealantforkids Panhandle Health District 8500    N. Atlas Road         Hayden, Idaho  83835 www.phd1.idaho.gov FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Date:     February 26, 2009 Contact: Released  by: Jeanne Bock, Director Shari Williams Public Health Dental Hygienist Panhandle Health District (208) 659-7335 Free Molar Protection for Area Children Panhandle Health District (PHD)  will provide protection for the permanent molars of eligible children ages 6 to  12 who live in and around Post Falls, Rathdrum, Athol and Spirit Lake  on March 6, 13 and 14. PHD will  provide the $200 service free thanks to generous grants from the Panhandle  Public Health Foundation—Project Health--and Kiwanis International. Eligible  children have no dental insurance, Medicaid coverage or a regular dentist. They  also have no fillings on the chewing surfaces of their permanent molars. PHD’s  dental hygienist will brush a dental sealant—antibacterial material—onto the  tooth surfaces. The sealant greatly reduces the risk of cavities occurring on  the chewing surfaces. Appointments  are necessary. Children’s molars will be screened. Sealants will go on if  permanent molars are not filled or decayed. A parent or guardian must be  present to give consent for the treatment. PHD will  offer the sealant service on: Friday, March 6, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Rathdrum Senior Center. Friday, March 13, from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at  Dentistry for Kids, 1027 W.    Prairie Ave. in Hayden. Saturday, March 14, from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at  Dentistry for Kids
