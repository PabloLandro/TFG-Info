Quick Asthma Remedy There are many asthma remedies that you can probably count on during times of emergency. But aside from relieving your attacks asthma remedies can also be considered a crucial partner along with your conventional medication, strengthening your bodys natural immunity making you more resilient to flare-ups and episodes. The only difficult part with be in the determination of remedies which would work well for your particular condition because there are so many too choose from and not everything is effective, others might actually be dangerous. Try looking up asthma remedies in the internet and you will be returned with millions upon millions of sites offering home remedies, alternative medications, herbal concoctions, and more. Of course it would be impossible to look up each and every result one by one, to make things easier here are a few things that you would probably want to keep in mind. First look for home remedies or remedies that do not make up more than three combinations of ingredients. The more ingredients present the higher the chances of you getting a different reaction from it (and not a good reaction at that). Secondly, youd want to be open-minded and rational when looking for possible remedy candidates. Look into the rationality of why a certain herb or combination can be effective and do not depend on the guarantees and claims that are being offered. Thirdly and most importantly, take your safety into the highest account before jumping into treatment. Ask your doctor if what you have chosen is indeed effective or not and why. There are a lot of good herbal remedies that are available out there and just to give you an idea, here are a few things that you might want to look further into: Coffee: The caffeine present in coffee belongs to the Xanthine chemical group containing Theophylline and Theobromine. Theophylline in particular is a powerful bronchodilator that has been used for many years in treating asthma. Drinking about two cups of hot, strong coffee (preferably brewed) can help ease your symptoms or bring your attack under control by constricting the blood vessels, relieving inflammation and breaking down mucus allowing air to flow in and out of the lungs easier. Daily intake of coffee has also been found to minimize the chances of attacks and flare-ups from occurring in asthmatics. Honey: Honey has also been used by more asthmatics as an emergency reliever as compared to other home remedies. Putting a jug of honey (preferably non- tampered, all natural, non-imported) under the nose when symptoms show can prevent further worsening by acting as anti inflammatory and expectorant. Drinking milk mixed with two teaspoonfuls of honey every night can also prevent attacks and flare-ups from happening. So as you can see, it does not really require complicated combinations of herbs or other ingredients in order to make a quick asthma remedy effective. All you need is rational thinking, common sense and proper research to find out which might work for you best.
