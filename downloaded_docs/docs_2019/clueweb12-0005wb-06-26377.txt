Cinnamon got its name from the Greek word ˜kinnamomon’, meaning spice. The early Greeks obtained the word from the Phoenicians with whom they had trade relations. Ancient people used cinnamon both as a spice  and medicine. Currently, cinnamon is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and food industry on account of its various therapeutic properties. Benefits of Cinnamon: The healing ability of cinnamon comes from 3 active components: cinnamyl acetate, cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde. Listed below are some therapeutic uses of cinnamon: Improves Blood Circulation: Experts believe that cinnamon can help in improvingÂ  circulation of blood because of the presence of cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde can prevent platelet clumps, thereby promoting improved blood circulation. Improved blood circulation is necessary to ensure normal supply of oxygen to the body. Fights Infections: The anti-microbial property of cinnamon inhibits the growth of bacteria, fungi, etc. This property can help in preventing urinary tract infection, gallbladder infection, etc. A Powerful Brain Tonic: Experts suggest that cinnamon can act as a powerful brain tonic. This can improve the activities of the brain cells and can aid in reducing nervous tension. Controls Blood Sugar: Experts believe that cinnamon can treat type 2 diabetic patients. These type of patients develop insulin resistance. The compounds in cinnamon can help inÂ  restricting such enzyme activities that can make insulin receptors inactive. This can help in promoting insulin activity and ensures better absorption of glucose. Prevents Colon Cancer: It is suggested that the presence of calcium and fiber in cinnamon can prevent colon cancer. Excess bile salts can damage colon cells. Calcium and fiber can bind with bile salts and help in removing them from the body, thereby treating colon cancer. Treats Arthritis: It is suggested that the anti-inflammatory property of cinnamon can be effective in treating arthritis. Cinnamon can give relief from pain and swelling. It can also help in reducing stiffness of joints and muscles, thereby treating arthritis. Improves Digestion: It is suggested that cinnamon can also help in improving digestion. Cinnamon helps in expelling gas from the stomach and intestine. Cinnamon can also help soothing the walls of the intestine and stomach, relieving spasm, thereby treating diarrhea. It is advised that topical application of concentrated cinnamon oil should be avoided as this can cause skin irritation and other effects. It can only be used in its diluted form after being tested on a sensitive skin.
