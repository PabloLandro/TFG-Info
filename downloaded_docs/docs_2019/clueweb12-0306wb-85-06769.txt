Two ops been done and the skin has just died again.No underlying infection samples came back clear.Anyone had a similar problem?

After numerous tests, biopsies, courses of anit biotics etc it is still there.  We manage it with pain relief and he's ok. Sorry I can't be more positive, hopefully you'll find something that helps.

If nothing else your dog will probably enjoy licking it off!

The elbow is a difficult spot - you can't put any sort of dressing on it I would imagine.  The honey will certainly not do any harm.  Sending healing thoughts.

Honey used to be used on gladiators' wounds in ancient times, my aunt used it on a septic leg wound with fast results.  I have used it as emergency treatment at a weekend (dog bite) with my vet commenting on the lack of infection and carry to on with it.

It was used on injuries in WW1 as well, sometimes along with spider webs over open wounds.  Manuka honey is better though.

Getting a bandage to stay on is the hard bit.

How about putting on a t-shirt with one leg in ech sleeve and then taping the bottom part of the sleeve to avodi it being pulled up, that should stop the dog from licking the honey off the ulcer.
