Link between low back pain and bowel motility The latest study shows a link between low back pain and 
						bowel motility December 2nd, 2005 A t 
						the annual meeting of North American Spine society in 
						Philadelphia Sergio A. Mendoza-Lattes, M.D. suggested 
						that Patients with low back pain have a significantly 
						greater prevalence of bowel motility disorders, “Our 
						findings suggest that nervous pathways involved in 
						relaying pain in the lumbar spine affect the 
						transmission of sensations from the bowels, causing 
						bowel motility disorders”. This findings resulted by 
						studying 59 patients with low back pain and 39 patients 
						with shoulder pain who were seen at the orthopedic 
						clinic at the University of Iowa. The patients with low back pain were 2.2 times more 
						likely to have bowel motility disorders than the 
						patients with shoulder pain, a statistically significant 
						difference, Dr. Mendoza-Lattes , an orthopedic surgeon 
						at the University of Iowa added. The patients with low back 
						pain were also 2.3 times more likely to use 
						antidepressive, antianxiety, or mood-altering 
						medications, but the use of these medications showed no 
						correlation with the prevalence of bowel motility 
						disorders. Among the patients with 
						low back pain, the use of opiates was linked with a 
						significantly reduced prevalence of bowel motility 
						disorders. Among those using narcotics, 25% had bowel 
						disorders, compared with a 62% prevalence among those 
						not using opiates. This finding suggests that the link
