She would break off a piece whenever she had chapped hands and rub the aloe vera gel on her hands to heal them. There's nothing fancy about this natural soap because there is nothing added to color the soap that might possibly be irritating to extremely sensitive skin. Aloe Vera contains saponins which are antiseptic fighting bacteria, viruses, fungi and yeasts. Aloe Vera contains salicylic acid which is also anti bacterial and anti inflammatory. Aloe is rich in antioxidants.
