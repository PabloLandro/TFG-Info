I have suggestion ways, in other articles, to do this by changing your diet. Any straining and puffing you do to push hard or even soft stools out during a bowel movement will aggravate your piles and can lead to bleeding and pain. When completing a bowel movement, make sure you are using the softest tissue available so that when you clean yourself you don't scrape or aggravate your piles. You can also use pre-moisten tissue. Just make sure that the tissue you use is not colored or scented because these chemical additives can aggravate your piles. You may have to take a shower a couple times a day to keep your rectum area clean. Here are three natural remedies that you can use to aid in eliminating your piles. Aloe Vera Aloe Vera gel is an astringent that helps to heal open wounds. It is useful in piles by applying the gel directly onto your anus. The best type of gel for this is directly from the aloe plant. If you don't have one, then 100% organic whole leaf aloe gel is second best. You can get this organic aloe at a health food or nutrition store. If you have a fresh plant, wash a leaf thoroughly with distilled water. Peel it on one side, bend it with the peeled side outward, and slip it into your anus. This will provide you with pain relief and reduce your piles bleeding. Just trim down the leaf so it slides into your anus easily. Aloe Vera juice, that you drink, is also good for piles. It helps to soften your stools and to activate peristaltic action. If you like aloe juice, then drink around 1/2 a cup of Aloe Vera juice three times a day. You can add 1/4 or 1/3 part aloe juice to a cup of apple juice to make the taste easier to handle. To make this aloe-apple juice more effective, add 10 drops of barberry extract. Barberry is an astringent for blood vessel congestion along the colon and rectum. It will improve blood circulation; it stimulates the immune system to resist disease, and will tone body tissues. It also is capable of stopping bleeding piles. #1 Doctor Recommended Remedy People Said About Calmovil Hemorrhoids Treatment " a week ago i was in agonizing pain. i was exausted and desparate for help. i though i would need a surgery, but i just couldn't imagine any sharp object anywhere near my butt. so i got calmovil. after 4 days my hemorrhoid got smaller and THE PAIN WAS GONE!
