Celebrity Smokers Quit the Smart Way: With Stop-Smoking Hypnosis Smoking WILL Kill Your Looks: Here’s How Stop Smoking Methods: Quitting With a Plan By Jeff Kolas If you’ve been trying to quit smoking and surfing the web to find the best stop smoking methods, you might be feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of stop smoking products, programs, methods to stop smoking, tips for quitting smoking, and smoking cessation aids that are out there. It’s a little hard to quit when you keep wavering between options and don’t even know where to begin. So, if you want to have success and to stop smoking now, the most important thing is to choose one and stick with it. Cold Turkey For anyone who truly wants to quit, cold turkey is the simplest and most straightforward method, but it’s also the most difficult. You have to be ready to face several days or even weeks of pure misery, but this is equally true of most stop smoking methods . But you can do things to make it better. For instance, you can quit smoking with a spouse or a trusted friend, which gives you an instant support network that keeps you strong and determined even through your weak moments. You can also take some time off work to barricade yourself inside, or you can just go out into the wilderness on a long camping trip, if you’re into that sort of thing. Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine replacement therapy is supposed to help you quit smoking by delivering nicotine to your body through alternatives to cigarettes. Nicotine gum and the patch are the two most well-known types of nicotine therapy, and both can be bought over the counter. There are also lozenges, nasal sprays, and inhalers. The problem with these stop smoking products is that they only address your smoking, while leaving your actual addiction unaffected. And since they just don’t provide the same type of satisfaction and the pleasurable routine of cigarettes, these products rarely work for people who aren’t ready to quit. Hypnosis to Quit Smoking Smoking hypnotherapy , which can be done either through a hypnotherapist or on your own at home, is one of the most effective stop smoking programs. Rather than only dealing with the symptoms of your addiction, it gets down deep into your unconscious mind and alters your attitudes toward cigarettes and smoking. You can quit smoking for free with the smoking cessation hypnotherapy sessions offered on this site. Pills and Natural Remedies A few prescription antidepressant drugs—namely Zyban, Pamelor, Chantrix, and Aventyl—have been approved by the FDA to help people quit smoking. Of course, the problem with these pills is that you have to deal with doctor visits, copays, and side effects, and then there’s no guarantee that they’ll work. Many people reported excellent results using natural stop smoking aids for nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Among the most popular stop smoking products of this kind are Miracet and Smoke Deter . Acupuncture and Laser Therapy to Stop Smoking One is low-tech and traditional, and one is high-tech and new, but acupuncture and stop smoking laser therapy operate under the same principal. Both are designed to help you relax while also releasing the same type of brain chemicals that nicotine stimulates. They’re applied at specific pressure points that are thought to produce the greatest effect. The main problem with these stop smoking methods is the cost. Both can range into the hundreds of dollars. Professional Consultation Finally, there are people such as addiction treatment specialists and stop smoking coaches who can help you get to the bottom of your addiction issues while also assisting you in a planned method for quitting. Sessions with these advisers can cost a lot, and many insurance companies don’t cover this type of thing, but they’re great as a last resort for anyone who doesn’t mind spending money to beat their addiction.
