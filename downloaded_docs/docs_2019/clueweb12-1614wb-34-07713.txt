Many skin diseases cause symptoms similar to those of eczema, so it is important to have the disease
properly diagnosed before it is treated. Symptoms Eczema is characterized by scaling, thickened patches of skin that can become red and fissured. It may also appear as tiny blisters (called vesicles) that rupture, weep, and crust over. The most troublesome and prevalent symptom of eczema is itching, which may be constant.

All of the patients studied had been resistant to conventional treatment. 2 Eating Right Diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life.
