Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes fluid to collect 
in the air sacs (alveoli). Symptoms include: labored breathing rapid breathing sometimes painful breathing coughing fever, sometimes with chills. Most rattly breathing is not pneumonia. Your child needs to see a 
healthcare provider to check if he or she has pneumonia. What is the cause? Pneumonia may be caused by viruses or by bacteria. Viral pneumonia is usually milder than bacterial pneumonia. 
Bacterial pneumonia tends to occur more suddenly and cause higher 
fevers (often over 104°F, or 40°C). Pneumonia is usually a complication of a cold. Although colds can 
be passed from person to person, bacterial pneumonia is not 
considered contagious. How long does it last? Before antibiotics were available, bacterial pneumonia was 
dangerous. With antibiotics it improves within 24 to 48 hours. On 
the other hand, viral pneumonia can continue for 2 to 4 weeks. 
Recovery from viral pneumonia is gradual but complete. Most children with pneumonia can be cared for at home. Admission 
to the hospital for oxygen or intravenous fluids is required in 
less than 10% of cases. Most children admitted to the hospital are 
young infants or children whose lungs are extremely affected (as 
shown on an X-ray). Recurrences of pneumonia are rare. How is it treated? Antibiotics Children with bacterial pneumonia need an antibiotic. Your 
    child's antibiotic is_____________________________. Give 
    ______________ every ______ hours. Continue the antibiotic for 
    ______ days. Give the medicine even if your child is feeling 
    better. Only bacterial pneumonia is helped by antibiotics. Antibiotics 
    will not kill viruses. However, your child's provider may 
    start him on antibiotics because it is often not possible to 
    know if pneumonia is caused by bacteria or a virus. Medicines for fever Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for fever 
    (over 102°F, or 38.9°C). This can be repeated every 4 to 
    6 hours. These medicines can also help chest pain. Warm fluids for coughing spasms Coughing spasms are often caused by sticky secretions in the 
    back of the throat. Warm liquids usually relax the airway and 
    loosen the secretions. Offer your child warm lemonade, apple 
    juice, or herbal tea. Children over 1 year old can sip warm 
    chicken broth. Encourage your child to drink a lot of fluids. In addition, breathing warm moist air helps to loosen up 
    sticky mucus that may be choking your child. You can provide 
    warm mist by placing a warm wet washcloth loosely over your 
    child's nose and mouth. Or you can fill a humidifier with warm 
    water and have your child breathe in the warm mist it 
    produces. Avoid steam vaporizers because they can cause burns. Don't give cough suppressant medicines (such as those 
    containing dextromethorphan) to children with pneumonia. 
    Coughing helps protect the lungs by clearing out germs. If the 
    coughing lasts for more than a couple of days, check with your 
    child's healthcare provider. Humidity Dry air tends to make coughs worse. Use a humidifier in your 
    child's bedroom. No smoking Tobacco smoke makes coughs worse and last longer. Don't let 
    anyone smoke around your child. In fact, try not to let 
    anybody smoke inside your home. Remind a teenager with 
    pneumonia that if he or she smokes, the cough will last weeks 
    longer. When should I call my child's healthcare provider? Call IMMEDIATELY if: Breathing becomes more labored or difficult. Your child starts acting very sick. Call within 24 hours if: The fever lasts over 48 hours after your child starts taking 
the antibiotic. The cough lasts over 3 weeks. You have other questions or concerns. Written by B.D. Schmitt, MD, author of "Your Child's Health," Bantam Books.
