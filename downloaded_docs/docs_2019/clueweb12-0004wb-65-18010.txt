Feverfew Feverfew ( Tanacetum parthenium ) Perennial Common names: Featherfoil, Featherfew, Midsummer
        Daisy, Bachelor's Buttons, Flirtwort Family: Compositae Range: Indigenous to Europe, North America,
        Australia History: Many herbalists believe that feverfew
        gets its common name from a corruption of febrifuge , a term
        indicating the presence of fever-reducing properties.  Feverfew has
        enjoyed a wide variety of medicinal uses, including being valued as a
        tonic, blood purifier, digestive and stimulant.  It has also been
        used as a wash for wounds, as a tranquilizer, an antiseptic, to cleanse
        after a tooth extraction, and to check intestinal parasites and
        gynecological disorders.  Today, the most common medicinal uses of
        feverfew are limited to treating migraine, arthritis, rheumatism, fever
        and allergies. Feverfew (certified
        organic) Feverfew is also used as an insecticide.  Bees, in particular,
        object to feverfew and commercial applications of insecticides may
        include Pyrethrum. The efficacy of feverfew in treating migraine is fairly well
        documented.  In one double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized
        study involving 72 subjects, the effect of one daily feverfew capsule
        after four months evidenced a significant reduction in severity and
        frequency of migraine. Feverfew extract has also shown an ability to inhibit blood
        aggregation and serotonin (5-HT) secretion by platelets. It also
        inhibits mast cell release making it useful in treating certain
        allergies. Constituents: Volatile oil (0.75%), including L-camphor,
        transchrysanthyl acetate, camphene, p-cymene, gamma-terpinene, linalool,
        borneol, terpinenes-4-ol.  Also contains sesquiterpene lactones
        (particularly parthenolide), flavonoids, polyynes (in fresh material). Cautions : 
        It is possible that feverfew preparations can interact with
        thrombolytics, anticoagulants and platelet aggregation.  There is a
        high degree of sensitization with skin contact.  Sometimes,
        gastrointestinal discomfort is experienced with internal dosages. 
        High levels in skin tissue can result in toxic and irreversible
        inhibition of smooth muscle contractility. Home | Library | Book
