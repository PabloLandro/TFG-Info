Epidemiology
Lateral sprains represent 80-85% of Ankle Sprains
Sports with highest rate of Ankle Sprain
Basketball
Ice skating
Soccer
Mechanism
Ankle Inversion with Plantar Flexion
Pathophysiology
Anatomy
See Ankle Anatomy
Lateral ankle ligaments (In order of injury)
Anterior talofibular ligament (ATF): Easily injured
Calcaneofibular ligament (CF)
Posterior Talofibular ligament (PTF): Rarely injured (third degree sprain)
TibioFibular Ligaments
See High Ankle Sprain
Anterior tibiofibular ligament
Posterior tibiofibular ligament
Medial ankle ligament
See Medial Ankle Sprain
Ankle Deltoid Ligament (rarely injured, but associated with serious ankle injury)
Associated Conditions: Other associated Injuries
Peroneal Tendon Injury
Peroneal tendon avulsion Fracture
Distinguish from Jones Fracture
Everts foot and prevents inversion
Palpate lateral foot at its insertion
Hemorrhage at Peroneal Muscle
Peroneal Nerve damage may occur
Bone Injury: Foot
Jones Fracture at fifth Metatarsal metaphysis
Peroneal brevis tendon avulsion Fracture
May require surgery for non-union
Tarsal Navicular Fracture (or Stress Fracture)
Lisfranc Fracture-Dislocation (uncommon, but high morbidity)
Bone Injury: Fibula
Pott's Fracture-Subluxation
Maisonneuve Injury (Proximal Fibula Fracture related to Syndesmotic Sprain)
Bone Injury: Talus
Talar Dome Fracture (occurs in 6 to 22% of cases)
Posterior Talus Fracture (Medial or Lateral Tubercle)
Lateral process of Talus Fracture (most commonly missed Ankle Fracture)
Bone Injury: Calcaneus
Calcaneus Anterior Process Fracture
Differential Diagnosis: Delayed healing
Unrecognized associated injury as listed above
Talar Dome Fracture
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy
Chronic Tendonitis
Peroneal tendon subluxation
Syndesmotic Sprain (High Ankle Sprain)
Occult Fracture
Anterior Superior Calcaneus Fracture
Lateral Talus Fracture
Symptoms
"Pop" heard with injury
Ankle swelling and decreased function
Inability to walk four feet after Ankle Sprain is higher risk of Fracture
See Ottawa Ankle Rules
Signs
See Ankle Exam
See Ankle Anatomy
Ankle Motor Function (Always assess)
Evaluate for Syndesmotic Sprain (High Ankle Sprain)
Crossed-Leg Test
Squeeze Test
Evaluate ankle stability
More useful at follow-up at 4-6 weeks after Ankle Sprain
Used in grading Ankle Sprain (see below)
Does not typically modify initial management after acute injury
Ankle Anterior Drawer Test
Tests anterior talofibular ligament integrity
Ankle Talar Tilt (Inversion stress Test)
Tests calcaneofibular ligament integrity
Evaluate for associated Fracture
See Ottawa Ankle Rules
Ankle bony tenderness
Medial malleolus or distal tibia tenderness within last 2.4 inches (6 cm)
May also indicate Growth Plate Fracture in adolescent
Lateral malleolus or distal fibula tenderness within last 2.4 inches (6 cm)
Talocrural joint line (anterior talar dome) tenderness or swelling
May indicate osteochondral Talar Dome Fracture
Not part of Ottawa Ankle Rules
Foot bony tenderness (midfoot)
Fifth Metatarsal tenderness or pain at base or metaphysis (e.g. Jones Fracture)
Tarsal Navicular tenderness or pain at medial, proximal foot (Tarsal Navicular Fracture)
Lisfranc Joint tenderness, swelling or deformity at midfoot region (Lisfranc Fracture Dislocation)
Evaluation: Red Flags suggestive of more complicated injury
See Ottawa Ankle Rules
Mechanism different than classic inversion injury
Eversion injury (see Medial Ankle Sprain)
Forced severe plantar flexion (see Fifth Metatarsal Fracture)
Dorsiflexion
Atypical signs on acute evaluation immediately after injury
See signs above (under evaluate for associated Fracture)
Immediate swelling or Bruising over the forefoot or toes
Children with tenderness over physis
Suspect Salter-Harris Fracture I (physis is weaker than ligaments)
Safest to apply splint despite negative XRay
Low risk of Salter Harris I Fractures on MRI in these patients
Boutis (2016) JAMA Pediatr 170(1): e154114 +PMID: 26747077 [PubMed]
Imaging: Initial
Ankle XRay Indications
See Ottawa Ankle Rules (adults and children over age 5 years old)
See Low Risk Ankle Rule (children over age 3 years old)
See ankle bony tenderness above
Inability to walk four feet at injury site (e.g. sideline) or at acute evaluation by medical provider
Foot XRay Indications
See foot bony tenderness above
Imaging: Delayed healing (suspected Talar Dome OCD)
Indications
Symptomatic beyond 6 weeks
Persistent crepitus
Locking or catching sensation
Imaging
Repeat Ankle XRay and foot XRay
Ankle CT or Ankle MRI
Grading
Indications
Ankle stability at 4-6 weeks after Ankle Sprain
Instability directs additional management with rehabilitation (or possibly surgery for third degree Ankle Sprain)
Inaccurate and not useful on initial Ankle Sprain evaluation
Does not modify initial management
First degree Lateral Ankle Sprain
Mild pain and swelling (able to ambulate)
No mechanical instability
Anterior talofibular ligament stretched
Localized tenderness anteriorly
Second degree Lateral Ankle Sprain
Moderate pain and swelling with Ecchymosis present
Pain with ambulation
Moderate lateral ankle instability
Partial tear of anterior talofibular ligament
Third degree Lateral Ankle Sprain
Severe Ecchymosis and swelling (>4 cm at fibula)
Unable to bear weight
Severe lateral ankle instability
Total disruption of lateral ligaments
Anterior talofibular ligament
Calcaneofibular ligament
Heard "Pop" with immediate pain and swelling
Management
See Ankle Sprain Management
Prognosis
Outcomes generally good
Full recovery may require months
Severe Lateral Ankle Sprains
Syndesmotic Sprains (High Ankle Sprains)
Complications (rare)
Late Traumatic Arthritis
Chronic instability
