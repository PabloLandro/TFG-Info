Intervention - Vitamin D
Intervention = Give Vitamin D to a portion of study participants and see what happens
Typically
Intervene with the group: one dose size, but sometimes intervene while varying the dose size
perhaps such that each individual exceeds the desired blood level (say 40 ng)
Group size: 50 to 500 people, but can be ~ 100,000 individuals ( Turkey- Rickets )
Vitamin D3, but sometimes an activated form ( Calcidiol, or Calcitriol)
Disease treatment, but sometimes disease prevention
Just Vitamin D (monotherapy), even though cofactors are very important, especially if > 4,000 IU
Note - some interventions use loading doses to restore levels quickly (days or weeks instead of months)
Which also includes small single dose of vitamin D - say 100,000 IU
Not listed - Trials which clearly used too little vitamin D or too short of period
US Clinical Trials with Vit D Intervention new since Jan 2014 766 as of Sept 2018
