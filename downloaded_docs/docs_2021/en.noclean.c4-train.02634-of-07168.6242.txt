Below is the list of 10 simple beauty and health tips and solutions for many day to day problems.
1 Duct Tape for Getting Rid Of Warts
Duct tape is better for removing warts as compared to liquid nitrogen. This has been successfully proven by a study conducted at the Archives of Pediatrics And Adolescent Medicine.
You just need to tear a piece of duct tape and apply it on the infected area. Remove the duct tape
everyday and paste a new one for few days and also rub the wart with a nail file or pumice stone for a few days until the wart is gone.
Though the scientists are not so sure about this particular method, still they believe that the chemical contained in the tape does the trick. One alternative theory is that the application of duct tape causes irritation on the skin which in turn causes the immune system to attack the wart.
2 Bite A Pencil To Relieve Headache
This particular theory is based on the fact that when stressed, we often clench our teeth which strain the muscles that connect the temples to the jaws. This particular action can result in headache. If you place pencil between your teeth but not bite down on it, you would be able to relax your muscles thereby reducing the pain. However, this method is successful in relieving only some types of headaches.
3 Dry Out Blisters With the Help of Listerine
Listerine, commonly used as a mouthwash, is a powerful antiseptic and can be used for treating the blisters. Just dab Listerine onto the blisters two to three times a day using cotton balls until they heal completely.
4 Soothe Eczema through Oatmeal bath
Soaking in warm water consisting of two to three cups of colloidal or finely ground oatmeal for 15 minutes relieves almost all the irritation caused by eczema. The oatmeal has an antihistamine effect and reduces inflammation.
5 Treat Motion Sickness With Olives
Motion sickness is often accompanied by a feeling of nausea which may result in vomiting. In the event of vomiting, the human body’s protecting system kicks in and mouth begins to secrete excessive saliva in order to protect teeth from stomach acid. Eating a few olives dries the mouth and prevents the secreting of excessive saliva in the mouth. This is due to presence of tannins in the olives. Removing this particular symptom reduces nausea and prevents you from vomiting.
6 Sugar For Curing Hiccups
Sugar is known for triggering vagus nerve, which apparently causes body to forget hiccups. Vagus nerve is essentially a cranial nerve that transfers sensory information related to various body parts to the brain. When one swallows sugar, this particular nerve tells the brain that something more important than hiccups is happening and the diaphragm spasms stops immediately.
7 Treat Nail Fungus through Vicks VapoRub
Although there is no scientific evidence about this particular theory, still there are a numerous occurrences in which it has proved to be quite successful in treating different types of nail fungus. While some believe that it is the suffocating action of the Vaporub that does the job while other believes that it is the menthol that is present in it that kills the fungus. For treating nail fungus, just apply Vicks VapoRub twice a day over the affected area until its gone.
8 Treat Brittle Nails With Vegetable Oil
Rub vegetable oil on your hands for treating dry and brittle nails and give your nails rich moisturizing treatment.
9 Vodka for Foot Odor
Alcohol is known to be a great antiseptic that can kill almost all the bacteria that cause odor. It also dries out the moisture that prevents these organisms from thriving. Just dip a cloth in liquid and apply it on your feet at the end of the day.
10 Cure Bad Breath With Yogurt
Yogurt contains probiotics that can eliminate excessive acid in the stomach which is the major cause of bad breath. Although bad breath can originate in several places, stomach is one of the most common places from where it starts.
