Migraine, Occipital Neuralgia, and Chronic Headache Surgery
Dallas, Texas migraine doctor helps patients find a cure for migraines through surgery, BOTOX, and other migraine treatments.
In 2009, news that a single surgery (Trigger-point release/nerve decompression) can improve migraines and chronic headaches spread worldwide. Subsequently in October 2010, the FDA approved BOTOXÂ® (Allergan, Inc.) for chronic migraines. Drugs prescribed for migraines and chronic headaches may not help sufferers. Moreover, they have adverse effects including mental sluggishness, nausea, muscle weakness, difficulty in thinking, and trouble functioning.
Through trigger-point release and nerve decompression, the pressure on nerves are relieved thus preventing migraines and persistent headaches, or decreasing the frequency and intensity of pain. Reports have found that nearly 80% to 90% of patients experience improvement in pain, and in 50% to 60% of patients, the headaches are completely eliminated.
