Copper Cookware Sets For Kitchen | Why cooking In Copper Plated Vessels Is Good For You
It is always good to plate cooking vessels with copper since copper is an excellent conductor of heat. The heat is conducted very fast and evenly through the cookware which helps in decreasing the cooking time and increasing the over all efficiency. Copper plated vessels are more heavy, they can reduce hot spots and they look really beautiful and shining. However, it is not advisable to use copper inside the cooking vessels since copper may dissolve into the dishes during the process of cooking which may cause an excess of copper in blood and related toxicity.
Copper plated cooking vessels lined with tins are available in the market which are less expensive. But they are less durable also. Due to this reason, stainless steel interiors are mostly suitable for copper plated cookware even though they are more expensive.

VioletteRose, Copper always reminds me of words about poetry written in Latin by ancient Roman poet Horace: it mixes the useful with the pleasant (miscuit utile dolci).
Its practicality easily is matched by its artistry.
My mother especially liked to drink water from two heirloom jugs, one copper and the other pewter. She never was troubled with arthritis. I remember liking the flavor of the water, and I noticed a slight difference in the texture of the water from those jugs.
Nice tribute!

This is a very nice article and I was unaware that people left water in copper pots for health benefits.
VioletteRose on 02/02/2014
Thank you, I am glad you enjoyed reading my article :). Drinking water stored in copper jugs is an age old practice in India, which was especially very common among the previous generations.
