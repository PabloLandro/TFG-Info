What can you do for a child with a fever who is irritable and spitting medicine back up? Especially when she used to like the medicine. One simple thing might be to just try a different medication or a different flavor of the same fever reducer. While some kids simply don't like to take any medicine, others are just picky.
For example, Infants' Tylenol Oral Suspension comes in different flavors, including grape and cherry. There are also different forms of Tylenol, in addition to the oral suspension, including FeverAll suppository form of Acetaminophen, which can be given to infants over 3 months of age.
If she is over 6 months old and won't take Tylenol, you might change over to a fever reducer with ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin.
Lowering Your Child's Fever
Giving your child plenty of fluids to drink and maybe even trying a lukewarm sponge bath might also help to lower her temperature.
Things to avoid include:
Using rubbing alcohol or cold water in a sponge bath
Giving your child aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome
Overdressing her or using heavy blankets
You should also avoid repeating the doses of Tylenol that your child spits up unless instructed to do so by your pediatrician.
Do You Have to Treat Your Child's Fever?
While you certainly don't have to always try and reduce your child's fever, it is likely a good idea if your child has a fever and is irritable. The fever isn't going to help your child get better any faster, whatever is causing it.
And be sure to call your pediatrician if she continues to have a fever or continues to be irritable, even after you get her temperature to come down.
