Athlete's Foot

Athlete’s foot, also called tinea pedis, is a skin disease caused by a fungus, usually occurring between the toes. The fungus most commonly attacks the feet because shoes create a warm, dark, and humid environment which encourages fungus growth. Not all fungus conditions are athlete’s foot; other conditions that may mimic athlete’s foot include eczema and psoriasis.
The warmth and dampness of areas around swimming pools, showers, and locker rooms are also breeding grounds for fungi. Because the infection was common among athletes who used these facilities frequently, the term “athlete’s foot” became popular.
Signs of athlete’s foot include: dry skin, itching, burning, scaling, inflammation, and blisters. It may occur acutely or chronically, and it may spread to the soles of the feet and to the toenails with more severe cases taking on a moccasin-type infection – covering the toes, soles, and sides of the feet. Oral and topical antifungal medications are commonly used to treat tinea pedis. If you are presenting with some of these symptoms, Dr. Mendoza will be able to determine if a fungus is the cause of the problem and develop the best treatment plan for you.
