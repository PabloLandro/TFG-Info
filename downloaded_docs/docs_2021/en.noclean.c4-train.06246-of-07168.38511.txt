Warts are a skin infection caused by HPV viruses and are more common in children and adults. Except for warts on the sole of the feet, they are painless. Usually they disappear after a few months but are removed for cosmetic reasons. Some of the home remedies for treating warts are:
1. Garlic and onion when applied to the affected area using a tape are effective in reducing the wart size for some people.
2. Salicylic acid is used to remove warts by either applying an adhesive pad soaked in salicylic acid or directly applying the salicylic acid solution to the affected area. After applying the acid, the dead skin should be removed using a pumice stone or an emery board. Aspirin contains Salicylic acid, so making a paste by crushing a tablet and applying to the affected area using a bandage may also be effective.
3. Cashew oil, lemon essential oil and tea tree oil could be used to treat warts. Rubbing a raw potato slice on the affected area, several times a day may also help.
4. Soak the wart in warm soapy water, till it becomes soft. Rub the wart with a pumice stone or emery board. Repeat the procedure on alternate days.
5. Cover the wart with a duct tape for 6 days to one week. Remove the tape, soak the wart in water and rub it with pumice stone, sand paper or some other abrasive. Otherwise the duct tape can be used overnight, after applying a salicylic acid based wart remover.
