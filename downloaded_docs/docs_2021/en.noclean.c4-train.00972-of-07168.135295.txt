Male Pattern Baldness | Cure And Treatments
5 (100%) 1 vote
Male pattern baldness affects over 50% of men over 50 and most men at some point in their lives. Most affected men never wish to seek any treatment although some treatments are available if needed to help hair regrow.
What Is Male Pattern Baldness?
It is a common type of hair loss that most men will experience at some stage. It is also referred to as androgenetic alopecia. Normally, it takes 15 to 25 years to go fully bald although in some men it is much faster taking as little as five years.
Typically, it starts with the thinning of hair at the sides and simultaneously the hair also starts thinning at the top of the head. Gradually, a bald patch develops in the middle of the scalp. Eventually, the bald patch on the scalp and receding sides will join together leaving a patch at the front. This patch at the front will also thin eventually.
Male Pattern Baldness | Treatments Options
Luckily, there are a lot of solutions to hair loss. Some may need external application while some need you to consume internally. In this regard, you should expose yourself to various products before deciding on which to use to ensure the highest chance of finding a treatment that works for your condition.
1. Medication
Currently, there are two kinds of medications that help ¬ñ Minoxidil and 1mg Finasteride (Propecia).
Finasteride was launched in 2002 in the United Kingdom even though it has been available in the United States since way back in 1997. These work by reducing androgen hormones around the scalp hence promoting hair growth. They also act by preventing testosterone hormone from being converted to DHT. In this way, hair growth is restored on the scalp, and the baldness starts to fade away with time. Do not use more than 1mg Finasterid if you want to stop hair loss.
Minoxidil is a rub-n treatment for baldness that you can buy at your local pharmacy without a prescription.There is debate as to the effectiveness of Minoxidil. It seems to be most effective when used in the early stages of hair loss before too much hair has been lost.
2. Wigs
The wig still remains as a viable option for those with baldness. Some like them and find them useful while others find them not very convincing as well as uncomfortable.
3. Surgery
When all else fails you can turn to surgery to deal with male pattern baldness. Procedures such as scalp flaps and hair transplants have been used for several years with mixed results. However, newer procedures are generating better results.
Dieting for male pattern baldness ‚Äì No treatment
Believe it or not no treatment is in fact a treatment by itself. Gradual balding is a normal part of the process of ageing in most men. For most affected men no treatment is needed or wanted. However, for some men it can be distressing and they may opt to seek treatment.
But what about dieting for hair loss? This is a solution that will probably help in reversing the male pattern baldness. However, do not categorize dieting solution as a quick fix as it does not do that. Dieting for hair loss is an ideal alternative for people who find other choices are not working for them, or for those who experience side effects from the products.
While this requires time to treat your problem, it is natural and so, there is no side effects whatsoever. If you diet as required, then it will naturally become a part of your lifestyle. Therefore, you should allow this to take place for the recommended duration of you want it to work for you. This calls for a lot of patience and perseverance. But if you are diligent and consistent, then you will surely enjoy the results.

It is important to prepare yourself mentally for the diet which translates to an increase in the level of confidence.

Male pattern baldness (androgen alopecia) is a condition characterized by hair loss on the head. This condition mostly affects men due to a heavy presence of androgens. Although this condition may occur naturally, there are several methods of reversing the effect. This however means you have to understand how these hormones (androgen) work to reverse their effects.
Home remedies that can be used to treat male pattern baldness

The best way to balance this acidity is by avoiding heavily scented hair shampoos and using naturally inspired ones. You should also consider washing your hair at least once daily. Consider using alkaline based soaps to wash your hair.
