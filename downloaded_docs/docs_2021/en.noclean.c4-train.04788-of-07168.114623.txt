EVENING PRIMROSE OIL (EPO)
Product No. P0507
Source of fatty acids
Suitable for use in female heath and wellness supplements, skin care products
Evening primrose oil (EPO) comes from the tiny seeds of the evening primrose plant, which is named for its night-blooming yellow flowers. It is native to North America. The oil is light yellow in colour with a characteristic odour, and contains the fatty acids gamma linolenic, linoleic, oleic and palmitic.
The plant has long been used in the United States and Europe to treat wounds and skin conditions, such as acne and eczema. Today, evening primrose oil is also used for breast pain associated with premenstrual syndrome and menopausal flushing or ‘hot flushes’.
The gamma linolenic acid (GLA), contained in evening primrose oil converts to a hormone-like substance called prostaglandin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Although the body should theoretically convert evening primrose oil, many things can interfere with this conversion, including: disease, the ageing process, saturated fat, hydrogenated oils, blood sugar problems and inadequate vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, and B vitamins. Supplements that provide GLA will circumvent these conversion problems, leading to more predictable formation of prostaglandin.
The anti-inflammatory properties of evening primrose oil have been studied in research involving people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, and results showed that supplementation provides significant benefit. Evening primrose oil has been reported to lower cholesterol levels in some people, as well as improve the skin itching, redness and dryness associated with kidney dialysis.
In summary, conditions evening primrose oil may help with include:
High cholesterol levels
High blood pressure
PMS - irritability, headaches, breast tenderness and bloating
Acne
Eczema
Rheumatoid arthritis
Multiple sclerosis
Heart disease
