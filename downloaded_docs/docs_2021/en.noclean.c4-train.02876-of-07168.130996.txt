The Steps And Oils Utilized In Raindrop Therapy
Last Updated: 11/14/2017
Raindrop Therapy combines aromatherapy, reflexology, and more to create a healing and cleansing massage. The purpose of the therapy is to bring total balance, a sense of harmony, and body wellness including mental, physical, and emotional through the techniques used. The premise behind this massage therapy is that the use of specific antimicrobial oils applied in a particular sequence with various techniques will reduce the body’s inflammations and destroy any viral presence. Although the original theory behind this is to heal problems of the spine, modifications can be incorporated into the therapy to treat other conditions. Discovered through the research of D. Gary Young in the 1980s, raindrop therapy focuses on the application of a number of specific essential oils to various parts of the body through a combination of techniques that are explored here. Let’s take a closer look at the different components of Raindrop Therapy.
What Are the Principal Oils Used in Raindrop Therapy?
-Valor is a special blend of four oils: rosewood, blue tansy, frankincense, and spruce. Rosewood is credited with a plethora of healing properties that allow it to be antibacterial, anti-infectious, anti-fungal, antiviral, and anti-parasitic. It is soothing to the skin and helps to renew its elasticity. Blue Tansy is used for its antihistamine and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its ability to reduce and partially relieve the symptoms of arthritis, dermatitis, sciatica, allergies, and tuberculosis. Frankincense is used for its ability to lift the negative effects of despair and stress by stimulating parts of the brain. Spruce, an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infectious agent, is thought to stimulate the emotions toward a sense of balance.
-Thyme is mainly used for its antiseptic properties. It is considered beneficial in reducing and eliminating bacteria that is present in the body. Thyme is also thought to be helpful in reducing the effects of fatigue and stress by supplying energy to the body.
-Oregano, reacting in a more aggressive manner than thyme, performs in much the same way in that it helps to stimulate the body’s immune system and balance the metabolism of the body. Moreover, its use should strengthen the vitality of the body.
-Wintergreen is used to elevate the awareness of the body’s sensory system. Additionally, its use is said to relieve joint discomfort, muscle ache, and bone stress.
-Cypress is used to benefit the circulatory system.
-Peppermint, long revered for its healing properties, is used in raindrop therapy for a number of purposes. Included in these are its ability to benefit the respiratory system, sooth digestive problems, improve mental acuity, and to improve the senses of taste and smell.
-Basil is used to relax the muscles, including those of the digestive system and heart. Plus, its use is thought to stimulate the sense of smell and reduce mental fatigue. Applied topically, basil can be used to sooth insect bites.
-Marjoram is utilized to calm the body’s respiratory system. Its use is intended to relax the muscles and to reduce and relieve muscle spasms. Additionally, the use of marjoram is thought to calm the nerves. In short, the healing properties associated with marjoram are thought to support the proper functioning of the body’s respiratory system.
-Aroma Siez is a special blend of oils that are essential in helping the body to relax and remain in a calm state of being. The use of this blend is thought to reduce and relieve the soreness and tightness of muscles that have been overworked due to fatigue, stress, or injury. The tiredness of such muscles should dissipate due to the beneficial effects of raindrop therapy and of the application of aroma siez in particular. This blend contains the following essential oils: basil, cypress, marjoram, lavender, and peppermint.
Lavender is considered an anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticonvulsant, antiseptic, and sedating agent. Moreover, it is thought to safeguard against tumor growth. Among the many healing properties associated with lavender are the abilities to heal rheumatism, depression, earaches, convulsions, bronchitis, asthma, arthritis, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, hives, insect bites, respiratory infection, and nervous tension.
Many of the essential oils used in raindrop therapy are thought to be easily absorbed by the body.
Individuals who are giving or receiving raindrop therapy should go into the experience with a positive outlook. All negativity should be dispelled prior to entering this massage therapy experience.
What Techniques or Steps Are Used in Raindrop Therapy?
The steps utilized in raindrop therapy progress in specified order and fluctuate in the technique used. Both massage and a Vita Flex technique are used throughout various steps of the massage therapy.
Step 1
The individual who is receiving treatment should lie face down on the massage table with her arms at her sides. Her hips should be as flat on the table as possible. Next, the placement of six drops of valor upon each foot and shoulder occurs.
Ideally, two individuals are conducting the therapy and one can take up a position at the head of the recipient while the other takes up a position at her feet. There should be as much contact as possible between the palms of the hands of the therapist and the feet and shoulders of the individual. Her thoughts should be carefree and relaxed.
Step 2
Five drops of each of the oils of thyme and oregano are applied separately from a height of six inches along the spine. The drops are evenly spaced starting from the bottom of the spine and working up to the top. Once the drops from the first oil have been placed, they are spread out evenly along the spine’s curvature. Then, the second oil can be applied in the same manner. It does not make a difference as to which oil is applied first. A very specific method of massage is applied next.
Step 3
In this step, the following oils are applied in this order: cypress, wintergreen, basil, and peppermint. The oils are applied with four or five drops along the spine and spread out evenly and gently. Once they have all been applied, a specific method of massage takes place. The Vita Flex technique is used as well.
Step 4
Five to six drops of marjoram and aroma siez are applied along both sides of the spine and onto the muscle tissue of the back. A gentle massage and short resting period takes place.
Step 5
This step involves the use of a hot, wet towel to generate heat from the applied oils as well as enabling the oils to penetrate more deeply into the skin.
The intensity of the heat builds up slowly and some slight discomfort might occur.
Step 6
Each of the following four oils are applied and spread evenly on the inside of the lower legs: wintergreen, cypress, basil, and peppermint. The oils are applied in the order indicated. The Vita Flex technique is used next.
Step 7
Two people should be involved in this next process that involves some gentle body manipulation. The individual receiving treatment should be on her back for this part of the treatment.
Step 8
A visual examination of the individual’s spine is made as she once again turns onto her stomach. If desired, another technique can be applied at this point in the massage therapy.
While the explanations above are cursory and incomplete, the basic idea of raindrop therapy is presented. Not every massage therapist is a proponent of this particular procedure. However, many individuals who have undergone this treatment experienced positive effects.
