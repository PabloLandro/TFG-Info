Best Natural Supplements for Migraine Recommended by Top Doctor
Posted by Paula Dumas | Apr 6, 2015 | 45
When was the last time your migraine doctor educated you on the proven benefits of natural supplements for prevention?
Updated 10/28/16 / We tend to think of MD’s as drug and surgery experts, but when you consult with top headache clinics, you may find experts like Dr. Richard Lipton who are able to advise patients on an integrative approach to migraine management that includes vitamins and supplements.
In 2014, we had the privilege of interviewing one of the top headache doctors in the world, Richard B. Lipton, Director of the Montefiore Headache Center in New York City, and former president of the American Headache Society.
Below is an excerpt of our 60-minute interview with Dr. Lipton where he was asked him about the effectiveness of various natural supplements.
Richard B. Lipton MD is one of the top headache experts in the world.
Personally, there was a time in my migraine journey when I was experiencing migraines 25 out of 30 days a month and on 10 prescription pills a day to prevent them. Years later, I take no preventative meds and five of the six supplements mentioned below while experiencing 2-3 days a month of moderate migraine pain.
Could be many explanations for that shift, but I’m just incredibly thankful.
6 Best Vitamins and Natural Supplements for Migraine Prevention
(Interview Transcript)
Paula: What do you think about supplements like riboflavin, magnesium, melatonin, Co-Q-10?
Dr. Lipton: Your list is a good list. The American Academy of Neurology recently published guidelines on drugs and natural products that were useful in migraine prevention.
The only one that’s in the same category of effectiveness as the best prescription drugs, like Topiramate and Divalproex sodium, is a supplement called Petadolex, that’s an extract of the butterbur plant. There have been a couple of blind studies showing that it is effective in doses of 75 mg twice daily.
I hate to plug a branded product, but if the extraction is not done right with butterbur, then there can be toxic alkaloids in it, so I recommend the Weber & Weber product of medications; it’s a German company; the German government naturally regulates national products; so I know what people are taking when they take the Weber & Weber product.
Take Our Poll
Paula: Beyond butterbur, how much evidence is there for the efficacy of the other natural supplements for Migraine?
Dr. Lipton: Other products may be just as good, but I just don’t have a good way of knowing. B2 (Riboflavin) and Magnesium are both in the second category of evidence for natural products in the AAN guidelines, as is magnesium; so B2 is something I recommend very often. I tell people it’s the great free swing in migraine prevention, and by that, I mean you take 200 mg twice a day; effects develop over a couple of months; but don’t expect to see benefits immediately.
But it really is quite effective as a migraine preventive in double-blind studies. Melatonin has been shown to work in doses of 3 mg a day, although the best evidence wasn’t available at the time the AAN wrote their guidelines, so it has a lower level of evidence, because guidelines get out of date almost immediately as soon as they’re written. And that’s a good thing because it means we’re making progress.
Magnesium has a role as a migraine preventive, the only challenge with magnesium supplementation is that in some people it can cause cramps and diarrhea, but it’s a useful preventive. There’s a limited evidence for CoQ10 and Riboflavin, but they work through similar mechanisms.
I usually have people try riboflavin first because, honestly it’s much less expensive and slightly better studied. But I think that they are equally effective.
Paula: Great. So you mentioned butterbur, that it needs to be extracted properly to be effective and PA-free. How about Feverfew?
Dr. Lipton: For feverfew, the evidence is very mixed and I am not a big fan of feverfew based both on the very inconsistent results of studies and the fact that it may be difficult to active adequate concentrations of the active ingredients in feverfew extracts. So it is helpful in some people and has anti-inflammatory benefits, I’m certainly not opposed to it, but it is lower down on the list than the other natural products we’ve been talking about.

Butterbur isn’t recommended anymore for migraine treatment because Petadolex changed their manufacturing process back in 2009 and didn’t complete the mandatory studies that Germany requires. As a result Germany no longer allows butterbur to be sold in their country. Switzerland banned it as well. Not trying to discourage anyone, I just wanted to make sure people knew about it. I found out by checking out Petadolex on Google.
