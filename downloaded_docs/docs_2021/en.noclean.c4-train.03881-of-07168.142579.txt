Magnesium for Migraine
by Stephanie Mayberry on February 28, 2019 in Migraine Supplement
Magnesium is a mineral that is vital to just about every part of the body. It promotes normal bone structure, helps tissue to heal, keeps your heart healthy, and it even helps prevent migraines and helps decrease migraine pain. It is safe and very effective for everyday use. While it is found in many foods, most people who need the extra magnesium will typically opt for either the capsule supplement or powder form. If you have migraines, you would be wise to include it in your daily health and wellness routine.
What is Magnesium?
Magnesium is a chemical element, a mineral that the body needs for good health. There are about 25 grams of magnesium in the body of an adult human, broken down this way:
60% is in the skeleton
27% is in the muscle tissue
7% is in other cells
Less than 1% exists outside of cells.
You can find magnesium in bran cereals, brown rice, cooked mackerel, spinach, and in other common foods. While it is possible to obtain the mineral from the foods you eat, most people do not subscribe to a diet that incorporates enough magnesium rich foods. Therefore, it is often necessary to supplement.
Research
Magnesium has performed very well in several clinical studies identifying it as a viable treatment for migraine and related conditions. There are three studies that stand out as solid proof of its potential.
In the first study, (Peikert et al) 81 patients were divided into two groups. One group received 600 mg elemental magnesium and the other group received a placebo each day. Over the course of the 12 week study, the patients in the magnesium group reported that their attacks were occurring less often. In the final month of the study, the magnesium group experienced a significant decrease in the frequency and intensity of their migraine attacks. The reduction was at a rate of 50% or greater.
The second study (Pfafferath et al) included 69 patients who were divided into two groups. One, a placebo group while the other group took 243 mg magnesium twice a day. Over the 12 week course of the study, neither group experienced any significant difference in the frequency or intensity of their migraine attacks. This indicates that, when compared to other studies, the dosage of magnesium was too low to achieve the desired result (the same results achieved in other studies that utilized higher dosages).
The third study (Koseoglu et al), involved 40 patients divided into two groups. The first group of 30 patients received 600 mg magnesium daily. The second group of 10 patients received a placebo. After a four week baseline, both groups began taking their respective supplement. The group receiving the magnesium found that the frequency and intensity of their migraine attacks were significantly reduced compared to the group receiving the placebo.
An evidence based review of oral magnesium supplementation in the preventive treatment of migraine (Teigen et al), noted that migraine and low magnesium levels are generally linked. As yet, there is still insufficient evidence to provide the particulars in how magnesium is measured and how supplementation is provided. This review advocated increasing dietary intake of the mineral as the preferred supplementation method.
How to take Magnesium for migraine
Magnesium has received a strong recommendation from the CHS for use as a treatment for migraine. Based on evidence obtained from several trials, including those discussed here, the recommended daily dose for magnesium as a treatment and preventative for migraine is 600 mg daily. Guidelines set forth by the AAN/AHS give magnesium a Level B recommendation. The mineral has also received a rating of Level C by the EFS.
