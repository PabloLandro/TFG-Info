Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is a common condition that affects joints of the body. It causes structural changes within a joint or multiple joints, resulting in pain and loss of function. Osteoarthritis is associated with a number of factors, including genetic, mechanical, hormonal and inflammatory factors, and is not just a disease of aging or an ‘older persons’ disease.
The symptoms of osteoarthritis can vary from one person to the next and change within the same person over time. Some of the common symptoms include: stiffness, pain associated with movement, muscle weakness, joint instability, reduced range of movement, sounds within the joints, feelings of low mood.
Medication may be your first line of defense. Use of pain relieving medication to manage osteoarthritis focuses on improving symptoms, not changing the underlying cause.
Exercise can be effective in reducing pain. An exercise routine may include strengthening, stretching and a balance program. Do not do any exercises that cause more pain.
For some people, surgery may be considered when all other appropriate, non-operative treatments have been tried for a reasonable period of time and there is a significant impact on the quality of life. Surgery is usually only recommended when there is a high likelihood that it will reduce pain.
