Seizures
Secondary seizures; Reactive seizures; Seizure - secondary; Seizure - reactive; Convulsions
A seizure is the physical findings or changes in behavior that occur after an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
The term "seizure" is often used interchangeably with "convulsion." During convulsions a person has uncontrollable shaking that is rapid and rhythmic, with the muscles contracting and relaxing repeatedly. There are many different types of seizures. Some have mild symptoms without shaking.
Considerations
It may be hard to tell if someone is having a seizure. Some seizures only cause a person to have staring spells. These may go unnoticed.
Staring spells
An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) distur...

Specific symptoms depend on which part of the brain is involved. Symptoms occur suddenly and may include:
Brief blackout followed by a period of confusion (the person cannot remember for a short time)
Changes in behavior, such as picking at one's clothing
Drooling or frothing at the mouth
Eye movements
Grunting and snorting
Loss of bladder or bowel control
Mood changes, such as sudden anger, unexplainable fear, panic, joy, or laughter
Shaking of the entire body
Sudden falling
Tasting a bitter or metallic flavor
Teeth clenching
Temporary stop in breathing
Uncontrollable muscle spasms with twitching and jerking limbs
Symptoms may stop after a few seconds or minutes, or continue for up to 15 minutes. They rarely continue longer.
The person may have warning symptoms before the attack, such as:
Fear or anxiety
Nausea
Vertigo (feeling as if you are spinning or moving)
Visual symptoms (such as flashing bright lights, spots, or wavy lines before the eyes)
Causes
Seizures of all types are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
Causes of seizures can include:
Abnormal levels of sodium or glucose in the blood
Brain infection, including meningitis and encephalitis
Meningitis
Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.

Sometimes, no cause can be found. This is called idiopathic seizures. They are usually seen in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. There may be a family history of epilepsy or seizures.
If seizures continue repeatedly after the underlying problem is treated, the condition is called epilepsy.
Home Care
Most seizures stop by themselves. But during a seizure, the person can be hurt or injured.
When a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the person from injury:
Try to prevent a fall. Lay the person on the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects.
Cushion the person's head.
Loosen tight clothing, especially around the neck.
Turn the person on their side. If vomiting occurs, this helps make sure that the vomit is not inhaled into the lungs.
Look for a medical ID bracelet with seizure instructions.
Stay with the person until he or she recovers, or until professional medical help arrives.
Things friends and family members should NOT do:
DO NOT restrain (try to hold down) the person.
DO NOT place anything between the person's teeth during a seizure (including your fingers).
DO NOT move the person unless they are in danger or near something hazardous.
DO NOT try to make the person stop convulsing. They have no control over the seizure and are not aware of what is happening at the time.
DO NOT give the person anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and the person is fully awake and alert.
DO NOT start CPR unless the seizure has clearly stopped and the person is not breathing or has no pulse.
If a baby or child has a seizure during a high fever, cool the child slowly with lukewarm water. DO NOT place the child in a cold bath. Call your child's health care provider and ask what you should do next. Also, ask if it is OK to give the child acetaminophen (Tylenol) once he or she is awake.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call 911 or your local emergency number if:
This is the first time the person has had a seizure
A seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes
The person does not awaken or have normal behavior after a seizure
Another seizure starts soon after a seizure ends
The person had a seizure in water
The person is pregnant, injured, or has diabetes
The person does not have a medical ID bracelet (instructions explaining what to do)
There is anything different about this seizure compared to the person's usual seizures
Report all seizures to the person's provider. The provider may need to adjust or change the person's medicines.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
A person who has had a new or severe seizure is usually seen in a hospital emergency room. The provider will try to diagnose the type of seizure based on the symptoms.
Tests will be done to rule out other medical conditions that cause seizures or similar symptoms. This may include fainting, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, panic attacks, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, among others.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time. A person will have stroke-like symptoms for ...

CT scan of the head or MRI of the head

A new seizure without a clear cause
