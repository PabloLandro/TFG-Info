Bracing for Achilles Tendonitis
October 20, 2014 /
I should probably issue a disclaimer. This post is not going to be pretty or home-related. There are pictures of my feet. I‚Äôm so sorry. There is a happy ending though, so there‚Äôs that.
If you‚Äôve ever read the ‚Äúabout me‚Äù page on this blog (it‚Äôs riveting), you‚Äôll see I mentioned something about running, but not being a runner. I do it 3 days a week because it happens to be the most efficient and effective way for me to exercise and I do like how it makes me feel ‚Äì after. The during part isn‚Äôt my most favorite part.

What came next really chapped my hide. Last year, there was a time when I swore my achilles tendon was on fire and was going to snap in two. That feeling was accompanied by on-going stiffness and aching. It rocked my foundation. There may have been some well-founded melodrama going on. I had finally found an exercise that worked and I completely despised, but now I was going to be deprived of it! The gall!
So after living with it for awhile and whining about it a lot, I saw the orthopedic doctor and he diagnosed achilles tendonitis. I think there is a more medically accurate term than that, but achilles tendonitis works for me. He prescribed physical therapy. So, off I went. It wasn‚Äôt my first time in physical therapy. I‚Äôve been there twice for recovery from ACL reconstruction and once for patella tendonitis. I‚Äôm a real lucky duck.
And, yes, I actually did follow the rules. I did the exercises, applied ice, foam rolled and avoided running. I made great strides in improving my hip strength so that it would improve my running form. Except the pain was still there after 6 weeks, then 8. I even asked for those little electrodes to send the anti-inflammatory gel into my skin. It only brought temporary relief. By the time I had finished my stint in physical therapy I was 3 months into no running. Yet the pain was still there and I was getting desperate.
So I did what any logical person does. I Googled my problems and tried to find a cure myself. That‚Äôs when I stumbled on the Aircast Airheel Foot and Ankle Brace . I found mine on Amazon, but I‚Äôm sure you can get it elsewhere too. (P.S. I‚Äôm sorry you have to look at my foot.)
I was skeptical, but the reviews trended toward the more favorable side. And remember, I was desperate, so it was worth a hail mary try. The first time I used it I was able to run a mile and a half before I started to feel any discomfort. I almost cried, I was so happy. And, yes, the irony of being happy to get back to something that I don‚Äôt enjoy doing is not lost on me.
I will say, it is weird wearing the brace at first. It feels very, very odd because you are walking on an air bubble. However, I think it might actually facilitate a more natural heel-toe foot placement.
Right where my thumb is (see below) there is an air-pocket that goes under your arch. When you step down, your foot pushes the air from under your arch up to the air-pocket that surrounds your achilles tendon to give it support.
The blue pad I‚Äôm pointing to in the below picture is the air-pocket that surrounds the achilles tendon. You can see there is a little tube that sends the air from one spot to another and back.
The only downside to wearing the brace is that little tube. On my particular foot, I found that it rubbed my ankle in an uncomfortable way. I could put a piece of moleskin there to protect from the rubbing, but it was just as easy to wear a taller sock instead. This is one of my husband‚Äôs socks. Glamorous, I know! üòâ I‚Äôve had my brace for a little over a year, so hopefully they‚Äôve improved it since then.
Right now, the Aircast Airheel Foot and Ankle Brace is selling for $34.70 on Amazon and it is Amazon Prime eligible.
I wore the brace as much as possible during the first couple of weeks of using it (even when not running). After that, I transitioned to wearing it just during my runs. Eventually, I was able to wean myself off of it altogether. Every once in awhile I will experience some achilles discomfort and so I will wear the brace again until I‚Äôm pain free.
I don‚Äôt think the brace alone solved my tendonitis issues, I think it helped give me the nudge I needed to finally heal correctly. I still had to do the hard work to improve my muscle strength and running form. I also had to give my body time to let the inflammation go away. Will it work for everyone that suffers from achilles tendonitis? I can‚Äôt answer that. I can only share my story and I‚Äôm so happy it worked for me. I hope it can help you too.
P.S. I am not a medical professional. Please consult your doctor for all medical questions and treatment. Also, the Aircast company has never heard of me. I am only sharing my experience using their product because I felt so inclined. The end. Affiliate links in this post.
