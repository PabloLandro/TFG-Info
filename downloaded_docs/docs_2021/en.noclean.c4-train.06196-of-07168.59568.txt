Surgical Hope for Migraine Headache Sufferers
27 Sep 2018/0 Comments/in Blog /by Kiran
It’s Monday and you’ve just clocked in to start your shift for work. You take your seat at your desk and smile. This is the first time in two weeks that you’ve experience three consecutive days of relief. Then without any warning, it happens again. The aggravating unwanted guest comes back to visit. You hate when it comes, because you never know how long it’s staying. That unwanted guest is a migraine headache. If you are like most people you’ve tried medicine to get rid of your annoying painful migraine such as: Excedrin, Aleve, Tylenol, etc. Nothing seems to help get rid of the migraine for long. If you feel hopeless, then rest assured that there is another option: Migraine Headache Surgery.
What Is Migraine Headache Surgery?
Since the early 1900’s, physicians and surgeons have studied the link between migraine headaches and the human body. Through those studies, they found several nerves that migraines target in the anatomy. Those nerves affect areas located: above the eyebrows, behind the eyes, and in the back of the neck. Migraine surgery simply decompresses those peripheral sensory nerves. There are two types of surgeries: nerve release and pain blocking. Nerve release (the most common form of surgery) is the removal of tissue or cartilage to take pressure off the nerve. Without the pressure provoking the nerve, you can be free from migraines permanently. Pain blocking (the least common method) is procedure where surgeons place neurostimulators under the skin to reverse the pain signal sent to the brain. Nerve blocking is not a permanent fix, but can last up to a few months. No matter which method of migraine surgery is used, both can help you get rid of that “unwanted guest”.
Reaping the Benefits
Even though both surgical methods will help those who suffer get relief from a migraine headache, the thought of going through surgery can still be a little daunting for most. However, migraine surgery typically only lasts about one to two hours. The recovery process takes one to two weeks, and after that, the relief is long-lasting. The goal post-surgery is to allow the patient to resume to their normal life, without having to deal with migraines.

Since this surgical procedure is growing more and more popular, there are a lot of places who are skilled in cosmetic surgery and plastic surgery that can help!
