Starve a Cold and Feed a Fever
February 25, 2019 5 Comments
Or, is it Feed a cold and starve a fever?
I was never quite sure which it was. And, since I have spent the last few days battling a cold, or maybe the flu, I decided to check. It seems starving is never correct! A well-balanced diet can help you stay healthy and defeat either a cold or a fever! How about that? This is really good new for me because I hate to starve!
Other possible remedies
I was certainly relieved to read I did not have to starve to beat whatever it is I am dealing with. But, being a bit bored, I still looked for a few other possible cold remedies. I came across a few others that might be worth trying ‚Ä¶ or not.
The Naval Cure (I like this one)
An author friend of mine, D (Joe) Guy, who writes fascinating tales of of romance, love and tragedy with an Italian twist is a retired Navy man. He told me they had a sure-fire cure for any cold in the Navy. You just get a bottle of good whiskey, some honey and some lemons. Then you throw away the honey and the lemons and drink the whiskey!
Cold Wet Socks?
This one did not sound very appealing to me, but many people claim it does work. All you do is soak your feet in hot water for about three minutes. Next, you wet a pair of cotton anklet socks with cold water and put them on. Then, you put thick wool socks on over those and go to bed.
Supposedly, while you sleep, the blood vessels in your cold feet will constrict and push good nutrients up to your organs to help fight the infection. Then, as your feet start to adjust and warm up, your blood vessels will dilate and help send all the ‚Äújunk‚Äù from your organs into your bloodstream, allowing your body to remove it naturally.
Not sure I want to try this one, but hey ‚Ä¶ who knows? MindBodyGreen.com
Get Down to Your Local Chipotle
Chili peppers, it seems, are what you need when you have a cold. I might be willing to try this one since I don‚Äôt have to starve and I do like spicy food!
ABCNews claims this works because chilis contain a compound called capsaicin which is an irritant as well as the thing that makes them spicy.
I guess, if you are all stuffed up, it does kind of make sense to eat something that will make your nose run and your eyes water. So, have some hot wings, spicy chili, some Korean BBQ, or hot Mexican dish. Or, maybe some chili powder in your tea or brownies. Chilis are nature‚Äôs remedy for congestion.
Okay then!
I tried the Naval Cure and I now feel a little better. Therefore, I am done with the whole cold-battling thing. I may have one more snort and then crawl off to bed.

And remember, my two really awesome books for sale on amazon.com. Both are available in Kindle and paperback and both are getting great reviews! Serpents Underfoot (A Military Action Thriller) and Adirondack Bear Tales (True Life Adirondack Bear Encounters). I would be honored to have you read one or both of them. Remember to let me know what you think.

Hope you feel better soon. Did you try the old Grandmother‚Äôs remedy of chicken soup?

I am not sure that one works on me anymore. I eat chicken soup a lot so I think the medicinal value has worn off. üòâ

Hey DC, I thought all navy guys drank rum? but I guess if it comes out off a barrel and is over 10 years old then just about anything, full bottle of course, will help with most illness!!
