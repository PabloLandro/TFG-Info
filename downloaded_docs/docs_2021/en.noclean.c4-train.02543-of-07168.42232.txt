How to Deal with a Head Cold and Migraine at the Same Time
Posted by Angie Glaser | Jan 23, 2019 | 9
Medical review by AHS Headache Specialist Katherine Hamilton, MD
The winter season brings cold and colds. A head cold is awful for anyone to deal with, but when you have migraine, ‘regular people sickness’ on top of other symptoms is a whole ‘nother ball game.

Sinus pressure mingles with migraine head pain. Feverish skin and dry eyes add to the aching sensitivity a migraine causes. Brain fog becomes intense. The head cold and migraine feed off each other, causing twice as much fatigue and twice as many body aches.
Sinus congestion can even trigger and worsen migraines since the sensory nerves of the nose and sinuses are part of the system involved in migraine.
Battling a head cold and Migraine at the same time is exhausting, but a few essential items make all the difference
When you deal with both a cold and migraine, the symptoms run together until you can’t tell which is causing which. All you know is you feel absolutely terrible.
We asked Dr. Susan Hutchinson, Migraine specialist, founder of Orange County Migraine and Headache Center, and family-practice physician, the best way to treat a head cold and migraine at the same time.
“It may be beneficial to take a decongestant containing pseudoephedrine in addition to the mmigraine-specific medication,” she said.
“Significantly, about 45% of migraine attacks are accompanied by nasal and sinus congestion, so if there are no signs of fever or illness, the migraine specific medication can be taken first.”
Migraine medication is helpful to try first, one study found that close to 90% of patients with ‘sinus headache‘ met the criteria for migraine 1).
“If the congestion is part of the migraine itself, the migraine medication can help clear up the ‘head cold symptoms.’ If the head cold symptoms persist then oral decongestants, nasal decongestants, and acetaminophen may safely be taken,” Dr. Hutchinson said.
A head cold should clear up on its own after about a week, and the symptoms can usually be managed with over-the-counter medication. However, Dr. Hutchinson added, “If head cold symptoms persist more than 5-7 days, medical attention should be sought in case a bacterial infection has developed, in which case antibiotics may be needed.”
7 Essentials for Surviving Cold and Flu Season with Migraine
Rubbing a few drops of peppermint oil between and my palms and inhaling through my nose is a favorite home remedy for a stuffy nose.
Avoiding the common cold, or its nefarious cousin the flu, is nearly impossible during the winter season. If you have frequent migraines or chronic migraine, that means you are likely to find yousrelf battling a head cold and migraine at the same.
In addition to Dr. Hutchinson’s expert advice, you can help your body feel better quickly by surrounding yourself with a essential items.
1 – VapoRub or peppermint essential oil are over-the-counter treatments popular for treating both a head cold and migraine. Vick’s VapoRub is an old-school home remedy to relieve head pain. A dab to the temples or back of the neck produces a pain-relieving tingle. Plus, many people find the peppermint scent relaxing.
Similarly, diluted peppermint essential oil can be applied to the base of the skull to relieve migraine pain. Both VapoRub and peppermint oil feel absolutely amazing when the scent is inhaled through inflamed, stuffy sinuses.

2 – A hot, steamy shower is essential for relieving sinus pressure. If, like me, heat helps rather than worsens your migraines, a hot shower is a valuable tool. A shower can provide much-needed relaxation and pain relief.
3 – An over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen can go a long way in relieving pain and inflammation. Even if analgesics do not help your migraine pain, they can still help a head cold induced headache.
Pay attention to how much you take – more than a few doses a week can lead to medication overuse headache. Naproxen (Aleve) has a lower risk for medication overuse headache, making it the safest option for migraine sufferers.
4 – A mug of hot tea is an inexpensive way to relieve symptoms of a cold and migraine. Peppermint tea and ginger tea both have anti-nausea properties, which is helpful if your migraines make you sick to your stomach. If caffeine helps your migraines, reach for a caffeinated cup of black tea or green tea. Any hot beverage will help soothe your cold symptoms and help you stay hydrated.
5 – A relaxing hobby for distraction can help replenish both your body and soul. Whether you chose a creative activity, a Netflix binge sesh, or an afternoon with your favorite book or audiobook, distraction is key for weathering the head cold and migraine storm.

6 – A big bowl of your favorite soup tastes extra delicious and nourishing when you’re sick. Feel free to use your head cold as an excuse to order take-out soup from your favorite MSG-free restaurant. Treating yourself to a favorite winter meal will soothe your sore throat and make the whole icky experience more bearable.
7 – Load up on vitamin C. Increasing your vitamin C intake at the first sign of a cold won’t keep you from getting sick, but it can help you get well more quickly, says the Mayo Clinic. (2).Fighting a cold and Migraine at the same time is extra draining, so anything that shortens the experience is welcome.
For extra relief, drink a cup of hot water with a slice of lemon* and a spoonful of honey. (*Bear in mind that citrus is a food trigger for some.)
The next time you find yourself battling a virus on top of a migraine, load up on tissues and a few essentials. Dedicating yourself to self-care will help you get back on your feet – and back to your life – as quickly as possible.

I have found it helpful to make a combination hot herbal tea mix for both colds and migraines, especially if you have them together. Steep an herbal tea for colds and Bengal Spice tea which has ginger in a pot of hot apple juice. What you get is one cup of tea that is tasty, decreases congestion, helps settle your stomach, and may even make you a little sleepy. Not a cure, but it beats swallowing a bunch of pills.

I dealt with this last week and totally did everything in the list. Also had my humidifier running and a warm eye pillow heated in the microwave (a sock filled with rice would work as well). The nasal decongestant helped so much!
