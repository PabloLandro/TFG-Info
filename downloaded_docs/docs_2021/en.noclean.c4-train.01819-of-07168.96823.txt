Cayenne Pepper and Migraines
Can Cayenne Pepper Help Eliminate Migraines?
by Glenn Reschke
Cayenne Pepper is an incredible medicinal herb that builds and nourishes the heart, immediately equalizing blood pressure upon its ingestion.
The health benefits of cayenne pepper are many and varied and for more information on its uses, please read the other pages in this website that you can see on the left-hand panel.
In this short article, I'd like to write about the effect of cayenne pepper upon migraines. Migraine headaches plague many.
In fact, over 45 million Americans suffer from chronic headaches with 28 million suffering from migraines.
I suspect those figures, percentage wise, are the same in Europe and in Australia and New Zealand.
I am not a doctor but a close friend, who is like my mother to me, has had virulent migraines until she started taking cayenne. Her doctor conveyed to her that migraines are caused by various stimuli, including but not limited to blood vessel contraction.
In fact, according to WebMD.com, "The exact causes of migraines are unknown although they are related to blood vessel contractions and other changes in the brain as well as inherited abnormalities in certain areas of the brain."
Moreover, WebMD.com also states that migraines are also heightened or even caused by light sensitivity, loud noise or strong odors, intense nausea or vomiting, a loss of appetite, and finally stomach upset or stomach pain.
I've personally never been afflicted with migraines; my adopted mother has, though. Sitting at her computer too long causes eye strain, which can cause a migraine. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is not uncommon.
More Health Benefits of Cayenne Pepper
There are some really significant therapeutic benefits of capsicum or cayenne without any side effects. So, without any further adieu, there's a natural solution for helping mitigating migraines. It is cayenne pepper. At the very least, it will severely lessen the recurrence of migraines.
So while it may not be a "cure," it will certainly give some relief. Let me quote in full what my relative wrote on the matter (she's the widow of my third cousin):
"I have had migraines for nearly 40 years now. They started about the time I began menopause. My headaches were not diagnosed as migraine, however, until about 16 years ago. I have tried everything from Aleve up to 2 treatments of Botox and nothing helped except ... cayenne pepper.It stops the headache, if taken at onset, 3 times out of 4. I get these headaches 2 to 4 times a week. You can't just sprinkle cayenne on your food, you have to drink it. Start with a tiny bit in half a glass of warm water, stir well, and drink it, follow it with cold water to stop the burning sensation in your mouth. Work up to a full tsp of cayenne. I use cayenne on my food as well. It is my miracle med and is a lot cheaper than Imitrex or Maxalt or preventive meds such as Topamax or Depacote, and there is no side effect with cayenne except for a little burning sensation in the mouth that doesn't last. (Disclaimer: This is my opinion and not to be considered medical advise without further research & discussion with your physician.)"
When my relative told me that her doctor said the main cause of migraines is caused by a constriction of the blood vessels in the head, my ears perked up.
One of the chief claims of cayenne pepper is that it immediately equalizes blood pressure throughout the body. As written elsewhere in this site, famed herbalist and naturopathic doctor Dr. John R. Christopher said he stopped many heart attacks if he could simply get a teaspon of cayenne pepper tea in them.
Once the heart attack was stopped, he had them drink a full glass or cup of cayenne pepper tea. (Drinking an eight ounce glass of warm cayenne pepper water is what Dr. Christopher termed "cayenne pepper tea.")
Cayenne pepper will equalize the blood pressure and thus relieve pressure in the head region. That is why my loving relative has had some tangible success with cayenne. Quite frankly, I knew cayenne was great for your heart and venous structure and in immediately stopping bleeding but not migraines.
It only further enhances my respect for this wonderful herb that is largely passed over by the medical community.
So, if you're a migraine suffer, try cayenne pepper. Cayenne pepper and migraines go hand-in-hand like peas and carrots. Drink at least a glass a day but if you can working up to 2 to 3 a day starting with just a third of a teaspoon. It will help.
It may not completely eliminate your migraines but at the very least it will mitigate its effects and the frequency of the migraines.
(The goal should be to be able to take a full teaspoon of cayenne daily.)
Take a glass of cayenne pepper tea or water upon the outset of the migraine headache and you should see results within a few minutes. Combine it with deep breathing and relaxed images and this should help significantly.
By the way, if you're worried about cayenne side effects, don't be but this page should help you assuage any concerns.
