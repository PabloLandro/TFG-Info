Croup (viral bronchitis)
If your child awakens with a harsh “barking” cough, you should moisten the surrounding air with a “cool mist” vaporizer. Air in the room should be as moist as possible. If you do not have a vaporizer or humidifier, running the shower in the bathroom is a good way to produce steam quickly. You should stay with your toddler and let him or her breath the steam but do not put them in the hot water. If there is no improvement and there is difficulty in breathing take your child to Children’s emergency room for assessment and treatment. Notify me the day after this cough begins because I may be able to shorten the illness and reduce its severity by prescribing a steroid medication.
