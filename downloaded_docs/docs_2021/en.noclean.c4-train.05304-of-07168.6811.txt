Antifungal; azole (imidazole derivative).a
Uses for Miconazole Nitrate
Dermatophytoses
Treatment of tinea corporis (body ringworm) and tinea cruris (jock itch) caused by Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, or T. rubrum.a d h
Treatment of tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) caused by Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, or T. rubrum.a d f g
Topical antifungals usually effective for treatment of uncomplicated tinea corporis or tinea cruris.104 105 106 108 An oral antifungal preferred when tinea corporis or tinea cruris is extensive, dermatophyte folliculitis is present, infection is chronic or does not respond to topical therapy, or patient is immunocompromised because of coexisting disease or concomitant therapy.104 105 106 108
Topical antifungals usually effective for treatment of uncomplicated tinea pedis.104 105 106 107 108 An oral antifungal may be necessary for treatment of hyperkeratotic areas on the palms and soles,105 108 for chronic moccasin-type (dry-type) tinea pedis,104 105 107 and for tinea unguium (fingernail or toenail dermatophyte infections, onychomycosis).104 105 106 107 108
Pityriasis (Tinea) Versicolor
Treatment of pityriasis (tinea) versicolor† caused by Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare or P. ovale).a
Topical treatment usually effective;104 105 107 110 111 112 an oral antifungal (alone or in conjunction with a topical antifungal) may be necessary in patients who have extensive or severe infections or who fail to respond to or have frequent relapses with topical therapy.107 110 111
Cutaneous Candidiasis
Treatment of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida albicans.a d
Treatment of candidal diaper dermatitis.b i Treatment of choice is a topical antifungal (e.g., nystatin, clotrimazole, miconazole).i Most infants with candidal diaper dermatitis harbor C. albicans in their intestines and infected feces appear to be an important source of the cutaneous infection.i Some clinicians recommend that an oral antifungal (e.g., oral nystatin) be administered concomitantly to treat the intestinal infection,i but studies have not provided evidence that concomitant oral and topical therapy is more effective than topical therapy alone.i
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
Treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (mild to moderate, sporadic or infrequent, most likely caused by Candida albicans, occurring in immunocompetent women).100 102 113 114 115 118 119 135 j l m A drug of choice.100 102 113 114 115 118 119 135 j l m
Self-medication (OTC use) for treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis in otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women who have been previously diagnosed by a clinician and are having a recurrence of similar symptoms.c e
Treatment of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, including infections that are recurrent (≥4 episodes in 1 year), severe (extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, fissure formation), caused by Candida other than C. albicans, or occurring in women with underlying medical conditions (uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy, pregnancy).100 k l Complicated infections generally require more prolonged treatment than uncomplicated infections.100 l k

Cautions for Miconazole Nitrate
Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to miconazole or any ingredient in the formulation.a b
Warnings/Precautions
Warnings
Use of Latex or Rubber Products
Miconazole vaginal suppositories contain petroleum base that can weaken latex or rubber products (including condoms and vaginal contraceptive diaphragms).a Concurrent use not recommended.a Consider use of miconazole vaginal cream as an alternative to the suppositories.a
Sensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Contact dermatitis reported following topical application of miconazole or other imidazole-derivative azole antifungals.125 126 127 128 129 130
If irritation or sensitivity occurs, discontinue the drug and contact a clinician.a
Possible cross-sensitization among the imidazoles.125 126 127 128 129 130 a
General Precautions
Selection and Use of Antifungals for Diaper Dermatitis
Prior to use of ointment for adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis, confirm diagnosis of candidiasis with microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast.b A positive fungal culture for C. albicans is not adequate evidence of candidal infection since colonization with C. albicans can result in a positive culture.b
Use ointment as part of a treatment regimen that includes measures directed at the underlying diaper dermatitis; the ointment is not a substitute for frequent diaper changes.b Do not use to prevent diaper dermatitis; preventive use may result in development of drug resistance.b
Safety and efficacy of ointment for treatment of diaper dermatitis in immunocompromised patients not established.b
Safety and efficacy of ointment have not been evaluated in incontinent adults; do not use in an attempt to prevent occurrence of diaper dermatitis (e.g., in adult institutional settings).b
Selection and Use of Antifungals for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
Prior to initial use in a woman with signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal candidiasis, confirm the diagnosis by potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopic mounts and/or cultures.100 102
Candida identified by culture in the absence of symptoms is not an indication for antifungal treatment since approximately 10–20% of women harbor Candida or other yeasts in the vagina.100
If clinical symptoms persist, repeat tests to rule out other pathogens, to confirm the original diagnosis, and to rule out other conditions that may predispose a patient to recurrent vaginal fungal infections.a
Do not use for self-medication in women who have never had a vaginal yeast infection diagnosed by a clinician,c e in women who are or think they may be pregnant, or in women with HIV infection or exposure.c e
Other Administration Precautions
Topical skin preparations are for external use only.a Do not administer orally or intravaginally.a Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes.a
Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and inhaling the contents of the aerosols can be harmful or fatal.f g
Specific Populations

Pediatric Use
Topical skin preparations: Use in children <2 years of age only if directed by a clinician.a d f g Use in children ≥2–11 years of age only under adult supervision.a
Ointment for candidal diaper dermatitis: Safety and efficacy not established in infants <4 weeks of age (premature or term) or very-low-birth weight infants.b (See Selection and Use of Antifungals for Diaper Dermatitis under Cautions.)
Intravaginal preparations: Safety and efficacy for self-medication not established in children <12 years of age.a e

Actions and Spectrum
Imidazole-derivative azole antifungal.a
Usually fungistatic in action; can be fungicidal at high concentrations or against very susceptible organisms (e.g., Candida).a
Presumably exerts its antifungal activity by altering cellular membranes, resulting in increased membrane permeability.a Interferes with ergosterol biosynthesis.b
Spectrum of antifungal activity includes many fungi, including yeasts and dermatophytes.a Also has in vitro activity against some gram-positive bacteria.a
Candida: Active against Candida albicans,a b C. guilliermondii,a and C. tropicalis.a
Dermatophytes and other fungi: Active against Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and T. rubrum.a
Bacteria: Active against Staphylococcus aureus.a
Cross-resistance can occur among the azole antifungals.
Advice to Patients
Topical Administration
Importance of completing full course of therapy, even if symptoms improve.d
Importance of contacting clinician if condition worsens during treatment or if improvement does not occur after completing full course of therapy.d
Importance of discontinuing use and consulting clinician if treated area becomes irritated (e.g., itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing).d
Importance of applying topical skin preparations to affected areas as directed and avoiding contact with eyes, nose, mouth, or mucous membranes.b d
Importance of washing hands after applying miconazole.b
Importance of consulting a clinician before using tincture if diagnosed with diabetes, circulatory, renal, or hepatic problems.d
For patients with tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), importance of wearing well-fitting, ventilated shoes and changing socks at least once daily.a d
For patients with candidal diaper dermatitis, importance of using ointment only for diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis.b Not for preventative use;b should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes and should not be used long term.b
For patients with candidal diaper dermatitis, importance of gently cleansing diaper area with lukewarm water or a very mild soap and patting dry with a soft towel before applying ointment.b Importance of not rubbing ointment into skin since this may cause additional irritation.b
Importance of not using ointment on children for whom it is not prescribed.b
