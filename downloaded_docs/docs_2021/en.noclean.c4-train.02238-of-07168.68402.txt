Call 911 if:
For All Burns
For First-Degree Burns (Affecting Top Layer of Skin)
For Second-Degree Burns (Affecting Top 2 Layers of Skin)
For Third-Degree Burns
Call 911 if:
The burn penetrates all layers of the skin.
The skin is leathery or charred looking, with white, brown, or black patches.
The hands, feet, face, or genitals are burned.
The person is an infant or a senior.
For All Burns
1. Stop Burning Immediately
Put out fire or stop the person's contact with hot liquid, steam, or other material.
Help the person "stop, drop, and roll" to smother flames.
Remove smoldering material from the person.
Remove hot or burned clothing. If clothing sticks to skin, cut or tear around it.
2. Remove Constrictive Clothing Immediately
Take off jewelry, belts, and tight clothing. Burns can swell quickly.
Then take the following steps:
For First-Degree Burns (Affecting Top Layer of Skin)
1. Cool Burn
Hold burned skin under cool (not cold) running water or immerse in cool water until pain subsides.
Use compresses if running water isn’t available.
2. Protect Burn
Cover with sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.
Do not apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.
3. Treat Pain
Give over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or naproxen (Aleve).
4. When to See a Doctor
Seek medical help if:
You see signs of infection, like increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or oozing.
The person needs tetanus or booster shot, depending on date of last injection. Tetanus booster should be given every 10 years.
The burn blister is larger than two inches or oozes.
Redness and pain last more than a few hours.
Pain worsens.
5. Follow Up
The doctor will examine the burn and may prescribe antibiotics and pain medication.
For Second-Degree Burns (Affecting Top 2 Layers of Skin)
1. Cool Burn
Immerse in cool water for 10 or 15 minutes.
Use compresses if running water isn’t available.
Don’t apply ice. It can lower body temperature and cause further pain and damage.
Don’t break blisters or apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.
2. Protect Burn
Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage and secure in place with gauze or tape.
3. Prevent Shock
Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury, or it would cause discomfort:
Lay the person flat.
Elevate feet about 12 inches.
Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible.
Cover the person with coat or blanket.
4. See a Doctor
The doctor can test burn severity, prescribe antibiotics and pain medications, and administer a tetanus shot, if needed.
Continued
For Third-Degree Burns
1. Call 911
2. Protect Burn Area
Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage or, for large areas, a sheet or other material that that won’t leave lint in wound.
Separate burned toes and fingers with dry, sterile dressings.
Do not soak burn in water or apply ointments or butter, which can cause infection.
3. Prevent Shock
Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury or it would cause discomfort:
Lay the person flat.
Elevate feet about 12 inches.
Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible.
Cover the person with coat or blanket.
For an airway burn, do not place pillow under the person's head when the person is lying down. This can close the airway.
Have a person with a facial burn sit up.
Check pulse and breathing to monitor for shock until emergency help arrives.
4. See a Doctor
Doctors will give oxygen and fluid, if needed, and treat the burn.
