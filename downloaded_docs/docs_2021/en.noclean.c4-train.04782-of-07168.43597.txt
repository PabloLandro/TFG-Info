Anemia is a condition that develops when there are not enough red blood cells or hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is the main component of red blood cells. When red blood cells and hemoglobin levels are abnormal, cells do not get enough oxygen resulting in lethargy and fatigue — thus making it the most common symptom of anemia.
There are many types of anemia(1), each having its own cause. This condition can either be a temporary or long-term one. When not treated in time, anemia can become fatal. People who take poor diet and who have chronic health conditions are more susceptible to the disorder. It is alarming to see the rate at which the number of women is suffering from anemia.
