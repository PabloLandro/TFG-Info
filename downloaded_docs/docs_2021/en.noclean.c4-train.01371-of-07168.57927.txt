Acne, oily skin and blocked pore treatment
Acne-prone skin responds best to a tailored combination of treatments and skincare products
There are many prescription treatments for acne.
Generally, though, acne-prone skin responds best to a specifically-tailored combination of treatments. These include
skin peels
photo laser treatment
LED light therapy
micro-needling (which is also suitable for acne scarring, once the breakouts have stopped)
and other rejuvenating skin treatments.
Treatment and product options

Your questions answered
What makes acne worse?
The Sun
Exposing scars to the sun can cause them to darken and slow the healing process. Ultraviolet rays stimulate melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) leading to further discolouration.
Before heading outdoors, use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, with the physical blocker zinc oxide, and reapply every two hours. Did you know the difference between a physical sun block and a chemical sun cream? Physical sun block instantly protects your skin without the need for waiting before it starts to work and doesn't contain chemicals that may increase sensitivity to your skin or block the skin with additives that are not healthy for you or your skin.
At Skin Perfection we have physical blocks and sunscreens that do not do this, unlike the chemical sunscreens we are used to buying over the counter or in department stores, causing your acne and redness to worsen.
Picking and squeezing
Scars, which are made mainly of collagen (a protein fibre normally found in the skin's second layer), are the body's way of repairing itself. Acne scars are typically indented because of collagen-loss from intense inflammation. Picking leads to further inflammation and injury of the skin, which adds to the skin’s discolouration and scarring. Squeezing or trying to pop a pimple causes pus and bacteria to filter deeper into the skin, resulting in more collagen damage and spread of bacteria causing more spots, then more scars.
Vitamin E
You may have heard that applying topical vitamin E to a scar will help it heal faster.
But, according to a study from researchers at the University of Miami, applying the nutrient directly onto a scar can actually hinder its healing. In the study, vitamin E had no effect (or made matters worse) for 90% of the patients, and 33% who used topical vitamin E developed a contact dermatitis.
Vitamin A, or derivatives of vitamin A, actually help better. Also Vitamin C, which calms any inflammation, protects your skin from free radical damage and helps to lighten any discolouration to the skin.
How do the treatments work?
Today’s cosmetic treatments can now reduce – or in many cases, completely remove – acne scars and there are several options for treatment.
The most effective treatments and skincare products from Skin Perfection are listed below.
Benzyl peroxide For mild acne, you may try, or your doctor may recommend, treatment with a non-prescription medication that contains benzyl peroxide (although this is usually more effective in combination with other treatments).
LED light therapy Proven to be effective at reducing acne and killing the bacteria under the skin.
Medical grade home skincare Prescribed by your skin specialist for use on a daily basis, morning and night, to help manage and maintain your breakouts and healthy skin.
Medical grade mineral make up A better option than spending money on great treatments and products then applying the incorrect make up, which may be the cause of you going round in circles and blocking the skin, causing new breakouts, scars or irritated skin.
Medical micro-dermabrasion: a fast and effective treatment for keratosis pilaris that uses a non-surgical but deep-penetrating resurfacing procedure to clean blocked or congested pores; tailored to your skin condition and with little downtime. This is a more effective treatment than ordinary, salon-grade micro-dermabrasion (hence the word ‘medical’) as the crystals used are aluminium oxide and sapphire-shaped, which means they hit the skin at every angle. Unlike many clinics or medi-spas, we only use sterile disposable tips, one for each patient and we never use the same tip for anyone else.
Photo rejuvenation laser therapy Boosts new skin growth, reduces scars and kills off bacteria. It's also proven to be effective at reducing redness and acne when combined with light facial peeling.
Microneedling using Dermastamp or Dermaroller is the latest celebrity ‘secret weapon’ to treat acne scars and leave your skin bright, clear and bursting with youthful radiance.
It can be used with skin peels if you are suitable and happy to embark this course that will really improve the texture of your skin. The Dermaroller uses micro-medical skin-needling to stimulate the natural healing process, using your own collagen to regenerate and repair your skin naturally while skin peels use active ingredients to dissolve and remove unwanted lesions on the skin.
Skin peels or resurfacers: help to improve skin texture and redefine pores, and suitable for a range of conditions including pigmentation (discolouration), scars left by ingrown hairs, lines and wrinkles, redness (or rosacea) and acne; available in different strengths and with different downtimes, according to your skin condition as well as time, financial or social commitments.

What our clients say
5 out of 5
I have been coming here for the last year and can honestly say it is one of the best salons I’ve been to… I’ve been having the micro needling treatment and my skin has never been better. I would highly recommend this treatment and salon.

I’ve been coming here for over a month now for blue LED light treatment and can’t recommend enough! The treatment itself has done wonders for my acne, the staff are lovely and the location is great. I also think the prices are very reasonable and have recommended Skin Perfection to my sister, who has started the same treatment.

I have visited the saloon for 6 course of yellow LED light therapy. The ladies there are all very nice and gave me full information about the treatment before during and after the course of 6. It is quite difficult to take appointment within a short time so i suggest to book your slot asap as they get fully booked very easily. …

Skin Perfection is one of the best clinics I have ever been to, they know what they talking about when it comes to your skin… When you first step in the clinic you are made to feel very welcome not rushed and they listen to what your concerns are about your skin, and what products will be best for your skin.
Caroline Hendey

I had my first session of laser hair removal today. I was anxious but Lauren B was very informative, professional and patient. I even noticed results from my patch test. The clinic is sparkling clean and clinically spotless. They are fully informed and professionally trained and I’m looking forward to the rest of my treatments. …
Sashy Nightingale

… I’m delighted with the results of my recent LVL (“lash volume lift”) treatment. Lilly added volume and dimension to my stick straight, long blonde lashes. The curl and blue/black tint really made them pop! I feel so pretty and awake now without makeup, and with mascara, the extra drama is intense in the best way. So happy I found a way to enhance my lashe without those high-maintenance and damaging extensions.
Lindsay Gray
5 out of 5
… I have had a course of skin treatments: photofacial rejuvenation combined with a peel and my skin feels so much better for it. It can be uncomfortable during treatment but definitely worth the results.
Steph Haverly
4.5 out of 5
I’d highly recommend Skin Perfection. I’ve used them for my lazer hair removal and it has been extremely successful. They are incredibly professional, fast and organised, always texting or calling before appointments, always on time and the treatment itself has worked really well and I’m going to continue using them for more.
