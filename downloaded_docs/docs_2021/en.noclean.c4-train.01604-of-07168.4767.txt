Background
Zinc is a trace mineral that is needed for many important functions in the body. The human body contains approximately 2-3 grams of zinc, mostly in the skeletal muscles and bones. Zinc is also found in the kidney, pancreas, retina, teeth, hair, skin, liver, blood cells, prostate, and testes.
Zinc is available through foods such as beef, pork, shellfish, peanuts, and legumes. Severe zinc deficiency may still be found in developing countries. Deficiency may cause problems with growth, diarrhea, hair loss, and immune function. Although it is rare in developed countries, some cases may be found in elderly and pregnant people. Mild zinc deficiency may be overlooked, since symptoms are not always obvious and may include loss of hair, appetite, weight, and the senses of taste and smell.
Zinc has been found to be effective for treating diarrhea, stomach ulcers, and zinc deficiency. There is good evidence to support its use for acne, ADHD, herpes simplex virus, immune function, and sickle cell anemia. Zinc has also been studied for Wilson's disease (excessive copper in the body), although results are mixed. Zinc has gained popularity for preventing the common cold, but research is still unclear.
There is still controversy on the role of zinc for many other diseases. Much evidence is conflicting or unclear.
Evidence Table
These uses have been tested in humans or animals. Safety and effectiveness have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are potentially serious, and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider.
GRADE *
Studies in developing countries found that zinc may reduce the severity and duration of diarrhea in poorly nourished children, especially those with low zinc levels.
A
The healing process of stomach ulcers may be enhanced through treatment with zinc, although more studies are needed to more clearly determine its effects. Most studies report few or no side effects associated with its use.
A
Zinc deficiency is caused by inadequate intake or absorption, increased zinc excretion, or increased bodily need for zinc. Zinc deficiency symptoms include growth and development problems, hair loss, diarrhea, impotence, eye and skin conditions, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include weight loss, delayed wound healing, taste changes, and mental slowness. Zinc can be measured in plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and hair.
A
Zinc taken by mouth or applied to the skin seems to be a safe and effective treatment for acne. However, some results are conflicting, and many studies used combination treatments. More research on the effects of zinc alone are needed.
B
Early studies report that zinc may benefit children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Zinc may reduce hyperactive, impulsive, and social problems. Zinc may be more effective for older children with higher body mass index (BMI) scores. Further research is required.
B
Early research has looked at the use of zinc for herpes types 1 or 2. Several studies used combination treatments, so the exact role of zinc is unclear. However, most results suggest that zinc may be a safe and effective alternative treatment for herpes types 1 and 2.
B
Zinc appears to be essential for the immune system, but research on its impact on immune function is limited. Zinc gluconate may benefit immune cells. There are few studies on zinc levels and zinc use in elderly people. Further research is needed before a conclusion can be made.
B
There is good evidence to suggest that zinc may help manage or reduce symptoms of sickle cell anemia. Most of these studies reported increased height, weight, immune system function, and testosterone levels, and decreased numbers of complications following zinc treatment.
B
Early research suggests that zinc treatment may be effective in the management of Wilson's disease. More studies are needed to confirm these early results. Galzin® (zinc acetate) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used to block the absorption of copper in people with Wilson's disease. It is meant to be an additional treatment to standard therapy.
B
Most studies have found a lack of positive effect of zinc on macular degeneration. However, some high-quality research has found that zinc may help prevent the disease. Since study results are conflicting, more research is needed before a conclusion can be made.
C
In early research, supplementation that included zinc in HIV-infected children improved appetite. However, the effects of zinc alone cannot be determined at this time. More studies using zinc alone are needed before a conclusion may be made.
C

C
Early studies report that zinc supplementation in people under 70 may benefit cognitive function. More studies are needed before a conclusion may be made.
C
Available studies report conflicting results on the impact of zinc on the common cold. Overall, studies suggest that if taken when symptoms begin, zinc may help treat cold symptoms. Effects are strongest in adults. Zinc gluconate is not recommended for sore throats. Further research is needed to clarify which zinc formulas are effective for reducing symptoms. More studies are needed before a firm conclusion may be drawn.
C
Zinc supplementation lacked effect on the nutritional status of people receiving CAPD in early studies. Further research is needed to confirm these results.
C

Avoid in people who are at risk for hemochromatosis (a metabolic disorder involving iron-containing pigments in the tissues).
Avoid using for longer than 6-8 weeks for the common cold.
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
Zinc is likely safe when taken by mouth in amounts generally found in foods (or as part of a multivitamin/multimineral compound) at levels less than the UL in non-allergic women.
The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for zinc during pregnancy and breastfeeding is as follows: for pregnant women 19 years old and older, 11 milligrams daily; for pregnant women 14-18 years of age, 13 milligrams daily; for breastfeeding women 19 years of age and older, 12 milligrams daily; and for breastfeeding women 14-18 years of age, 14 milligrams daily.
