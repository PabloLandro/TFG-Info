Abstract
OBJECTIVE:
To determine the efficacy of duct tape compared with placebo in the treatment of verruca vulgaris.
DESIGN AND SETTING:
A randomized placebo-controlled trial in 3 primary schools in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS:
One hundred three children aged 4 to 12 years with verruca vulgaris.
INTERVENTIONS:
Duct tape applied to the wart or placebo, a corn pad (protection ring for clavi), applied around the wart for 1 night a week. Both treatments were applied for a period of 6 weeks. Patients were blinded to the hypothesis of the study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT:
Complete resolution of the treated wart.
RESULTS:
After 6 weeks, the wart had disappeared in 16% of the children in the duct tape group compared with 6% in the placebo group (P = .12). The estimated effect of duct tape compared with placebo on diameter reduction of the treated wart was 1.0 mm (P = .02, 95% confidence interval, -1.7 to -0.1). After 6 weeks, in 7 children (21%) in the duct tape group, a surrounding wart had disappeared compared with 9 children (27%) in the placebo group (P = .79). Fifteen percent of the children in the duct tape group reported adverse effects such as erythema, eczema, and wounds compared with 0 in the placebo group (P = .14).
CONCLUSION:
In a 6-week trial, duct tape had a modest but nonsignificant effect on wart resolution and diameter reduction when compared with placebo in a cohort of primary school children.

Warts: does the duct tape theory stick? [J Fam Pract. 2007]
Duct tape may not be superior to placebo in the treatment of common warts. [J Pediatr. 2007]
Studies should report estimates of treatment effects with confidence intervals. [Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2007]
