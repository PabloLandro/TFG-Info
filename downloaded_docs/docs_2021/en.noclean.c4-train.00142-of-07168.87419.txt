​How to Fade Any Type of Scar
​Your go-to guide on proper scar care

Our scars show where we’ve been — but sometimes we wish they wouldn’t. So we went to the experts: Are all scars really permanent — and what can we do to make them fade away?
New York City dermatologist Debra Jaliman gave us the details on the different scars and treatments available. Here’s what you need to know.
Identify What Type of Scar You Have
Your genetics and skin type determine whether your skin scars easily, and what type of scar you’re likely to get. In this case, your grooming routine is less important; someone with the most moisturized skin can still scar.
Keloid scars are thick, raised scars that spread beyond the original wound. They more commonly affect people with darker skin. Hypertrophic scars are also elevated, but contained. Your surgery scar is most likely a hypertrophic scar. Contractures are tight, shiny patches — often the result of burns or other broad, severe damage.
Inflammatory cystic acne can cause acne scars. There are a few types of acne scars, too: icepick, box, and rolling scars. Icepick scars are thin, deep scars common for those with cystic acne. Box scars are wider, depressed acne scars. Rolling acne scars are broad divots in the skin with rounded, or rolling edges.
Pigmentation scars are abnormal discolorations anywhere on the skin. Think: red, brown, or white patches or spots of skin.
Lastly, a white scar means the skin has lost its pigment.
The Do-It-Yourself Method
For at-home care, Jaliman swears by Mepiform silicone bandages for new hypertrophic and keloid scars. ($20, amazon.com). The pressure from the bandages help flatten the scar and correct discoloration, but it can take a few months for improvement. Cut to size and apply the adhesive silicone sheet, wear it until it falls off.
Vitamin C serums will also help fight discoloration and brighten a dark brown pigmentation scar. Try this one from Mario Badescu ($45, amazon.com). Opt for products with green tea and hyaluronic acid for reddish scars, like this cream from Youth to the People ($48, sephora.com).
If none of those suit you, there’s always good, old Mederma ($15, amazon.com). The trusty gel helps you shed old skin while forming new tissue.
And if you heard that cracking open vitamin E tablets on your skin can help fix a scar, don’t believe the hype. It’s an ineffective old wives’ tale.
Seek In-Office Care
You have many options when it comes in-office scar treatment, just don’t expect a bargain (or any help from your insurance). Do your research, then talk to a dermatologist to see what makes sense for your skin and your wallet.
Jaliman says people most often seek professional help with depressed, sunken scars. Ice pick scars are best treated with punch incisions, where they cut out the scar then resurface the skin. This can cost over $400 a scar.
For a heavy-duty solution to depressed scars, consider a Platelet-rich plasma treatment. This involves taking your blood, separating out the plasma, then injecting it back into your face to stimulate collagen to generate skin cells. It works miracles, but it will cost you. A session can hit you for about $1,500, Jaliman says, and you’ll have to have multiple sessions.
Other options include injections (like collagen and steroid), laser, and microdermabrasion treatments. The minimum for a laser treatment can be about $150 for a tiny scar. Cryotherapy (freezing away buildups of scar tissue) works better for large, elevated scars.
For those white scars—where pigment has faded—there’s no true treatment. At most, a dermatologist can fade any discoloration around the scar to make it less noticeable. You may also see some improvement with a chemical peel.
Act Fast and Plan Ahead
You can’t repair old skin damage while allowing for new damage via UV rays. Jaliman prefers zinc sunblock, as she says it’s like putting a shirt on over a scar. This one from Neutrogena is lightweight, but powerful. ($11, target.com)
You can avoid acne scars by not picking at your face. Seriously, leave it alone. Get an extraction facial if you need to attend to your whiteheads.
Upon getting an actual cut, clean the wound and keep it clean. Use bandages and antibacterial creams—and don’t exercise. The only running you should do is running to get scar cream or schedule a dermatologist appointment.
“If you have a scar that bothers you, try to address earlier rather than later.” Jaliman says. “It certainly gets harder as the scar gets older.”
