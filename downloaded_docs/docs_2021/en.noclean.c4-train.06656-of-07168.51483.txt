DESCRIPTION
Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). IL-4 and IL-13 are key type 2 (including Th2) cytokines involved in atopic dermatitis.
INDICATIONS
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.
