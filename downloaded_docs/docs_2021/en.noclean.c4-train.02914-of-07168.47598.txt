Are you experiencing any of the following symptoms?
Cracked Skin on Heels
Peeling Skin In-Between Toes
Itchy Skin on Feet
Redness on Skin
Skin Irritation (especially at night)
Smelly Feet
Dr. Bob Recommends the following Footcare Tips:
The skin on heels and feet is suseptable to a number of different conditions that can be avoided by following a few simple steps. The most common conditios people report are peeling, cracking, irritation, redness and even foul odor. It is normal for anyone to experience at least one of these conditions in their lifetime; the good news is that these symptoms are easily treated and their recurrence can be easily prevented.
Avoid Excess Dryness - Applying harsh chemicals or soaking your feet in acidic substances can dry out the skin and leave the foot susceptible to cracking and peeling. Simply washing your feet twice a day and thoroughly drying will help control foot odor and prevent further peeling and cracking of the heel.
Take a GOOD, HARD look at your feet - Inspect your entire foot. Look closely in between toes and check for any signs of fungus. Foot Fungus and Athlete's Foot are a major cause of itchy peeling skin in-between toes. Fungus can spread onto the heels and toenails, thus it is crucial to spot the fungus before it gets out of hand and continues to damage the skin.
Change your socks and shoes - NEVER reuse socks before washing them! Also, try not to wear shoes without socks. If your feet sweat it is imperative that you take steps to avoid sweat buildup in your shoes and socks. Apply gold bond foot powder directly onto the foot and sprinkle some into your shoes before dressing.
Treat Any Fungal Infections, Cuts, Abrasions and Warts on the heels and feet - Before you can achieve happy healthy feet you must first treat any underlying conditions that can cause future problems. Applying an Anti-Fungal moisturizing Foot Cream such as PediMD will eliminate fungus and prevent issues such as cracking heels, peeling skin and smelly feet.

The problem with most fungus skin medications is that they work only when applied. As soon as the medication is stopped, the fungus returns to the skin. Furthermore, most of the medications dry the skin and can cause crackina, peeling and pain. Finally, they are very strong and can only be used for short periods of time.
