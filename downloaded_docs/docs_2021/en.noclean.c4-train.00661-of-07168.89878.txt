Scar Cream Ingredients
When a burn, cut, sore or blemish alters the skin, the skin works to repair itself by developing a scar, according to MedlinePlus. How the scar looks depends on your genetic predisposition toward scar development and the severity of the wound itself. Because the collagen fibers that comprise the scar tend to be hardened, a scar treatment cream may be applied to the area in order to soften the scar and reduce its appearance.
Silicone
Silicone is an ingredient sold in both gel and bandage form to treat scars according to Go Ask Alice, a resource of Columbia University. Silicone moisturizes the skin, which helps to soften the scar. Scar tissue forms when collagen fibers---which make up scar tissue---in the skin arrange haphazardly to repair a wound. Columbia University researchers theorize that silicone also attracts static electricity, which could cause the collagen fibers in a scar to rearrange themselves in a more even manner. This treatment may be particularly useful in treating keloid scars, according to the American College of Dermatology. Silicone gel or pads must be applied frequently in order to prove effective, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.
Onion Extract
Onion extract has natural anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce redness in a scar, and is often used in scar treatment creams and gels. This treatment must be applied several times per day over the course of several months in order to prove effective, according to Go Ask Alice. Onion extract may be most effective in treating new scars. This extract also softens scar tissue and inhibits the overproduction of collagen.
Alpha Hydroxy Acids
Alpha Hydroxy Acids, or AHA's, are derived from fruit acids, such as those found in sugar cane, oranges and lemons. These acids treat scars by reducing the dead skin cells on the skin's outer layer. When applied topically, AHA's penetrate the skin and cause a chemical reaction that releases dead skin cells from healthy cells, according to Go Ask Alice. In addition to reducing the amount of dead skin cells on the scar, the application of AHA's can help to reduce the scar's redness. AHA based creams are sold over the counter, and their components are often listed as glycolic, lactic, malic or citric acid.
Hydroquinone
Because a scar can be red or discolored in appearance, a dermatologist may prescribe a skin bleaching combination of hydroquinone and glycolic acid, according to Dr. Audrey Kunin, a dermatologist writing for DERMADoctor, a skincare resource site. The glycolic acid helps to exfoliate skin cells while the hydroquinone bleaches the area, making the scar fade closer to your skin's natural tone. Because this may make you more susceptible to sunburn and discoloration, always wear sunscreen when using hydroquinone cream.
