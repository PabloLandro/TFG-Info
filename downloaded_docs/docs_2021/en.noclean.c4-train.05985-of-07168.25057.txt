Anchor found at NN
I went out for a fish off narrow neck today ,on the way back in I had a few casts around the reef marker and found a plywood handle with some blue cord on it ,gave it a pull and up came a nice little anchor .So if it's yours send me a message and you can come and collect it
cheers
