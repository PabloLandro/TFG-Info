Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Ferrous Sulfate Oral tablet, extended-release
What is this medicine?
IRON (AHY ern) replaces iron that is essential to healthy red blood cells. Iron is used to treat iron deficiency anemia. Anemia may cause problems like tiredness, shortness of breath, or slowed growth in children. Only take iron if your doctor has told you to. Do not treat yourself with iron if you are feeling tired. Most healthy people get enough iron in their diets, particularly if they eat cereals, meat, poultry, and fish.
This medicine may be used for other purposes; ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions.
What should I tell my health care provider before I take this medicine?
They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
frequently drink alcohol
bowel disease
hemolytic anemia
iron overload (hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis)
liver disease
problems with swallowing
stomach ulcer or other stomach problems
an unusual or allergic reaction to iron, other medicines, foods, dyes, or preservatives
pregnant or trying to get pregnant
breast-feeding
How should I use this medicine?
Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water or fruit juice. Follow the directions on the prescription label. Swallow whole. Do not crush or chew.

breast-feeding
How should I use this medicine?
Take this medicine by mouth. Follow the directions on the prescription label. Shake well before use. Use a special dropper or spoon to measure your medicine. Ask your pharmacist if you do not have one. Household spoons are not accurate. You may mix the solution in the glass of water or fruit juice and drink the liquid through a straw to decrease contact of the fluid with the teeth. You may take this medicine with food. Take your medicine at regular intervals. Do not take your medicine more often than directed. Do not stop taking except on your doctor's advice.
Talk to your pediatrician regarding the use of this medicine in children. While this drug may be prescribed for even very young children and infants for selected conditions, precautions do apply. Never give iron to a child or infant unless directed by a doctor to do so. If you are giving the drops to an infant, you may mix the drops in a small amount of infant formula prior to bottle-feeding.
Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.
NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with others.

Liquid iron preparations can cause temporary staining of the teeth. Mix in water or juice and drink through a straw to prevent staining. Stains on adult teeth can be reduced or removed by brushing the teeth with baking soda. Check with your doctor regarding teeth stains in children.
