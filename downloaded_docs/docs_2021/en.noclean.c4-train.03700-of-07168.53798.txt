Preventing and Treating Athlete's Foot

Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection. The symptoms of athlete's foot include itching, burning, and stinging. The skin on your foot may peel, and there may be pain, itching, and fissuring in the toe webs. Dr. Bryan Sheehan at Ankle & Foot Centers of Mid-America in Bentonville, AR, and Grove, OK, offers treatments for athlete's foot. Here are six strategies for the prevention and treatment of athlete's foot.
1. Wash and dry your feet.
If you have athlete's foot or if you just want to prevent it, keep your feet as clean and dry as possible. Make sure you thoroughly wash and dry your feet (including between the toes) every morning and evening. Dry your feet thoroughly after you bathe or shower; use a hair dryer if necessary.
2. Wear shoes in public places.
Athlete's foot is contagious. Going barefoot in public places is a common cause of athlete's foot. You should always wear flip-flops, shoes, or sandals when walking around gyms, hotel rooms, pools, shower, or locker areas. Even when taking a shower in a gym, it is important to wear flip-flops or shower shoes.
3. Change shoes often.
Consider having multiple pairs of shoes so that you don’t wear the same ones every day. It takes at least 24 hours for shoes to dry out thoroughly. This will help your shoes keep dry and fungus-free. If your feet sweat excessively, change shoes twice a day. Make sure you have socks that wick moisture away or allow for breathing. Keeping your feet dry can help prevent an infection, even if you do come in contact with the fungus.
4. Apply an antifungal cream.
Your Bentonville and Grove podiatrist may have you apply a cream that contains medicine that kills fungus. This should make you feel better in a few days. You may need to use the cream for up to a month to get rid of the athlete's foot completely. Antifungal creams are effective at managing athlete's foot. Most cases of athlete's foot can be cured with antifungal products and good hygiene.
5. Use antifungal powder
Antifungal powder is effective at managing the infection. Your doctor may have you apply an antifungal powder on your feet and toes every day. Apply the powder to the affected area, usually twice a day or as directed by your podiatrist. Do not apply this more often than prescribed.
6. Take prescription medication.
In severe or resistant cases of athlete's foot, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal, like fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox). Laboratory blood tests to make sure there is no liver disease may be required before taking oral antifungals. Be safe with medicines. It's important to follow your podiatrist's directions when taking medicine.
