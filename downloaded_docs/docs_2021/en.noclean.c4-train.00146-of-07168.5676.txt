Magnesium for Migraines - clinically proven to work
There have been many scientific, double blind studies showing that magnesium for migraines works. Magnesium hasbeen proven to be effective in preventing and reducing migraines.
Migraine Stop’s main ingredient is magnesium. Magnesium takenorally, on its own is not absorbed well by the body. Our supplement goes a few steps further though. Added minerals and vitamins increase the absorption of magnesium. Migraine Stop is a supplement that will give your body all the magnesium it needs, as well as other natural remedies to help prevent migraines.
1. Migraine sufferers proven to have lower levels of magnesium
Study : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983373

Magnesium is a mineral that affects over 300 biological functions in the body. It has beenclinically proven todramatically lessen migraines.
If you suffer from Migraines, it is very likely that you have a magnesium deficiency. Migraine Stop can help ensure your body is getting all the magnesium it needs.
2. 600mg of Magnesium for migraines has been proven to significantly reduce Migraine Attacks
Study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8792038
Migraine sufferers who took 600mg of magnesium for 12 weeks noticed a 42% reduction in migraine attack frequency.
Migraine Stop has 1695mg of magnesium coming from 3 different sources. It also has other vitamins and minerals to help improve the absorption of the magnesium. Making it more effective than a stand alone magnesium supplement.
