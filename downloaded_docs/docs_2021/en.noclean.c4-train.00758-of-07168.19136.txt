Counselling In The Bristol Area
Stress can affect our lives negatively in many ways. If you have a lot of stress in your life, it can affect your relationships, your ability to focus and be productive, and even your health! That’s why it’s so important to learn to relieve and reduce stress in your life. Read on to find out how.
If you feel like you are chronically stressed out or upset than you should consider introducing exercise into your routine. Many people swear by running for stress relief but any kind of heavy exercise will help you to free your mind and will also increase your fitness level at the same time!
Looking for Counselling in the Bristol Area? See the contact page for how to reach us.
A great tip that can combat stress is to never let yourself engage in gossip. Everyone knows that if they gossip, it’ll eventually come back to haunt them. Unless you want to deal with a difficult situation in the future, you should steer clear of gossiping at all times.
One of the best proven ways to reduce stress is to keep a diary or journal. It has been proven through scientific research that writing about our problems, or rather to be specific acknowledging our stress and analyzing the underlying reasons for it, can help reduce stress. Scheduling time to write in your diary or journal is a great way to make sure that you do this everyday.
One way to reduce your high levels of stress is to read a book. When you read, your mind wanders into a fantasy land, where you are not troubled by the different pressures that will cause you tension. Purchase a mystery or science fiction novel to help how you feel.
To more effectively manage stress, learn to let go of things you have no control over. Try to discern which things you do have control over and separate them, mentally, from those you don’t have control over. By separating the issues, you will find it easier to worry less about things.
Avoid taking on too many responsibilities at once. By taking on too many things all at once you can become stressed out. Chances are, if it seems like too much for you to handle it probably is, and you should avoid the extra responsibility if you are able to.
A warm, dark environment can be comforting when you feel stressed. Though it is not always possible to step into a warm dark room, you can try warming your hands in a pair of gloves and then cupping them over your eyes to create darkness. This environment is comforting and can cause a feeling of safety and relief.
Personal finances can be one of the most stressful things a person can deal with. In this world, we are used to living above our means and this puts a constant strain on our minds and health. Our stress levels shoot through the roof as we imagine how we are going to pay the next bill everyday. Budget, and live within your means and try to take the stress of finances off of yourself.
Remember that stress from all areas of life can negatively impact you in many ways. If you practice the tips from this article, you can improve your job, your family life, and your emotional, mental, and physical well being. Remember to recognize symptoms of stress in yourself and take a step back if you need to.

Private Counselling Services Bristol
If you are seeking private, confidential counselling in Bristol to a high standard of sensitivity and professionalism I invite you to contact me about working together. I have over seven years experience of working in the private healthcare system. Most recently, before moving to Bristol, I worked at the flagship Priory hospital in Roehampton, London, so I am well acquianted with needs of individuals requiring a private therapy service.
If you are looking into counselling for the first time it may feel confusing and somewhat daunting. You may be asking yourself: “How do I know what is the right kind of therapy for me? How do I know which therapist will be best for me? What if I don’t get on with the therapist once I’ve begun?” These can seem difficult questions to answer, particularly when under the kinds of pressure that can prompt us to seek help in the first place.
The first thing to consider is what type of therapy do you want? There are lots to choose from but a simple breakdown is given here http://www.mind.org.uk/help/medical_and_alternative_care/making_sense_of_counselling#whatis. It is helpful to find out about the approaches on offer and see which ones seem suited to your personality and aims.
I am an Integrative counsellor, which means I adjust the ways I work according to your needs at any given time. Having trained working with addictions, eating disorders and other compulsive conditions I am adept at addressing behavioural change, which at times requires Cognitive Behavioural Techniques (CBT) and tasks-based interventions. However, my preferred orientation is towards a “person-centred” (Humanistic) approach, in which I look to deeply supporting you through empathy, congruence and acceptance of you and any issues that you bring to therapy. My experience tells me that the most long-lasting change arises through people feeling really listened to, accepted and supported in finding their way through whatever difficulties they are facing. It is therefore vital to work with someone you feel comfortable with and trusting towards.
I offer an initial consultation in which you have the opportunity to ask me anything you’d like to know about the way I work and what to expect from therapy. Through spending this time together you will have a chance to see if you feel comfortable with me. I also then have the chance to assess whether my training and experience are suited to the help you’re looking for.
Another aspect to consider is choosing someone who is well qualified and accredited. Accreditation is the outcome of a lengthy process through which a therapist demonstrates their capability by building up significant counseling experience during their training, and shows understanding of the therapeutic process through case study reports. Credentials can be checked by making an enquiry to the therapist’s accrediting organization. The British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP) or the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) are the most widely recognized accrediting bodies in the UK for counselors and psychotherapists. I am accredited with the Federation of Drug and Alcohol Practitioners (FDAP) because I initially studied addiction psychology. I am also a member of BACP, which means I abide by their code of ethics, which can be found at http://www.bacp.co.uk/ethical_framework/.
You can contact me via the form below or simply call me on 07737 092 625. Please feel free to enquire about any aspect of therapy

Depression can hurt not only your mind but your body as well. It can be hard when you are under the cloud of depression. Yet, taking control of many of the aspects and causes of your depression is still very possible. The following tips will help get you back on your feet and on the road to recovery.
Don’t stop eating. This causes your blood sugar to dive between meals and to jump when you eat which can cause mood swings. Try to eat small, nutritious meals every few hours to keep your blood sugar stable. That way, you don’t have to worry that your food intake is contributing to your depression.
The next time you are feeling depressed, grab a great book. A book provides you with an escape to a fantasy land with fictional characters and exciting events. It can provide your mind with just the release it needs, and give you a moment to not focus on your depression.
While many realize that exercising is an important tip to help combat depression, it is equally important to exercise your mind. Keep your mind active and alert when you are dealing with depression as this can elevate your mood when you accomplish a task you have set your mind to.
If the area you live in is part of the cause of your depression, you may want to think about moving. People who live in undesirable neighborhoods tend to get depressed because they do not feel safe. Changing your environment can help to reduce or get rid of many of your feelings of uneasiness.
Exercise is an effective and scientifically proven way to combat depression. The reason why it works is because exercise increases your endorphin levels which provide a feeling of well being. If you are feeling down, a great way to start getting better is to create an exercise plan. It can be as simple as allocating an hour a day to jogging.
If you are struggling with depression, two good options to consider in the treatment of depression are using interpersonal therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Interpersonal therapy centers on your relationships and how you cope with them. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to depression.
Getting an appropriate amount of sleep is also another great way to battle depression. Clinical studies have very reliably shown that both those who over sleep and those that under sleep are more prone to experience clinical depression. If you can, you should have a set sleep schedule which allows for seven or eight hours of sleep.
Exercise releases endorphins in your brain. These endorphins are feel good mood boosters. If you feel like you are depressed, or even just in a bad mood, get up and do some exercise. The more rigorous and energetic the better. It will help you feel better and get you into shape at the same time.
As you have read above, there are many ways to take the hurt out of depression and get yourself in a better place both mentally and physically. Attentive application of these suggestions will help you to recover, and at the very least will lessen the impact that depression has on you.

Confidential Counselling Service
There are many reasons that someone might start to suffer from anxiety. There may be a history of anxiety in your family, or you may be experiencing a lot of stress in your life. Anxiety can happen to anyone. If you are feeling anxious, here is some solid advice to help you live a more relaxed life.
You will go a long way toward reducing your anxiety if you learn to accept things as they are. Realize that you cannot control everything in life, and sometimes things will not live up to your expectations. Look at the situation objectively, and realize that matters are not really as bad as you are making them out to be.
Try not to self-medicate with alcohol. When you suffer from anxiety, it can be easy to consume alcohol, in order to reduce your symptoms. Using alcohol to control your anxiety levels, however, is a very bad idea. You will build up a tolerance to the alcohol, and you will have to keep increasing your intake.
Learn to say no. Overextending yourself can quickly drain your reserves and leave your mind racing as you try to live up to your commitments. Your refusal to put more on your plate than you can manage may cause disappointment for someone, but your mental health and well-being are most important.
To help keep anxiety at bay, manage everyday stress. When your stress levels are high, your anxiety tends to increase, too. Learn to delegate tasks and relieve some of the pressures or responsibilities at work or home. Also, make sure that you get plenty of time to unwind and decompress each day.
Know that your anxiety will pass. Millions of people suffer from anxiety, but millions of people also recover. Hope for the best and make sure that you are ready to start feeling better. Look for examples when you find yourself less anxious, and soon you will indeed be less anxious.
Investigate amino acids as a treatment and potential cure for your anxiety. Many people find they are low in certain nutrients and their bodies do not produce enough serotonin. Many good books discuss treatment plans that help you use over-the-counter supplements to reduce or eliminate your anxiety.
Listen to music. However, not just any music will do. The next time you feel your anxiety levels rising, throw on your favorite CD, or playlist. Whether you enjoy the calming sounds of a classical orchestra, or rocking out to 80’s hair metal, you will feel your anxiety melt away with each song you know by heart. Before you know it, the anxiety is reduced, if not gone, and your spirits will be invigorated and renewed.
Anyone can start to have feelings of anxiety. It’s important to know that you aren’t alone. It’s also important to start coping with your anxiety, and the suggestions in this article can help you to do that. Take a deep breath, and make sure that you start taking your life back so you can be happy once again.

An Integrative Approach To Anxiety Counselling
Are you struggling with feelings of anxiety? If so you are not alone and help is available. I am encountering more and more clients who seek help for precisely this issue. The purpose of this article is to illustrate how I work with people suffering from anxiety so you may have a better idea of what to expect from therapy. If you have any questions relating to this article or how to engage in therapy with me please feel free to contact me.
As an Integrative counsellor, I use techniques from different psychotherapeutic models to tailor the most effective treatment possible. This means that I can vary how I approach the issues according to each client’s individual character and needs.
Generally speaking I aim to work on two different levels for clients suffering from anxiety issues. First there is the immediate challenge of helping you to understand, manage and reduce your anxiety symtoms. Second comes the task of exploring the underlying tensions that might be “driving” the anxiety experience. This part of the work helps you to maintain freedom from anxiety by recognising your deeper emotional needs and learning to effectively respond to them.
There is ample research to indicate that CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is effective in helping people recover from anxiety disorders. The CBT model emphasises the impact of our thinking (cognition) on our behaviour. Through getting a better understanding of our thought-processes regarding anxiety – largely maintained by worry – and by learning behavioural tools to change those processes we can make significant progress in changing how we think and, therefore, how we feel. Exploration of these processes is often a significant initial focus of therapy.
As well as talking about your thoughts in connection to the issues you worry about I introduce mindfulness techniques to help you be able to see more clearly what is happening for you. With this increased awareness of your internal landscape, and instruction in relaxation techniques, you then have more capacity to respond effectively to anxiety triggers (both from the outside world and your own inner thoughts or feelings).
Ironically, the thought processes that drive anxiety often automatically come into being to distract us from uncomfortable emotions. We may not realise it but our minds are very skillful in helping us avoid emotional and mental pain. They create clever diversions to protect us from difficulties. However, in time the avoidance strategy itself can become a problem and prevent us from resolving the original difficulty. An example of this dynamic is an addiction, wherein the sufferer initially gained relief from pain (whether knowlingly or not) through the addictive behaviour but over time it has taken on a momentum of its own and become destructive. It can be a similar process with any thought process. Hence the need to address your emotional management to achieve a long-lasting recovery from anxiety.
For this aspect of therapy I drawn on humanistic theory, which asserts that each individual has his or her own healing potential within. I find that by giving space, encouragement and honest empathy people are often able to contact this aspect of themselves and bring about large shifts in how they relate to themselves and others. Thus you become adept at managing your emotional and interpersonal needs.
I have offered a brief and generalised picture of the process of Integrative Psychotherapy for anxiety as I approach it. Of course, everyone has a different set of experiences and personality attributes that they bring to therapy, which means that no two paths to healing are the same. The beauty of the Integrative model is that it allows for these differences and enables me to bring my full training and experience to each therapeutic relationship.
I offer free assessments so you can find out if this approach feels right for you before committing to anything, and am happy to answer any questions you might have. Please feel free to comment below or contact me on 07737 092 625 or info@freddyweaver.co.uk

This article will show you how you can deal with that stress more effectively and possibly eliminate some of it as well. If you’re looking for Counselling Services in Bristol please give us a call.
Adults have responsibilities and a busy life, but that does not mean that you have to be serious all of the time. Sometimes it is necessary not to carry out plans or your next item on the to do list. Every so often you need to take a break.
A great tip that can help you keep your stress levels down is to stop relying on your alarm clock to wake up in the morning. Waking up to an alarm clock can make you very stressed out. Learning to wake up naturally is a much better alternative to an alarm clock.
A great tip that can help you keep your stress levels down is to be careful about which words you use to describe your stress. Avoid using negative words too much because they’ll influence your mood. Try to stick with positive or neutral words as often as you can.
One of the easiest ways to reduce stress in your life is by shutting off the evening news. Today’s news broadcasts are typically filled with nothing but doom and gloom, making them anything but uplifting. In fact, they can leave you feeling downright stressed out and worried. Instead, try skimming the news headlines online to stay informed. Just don’t allow yourself to get bogged down in all the details.
Multitasking is a stress magnet. Many people consider multitasking to be a skill that only certain people have, but in reality, it is just the cause of an extraordinary amount of stress. Some people can better cope with stress but if you are not one of those people, do not multitask.
Listen to calming music. When you are feeling stressed out, one of the best things to do is to put on some soothing music and listen. Have some relaxing music available so that when you start feeling stressed you can just put on some music and distract yourself with the sounds.
Laughter is a very effective, healthy and natural way to reduce stress. Laughing naturally resolves tension and the activities that cause you to laugh can also help take your mind off your issues. A couple of ways you can get yourself to laugh and have a good time are to go out with a friend to a comedy club or rent a comedy to watch.
You don’t have to be stressed out or worried all of the time. This article has shown you lots of ideas on how to reduce your stress level and how to deal with that stress when it does inevitably show up. Pass along this information to a friend as well if you felt that it was helpful.

When you feel a panic attack coming on, write down what you are feeling at that time so that you can look back at them to assess what was really happening versus what you thought would happen.

Depression should be taken seriously. It can cause some pretty serious side effects as well. There is so much information available on depression. Some choose to treat it with prescription drugs, while others may opt for remedies a bit more natural. Following is an article on depression designed to give you some helpful tips. If you looking for Bristol Counselling, please give us a call.
Keep up with your usual social activities. If you are feeling down and depressed, you might not feel like doing the things you normally do. Even so, it is important to keep them up. Continue with your normal activities. Avoiding them will likely only serve to make your feel more depressed.
There are ways that you can beat depression. One of them is developing new interests. The reason many may feel depressed is because there are not enough interests or activities in their life. Finding new interests and helping others not only gives your life new meaning, but helps you experience new things and keep you away from depression.
Never feel as though you have to battle depression alone. Turn to your friends, family, church and other outlets for support and help in finding a professional who can treat your illness. There is no glory in battling depression by yourself, and your loved ones will not mind providing a shoulder for you to lean on when times get tough.
Music therapy can provide wonderful relief for those dealing with depression. Music is scientifically proven to have a powerful effect on an individual’s mood state. If you listen to calm music, it can calm you down. More powerful beats can have an uplifting effect. Take some time to turn on your favorite tunes the next time you are feeling depressed.
If you are feeling depressed, be cautious about using “natural” home remedies. Some of these are nothing more than a placebo and others can be harmful to you. These are true medications, and it is important to discuss them with your doctor before you start taking them.
If you are feeling depressed, take your dog for a walk. Clinical studies show that individuals with pets are often less depressed than individuals without pets. Taking a walk can also provide you with fresh air, an instant mood lifter. Enjoy some time with your pooch and your problems just might disappear.
The next time you are feeling depressed, take your kids to the park. Don’t just sit on the bench, get out there and swing or slide with them. Doing this will help you to feel like a kid again yourself, and young children seldom feel depressed. You’ll have fun, laugh a little, and get some fresh air. All can help you to forget about your problems and find relief.
Finding a new hobby or interest will help in the process of overcoming depression. Whether you decide to learn pottery, yoga, or take up archery, find something new to do. This will add interest, variety, and satisfaction to your life. Cultivating new interests has been found to relieve the symptoms of anger or sadness in those who struggle with depression.
There’s nothing about depression that isn’t serious, and you would do well to remember that. Perhaps, though, you can find some relief by following the tips provided in the above article. Find something that will work for you and stick to it! Better days are possible!
