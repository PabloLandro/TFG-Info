Description
Vitamin E oil
Contains natural Tocopherols (vit e ) in pure vegetable oil ready to use.
It acts as an antioxidant and prevents the formation of free radicals on the skin cells. It also has anti-inflammatory properties. Due to presence of such essential qualities, it is good for the skin.
Vitamin E oil is helpful for scar healing and prevention because it goes beneath the surface of skin to block free radicals. Free radicals are especially harmful to scar tissue because they prohibit healing.
Vitamin E oil is great for preventing rancidity in cosmetics and it acts as an antioxidant in creams, lotions, and baby products.
Vitamin E as a concentrated product is very strong and could be caustic on the skin, our Vitamin E oil is suspended in Vegetable oil at a standardized rate of approx .5% so can be used directly
