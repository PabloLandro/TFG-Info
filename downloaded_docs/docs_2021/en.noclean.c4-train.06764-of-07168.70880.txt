What is Imitrex?
Imitrex is a prescription only drug manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline which belongs to the class of drugs called Antimigraine agents. It was first approved by the FDA in 1992. Imitrex is not a controlled drug with a pregnancy category C. Imitrex is a brand name of the generic Sumatriptan. Other brand names of Sumatriptan are Alsuma, Imitrex Statdose, Sumavel DosePro. Imitrex is the most commonly available and used among all of these drugs.
Imitrex generic is basically used to treat headaches. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain. Sumatriptan reduces the effect of substances that trigger a headache, nausea and other migraine symptoms including vomiting, a sensitivity of light and sound. Generic imitrex is used to treat migraine headaches as well as cluster headaches that have already begun , but it will not be useful for prevention of headaches.
Imitrex generic belongs to the triptan class. The basic structure of Sumatriptan, as explained by Wikipedia is:
“Analog of the naturally occurring neuroactive alkaloids dimethyltryptamine (DMT), bufotenine, and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine, with an N-methyl sulfonamide methyl- group at position C-5 on the indole ring”
The drug is at its maximum effectiveness when it is injected under the skin and is taken right after the pain starts.
Imitrex is available in tablets, imitrex injection and nasal spray. The biological life of Sumatriptan is 2.5 hours. 60% of the drug is excreted through urine and 40% through feces.

Imitrex is found in the following strengths: 25mg, 50mg, 100mg, 6mg/0.5mL. 20mg/in. 6.5g/4 hr
The imitrex dosing for adults suffering from a cluster headache is usually an initial dose of 6mg subcutaneously one. If symptoms reappear, the dose can be repeated. A maximum dose of 12mg in 24hours is allowed. The dose should be started as soon as first symptoms of a cluster headache start to appear. These can include vomiting, photophobia or nausea.
The dose for adults suffering from a migraine is usually an initial dose of 25mg, 50mg or 100g through the mouth. If symptoms reappear, the dose can be repeated if at least 2hours have passed since the first dose. A maximum dose of 200mg in 24hours is allowed.

Imitrex side effects
Some of the most common side effects of Imitrex are as follows:
Chest pain
Tiredness
Weak muscles
Drowsiness
Stiffness in neck or jaw
Hallucinations
High fever
Swelling of throat or oral area
Constipation
Blood in stool
Nausea
Vomiting
Changes in colour of fingers or toes
Some very rare cases have been reported where the patients have had problems of vision as well as blindness or blurred vision.
Imitrex might affect your blood pressure as well so it should be kept in check and anything abnormal should immediately be reported and taken care of. Imitrex may also increase your serotonin levels and in very rare cases might also cause toxicity. The risk of this happening increases manifold if you already taking other drugs that increase serotonin.
Does Imitrex get you high? Some users have reported having used it recreationally suggesting that the Imitrex high was enough to be noticed and get addicted to. A look at the ingredients of Imitrex does not suggest anything that could prove this claim, but it is still up for debate. Most users claim that the effect of Imitrex is not anything ‘enjoyable’ or something they would try again recreationally for a feeling of ‘high’.
Tell your doctor right away if you face any of the above-mentioned side effects after a dose of Imitrex. Most people who use this drug will likely not face any of these side effects, but that is not a reason to not be aware of the potential risk involved. Side effects of Imitrex can be reported to the FDA using phone number 1-800-FDA-1088 if you are in the US. For Canada, you can call 1-866-234-2345.
