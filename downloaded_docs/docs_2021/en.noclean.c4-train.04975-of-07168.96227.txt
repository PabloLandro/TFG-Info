Antique Silver Toned Copper Magnetic Bracelet for Men- Vikings
Silver toned bangle-style copper magnetic bracelet for men beautifully decorated with traditional Viking symbols.
According to a legend “Midgard Serpent” is a snake who lives in the ocean that surrounds Midgard, the visible world of Norsemen. So enormous is he that his body forms a circle around the entirety of Midgard.
The snake eating its own tail represents the infinity of life.
Copper core of this bracelet makes it pliable and easily adjusted for a comfortable fit.
Hypoallergenic pewter coating has been applied to this bangle making it an easy-to-maintain, long-lasting piece of jewellery with unique therapeutic properties. This lovely magnetic bangle is really hard wearing and won’t lose its antique silver lustre for a very long time.
Made from solid copper
Hypoallergenic pewter coating
6 Powerful Rare Earth Neodymium Magnets 3000 Gauss each
The magnets have north polarity – most beneficial for human health
Easily adjustable for a comfortable fit
Bracelet Width – 13 mm
Also available in traditional vintage copper
Copper Magnetic Bracelet Benefits
Copper magnetic bracelets help relieve pain and discomfort associated with arthritis, rheumatism, carpel tunnel syndrome or injury and reduce swelling and stiffness.
Increase blood circulation which leads to more oxygen and nutrients available to painful areas.
Relax muscle spasms.
Reduce inflammation, lactic acid, calcium deposits and other toxins in the body.
Copper magnetic bracelets assist to healing nervous tissue and bones due to the magnets ability to accelerate the migration of calcium ions.
Can help the body produce more endorphins, which are known as natural painkillers.
Copper magnetic bracelets promote peaceful sleep as the magnets can influence the production of the hormone melatonin in the body.
May stimulate collagen density in and around joints proven in studies to heal bones and joints faster and to help alleviate chronic pain and invigorate overall well-being.
Please Note:
People with cardiac pacemakers should avoid wearing magnets.
For cosmetic reasons we suggest removing copper jewellery before bathing or swimming.

How Magnetic Therapy Works
How Magnetic Therapy Works
Healing with magnets has been around for hundreds of years. Recently, due to an increased interest in alternative medicine and news of some well-known athletes using magnetic therapy for pain relief, the interest in healing with magnets is on the rise ones again.
In spite of a limited scientific evidence to either support or deny the positive results of healing with magnets lots of people including hundreds of our customers swear by the benefits of magnetic healing.
So, how do magnets work?
There are two main applications for magnetic therapy:
Pain Reduction
Healing The Body
In terms of reducing pain, some doctors believe that pain reduction with magnets works similarly to using a heating pad. The magnets are placed on or near the body, and are used to stimulate nerve endings by acting to interrupt pain signals to the brain. The difference is that heat treatment can be more intense, while magnetic healing is more constant. So, while you can’t wear a heating pad for hours at a time, you can wear a magnetic bracelet every day.
In terms of healing an area of the body, magnets are placed either on or near the body, and it’s believed that the magnets act to stimulate the cellular and chemical area where the healing is to occur. That is, blood is accelerated to the area, which increases the oxygenation of the blood and dilates the blood vessels, providing additional oxygen and nutrients to the place in need of healing.
Healing powers of magnets depends on their strength and polarity. The force (magnetic field of energy) from a magnet is measured in Gauss strength. Magnets used for pain relief and healing typically measure between 300 – 3000 Gauss.
Magnets have two different poles—a positive pole and a negative pole. For reasons most researchers cannot explain, applying the negative side of a magnet is effective, but applying the positive side of a magnet is not.
When buying magnetic jewellery form us you can be sure that all our products contain neodymium magnets – the strongest permanent bio magnets available and are designed with the north pole of the magnet facing the body.
