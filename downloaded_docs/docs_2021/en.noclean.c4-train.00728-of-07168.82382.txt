They come with three different settings and can be worn over existing glasses so you can wake up, put them on, and go about your day.
These glasses are rechargeable, and they charge easily using a USB cable. One full charge gets you six sessions which is 20 to 45 minutes.
We felt the impact of wearing these glasses almost immediately. There is a boost in energy and overall well-being but wearing the glasses for too long can become cumbersome, so keep your sessions short and comfortable.

This floor lamp offers 10,000 LUX and diffuses warm light out for 12 inches, which is comfortable and easy on the eyes The lamp itself is four feet tall and gets powered by an electronic ballast.

The lamp uses specialized UV coated fluorescent light bulbs that are only available from the manufacturer.
In comparison to a lot of the other lampswe have reviewed, this is one we would recommend for a larger room because it does not have adjustable settings and it throws off quite a bit of light. If you were to use this in a small room, you may find the amount of light to be excessive.

Pros
Great for treating different skin disorders
Handheld and lightweight
Easy to use
Affordable
Works quickly
Cons
Can burn the skin if you are not careful
Digital programming may be intimidating for seniors
This handheld therapy lamp has a different purpose than the previous lamps we have reviewed. This lamp is a treatment for Psoriasis, Eczema, and other skin disorders. By hovering the lamp over the affected area, it is known to clear up your skin. This may prove to be very therapeutic and comforting for a senior whose quality of life suffers as a result of these conditions.
Using this method to relieve the skin disorder symptoms is an incredible alternative to adding more pills and treatments to a senior’s daily regimen. This strategy is something they can do themselves in their free time, thereby enhancing feelings of independence and self-reliance.
It is highly recommended for the treatment of these issues however there is very little instruction on how to use it with the package.

Pros
Gives off a lot of light
Meant to mimic natural light
UV protecting bulbs
Provides relief to seasonal depression
Offers sunlight to those who may not have it
Improves mood
Cons
Could be too bright and bulky for some
May be cost-prohibitive
This mood light is incredibly useful and often a life changer for seniors who deal with seasonal depression and lack enough sunlight in their life. If you live in an area that does not have an ample amount of sunlight or your living conditions do not provide you with that, then this is a great option.
Something we really liked about this lamp is its adjustability. The top of the lamp swivels in many different directions and also goes up and down to fit a variety of situations.
Natural white light is incredible and has the ability to help seniors aging in place with issues that affect them disproportionately, like depression, anxiety, and sleep deprivation. When compared to mood correction pills and other methods of helping the elderly feel more energized, therapy lights such as this provide a safe and healthy alternative. ,.
The lamp is large and throws off a lot of light at 10,000 LUX, so you do not want this light in a small area, or it could be irritating.

Why Should You Use A Sunlight Lamp Or Light Therapy Lamp?
You know that light therapy lamps are useful for Seasonal Affective Disorder or seasonal depression but what if you don’t have that? Could a sunlight lamp still be helpful to you? Our answer is yes and we’re here to tell you why.
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Seasonal Affective Disorder is also known as seasonal depression, and this often happens due to the drastic decrease in sunlight during the winter months.
Some people have even claimed that they experience this issue during the summer months because they prefer winter over summer.
There is no definitive treatment for seasonal depression, so doctors often prescribe light therapy to trick the chemicals in the brain to think there is more sunlight than there is. For seniors who don’t get out of the house often due to limited mobility or poor health, this could be a life changing product.
Depression
Therapy lights are also suitable for general depression that is not due to a change in season. It works similarly by tricking the brain into thinking there is additional sunlight. When we have an overexposure to artificial light, it tends to affect our mood, and that is why a walk through nature sometimes feels so good.
Similarly, the therapy light improves your overall mood the more you are exposed to it, and if you follow consistent treatments and stick to it, it can relieve symptoms of depression.
Energy
When your mood is improved, you often experience increased energy and a better quality of life. When you are enjoying life, you tend to have more energy to get through your day and that can be incredibly beneficial to seniors experience fatigue and listlessness.
This is also a great option if you do not have enough exposure to sunlight because your living conditions do not allow it. If your bedroom does not have windows or you live in an area that experiences long periods without sunlight, this is a perfect solution.
Skin Disorders
In some cases, skin disorders like psoriasis are treated using light therapy directly on the affected area. We reviewed a portable light therapy lamp above that is intended for this use. By addressing the affected area consistently on a daily basis with the light, it is known to improve symptoms of common skin disorders.
This method is a great alternative because it is something the user can do on their own time by themselves with little assistance. It does not require them to get up and go anywhere or take any additional medication. Using white light in this way can drastically improve a senior’s quality of life.
Summary
Depression, seasonal affective disorder, and sleep problems tend to effect the elderly disproportionately, which is why light therapy can be a great option. By simulating the sun’s natural light, you can reap the benefits you would get from exposure to the sun in the comfort of your own home. Light therapy is a simple, cost-effective way for seniors to boost their overall health and wellbeing and we hope the information we’ve compiled helps you find a product that suits your individual needs.
