EVENING PRIMROSE OIL
The Evening Primrose is a small fragrant wildflower with petals that unfold in the early evening. Though a native to North America, it is now widely grown in Europe as well. Evening Primose Oil is obtained from the seeds of the flower and is used extensively as a nutritional supplement due primarily to its high content of Gamma Linoleic Acid (GLA).
It is claimed that Evening Primrose Oil positively affects benign breast disorders, PMS, migraines, metabolism problems, diabetes, arthritic conditions, and skin conditions such as atopic eczema. Evening Primrose Oil has also been claimed to be helpful with other medical disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, hardening of the arteries, heart disease and high blood pressure.
