Your guide to avoiding the E.R.
Oct 6, 2010
You don't want to know me.
If we meet on the job, it probably means you're in a world of hurt. I'm an ER doctor. I see the worst that can happen to a guy: the carnage inflicted by a multicar pileup, the devastation of a heart attack, the mess and the mayhem behind the evening news lead-in.
But I also see injuries that, while less Tarantino-esque, stick with me for other reasons--bones snapped on rock-hopping mountain-bike rides, ligaments shredded on soccer fields, tendons ruptured while boarding. When I see a man in his 30s who's torn up his knee playing hoops, or a 26-year-old who's wrecked his shoulder after imploding off a mogul, I empathize. Guys like us--we need to be in the game. We need to take on the biggest rapid, the steepest slope, the fiercest opponent. These are the activities--not our day jobs--that fuel our fires. I'd never recommend giving it up--the risk, the adrenaline rush. But I would advise you to do everything you can to minimize your chances of injury so you can stay in the game...and win. So here are seven of the most common sports injuries I see in the ER. Read on to learn how to keep from being yet another forced retiree from the games that make life worth living.
Wrist or Elbow Fracture
Case study: 33-year-old male skier presents with severe wrist pain and deformity. Injury sustained while skiing moguls. Patient crashed over ski tips, using right hand to break fall.
A fall onto an outstretched hand--or "foosh" as we call it--causes ER visits as frequently as the Kardashians cause paparazzi pileups. Skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders, and roller-bladers are the usual victims, although pretty much any sport that has you moving fast with hands free will do. Boom, over you go and out go the hands to break the fall. Wrists and elbows are what break instead.
I've fooshed. Within days of moving to Colorado after my residency training, I went mountain biking on some tough terrain. I was in over my head, and sure enough, it wasn't long before I was flying over the handlebar. Despite all my knowledge of anatomy, what did I do? Stuck out my hand to break my fall. What'd I get? A gash on my palm and a fracture that kept me off the bike for months.
While you're fooshing, all those mechanical and vector forces you create have to go somewhere. The position of your hand when it makes contact with the ground determines where those forces will focus and where the injury will occur. Fall forward onto your hand, as I did, and you risk breaking your wrist. The next thing you know, you're in a cast for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by physical therapy. Or fall backward on your hand with your arm outstretched, and it'll be your elbow that fractures. Depending on which bone you damage, you'll find yourself in either a sling or a long-arm cast for 3 to 6 weeks.
ER Avoidance
Roll with it. Instinct rules in the milliseconds between the start of a forward fall and its painful conclusion. Make sure your instinct is for tumbling rather than applying the hands-out brake. Once you're airborne, tuck chin to chest and try to land on the back of your shoulder. Then keep rolling. Use your leading arm to guide the tumble; use the other arm to protect your head. Practice on grass or carpet until it's hardwired.
Stay balanced. Your ability to regain your balance quickly can prevent a little wobble from becoming a crash. To improve your reaction time, practice with dynamic agility drills involving direction changes at progressively higher speeds. You'll need a buddy for this. Mark out two 5-by-5-yard squares. One of you is the rabbit, who initiates quick-cutting moves in one square. The other is the fox, who mirrors those moves in the other square. Do 4 to 6 reps of 15 seconds each.
Armor up. You may feel like a dork wearing a helmet and wrist guards while skateboarding or snowboarding, but will the strangers you're trying to impress visit you in the hospital? No.
Stay centered. Proprioception--the ability to sense the position and orientation of your body and its parts--slumps with age, raising your risk of falling. Studies show that staying fit may slow the process. Hit the gym to avoid hitting the dirt.
Ankle Sprain
Case study: 40-year-old male presents with pain and swelling of lateral left ankle. Patient stepped off a curb while jogging. Suspected inversion sprain.
In the ER, ankle injuries are like drunks--they just keep coming. Sprains account for roughly 80 percent of ankle injuries, and of those, the majority are what we call inversion sprains. These happen when the foot is forced to turn inward beyond the limits of the ankle ligaments. The ligaments on the outside part of the ankle tear, and you go down in a heap.
There are two main reasons for the endless parade of ankle sprains I see: (1) The guy was playing a sport like football or soccer that requires a lot of stop-start, lateral movements he may not have been conditioned for, or (2) he wasn't wearing proper footwear, such as high-cut boots for hiking or high-tops on the court.
Back in high school, I sustained a bad ankle sprain in my freshman hoops season because I was messing around in low-cut sneakers with no ankle support. Missed the remaining games.
ER Avoidance
Work your ankles. Ankle stiffness in the forward direction (dorsiflexion) has less to do with tight calf muscles than with weak muscles on the outside part of the shin. Build strength by doing simple toe raises. In a seated position, lift your toes as high as they'll go while keeping your heel on the ground. Hold for a six count. Do 2 or 3 sets of 12 to 20 repetitions.
Protect yourself. If you've already suffered a sprain, you need to strengthen your weakened ankle to prevent reinjury. Stand on one foot as you brush your teeth, switching feet halfway through. Do this every time you brush. It's a great way to improve your balance and increase your ankle stability.
Of course, you also need proper footwear, and if you've had a previous ankle injury, you should wear a brace. Weakened ligaments tend to stay that way; more than a third of people who've sprained an ankle end up spraining it again. Finally, if you're playing touch football (or any other sport, for that matter), avoid uneven playing surfaces or torn-up fields.
Hamstring Pull
Case study: 45-year-old male describes sharp pain in left posterior thigh and buttock while walking. Subject was sprinting to first base during a coed softball game when he experienced acute burning sensation.
You've seen the pro athlete pull up on the field, his hands glued to his butt, his face twisted in pain. You'd think he'd just been shot. Out of the camera's eye, weekend warriors go down with hamstring pulls or strains with even greater frequency. Jeter wannabes, I call them--guys who forget that they haven't been playing competitive baseball, football, or soccer on a daily basis, who have poor flexibility, and who are overdoing it with running or jumping activities.
Depending on the severity of the tear, most hamstring pulls can usually be treated at home with the classic RICE prescription--rest, ice, compression, and elevation. But recovery time can stretch from a few weeks to a few months.
ER Avoidance
Lose the lopsidedness. The combination of strong quads and weak hamstrings shoots your risk of injury to either muscle through the roof. Many gym standards, such as squats, lunges, and leg presses, overemphasize the quads at the expense of the hamstrings. Vary your routine by adding stepups and straight-leg deadlifts, which train the hamstrings as hip extensors.
Stepup. Stand facing stairs or an adjustable step platform. Place your right foot squarely on a step so that your thigh and lower leg form a 90-degree angle. Push your body up until you're standing on your right leg on the step. Pause, and step down slowly onto your left foot. Keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles tight. Do 2 or 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. Add light dumbbells as you gain strength.
Straight-leg deadlift. Follow these instructions precisely in order to maintain good form and avoid injury. With your feet and hands shoulder-width apart, grasp a weighted barbell, palms down. From an upright position, keeping your arms straight and your back slightly arched, slowly lower the barbell by shifting your hips back. Your knees should bend only slightly. Lower the barbell as far as your hamstrings will allow. Return to a standing position by contracting your hamstrings and glutes. Do 2 or 3 sets of 5 to 8 reps.
Shoulder Injury
Case study: 28-year-old male complains of severe shoulder pain consistent with AC separation. Subject was playing football when he landed hard on shoulder with tackler on top.
Separation anxiety. That's what anyone bombing down a hill or about to get blitzed by a linebacker should be feeling, because a shoulder separation (known as an AC, or acromioclavicular, joint separation) or a clavicle fracture may be up next. Either injury can arise from playing contact sports, like football, rugby, or hockey, although a foosh can cause a shoulder injury, too.
During a hard fall, a shoulder gives way where it's weakest, and that's often either the AC joint or the clavicle. The clavicle will be forced away from the shoulder bone, resulting in a shoulder separation (a ligament injury), or the bone itself will fracture. Either injury can cause a deformity, but unless it's severe, rest is usually the primary treatment. You can forget about doing bench presses anytime soon. Recuperation requires at least 8 weeks.
ER Avoidance
Roll through falls. It's tough to control a fall when a tackler is initiating it and, to a large degree, controlling it. But learning to manage contact in contact sports can help disperse the brunt of impact across as many of your bones and joints as possible. Your goal is to roll through the impact rather than using a stopping motion. Relaxing instead of tensing up also helps manage the effect of contact with the ground. Practice falling on a padded floor at the gym, forcing your body to relax with each tumble.
ACL Tear
Case study: 34-year-old male presents with intense pain and significant swelling of right knee. Subject was playing soccer when he heard a loud pop after pivoting on right foot while dribbling past a defender. Suspected right ACL tear
A tear of the knee's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), like all ligament injuries, is distressingly prevalent among weekend warriors. The guy who's deskbound all week often doesn't have the conditioning, come Saturday, to execute the quick start-stop movements that soccer, skiing, football, and basketball require. He pivots in one direction while his lower leg keeps moving in the other, tearing his knee's stabilizing ACL.
Hang with me for a quick anatomy lesson. Four primary ligaments hold together the bones that meet at the knee: The two collateral ligaments (on either side of the knee) check the knee's sideways motion, and the two cruciate ligaments (inside the joint) control back-and-forth movement. ("Anterior" means "at the front"; the PCL, or posterior cruciate ligament, is--you guessed it--at the back.) Any direct contact to the knee or rapid change in direction can stretch and even tear these ligaments. At best, you're benched for months. At worst, as in a Grade III tear, a ligament snaps clean through and often needs surgical repair.
ER Avoidance
Brace your knee. Create a brace of sturdy quads, hamstrings, and calves using a leg-targeted lifting routine that includes squats, lunges, leg presses, and the hamstring exercises described above. Hop to it. Use jump squats to combine muscle building with balance and coordination training. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, hands out, and elbows angled 90 degrees, bend your knees until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Explode upward, driving your arms up. Land softly on both feet, making sure your knees don't bow inward. Rest for a couple of seconds, and repeat. Do 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.
Concussion
Case study: 28-year-old male complaining of dizziness, headache, and inability to concentrate. Patient fell and hit his head while bicycling with friends. Rendered momentarily unresponsive. Patient was not wearing a helmet.
When you take a hard hit to the head while skiing, bicycling, or blocking a tackle, your brain is violently shaken and sometimes literally slams against its hard casing--your skull--injuring precious neurons in the process. The result is often confusion, blurred vision, memory loss, nausea, and sometimes unconsciousness. A single severe concussion or repeated mild concussions may lead to lasting depression and dementia, as we're seeing with an increasing number of NFL players.
ER Avoidance
Choose the right headgear. A good lid can absorb and deflect impact forces and prevent serious brain injury. Until I became an ER doc in Colorado, I never used to wear a helmet while skiing. But then I saw maybe five severe head-injury cases on the job every day, some of them young skiers who would never walk or talk normally again, all because they weren't wearing a helmet. It's a stupid, unbelievable waste. A helmet should be snug, level on your head, and stable enough to remain in place despite violent shakes or hard blows. But don't think one helmet will protect your dome for all activities. Consult the certifications on the product's packaging to ensure that the helmet has been tested to the appropriate standards. Cycling or in-line skating require an ASTM F1447 certified helmet; BMX requires an ASTM F2032 certified lid; and a rock climber needs an EN 12492 helmet.
Achilles Tendon rupture
Case study: 35-year-old male presents with inability to flex right ankle. Subject reports that while leading a fast break in a basketball game, he heard a loud pop from the back of his leg. Exam suggests a right Achilles tendon rupture.
Soccer great David Beckham recently brought this devastating injury to public attention, but Achilles tendon ruptures have always been infamous in the ER thanks to weekend athletes. The men I usually see might have had some warning from Achilles tendinitis--soreness and stiffness where the tendon meets the heel--prior to the blowout, but usually this injury comes out of the blue. And it comes with sound effects: The Achilles is the thickest and strongest tendon in the human body, so when it pops, people often hear it. If the rupture is complete, you won't be able to fully flex your ankle.
Achilles tendon ruptures occur primarily in sports requiring abrupt jumping or bursts of sprinting, such as basketball, soccer, and tennis, as well as running and track-and-field events. Ruptures can be treated surgically (doctors go in and reattach the tendon) or nonsurgically, with simple casting. (The rerupture rate in patients who don't go under the knife is higher.) Either way, you're looking at up to 6 months before returning to action.
ER Avoidance
Lunge and lean. It's no coincidence that most Achilles ruptures happen to athletes between the ages of 30 and 40. As we age, the water content of tendons declines, making them stiffer and less able to tolerate stress. Stretch your Achilles tendons regularly and always after your game or workout. Never do it prior to warming up. Here's how: Stand facing a wall with both palms resting against it. Take one step backward with your left foot. While keeping both heels on the ground, slowly lean into the wall, bending both your right and left knees at the same time. Hold for 30 seconds, and switch legs. Extra credit: Sit in a full squat with both heels on the floor for as long as you're comfortable.
Get hip. Achilles tendons pop due to overload, and the overload comes from a lack of pelvic control. Your pelvis tilts forward, which shifts your center of gravity forward, increasing the load on your calf muscles and Achilles tendons. To build pelvic stability, do basic planks and side planks (two 45-second reps of each) as well as half-kneeling hip flexor stretches. To do the hip flexor stretch, kneel on your right knee with your left leg extended at a 90-degree angle. Lunge forward, keeping your back straight and tightening your butt. Hold for 30 seconds. Do 3 to 5 reps, switch legs, and repeat.
Heed the warning. If you have tenderness or pain above the heel--symptoms of Achilles tendinitis--avoid activities that place excessive stress on your Achilles, such as jumping and hill running. As a general rule, alternate high-impact sports, such as running, with low-impact sports, such as biking or swimming. If there's significant pain, give yourself proper rest, because there's a reason something hurts. Your body is telling you the Achilles is inflamed and needs RICE so you can slowly return to activity. Otherwise, a rupture may sideline you for a year or more! And that's not good for guys like us.
