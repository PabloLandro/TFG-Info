BE SURE TO NOTE THIS: REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE IN CHILDREN IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES!
World Health Info
Experts have found that if a child is healthy, then a fever should not be cause for concern. If your children still have a temperature that makes them do not feel comfortable then you can do something, but it is important to know that if a child has a fever for more than three days should not avoid visiting the pediatrician.
Fever in children can be reduced in five minutes with these methods:
A warm bath
Water evaporates from the skin, and begins lowering the temperature, and all this with the help of warm baths. Do not use cold water, because it can cause the opposite effect, i.e., in this case, the temperature can rise.
Potato
It is also very useful to put the freshly grated potatoes in socks.
