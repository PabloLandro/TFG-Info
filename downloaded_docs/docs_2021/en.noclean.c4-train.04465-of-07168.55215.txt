How Does L-Theanine Work?
It is not clear exactly how L-theanine works. It might be beneficial for anxiety by increasing levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a brain chemical that is naturally calming. L-theanine may also increase serotonin levels in the brain. It is thought that L-theanine might be beneficial for Alzheimer's disease treatment (or even prevention) because it seems to protect nerves in the brain from damage seen in Alzheimer's disease. In animals, L-theanine lowers norepinephrine levels, which may help lower blood pressure.
L-Theanine Use in Children
It is not known if L-theanine is safe for children. Keep in mind that children may be more sensitive to the effects and toxicities of medications or supplements. Check with your child's healthcare provider before giving your child L-theanine for any purpose.
