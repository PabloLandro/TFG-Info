Treatments for Thinning Hair: Do They Work?

When to See a Doctor for Hair Loss
So you're never going to have a thick, lush head of hair again. But at least you'd like to hang on to what you've got. Short of a transplant, is there anything you can do to stop thinning hair?
Yes. With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever. Read on to see what works and what doesn't.
Minoxidil
This is the only over-the-counter medication for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works.
Minoxidil is available as Rogaine or Theroxidil, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%.
Effectiveness: Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men. It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair.
How to use it: Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more.
What it doesn't do: Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before.
Side effects:You may have redness, itching, dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution.
Finasteride
This medication stops your body from making the hormone at the root of male pattern baldness, DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It is available under the brand name Propecia.
Effectiveness: Finasteride is very effective. It slows or stops hair loss in nearly 90% of men. About two-thirds of these men also regrow some hair.
How to use it: Finasteride is a pill. Usually, you take it once a day. Your dermatologist may recommend using it in combination with minoxidil.
What it doesn't do: Like minoxidil, it doesn't cure hair loss. If you stop taking it, you will lose hair again.
Side effects: Finasteride can cause erectile dysfunction and other sexual side effects, though this is unusual. If it happens to you, it will likely clear up once you stop taking finasteride. But for some men, that can take 3 months or more.

Biotin and Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)
Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for your health. You most likely get plenty of it in your diet in egg yolks, yeast, liver, and other foods. That’s good news because too little biotin can cause hair loss. Does that mean that taking mega-doses of it will give you more hair? Probably not. No scientific studies have shown biotin to prevent or treat hair loss.
You may have heard that laser combs, brushes, hoods, and caps can help halt hair loss. The theory is that when hair follicles absorb laser light at a certain level, it stimulates hair to grow. But there’s not enough evidence that any of these devices restore hair or prevent balding.
When to See a Doctor for Hair Loss
If you lose hair suddenly, see your doctor. It may be caused by illnesses, medicine, or your diet.
