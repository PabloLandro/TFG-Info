Abstract
Objective: This study was designed to evaluate iron supplementation on serum zinc level in pregnant women with hemoglobin levels higher than 13.2 gr/dL.
Material and Methods: This research was performed using an experimental study based on unilateral blind random clinical testing. 64 pregnant women in first trimester with Hb>13.2gr/dL, ferritin>14.3 m g/L and normal zinc (77-165 m g/dL) that had similar conditions in background variables, were selected to participate in this study. The participants were divided into 33 cases and 31 controls. From the 20th week till the end of pregnancy, cases received a daily ferrous sulfate pills (a 150 mg pill containing 50 mg elemental iron) and the controls received a placebo daily in the 24-28 and 32-36 weeks of pregnancy. The level of serum zinc in all cases and controls and hemoglobin in controls were measured. Furthermore, the level of serum ferritin was measured in the 32-36 pregnancy weeks in both groups.
Results: This study showed that the average level of zinc in the second trimester in controls (91.23 ± 2.15 m g/dL) was significantly (P<0.001) higher than that of cases (80.35 ± 1.68 m g/dL). Morover, the average level of zinc in the third trimester of controls (87.33 ± 2.1 m g/dL) was significantly (P<0.001) higher than cases (67 ± 1.98 m g/dL). The percentage of decrease from the first trimester to the third trimester in cases (32.7%) was considerably higher than the control (11.37%). The average ferritin level in the third trimester in controls (13.08 ± 0.57 m g/L) was significantly (P<0.001) less than that of the cases (15.88 ± 0.42).
Conclusion: Using iron supplements by women with hemoglobin higher than 13.2 gr/dL causes a considerable decline in serum zinc and increases the possibility of adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Morover, avoiding the use of iron supplements in these women does not cause a considerable decrease in hemoglobin and serum ferritin level, and does not trigger iron deficiency anemia.
