Several factors have to be considered in determining the type of treatment for ovarian cyst pain, and whether these cysts need to be treated at all. These factors include:1
• Patient’s age
• Cyst appearance
• Cyst size
• If patient is pre- or postmenopausal
• Presence of ovarian cyst symptoms, such as pain located in the abdomen, pelvis and sometimes on the lower back2
What Is Watchful Waiting?
Watchful waiting or observation may be recommended if the patient is premenopausal and has a small functional cyst measuring 2 to 5 centimeters (three-quarters inch to 2 inches).This means that the patient won’t receive immediate treatment. However, the patient will need to undergo ultrasounds to check if the ovarian cyst resolves on its own. These scans are often done a few weeks or months after the cyst is first spotted.3,4
Postmenopausal patients may also be monitored with ultrasounds and blood tests to check for their CA125 levels. Ideally, post-menopausal women must undergo a follow-up ultrasound four months after the cyst disappears. The specific approach for treating the ovarian cyst depends highly on the cyst’s size and if there is progress over time.
A woman with small cysts in one ovary has a small risk of developing cancer, but in most cases, these cysts go away within three months. If the ultrasound shows that the cyst has resolved, further tests and treatment aren’t usually necessary. If the cyst remains, however, surgery may be recommended.
Ovarian cysts may be surgically removed if they are large or persistent, usually cause symptoms or if there are concerns that the cysts can be cancerous or potentially cancerous.5
Conventional Medicines for Ovarian Cyst Pain Relief
There are medicines that may be suggested to treat ovarian cysts. However, only consider them as a last resort, as there are side effects linked to these drugs:6,7
• Oral contraceptives or birth control pills: These are recommended to inhibit ovulation and ovarian hormone production to help reduce the risk for developing functional ovarian cysts. The uterine lining grows and sheds in direct response to the pills' hormonal content. Oral contraceptives may also be suggested to lower the risk of cysts developing in future menstrual cycles and decrease the possibility of ovarian cancer. However, there are complications linked to these medicines.
Most birth control pills contain derivatives of estrogen and progestin hormones that often mimic effects of the said hormones in the body. These derivatives fool the reproductive system and may eventually:
◦ Prevent ovaries from releasing egg cells
◦ Thicken cell mucus to assist in blocking sperm cell from fertilizing the egg
◦ Prompt thinning of the uterus lining that can make it difficult for an egg to implant if it becomes fertilized
Other complications of taking oral contraceptives include:
Migraines
Weight gain and mood changes
Yeast overgrowth and infection
Increased risk of being diagnosed with glaucoma8
Prevention of muscle gain from resistance exercise training
Higher risk of depression9
Increased plaque artery buildup in the body, consequently raising the risk for heart disease
Reduced mineral bone density (MBD)
Higher risk for blood clots and stroke
Long-term sexual dysfunction, including reduced desire and arousal
Increased risk for cervical, breast and possibly liver cancer
Myocardial infarction
• Pain relievers: Over-the-counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen may be recommended to help reduce pelvic pain, while prescription narcotic or opioid painkillers can be proposed for relieving cyst-caused pain. Unfortunately, these drugs have no effect on speeding up healing of the cysts, and can cause side effects such as:
Side Effects of OTC NSAIDs
Side Effects of Prescription Narcotic or Opioid Painkillers
Stomach upset, nausea and vomiting
Kidney problems
Hypertension
Higher risk of hearing loss (linked to long-term regular use of NSAIDs)10
Higher risk for miscarriage11
Gastrointestinal disorders like upper and lower GI bleeding and perforation12,13
Higher risk for atrial fibrillation14
Death15
Drowsiness
Impaired judgment
Increased risk of misuse and overuse that can cause these medicines to become a gateway drug to heroin
Opioid overdose and death
