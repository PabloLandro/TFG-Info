Ticks & Lyme Disease
Posted on 15th May, by Vicky in Uncategorized. No Comments
Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium present in the digestive system of many animals including mice, hedgehogs, foxes and blackbirds. If a tick bites an animal carrying the bacteria, the tick can become infected and the bacteria can then be transferred as the tick bites its next victim.
The disease is now found across the UK,in city parks and urban gardens as well as rural areas.
There is no need to be afraid of ticks. It’s more a matter of being aware.
Ticks should be removed as quickly as possible but it is essential everyone understands that ticks should never be removed with a cigarette, be squashed or covered in vaseline or citric acid. Such actions can cause the tick to regurgitate its stomach contents into the hosts bloodstream and will make matters worse.
A piece of cotton wound round the tick close to the skin can be used to lift the tick away. Then seek medical attention. Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early.
