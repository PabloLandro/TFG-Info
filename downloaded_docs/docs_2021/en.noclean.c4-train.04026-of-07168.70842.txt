Cold and Flu Myth:
Feed a cold and starve a fever.
Should you feed a cold and starve a fever? Or is it the other way around, starve a cold and feed a fever?
Whatever you may have heard about starving or feeding a cold or the flu, the good news is that this maxim is a myth: starving is never an appropriate option for dealing with a cold or flu. That’s because calorie restriction (starving) puts the immune system in a state of distress, while calorie ingestion (feeding) favors immunity.
The best thing you can do when you’re suffering from a cold or flu is take in plenty of fluids and eat foods rich in zinc and antioxidants like beta-carotene and vitamins C and E.
Foods rich in zinc include: eggs, meats, nuts, seafood, seeds, wheat germ, and whole grains; while most brightly colored fruits, vegetables and dark leafy greens are high in antioxidants. And don’t forget to drink lots and lots of water!
