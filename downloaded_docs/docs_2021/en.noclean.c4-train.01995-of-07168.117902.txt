Background
Folate and folic acid are forms of a water-soluble B vitamin. Folate occurs naturally in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin. Folic acid is well-tolerated in amounts found in fortified foods and supplements. Sources include cereals, baked goods, leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, lettuce), okra, asparagus, fruits (bananas, melons, lemons), legumes, yeast, mushrooms, organ meat (beef liver, kidney), orange juice, and tomato juice. Folic acid is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations.
Folic acid supplements are effective for increasing folate levels in blood and decreasing symptoms associated with low folate levels. Folic acid supplementation, with and without other B vitamins, reduce levels of homocysteine in blood (a cardiovascular risk factor).
Folic acid supplements are suggested for use in women of childbearing age in order to prevent neural tube defects. Neural tube defect risk appears to have decreased in many countries since folic acid fortification of flour and cereals.
Folic acid is also of interest with respect to cognitive enhancement, cancer, psychiatric illnesses, and cardiovascular conditions, although conclusions may not be drawn for many of these uses at this time. Some concern exists with respect to increased folic acid intake masking symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, especially in the elderly population.

Folate deficiency may cause megaloblastic anemia, a blood disorder in which there are very large red blood cells. If the cause is folate deficiency, then treatment with folate is the standard approach. People with anemia should see a medical professional to identify the underlying cause.

Folate deficiency will occur if the body does not get enough folic acid from dietary intake. Folic acid is effective in the treatment of some complications of folate deficiency.

Folate deficiency has been seen in alcoholics. Alcohol affects the body's ability to absorb folate and also increases folate in the urine. Many alcohol abusers have poor quality diets that do not provide the suggested intake of folate. Increasing folate intake through diet, or folic acid intake through fortified foods or supplements, may benefit the health of alcoholics.

Folate may help people being treated with long-term, low-dose methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriasis. Folate deficiency may cause side effects including stomach problems and inflammation, hair loss, anemia, and high homocysteine levels, which are linked to heart disease. People who have experienced side effects may need to continue taking folic acid for the duration of methotrexate therapy. People receiving methotrexate for cancer should avoid folic acid supplements, unless suggested by their doctor. There is some evidence that folic acid supplements reduce the effectiveness of methotrexate in the treatment of some cancers.
