Foot Warts Duct Tape Home Remedy – Is It Really Working?
September 27, 2010 Warts
Does the foot warts duct tape home remedy really work? Out of all of the home remedies for wart removal available, this one does not seem like it would work otherwise why are all of the other products created? Foot warts removal can be done in a number of ways, and some of them are painful while others are expensive and require a dermatologist. Freezing warts can be done at home or by the dermatologist, but this method may not always be effective and the price range can vary from small for home kits all the way up to very expensive for medical procedures. Duct tape only costs a few dollars and may be just as effective as laser wart removal and other expensive methods, although there may be more time required for the wart to be completely removed.

September 13, 2010 Warts
Freezing warts is a common removal method, but when exactly can this method be used and which types of warts can be treated this way?

This method can be used for facial wart removal, but in some extremely sensitive areas there may be some discomfort involved. Freezing may also be used in home remedies for wart removal, although these treatments are not as effective or intense as those that are performed in a physician’s office. The cost is also a lot less, and many of the home products available can be effective.

September 8, 2010 Warts

Mosaic warts are overgrown clusters of planter warts that are extremely painful since they are located on the heels and the balls of the feet, areas they get compressed the most during walking. The compression causes mosaic warts to grow deep inside the skin, making foot warts removal very complicated and lengthy in time.
