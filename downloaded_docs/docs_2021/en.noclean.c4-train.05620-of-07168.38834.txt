Product information:
If you suffer from migraine but the usual analgesics do not help you to weaken the headache, you may find an alternative option and buy Imitrex.
Imitrex is the most promising drug for the treatment of migraine. First of all, this products may prevent the appearance of the migraine symptoms, and also neutralize severe headache during the occurred attack of the disease.
Secondly, the clinical studies have confirmed that Imitrex combines a good balance of the efficiency and safety. In the course of the studies, this medicine was taken by 60 000 patients, and most of them gave this medicine high grades.
The positive action of Imitrex is possible due to its active component Sumatriptan.
Sumatriptan selectively activates certain receptors and chemical connections in the brain in the system of carotid arteries. In the process of the activation of these receptors there is a narrowing of the arterial vessels but without worsening of their capacity. This way, narrowing the arteries and preventing their edema Imitrex prevents the appearance of the migraine symptoms and does not influence on the blood circulation in the brain.
The usual analgesics used to arrest the migraine symptoms just increase the pain threshold due t which the patient does not feel a strong discomfort. But it does not help during other symptoms of migraine.
Imitrex not only reduces headache but also prevents the development of the precursor symptom, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, increased light sensitivity and hypersensitivity to loud noises. Imitrex works better for patients with severe forms of migraine because it acts not only to the symptoms but also to the cause of the disease.
Indications and clinical use:
Imitrex is prescribed to arrest the migraine attacks.
If you decided to buy Imitrex to weaken the headache not connected to migraine, this drug may be ineffective. Its action is conditioned by certain mechanism and if the initial cause of the headache is not connected to the narrowing of the vessels of the brain, this drug is weak against the headache because it is not an analgesic.
Way of use and dosage:
The important note for the patients will become information that the use of Imitrex is ineffective during the prophylaxis of migraine. This drug is the most effective during the development of the migraine symptoms, i.e. in the process of the attack. If the medicine is taken as quick as possible right after the first signs of coming migraine, it will easily and quickly help to avoid the worsening of the health condition of the patient. According to the results of the studies the prolonged therapy with Imitrex drug has not reduced the frequency of the migraine relapses.
In case of the appearance of the migraine signs it is necessary to take 1 tablet of Imitrex 50 mg or 100 mg depending on the form and severity of the disease and attendant symptoms.
In case of severe forms of migraine when attacks may happen every day or 2-3 times a day, the use of another 1 dose is possible not earlier than in 2 hours after the use of the first dosage.
The maximal daily dose of Imitrex is 300 mg.
What side effects might I expect to see or feel?
As it is mentioned before Imitrex differs by the high pharmacological safety and rarely cause the side reactions. Often, the patients confuse the side effects of Imitrex with severe symptoms of migraine.
The most probable side reactions which may happen during the use of the pills are sleepiness, lowering of the arterial pressure, tachycardia, feeling of the discomfort in the stomach, feeling of the flash to the brain, and convulsive attack.
Interaction with other medical products
Imitrex interacts with ergotamine, as a result of which there may be a severe spasm of vessels. These medicines should be used with the interval of 24 hours.
The interaction between sumatriptan and MAO inhibitors is possible as a result of which there is the increase of the concentration of sumatriptan by means of the reduction of its metabolism.
During the simultaneous use of sumatriptan with the drugs from the group of the reuptake serotonin inhibitors the development of weakness, sleepiness and motion coordination is possible.
Overdosage
In case of the overdose the patient may experience the side effects and the efficiency of the drug may be weakened due to which the migraine attack will be felt stronger.
The symptomatic therapy and careful supervision of the patientâ€™s condition is needed within 10-12 hours in case of the overdose.
