Thanks for sharing Tim. NSAIDs can be very helpful for many Migraineurs. The trick is not using them too frequently that you set yourself up for medication overuse headache. https://migraine.com/blog/help-how-can-i-not-overuse-migraine-medications/

I have Supraventricular Tachycardia, a minor cardiac arrythmia. My Neurologist talked with my Cardiologist and they both agreed that there isn’t a single Migraine abortive medicine that I can safely take. So for moderate Migraines my Neurologist has me take two Aleve. For severe Migraines I take two Aleve plus two Tylenol 3’s at the same time. It works really well for me. I agree that you don’t want to take Aleve very often unless your Migraine is really bad.
