Institute of Radiology, Kantonsspital Baden, Baden, Switzerland.
We present an uncommon imaging feature with fluid fat tracking within the tendon sheath of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) after traumatic injury to the ankle joint. We propose a coined medical term "lipidus migrans" to define the presence of floating fat in a tendon sheath. This is due to lipohemarthrosis from intra-articular fracture of the ankle with leakage of fluid fat into the tendon sheath. Read More

J Dance Med Sci 2018 Mar;22(1):11-18
Medical Center for Dancers and Musician, The Hague Medical Center, The Netherlands.
Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) is a painful, usually limited plantar flexion of the ankle joint due to soft tissue impingement or a bony impediment often coinciding with tendinopathy of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) behind the medial malleolus. In persistent complaints, the bony impediment is removed, the tunnel of the FHL tendon is released, or a combination of both procedures has traditionally been performed by open surgery. In 2000, an endoscopic surgical technique for PAIS and FHL tendinopathy was introduced. Read More

Medical Center for Dancer and Musician, The Hague Medical Center, The Netherlands.
Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS), the result of posterolateral soft tissue or bony impingement of the ankle, and tendinopathy of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL tendinopathy) in the ankle are common in dancers. If conservative treatment of these conditions fails to produce adequate results, surgical intervention might be necessary. However, outcomes of treatment by open surgery for these diagnoses have been described only in small series of dancers. Read More

Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway (EEH, KHH, AHS).
Background: Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures can lead to reduced power of plantar flexion in the ankle with impaired gait ability. The open 1- or 2-incision technique for flexor hallucis longus transfer has proven good functional outcome but has the disadvantage of relatively extensive surgery performed at a vulnerable location. To reduce the risk of soft tissue problems, the flexor hallucis longus transfer can be performed endoscopically. Read More

Assistant Professor, Division of Mineral Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.
The flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer is commonly used to restore function in chronic Achilles tendon ruptures and chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The tendon is often secured to the calcaneus either through a bone tunnel or by an interference screw. We hypothesized that tenodesis using the bone tunnel method would be mechanically superior to interference screw fixation for flexor hallucis longus transfers. Read More

Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio.
Introduction: Flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer to the calcaneus is commonly used in the surgical treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. This study assesses the integrity of FHL tendon biotenodesis screw fixation with respect to 2 variables: incorporation of a terminal whipstitch and tunnel depth.
Materials And Methods: A total of 60 fresh-frozen cadaver FHL tendons and 28 calcanei were harvested for analysis in 4 sets of fixation constructs; 14 whipstitched tendons were compared against their nonwhipstitched paired tendon via pull-out strength load testing, and 16 tendon pairs were randomized for fixation in either a full-depth tunnel (bicortical) or a 25-mm partial tunnel (unicortical).

Os trigonum syndrome with disease of the flexor hallucis longus tendon, so-called stenosing flexor tenosynovitis, is a common cause of posterior ankle impingement. Conservative treatment is the recommended first line of treatment, with secondary treatment options of either open or arthroscopic os trigonum excision with flexor hallucis longus retinaculum release. The arthroscopic approaches have gained popularity in the past decade because of less scarring, less postoperative pain, minimal overall morbidity, and earlier return to activities. Read More

Tendinopathy of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), colloquially referred to as "dancer's tendinitis," is a common condition in dancers and attributed to high demand on this muscle in positions of extreme ankle plantarflexion and metatarsophalangeal (MTP)) flexion and extension. Despite such a high prevalence, there has been little research into preventative or nonsurgical interventions. As a means to identify potential targets for prevention and intervention, this study aimed to characterize toe flexors in dancers by measuring strength, flexibility, function, and FHL tendon morphology.
