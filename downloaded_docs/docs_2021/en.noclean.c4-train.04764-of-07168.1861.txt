Most ticks are not known to cause any diseases but it is still advisable to remove a tick as soon as it penetrates the skin. This is important as it helps to prevent infection at the site of the bite and also prevent Lyme disease. Lyme disease is sometimes passed into the body while a tick is feeding on human blood. Although the risk of getting Lyme disease after being bitten by a tick is low, it is still important for the child to be checked out. The tick should be removed immediately because the risk of infection increases in the 24 to 48 hours after the bite.
Steps
Part 1
Comforting Your Child
1
Do not let the child touch the tick. Since we are dealing with a child here, it is very important to communicate clearly and talk to your child as simply, but firmly as possible. Tell your child not to pull or sweep off the tick by himself.
2
Let your child know that you are there to help. Reassuring the child will decrease his anxiety. If the child is crying or frightened, comfort the child by talking to him gently and staying close beside him.
3
Explain the situation to your child. Never try to frighten your child with silly jokes. Explain to the child what you intend to do and how you will go about it. Explaining to the child important information in a loving way may help him be more calm and composed.
Part 2
Removing the Tick
1
Wash your hands. Wash your hands thoroughly for at least two minutes. This will minimize the spread of bacteria. Use warm running water and a mild soap.
2
Wear a pair of clean gloves or simply use a tissue. The tissue or gloves will serve as a protection for you and your child. They will prevent you from having to touch the tick directly and stop any bacteria from entering the child's body through the tick bite.
3
Find a pair of fine-pointed tweezers. This is the most important and effective tool for removing a tick from your child. Though there are different types of tweezers, a fine-pointed tweezers will help you to be more precise when pulling of the tick and prevent you from pinching the child's skin.
At this point in time, if you think that there is a risk of tick bites in your home, it's a good idea to buy a fine-pointed tweezers so they are always easily at hand.
This will ensure that you have the right tool in case the problem arises again.
4
Grasp the tick firmly and securely at its mouth or head. This can easily be done with a fine-pointed tweezers. Never try to grab the tick on its body or abdomen.
There is a risk that you squeeze its abdomen, which will push infected blood back into your child’s blood stream. Additionally, pulling the tick out by its abdomen might leave a part of its body stuck on your kid’s skin.
5
Pull slowly and firmly. With enough gentle pressure, the tick will hopefully let go of the skin. Never try to twist or rock the tick from side to side. This will increase the chance of leaving some portion of its mouth or head attached to the skin.
However, do not worry too much if you see that something was left behind on your child’s skin. It will come out eventually on its own.
6
Place the tick in a container or zip-locked bag. You can do this in case you want the tick to be examined or properly identified later by healthcare professionals.
Never release the tick. Kill it if you do not have any need of it.
7
Wash the bite site with running water and mild soap. Pat dry, and then further clean the bite site with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol[1]
Afterwards, wash your own hands as with running water and mild soap.
8
Check the affected area. Signs of localized inflammation are normal. These include swelling, redness and being warm to touch. Oftentimes, tick bites are harmless and the bite site will heal without any medical intervention.
Part 3
Knowing When to Notify Your Doctor
1
Call your doctor if you are unable to pull out the tick. Under special circumstances, you might not be able to remove the tick by yourself. If you don't think you can remove the tick effectively, it's a good idea to seek professional help.
2
Visit your doctor if you suspect Lyme disease. Though it is uncommon, it is still possible that a tick can cause Lyme disease. This disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi.
You should call the doctor if your child develops signs and symptoms related to Lyme disease. These include a circular rash at the site of the tick bite resembling a “bull’s-eye”, generalized weakness, headache, stiff neck, muscle and joint pain, and fever.[2]
This bacterium is commonly found in mice and deer. When a tick bites a bacterium-infested animal, it can transmit the bacteria to humans.
It is helpful if you have stored the tick in a container. You can bring the tick along with you as you visit your doctor.
3
Keep an eye out for the signs and symptoms of allergic reaction. Immediately call your doctor if your child experiences signs of an allergic reaction to the tick bite such as severe headache, paralysis, chest pain, heart palpitation and difficulty of breathing.

Question
Isn't it best to pull the tick fast? If you do it slowly, the tick grabs tighter to the skin and will either rip skin off or leave in mouth parts, which can create infection. It does not seem very smart to leave parts of the tick it the skin. Won't that cause disease?
Community Answer
It would be wise to pull it quickly unless it has it's head underneath the skin. if it has its head underneath the skin, it is best to be careful, lest you risk ripping its head off which can cause serious infections.

Warnings
Never fall for the myths surrounding methods of getting rid of ticks. Some people suggest touching the tick with a hot match; using a lighter to “burn” the tick; using ice to freeze it off; or covering it with nail polish or petroleum jelly in an attempt to suffocate the tick.. As plausible as they may sound, these methods have the opposite effect. Most often than not, they will just force the tick to hold on tighter, burrow deeper, and release more saliva into your child’s skin. All these will only increase the chance of your child developing an infection.[3]
