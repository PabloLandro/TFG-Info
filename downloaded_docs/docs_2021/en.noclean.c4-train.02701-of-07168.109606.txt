Welcome One Woman. I don't know that it has been approved for dyshidrotic eczema, but it's worth talking to the doctor. Have you figured out any triggers that make it worse?

Re: New Eczema Drug Dupixent Approved by FDA
OneWoman · 4/1/179:22 PM
I was just wondering if anyone has any knowledge or experience with Dupixent and Dyshidrotic Eczema? I have had it for almost 2 years now. I have tried everything I know to do, as well as Rx creams from my Dr., and nothing helps...not even a little. The skin on my hands (back, front, sides, all fingers- sides, top, bottom) is so thick and itches so bad all the time. The only way I can relieve the itching is by popping the blisters. I'm about to go insane. I don't know what to do. The subject...

FDA Approves Removal of Asthma-Related Death Box Warnings From Certain Asthma Medicines
AAFA Community Services · 12/21/1712:13 PM
FDA's most prominent warning, the Boxed Warning, about asthma-related death has been removed from the drug labels of medicines that contain both an ICS and LABA. A FDA review of four large clinical safety trials shows that treating asthma with long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) does not result in significantly more serious asthma-related side effects than treatment with ICS alone.
