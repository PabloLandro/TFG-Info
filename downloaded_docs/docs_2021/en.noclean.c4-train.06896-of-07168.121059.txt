How To Use L-Theanine For Opiate Withdrawal
Natural Remedies for Opiate Withdrawal, Nootropics for Opiate Withdrawal, Opiate Withdrawal ¬∑ February 5, 2016
In this article, I‚Äôm going to teach you how to use L-Theanine for opiate withdrawal. L-Theanine is an amino acid that is not common in the diet. It‚Äôs unique because it‚Äôs neither an essential or one of the common nonessential amino acids, and is deemed a nondietary amino acid.
L-Theanine is found primarily in plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of green tea (Camellia sinensis) in 1949, and in 1950, a laboratory in Japan successfully isolated it from gyokuro leaf (a type of green tea) which has a high L-Theanine content. Along with green tea, L-Theanine is also found in black tea, white tea, and certain types of mushrooms.
L-Theanine has been reported to increase mood-enhancing chemicals in the brain such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce psychoactive properties.
L-Theanine has been studied for its potential ability to:
Reduce mental and physical stress
Improve cognition
Boost mood and cognitive performance in a synergistic manner with caffeine
Reduce opiate withdrawal symptoms
L-Theanine significantly increases alpha wave production in the brain. Alpha brain waves are most present in a wakeful state that is characterized by a relaxed and effortless alertness. Alpha states have been described variously as sublime, flying, floating, lightness, peace, and tranquility.
Alpha waves are present when your brain is in an idling default-state typically created when you‚Äôre daydreaming or consciously practicing mindfulness or meditation.
L-Theanine For Opiate Withdrawal Study
More and more people are starting to learn about the use of L-Theanine for opiate withdrawal. Since it is reported to increase alpha brain waves and mood-enhancing neurotransmitters, it may be useful in the treatment of opiate withdrawal.
In a study from 2012, researchers wanted to see if L-Theanine reduced opioid withdrawal symptoms in morphine-dependent monkeys, as a model for what could potentially happen with human opioid addicts. They also wanted to see if L-Theanine decreased anxiety-like behavior in mice using the elevated plus maze and marble burying assays.
Here is a quote taken directly from this study, which discusses the outcome:
‚Äúl-theanine significantly attenuated designated opioid withdrawal signs, including fighting, rigid abdominal muscles, vocalizing on palpation of abdomen, pacing, retching, wet-dog shakes, and masturbation. It had a relatively quick onset of action that persisted for at least 2.5h.
l-theanine also produced anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze and the marble burying assay in na√Øve mice at doses that did not significantly affect motor behavior. The results of these studies suggest that l-theanine may be useful in the pharmacotherapy of treating opioid withdrawal as well as anxiety-associated behaviors.‚Äù
How To Use L-Theanine For Opiate Withdrawal
After reading the results of that study, you may be thinking about using L-Theanine for opiate withdrawal. L-Theanine may be useful for opiate withdrawal anxiety due to its action on the GABA receptors.
GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that steers the mind to naturally reduce feelings of anxiety and stress. Instead, a person feels relaxed, peaceful, and confident. Sleep cycles are normalized, and ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù reactions are minimized throughout all systems of the body.
Here are some guidelines on the use of L-Theanine for opiate withdrawal:
The amount of L-Theanine found in tea likely will not be enough, so you‚Äôll want to use a high-quality supplement, such as Absorb Your Health L-Theanine.
Take 200 mg to 400 mg doses a few times throughout the day, with a maximum daily amount of 1200 mg.
Always take this supplement on an empty stomach to increase absorption rates.
Be sure to use L-Theanine under the care of your healthcare provider, and be aware of the possible interactions.
Using L-Theanine may reduce blood pressure, so use caution while taking other medications or supplements with this effect.
In addition, you may really benefit from taking L-Theanine with an Opiate Withdrawal Supplement that was formulated to help ease the symptoms of opiate withdrawal.
If you can afford it, I also highly recommend taking this awesome supplement, because the benefits are just too good to pass up.

So I am slowly coming off VALIUM. I take 15mg. Soon to drop by a quarter. I had a hip replacement and take 5mg. hydrocodone day, tapering off that as well with no problems EXCEPT INSOMNIA! I‚Äôve gotten about 7 hours sleep in 4 days, which is why I want to try L Theanine. The benzos lock into the gaba receptors, apparently so does thiamine. Will I have a problem here?
Thank you so very much. I need SLEEP!

No issues with theanine withdrawal. I‚Äôm going to post an article that you will benefit from reading. In the title it says Klonopin, but this plan is for getting off any benzodiazepine drug:

I would also like to know the answer to this. As I have been having horrible anxiety with panic attacks but I am at 100mg on a 5mg bi-weekly taper and I‚Äôm too scared to take anything with the methadone. I also looked into taking magnesium but heard some horror stories about adverse reactions, including a feeling of being under the influence of ecstasy.

Hi Matt,
I wanted to be a bit more specific than my original post. I currently have 2.5 years of clean time from opiate addiction. I‚Äôm currently taking 300mg of wellbutrin once daily for depression. While wellbutrin has been a life saver, I have found it‚Äôs s not working as well as it did when I first started. I‚Äôve done a ton of research and cannot find anything negative about L-theanine being a problem with someone with a drug addiction history. I decided to try L-theanine 200mg three times a day and I‚Äôve found it works very well. I‚Äôm no longer having social anxiety, and my mood has been more stable. I‚Äôm just concerned, I want to make sure it‚Äôs safe for someone like me. Thanks for your help.

Ian,
L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea and is what gives it a calming effect without causing one to feel sleepy. Supplementation with L-Theanine does however seem to improve sleep quality over time. While it is not commonly known to help with RLS, this doesnt mean that for some people it does. This amino acid promotes both dopamine and seratonin, and in relation it help produce the ‚Äúhappy hormones‚Äù and calm the stress hormones, like cortisol. Since the exact cause of RLS is still unknown, many things do point to being a contributing factor for this syndrome. It does make sense that since L-Theanine supplementation over time can produce restfull sleep and that this does contribute to dopamine production, that yes, for some it may very well help with RLS.

I see that it‚Äôs been a few days and you haven‚Äôt had a chance to respond to precious postings, but could you please contact me (or let me contact you) via e-mail? I have many of the vitamins u have suggested (with the exception of passion flower) and I am already starting detox but feeling okay (on day 1, so you know). Can you help me figure out how much of each to take when and is it OK to do that along with the mega dosing vitamin c method?? Thanks so much, I appreciate your time and please ask that you respond quickly if possible!
