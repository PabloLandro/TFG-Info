CBD Bath Bombs for Migraines: Wow
CBD Bath Bombs for Migraines: Wow
CBD is on track to becoming one of the most popular migraine treatments. CBD research shows that it may relieve migraines with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, anti-nausea, and anti-seizure effects. This is a brief article about the migraine research behind CBD bath bombs, which you can learn more about in my new book Hemp for Migraine.
You can sift through all of the CBD research but I warn you, nothing will prepare you for the relief stepping into a CBD-infused bath will bring. I was blown away. CBD is non-psychoactive‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt get you high‚Äîbut your whole body will feel like it is radiating away any stress or pain. You‚Äôre about to read where the relief comes from and why a CBD bath bomb is just what migraine sufferers need.

9 Things You Should Know About CBD Bath Bombs for Migraines

How CBD and Endocannabinoids Prevent Migraines

9. CBD in a Bath? Does It Work?
The skin absorbs CBD more effectively than the gut.[1] Topical CBD is considered extremely effective when applied directly to the skin. ‚ÄúHold on, Jeremy,‚Äù you say, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it wasteful to put CBD in a tub because some of the CBD floating around won‚Äôt make it to your skin?‚Äù Yes, you will only absorb a fraction of the CBD in bath water. A CBD bath is not as effective as a topical CBD cream that‚Äôs applied directly to the skin.
A CBD bath bomb isn‚Äôt about effectiveness. It‚Äôs about luxury. You‚Äôll lose some CBD in bath water but bath bombs account for this with high doses of CBD. They‚Äôre an expensive option; however, soaking in a CBD-infused bath may provide a level of full-body relief that is unmatched by any other treatments. It could be the additional relief you need to soothe a migraine or an oncoming migraine.

8. How Much CBD Does My Bath Bomb Need?
I can‚Äôt give you a specific dose because of multiple variables that I discuss here, including the needs of your individual endocannabinoid system. Furthermore, there‚Äôs no peer-reviewed research on the dosage for this method of CBD absorption. Some CBD bath bombs contain 25 mg of CBD and others contain 250 mg of CBD. I felt like I was in a cloud after using a 30 mg bath bomb, but you may want to try a much higher dose during a migraine. Manufacturers recommend starting with a lower dose and working your way up to a higher dose for maximum relief. People have ingested doses of over 1500 mg of CBD without side effects, but you should always check with your doctor first.[2]
Note: Fake CBD is a big problem. Only purchase from reliable companies that provide third-party testing.
7. How Does It Work?
A CBD bath may help relieve migraines in several ways. CBD‚Äôs anti-inflammatory effects can reduce body pains and aches that a migraine brings.[3] [4] Inflammation is also a migraine trigger and reducing the body‚Äôs total levels of inflammation may help alleviate or prevent migraines.
You have cannabinoid receptors located all over the body and a CBD bath can increase your body‚Äôs natural endocannabinoids to prevent or relieve migraines. If you‚Äôre wondering why migraine sufferers need more endocannabinoids, you can read this free chapter from my new book Hemp for Migraine.
The most noticeable effect of a CBD bath is a feeling of deep relaxation‚Äîhey, don‚Äôt knock it until you try it.[5] Things that relax the body such as biofeedback, relaxation exercises, massages, and anti-anxiety medications have been proven in hundreds of studies to prevent and relieve migraines. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Stress increases a migraine trigger called oxidative stress and a CBD bath reduces both stress and oxidative stress.[12] [13] [14]
At worst, a CBD bath could help reduce the body pains and aches that a migraine brings. At best, it may reduce your body‚Äôs overall stress and inflammation levels to subdue or prevent migraines.
6. What‚Äôs Missing from a CBD Bath Bomb?
CBD that is absorbed through the skin can directly target cannabinoid receptors, which are located all over the body. This means a CBD bath can relax the body and that may indirectly help calm the nerves that trigger migraines. These nerves are called the trigeminal and occipital nerves, which are located in the face and the neck. You can also directly target these nerves by using a topical CBD cream on the face and neck while taking a CBD bath.
By combining a CBD-infused bath with the use of topical CBD cream, you will have most of your nerves and surrounding muscles that trigger migraines covered, literally with CBD. However, topical CBD does not enter the bloodstream. A CBD bath and topical cream may help reduce the total levels of inflammation and oxidative stress that trigger migraines, but there are obviously areas of the body that can only be directly influenced from CBD that makes it into the bloodstream. You may want to use a sublingual CBD or CBD vape in addition to a bath bomb to increase endocannabinoids throughout the entire body, including the bloodstream.
To recap, use a CBD-infused bath to relieve the body. Use a topical CBD cream for the nerves that trigger migraines in the face and neck. And use the sublingual or vape method of CBD absorption to help CBD rapidly enter the bloodstream and increase endocannabinoids throughout the entire body and central nervous system.

5. To THC or Not to THC? That is The Question.
In my articles and in my book, I recommend full-spectrum hemp extracts, which include numerous cannabinoids and nutrients that help fight migraines. However, unless you‚Äôre rich, it might be a waste of money to purchase a full-spectrum bath bomb. Pure CBD, known as CBD isolate, is much cheaper than a premium hemp extract.
CBD absorbs ten times better through the skin than the topical absorption of THC.[15] A topical cream that includes small amounts of THC may be worth it because THC is extremely anti-inflammatory. THC is responsible for the psychoactive effects‚Äîthe ‚Äúhigh‚Äù effects‚Äîof cannabis, but you don‚Äôt need to worry about a topical cream or a CBD-infused bath. THC can‚Äôt enter the bloodstream through the skin and therefore will not get you high.
There are advantages to a full-spectrum hemp bath bomb that includes THC and other cannabinoids, but are they worth the money? I say no. Paying top dollar for a full-spectrum hemp extract and losing most of the cannabinoids in a bath is wasteful. That‚Äôs my frugal opinion. But as I said before, CBD bath bombs are a luxury and you might want the best of the best.
Ingredients You Want in a CBD Bath Bomb for Migraine Relief
4. Epsom Salt:
Epsom salt is also known as magnesium sulfate and it is the most popular ingredient for a soothing bath. Migraine sufferers become deficient in magnesium during attacks and there is a ton of research that shows that magnesium supplements should be used by all migraine sufferers.[16] [17] [18] Magnesium is also part of a group of minerals, which I call migraine minerals, that help the endocannabinoid system control migraines.
There is some research that shows that magnesium absorbs well through the skin, while other research suggests that only a small amount of magnesium can be absorbed through the sweat glands and hair follicles. Skeptics argue that there‚Äôs not enough research to know for sure and you should not replace your magnesium supplement with an Epsom salt bath.[19]
It doesn‚Äôt matter if magnesium enters the blood or not. Sure, any extra magnesium in the blood is a plus for migraine prevention. However, the reason you want to dump Epsom salt into a bath is because it is extremely effective at soothing muscle inflammation, pain, and body aches. You want to reduce the body‚Äôs total levels of oxidative stress and inflammation for migraine relief and prevention.
Look at the Amazon reviews of this 19-pound bag of Epsom salt‚Äîthat‚Äôs a lot!‚Äîby the San Francisco Salt Company. People are buying this stuff in bulk. There are over 2,000 people who give it five stars (at the time of this writing) for its claims of soothing aches, pain, stress, and exfoliating and softening skin. But if you look closer, many of the reviewers are migraine and headache sufferers.
Here are a few quotes:
‚ÄúI get migraines and neck and back pain daily. So I decided to start taking Epsom salt baths, and this helps with the pain so much! I can actually function‚Äù
‚ÄúI have been using Epsom salts for years to relax tired aching muscles‚Ä¶.and prevent the headaches that accompany them from turning into an ugly migraine.‚Äù
‚ÄúRelaxes me and I have noticed a decrease in my migraines.‚Äù
‚ÄúAfter I take 1 bath with this, my headaches are gone instantly‚Äù
‚ÄúMy 7-year old daughter has been on a migraine prevention regimen since she was 5 and she‚Äôs gone from a migraine a month, to nearly a year without one. Epsom salt baths are a part of her regimen‚Äù
Put some Epsom salt in your CBD bath. You might be the next headache or migraine sufferer that gives this folk remedy a five-star rating.
3. Baking Soda:
Sodium bicarbonate (aka ‚Äúbaking soda‚Äù) is one the most common bath bomb ingredients for its anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties.[20] [21] It leaves the skin soft, smooth, and clean.
Baking soda baths are one of the most effective ways to treat psoriasis.[22] If you‚Äôve read my books or articles, you know that migraines are associated with conditions that raise oxidative stress and inflammation levels. Psoriasis is a condition that leaves the skin inflamed, itchy, and flakey. And, indeed, psoriasis is associated with oxidative stress and migraines.[23] [24] [25]
To treat migraines, you want to treat the inflammation and oxidative stress throughout the body. The activation of the endocannabinoid system also plays a role in keeping skin healthy and in some cases has reversed skin inflammation and damage.[26] Research suggests that CBD (as well as other cannabinoids, such as THC, CBN, and CBG) may help treat the overactive T-cells that trigger psoriasis and inflammation.[27] [28] [29] [30]
Psoriasis is just one example of how inflammation in the body is linked to migraine. We could have discussed how acne increases the risk of migraine and how reducing oxidative stress and inflammation could prevent both conditions. And yes, research shows that CBD is a ‚Äúpromising treatment of acne,‚Äù according to an international study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.[31] A CBD bath with baking soda might help migraines by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, just like it does with related conditions.
Side note: If you have psoriasis or acne, you may want to consider a full-spectrum hemp cream for direct application to the inflamed skin and a full-spectrum hemp extract for sublingual use. This may help directly treat the inflammation and help the endocannabinoid system maintain healthy skin.
2. Lavender
Lavender is a favorite essential oil of migraine sufferers for several reasons. Lavender induces powerful anesthetic effects (insensitivity to pain). A study published by the New York University Medical Center found that lavender‚Äîyou know that hippy essential oil‚Äîreduced the need for morphine after patients underwent surgery.[32] That‚Äôs potent stuff.
Most people like lavender because it‚Äôs calming, which comes from its anti-anxiety, anti-seizure, and neuroprotective effects.[33] Yep, all of that calming will also help control migraines.
A study published in the journal European Neurology found that lavender helped to partially or completely alleviate over 70 percent of attacks in diagnosed migraine sufferers.[34] A recent study found that lavender therapy significantly improved the disability score of migraine sufferers over a three-month clinical trial.[35] This suggests that taking CBD baths with lavender may help relieve the pain that is here now, and they may prevent migraines before they start.
1. Peppermint
I don‚Äôt need to say much about peppermint for migraine because the research says it all. Peppermint may be the most effective essential oil for migraine relief. A 2015 study conducted by Thomas Jefferson University found that it outperformed prescription migraine medications when applied to the back of the neck and behind the ears during attacks.[36] A larger study found that menthol, the active ingredient of peppermint, was superior to a placebo for migraine pain relief, pain freedom, nausea, vomiting, sound sensitivity, and light sensitivity.[37]
Peppermint is an incredible natural migraine remedy and you can learn more about the science here.
Sum it Up
A CBD bath bomb may help relieve the stress and tension in the body that triggers migraines. It attacks migraine through anti-inflammatory, anti-nausea, antioxidant, and anti-seizure effects.
If you need relief now, you can mix some CBD isolate (25-250 mg) into a bowl of warm water and splash it into a hot bath. Dump in 1-2 cups of Epsom salt, ¬Ω-1 cup of baking soda, and 5-10 drops of peppermint oil, 5-10 drops of lavender oil, and mix it all around. However, if you have time, nothing is as cool as making your own CBD bath bombs. It will save you money and is also one of the best gifts you could give a migraine sufferer, including yourself.
