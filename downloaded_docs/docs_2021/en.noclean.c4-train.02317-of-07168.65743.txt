Can I try multiple of these things? Or will trying different things each day make me breakout more?
Maddie Jones

I use honey and cinnamon mask, which is great for acne scars and preventing breakouts at the same time! Lemon juice is recommend as well, although it can be a bit harsh on the skin particularly if used alone. This is not recommended for people with extremely sensitive skin. If you still want to try it though, I suggest mixing it with water to lessen the acidity. You can check out easyacneguide.com for more acne and acne scar home remedies. It's where I got most of my ideas from :)
