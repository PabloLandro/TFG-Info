Minoxidil topical solution for hair growth
According to recent medical research, baldness affects over 50 million men and 30 million women in the United States. This medical condition also known as Androgenetic alopecia is the cause of genetic failure and the transfer of hair loss genes from one generation to the other.
The good news is that modern medicine has found a safe and comfortable way for you to overcome genetic iniquities. By using a minoxidil topical solution for hair growth, you can defeat male pattern baldness and regain your luscious mane safe and easy. Here are a few tips on how to stop your hairline from receding:
What is Minoxidil?
Minoxidil is a solution commonly used for hair loss remedies. This substance is efficient for sustainable hair growth in both men and women. Its primary action is to revive the follicles on your scalp and boost hair growth. In combination with other vitamins and organic essences, minoxidil increases your chances to regrow a full head of hair in just a few months of treatment.
The best remedy for hair loss on the market at the moment is Provillus. This cure for baldness uses a significant dose of minoxidil to accelerate hair growth and prevent your follicles from dying. The pills contained in this treatment are also packed with minerals and natural extracts that regenerate your scalp. Daily intake helps you defy baldness genes efficiently and without any negative consequences for your health.
Which is the best topical solution for baldness?
Provillus uses the complementary action of dietary supplement pills and topical solutions to boost hair growth quicker than any other hair loss treatment on the market. Both products use minoxidil and other Provillus ingredients to treat a balding scalp and revive the follicles from their dormant state.
Regular use of Provillus enables you to grow new strands of hair from stronger and healthier roots. Extensive treatment promotes and sustains hair regrowth even in areas where the follicles had stopped their production years ago. As a result, you develop thicker, more luscious curls that are harder to break and fall than ever before.
How quick will my hair grow back?
Provillus contains a 5% dose of minoxidil, which is ideal for hair growth in both men and women. Daily use boosts hair regeneration and restores your natural mane in less than 48 weeks of treatment. Besides the surfacing of new threads, this highly effective cure for baldness prevents your old strands from falling off.
The nourishing power of this receding hairline remedy supports the healthy growth of new hairs and the gradual strengthening of your old curls. It only takes two Provillus pills per day and a scalp massage with the topical solution to ensure a quick and natural restoration of your crowning glory.
Does minoxidil have any side effects?
Minoxidil is an FDA-approved substance that has passed all the necessary clinical tests before being proclaimed as 100% safe for human use. At relatively small doses it is impossible to produce any adverse side effects. The recommended amount of hair growth remedies is 5%, which is the staple present in the Provillus treatment for baldness.
