Ultra Prim 500mg

180 Softgels
Quick Overview
Evening Primrose Oil comes from Oenothera biennis (common known as evening primrose), a wildflower found in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. The seeds are unique because it is one of the few oils that contains high amounts of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 essential fatty acid that plays an important role in our body. Omega-6 fatty acids are needed to produce the hormone prostaglandins, particularly PGE1, which helps to maintain and regulate bodily functions. Evening Primrose Oil can be used to alleviate irritated skin conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis as well as relieving discomforts associated with premenstrual syndrome.

Cold pressing enhances the stability and preserves the nutritional components of the oil. Ultra Prim is also ultra-purified to remove any organic residues or impurities.
