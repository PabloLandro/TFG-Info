Magnetic Therapy: An Introduction
The use of magnetism in the field of medicine started centuries ago in China, Egypt and India. Today, it is known as an effective alternative medicine in several parts of the world. People are often curious to learn how magnetic therapy works, to cure ailments. There are two theories described here that explain how magnetism can cause therapeutic effects. According to one of them, when the magnetic article like magnetic bracelet comes in contact with the skin, the magnetic field produced by it attracts the iron present in the blood. It increases flow of blood to that area of the body. The increased blood flow brings in more oxygen and nutrition to that area. This promotes healing.According to scientific studies, human body contains ions. There is another theory that explains how magnetism can treat a particular illness. The ions carry either positive or negative electrical charge. Under normal conditions, there is a balance between the negative and positive charges in the body.
When this balance gets disturbed, the body begins to develop several medical conditions. They include pain, metabolic disorders, organ malfunctioning, etc. The magnetic therapy uses the electromagnetic fields produced by permanent magnets to restore the balance of the charged ions. Because of the restoration of negative and positive charges, the body gets rid of the sickness it suffers from. This is how magnetic therapy facilitates healing and brings back the normal healthy state of the body and subsequently the explanation for magnetic bracelets benefits on the human body.
Magnetic Bracelets: What are their Benefits
Professionals, who use magnetic therapy for improving the health of their patients, claim a lot about its health benefits on human body. According to them, magnetic bracelets can reduce pain from an injured or diseased body part. It is thought that a negative field brings the disturbed metabolic functions back to normal, and thus treat many painful medical conditions such as inflammation or degeneration of body cells. Professionals recommend the use of magnetic bracelets in the treatment of arthritis, as it is believed to reduce inflammation occurred due to infection or some other medical conditions. It has been observed that many patients of chronic headache and migraine have derived a lot of magnetic bracelets benefits and have recovered from frequent episodes of headaches. The regular and proper usage of magnetic bracelets is found to significantly decrease the severity and number of headaches. Practitioners of magnetic therapy prescribe magnetic bracelets to cure insomnia. The magnetic field when placed directly on top of the patient's head is found to produce a calming effect and is highly effective in allowing him to have normal sleep. It has been observed that magnetic therapy delivers positive results in cases of patients suffering from non-healing bone fractures and incontinence.All the above mentioned magnetic bracelets health benefits are not yet completely proved with scientific facts.
The theories described here in this article are only based on the beliefs and assumptions of the scientists who are working on the effects of electromagnetic fields on the human body. Therefore, it is recommendable that you use magnetic bracelets and other similar articles only with the agreement of your doctor. This is the best way to derive magnetic bracelets benefits as well as keep yourself on the safer side.Magnetic therapy uses the natural energy of magnetism that is important to the overall health of a person. To understand magnetic therapy, one would need to think of one's body to contain electrical cells. The cell have a positive charge as well as a negative charge. The body can function at its topmost level when both the polarities of the cells are at an equal level. The polarities are said to have the effects mentioned below: North Pole (Positive): Calming and relaxing effect South Pole (Negative): Motivating and stimulating effect The magnetic therapy uses the magnetic field to assist the body's normal healing processes. Applying the magnetic fields to an injured area helps to improve the blood circulation. This would in turn help to enhance body�s natural healing process. This improved blood circulation and fluid exchange also reduces the pain and inflammation.Medical studies have shown that magnet therapy can prove to be very effective as it blocks the sensation of pain.
Although this has been a matter of much debate, it has been rumored; that magnetic therapy can enable the body to regain its self-healing electromagnetic balance in the natural way. It is also known that the magnetic therapy helps in the prevention and treatment of ailments.There are two types of fixed magnets: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar magnets have a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other. The concentration on one direction assures a most advantageous depth of penetration of energies. On the other hand, the bipolar magnets have the North and South polarities on the same side. However, one has to careful with magnetic therapy. If one is exposed continuously to excessive static electricity due to weather fluctuations and household electrical devices then the body becomes flooded with the positive ions. This can cause a certain imbalance in the body, which can result in the headaches, migraines, insomnia, muscle and joint pain, tiredness, fatigue etc.
