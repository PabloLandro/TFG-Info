It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, with an estimated 300 million affected individuals. It is also an associated disease with allergic rhinitis (AR). AR is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching of the nose, and/or postnasal discharge. It is also closely related to asthma and 10%–40% of people with rhinitis have concomitant asthma Researches in this field are very limited; therefore, this review article will be helpful in updating the knowledge about disease and drugs that can help in satisfying the attending people.
