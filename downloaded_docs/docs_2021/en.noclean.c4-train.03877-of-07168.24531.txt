Music therapy
Music is one of the few things in life that has the power to move us emotionally. A piece of music can bring back memories, lift our spirits and soothe our soul - helping us to express emotions when words fail us. It is this power that music therapy harnesses, using the various musical components to provide a way of relating within a therapeutic relationship.
Music is something almost everyone can relate to and indeed, most of us listen to music at some point every day. Whether you're singing along to your favourite song on your drive to work, listening to the radio at the office or out dancing on a Saturday night, chances are there isn't a day that goes by without music.
The idea behind music therapy is to tap into that shared experience in a way that relates to you. Music therapy can help a range of people including those with emotional difficulties and those with physical limitations. Young children can benefit and improve communication, while older people can regain self-esteem. In this page we will explore this growing area of music therapy and how it could work for you.

What is music therapy?
Music therapy is a type of creative therapy that involves listening to and/or playing music. Depending on the needs of the participant, music therapy can foster self-awareness, communication skills and self-esteem. The therapy utilises the social and communicative nature of music to do this and aims to facilitate positive changes in behaviour.
Usually the music therapist will conduct sessions using a range of instruments and/or their voice to provoke interaction and response from the participants. This kind of relaxed and safe environment helps to encourage learning and emotional release from those taking part.
Do I need musical experience?
You will not need any previous musical experience and you do not need to know how to play an instrument to join in. If the therapist wants you to join in, they are likely to offer up an easy to play instrument such as a drum or tambourine, or indeed you can simply sit back and enjoy listening to the music.
It is also worth noting that music therapy does not aim to teach you how to play an instrument and should not be a substitute to music lessons. That being said, you may find that you naturally pick up rhythmic control and develop sensitivity to pitch by attending music therapy.
What happens in a music therapy session?
A music therapist may work with one person individually, or with a group of people together. The therapy itself can take place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, schools, prisons, care homes and private workspaces depending on the requirements of those taking part. Every therapist will have a different way of working and the session structure will largely depend on the nature of the issues being explored.
Your music therapist may encourage you to take part by singing or playing an instrument, and you may be asked how the music being played makes you feel. Sometimes other sensory props (for example feathers) may be introduced; this can be especially true when dealing with children or those with disabilities. Some music therapists may ask you to make up a piece of music or write a song.
History of music therapy
The use of music as therapy has been taking place for centuries, with Ancient Greece leading the way. Apollo, for example, is the Greek God of music and medicine - proving that the two have been linked since at least the Ancient Greek era. Music therapy was even practiced in biblical times, when it was thought that David played the harp to rid Kind Saul of an evil spirit.
Music therapy as we know it today began in the wake of World Wars I and II. It was then that musicians (particularly in the UK) would travel to hospitals to play music for soldiers experiencing emotional and physical trauma. French cellist Juliette Alvin pioneered clinical music therapy in Britain in the 60s, and is still considered the therapy's strongest influencer.
Today music therapy is one of the country's leading creative therapies and is supported by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).
Music therapy techniques
Music therapists will use a variety of techniques depending on the needs of the people taking part. The following techniques are some of those most commonly used, however this list is not exhaustive and other techniques can be applied:
Singing – Your music therapist may invite you to sing along while they play a song. Singing can help to develop articulation and breath control, and within a group setting it can help to improve social skills.
Playing instruments – Playing an instrument can help you refine motor skills and coordination. Playing along with others also enhances cooperation and team working abilities.
Rhythmic based activities – Imitating a rhythm, or making up your own, can help to develop coordination and range of movement. In some cases it can also help to ease anxiety and aid relaxation.
Improvisation – Giving you the opportunity to express yourself in a creative way, musical improvisation can help when words fail you.
Composing/songwriting – Writing a song about your experiences can be easier than talking about it. Composing music can also help to foster a greater sense of self-awareness, helping you to understand your feelings better.
Listening – Just listening to music can have therapeutic properties. It can help to develop cognitive skills and encourages memory and attention.
Who can music therapy help?
Thanks to the versatile nature of music therapy it has the potential to help a range of different social groups. Almost everyone can benefit from music as therapy, however it is thought to be particularly beneficial for the following:
Children and families
It is thought that children first experience music when they are still in the womb, leading music and sound to be a key communicator for young children. This means music therapy can be experienced by very young babies. When dealing with children and young babies, the use of fabric and sensory props is often encouraged to draw attention and develop cognitive skills.
The aim of music therapy for children is to help them explore and express thoughts and feelings while developing communication and linguistic skills. The therapy can also help to increase self-awareness and develop self-esteem. Listening and taking part in rhythmic-based activities is thought to support coordination while encouraging creative play.
While this type of therapy is aimed more so towards children, sessions can help to cement bonds between parent and child. This can be especially important for those suffering with postnatal depression.
Those with learning difficulties
When music is used in therapy for those with learning difficulties, it is the communicative element that is most often applied. Self-expression and interaction is actively encouraged to help empower and motivate participants. Melodies encourage and prompt physical movement, helping to refine and develop co-ordination.
Those with a neuro-disability
Music is processed within many parts of the brain, making it a valuable tool for those with a brain injury or a neuro-degenerative condition. There are typically three different approaches used to assist rehabilitation and quality of life, these are:
Compensatory - whereby music is used to compensate for any losses (normally in conjunction with tools such as communication and memory aids).
Psycho-socio-emotional - whereby music is used to facilitate emotional expression, social interaction and adjustment to disability.
Restorative - whereby music is used to help regain skill and function.
Neurological Music Therapy (NMT) is a specific model of practice that involves 20 research-based therapy techniques designed to help those with neurological disabilities.
Those on the autistic spectrum
Music therapy is thought to help stabilise mood and increase frustration tolerance for those on the autistic spectrum. The therapy does this by helping the participant identify emotions in a different way, thereby improving self-expression. It is often the feeling of not being able to express oneself that frustrates those with autism, and music therapy offers a way of doing so that doesn't require words.
Music engages the brain in both the neo-cortical and sub-cortical levels, meaning that the listener is not required to 'think' while they listen to the sounds. This makes music therapy ideal for those who have difficulty concentrating. The repetitive sounds used within music therapy also provide stimuli and subsequently teach the brain to respond to such stimuli in better ways.
Those with dementia
Elderly people can feel isolated, and those who have dementia even more so. Music therapy for older people aims to improve self-esteem, promote social interaction and encourage memory recall. Sometimes listening to a song from the past can trigger previously forgotten memories - something that is invaluable for those who have memory problems.
Listening to music can also help to aid relaxation and ease stress. Giving older people the chance to explore their own creative abilities also helps to develop a stronger sense of self.
Those with anxiety and depression
Working as a medium of communication, music can help people dealing with depression to express themselves in a creative way. Whether music therapy is undertaken individually or through a group, the very nature of music helps to ease feelings of isolation that are often experienced by those with depression.
Music therapy has also been hailed for its ability to build self-confidence, helping individuals to take responsibility for their choices and make more choices independently. Anxious thoughts and feelings can often be intervened with the use of music, with calming melodies helping to reduce stress and even lowering blood pressure.
Serving as a creative outlet, music therapy also helps individuals to develop ways of coping when difficult situations arise.
Those with schizophrenia
Studies have shown that music therapy can help to diminish symptoms of schizophrenia, including: flattened affect, speech difficulties and inability to find joy in activities. The therapy helps to reduce feelings of isolation and can increase interest in external events.
It should be noted that music therapy often works best for those with mental health issues when used in conjunction with other treatments including talk therapy and medication.
Can music therapy cure?
Music therapy has the potential to affect an individual for the better, however some conditions are irreversible. In some cases music therapy can have a healing effect, and in others it can help to slow deterioration. Depending on the issues being dealt with within the therapy, it may be necessary for the individual to undergo further treatment, or to combine different treatment types.
What qualifications does a music therapist need?
The title of music therapist is protected by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), which means that in order for someone to call themselves a music therapist, they must be registered with the HCPC. In order to register, music therapists need to have completed an approved programme in music therapy - usually this leads to either a diploma or a masters qualification in music therapy.
Your therapist should be able to provide evidence of their registration with the HCPC so that you can verify their status.
