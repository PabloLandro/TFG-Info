Over the years we have been so happy to hear the remarkable success stories bought to so many, in the UK and all over the world, who have tried our copper collars and this wonderful old remedy. It is a testament to Arthur Forbes, an animal lover and naturalist, who pioneered the use of copper as a remedy on pets as he discovered the rheumatic disease was common while living in a copper deficient area in Africa. You can read more about the history on our about page.
Copper as a Remedy
Egyptian medical papyrus dating to circa 1550 BC
The therapeutic value of copper in relieving the symptoms of arthritis, rheumatism and stiffness has been know for centuries and is recorded in the ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus, a collection of remedies and one of the world's oldest books. Today a number of European countries use copper complexes in drugs to treat inflammatory diseases.
Copper is a natural chemical element, more specifically its a transitional metal. When Copper reacts with your skin, and air, it produces copper oxide; this is the green alkaline phosphates that sometimes appears on your skin as a result of wearing the copper. Academic research indicates that this copper solution is capable of permeating your skin. We know that arthritis and stiffness can be caused by a build-up of acidity in ones joins, therefore, by wearing the copper, the most simple of chemical balancing occurs as the copper alkaline solution helps to neutralise the acidity in ones join and with it reduce the symptoms and pain of arthritis and other stiffness conditions.
Forbes copper collars can be used for horse arthritis, dog arthritis & on cats, its a natural remedy for relieving the symptoms of arthritis, but we always stress that it relieves pain rather than curing it and, once the copper is removed, symptoms return.
