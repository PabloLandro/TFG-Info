1. Evening Primrose Oil
Evening primrose oil, which comes from the plant evening primrose is popularly used as a topical application to soothe the symptoms of irritated skin. However, when taken orally, the remedy can be used successfully for the treatment of systemic inflammatory conditions including eczema.

When plagued with the condition, it means your skin is holding minimal amounts of water and your skin has less natural oils.

An elimination diet is key, as it involves removing certain foot types from your diet and then reintroducing them slowly after a period of time to help you determine the specific food types causing the reaction.

This can be helpful for individuals with eczema and dry skin. In addition, virgin coconut oil protects the skin by combating inflammation while improving the overall health of the barrier of the skin. Simply apply two to three tablespoons of coconut oil on a daily basis, especially on the patches of eczema for the best results. This remedy is a wonderful topical solution that will certainly come in handy if you need quick relief from the mild pain and itching caused by eczema.
