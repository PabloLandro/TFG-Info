Treatment Options for Scars
Treatment Options for Scars
Chemical Peels – TCA (trichloroacetic acid) chemical peels for acne scars and hyperpigmentation
Cryotherapy – a freezing therapy using liquid nitrogen for smaller keloid scars.
Dermabrasion – a procedure that removes top layers of skin, in effect “sanding down” acne scars. Treats hyperpigmentation as well.
Dermapen – a form of microneedling, effective on hypertrophic and atrophic scars.
Dermaroller – a form of microneedling, effective on hypertrophic and atrophic scars.
Fillers – Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Radiesse or Fat Transfer used to plump up atrophic (depressed) scars, as in the case of acne, also stretch marks.
Lasers –
Sublative RF Treatment for acne scarring
Excel V Laser for red scars
Laser Resurfacing/Fractional CO2 – atrophic, hypertrophic, acne scars, rolling scars
Fraxel®, – hypertrophic and scars related to stretch marks
Smoothbeam – acne scars
Vbeam® – red Scars
IPL – red scars and scars related to hyperpigmentation
Medlite C6 lasers for hypertrophic and atrophic scars including those related to acne, stretch marks and hyperpigmentation
Latisse – used in combination with fractional laser therapy has shown promise on hypopigmented scars.
Retin-A – A topical derivative of vitamin A available by prescription only. Most effective against shallow acne scars and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Stimulates the production of collagen. Can be helpful in relieving the pain and itching associated with keloids and hypertrophic scars.
Steroid Injections – a variety known as Kenalog is used to flatten out hypertrophic and keloid scars.
Silicone Sheeting – reduces keloid and hypertrophic scars including surgery scars from tummy tucks, breast augmentation or reduction and other cosmetic and non-cosmetic procedures such as C-section.
Surgical Excision – in the case of keloid scars, where an incision is made and the scar is cut out.
Punch Grafting – For depressed acne scars. A technique where the scar is cut out, then a skin graft, usually taken from behind the ear, is used to fill the void.
Punch Elevation – For depressed acne scars. A technique where the scar tissue is pinched, the base of the scar raised and the surrounding tissue sutured to seal off the site.
Topical Creams –
Prescription varieties:
Aldara Cream has been shown to decrease the reappearance of surgically excised keloids.
5-Fluorouracil Cream (5-FU) – typically used to treat skin cancers, it decreases collagen production and has proven helpful on some hypertrophic scars.
Non-prescription:
Mederma, a gel based on an onion extract. Its marketing claims to make make scars “softer, smoother and less noticeable.
Bleaching Creams – a variety exist on the market to help diminish hyperpigmented scars.
Vitamin E – Special Note: Studies have shown that topically applied vitamin E does NOT help in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars and leads to a higher incidence of an allergic reaction known as contact dermatitis.
Vibradermabrasion– a form of dermabrasion that uses a vibrating paddle.
Concealment of Scars
Camouflage Makeup
Dermablend: a light, full-coverage foundation that can cover a variety of scars on the face and body.
Jane Iredale Mineral Makeup: Concealer and corrective color system available at Contour Dermatology.
Tattooing a Scar – NEVER a good idea. The exact pigment can never be matched. Tattoos fade over time and skin pigment changes throughout the year.
