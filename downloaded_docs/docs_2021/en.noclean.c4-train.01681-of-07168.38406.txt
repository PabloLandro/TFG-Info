Osteoarthritis of the Knee
27-03-2019 04:18:00
Orthotics
Knee Osteoarthritis is a degenerative knee condition where the cartilage of your knee joint gradually wears away, exposing the underlying bone.
Early stages of knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by the onset of pain and mild inflammation around the knee. Usually pain is more severe in the morning and the knee may feel stiff and take a while to loosen up. These symptoms are also exacerbated when living in cooler climates.
So what is going on inside the knee joint?
Knee OA causes inflammation of the tissues in and around the joints. Cartilage, which is a strong and smooth surface that lines the bones and allows the joint to move without friction, can be damaged. Unfortunately for us cartilage does not regenerate.
Bony growths can sometimes develop around the edge of the joints called bone spurs and the alignment of your knee may change as the deterioration takes place. The continual erosion of cartilage can cause alignment problems and this may make you feel as if one leg is shorter than the other or your balance may be compromised.
When the cartilage is very worn (in the later stages of OA) you may feel a grinding in the joint, which is described as the feeling of bone rubbing on bone, or you may hear a clicking noise. Knee OA can be debilitating but there are many treatment options to keep you active and on your feet.
If you think you have OA and would like to know more, see your local GP, they will be able to refer you to have a suitable X-Ray to determine why you are experiencing knee pain.
Symptoms & Causes
There are many diverse causes of knee OA. We commonly see patients over the age of 50 who have lived active lives present with general wear and tear injuries.
Active people who have participated in weight-bearing sports involving lifting, running and directional change are the most likely to develop OA symptoms over their lifetime.
Past (sports) injuries will also play a part in the development of OA, particularly for those who have had prior surgeries for ligament or meniscus damage. In a lot of these procedures the surgeon will clean up and remove cartilage from the joint. As we know, cartilage does not grow back.
Contrary to those active patients, we see people who are overweight and not active enough. They are simply putting more strain through their knees, ankles and feet than the body can adequately deal with. This strain on the joints causes accelerated breakdown of soft tissue in the joint capsule.
Lastly, you could blame your parents… Genetics does play a part in the cause of your OA. Although you do not inherit the condition itself, if your parents have/had OA, you inherit an increased risk of developing the condition.
Treatment & Prevention
Unloader Bracing
VQ Osteoarthritis Unloader Brace
Whether you have mild, moderate or severe OA, a knee brace may help to reduce pain by shifting your weight off the most damaged portion of the knee. These braces have hinges designed to push or pull the painful compartment of the knee open for relief. This will improve your mobility and help increase the distance you can walk comfortably. In most cases these braces will provide extra stability and improve balance for the wearer as well.
OA knee braces come in a variety of designs, but most are constructed with a combination of rigid and flexible materials — plastic, metal or other composite material for basic structure and support and mouldable foam for padding and positioning.
You may only need a light single upright brace to get an exceptional result. There are also dual upright braces available and if you have some severe malalignment or if you have an unusual shaped leg, custom bracing is also available.
In some Australian states there is government funding to assist with the cost of these braces, just ask your preferred clinician for more information.
oapl Thermic Knee Brace
Thermic Knee Braces
Thermic compression braces are designed to keep the knee joint and surrounding area warm and supported. With those affected by OA, heat can help to relax the muscles and in turn can provide some pain relief. These braces are usually knitted or made of neoprene (wetsuit material) and are circumferential in their design to provide a comforting, hugging sensation to the knee..
Orthotics
Orthotics are used to augment foot function and are designed to treat, adjust, support or accommodate various biomechanical foot disorders.
The most effective orthotics are custom-made as they are tailored to meet the specific needs of an individual. Custom orthotics are created using an impression of the foot (called a mould) which duplicates any misalignments in foot structure. Using the cast, scanning and computer technology, an orthotist will then create the foot orthoses to sit under your foot and support the muscles in your feet and legs. These orthotics can realign joints in the lower limbs and lead to decreases in knee, gluteal and lower back pain.
Flexiseq Osteoarthritis Gel
Creams, Topicals, Gels and Anti-inflammatory Tablets.
There are many topical creams and gels you can use for reducing the inflammation associated with knee OA. One you may not be familiar with is FlexiSeq, which is a gel containing very small particles to deliver bio-lubricating vesicles through the skin and directly into joints to coat the surface of the cartilage.
By reducing biomechanical stress and friction, Flexiseq reduces pain and restores joint function. This product does not use any active drugs and hence does not have associated side effects.
Oapl have a vast array of experience treating patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee.

Do you have Achilles Tendonitis?
04-02-2019 03:37:00
If you’re experiencing pain and stiffness along your Achilles area then chances are you may have Achilles Tendonitis. Achilles tendonitis is the inflammation of the Achilles tendon above the heel and can be caused by an increase in high impact activities such as running or jumping.
The Achilles tendon joins the calf muscle (Gastrocnemius) to the heel bone (Calcaneus) which is the largest and strongest tendon in the body; however, due to poor blood supply to the tendon, damage takes longer to heal than other soft tissue injuries.
Symptoms & Causes
Achilles tendonitis can present as pain anywhere along the tendon, localised warmth, mild swelling or pink/redness. Pain is intensified when you push up on your toes and lift your heel off the ground. This is due to the tendon contracting and being put under load. Achilles tendonitis is often worsened by:
An increase in usual running distance
Running uphill frequently which creates a repeated stretch on the Achilles tendon as the ankle is positioned in dorsi flexion (position where the toes point up towards the body)
Pronation and over pronation. This is when the foot rolls inwards and the arch of the foot collapses, this position increases the strain on the Achilles and can cause injury
Wearing high heels
Achilles tendonitis is a common overuse injury in athletes. The Achilles tendon can be put under stress from overuse of the calves in physical activities such as running and cycling. It is seen in runners who are doing excessive sprinting and speed work but not stretching enough when their calves are tight. Further to this, cyclists whom have their seat position too low are putting their Achilles tendon under stretch due to the foot and ankle being in a dorsiflexed position on the pedals.
Each time the Achilles tendonitis heals, it repairs with a small amount of scar tissue or adhesions. Adhesions will build up over multiple injuries to the Achilles tendon, making the tendon less flexible. Therefore, you should rest and treat the tendonitis as soon as possible. Here are some ways to prevent and treat Achilles tendonitis.
Treatment & Prevention
Stretching
It is important to always stretch the calves, hamstrings and Achilles to maintain strong and flexible leg muscles. One way to stretch the Achilles tendon is to stand with the knees very slightly bent, lean the body forward to reach for the floor. Take deep breaths in and as you exhale allow your body weight to move your torso closer to your knees and your hands will reach further towards your feet. You should feel an obvious stretch behind the knee. This is stretching the hamstrings and the calf muscles.
Another gentle stretch is keeping your feet and heels planted on the floor, shoulder-width apart whilst keeping the torso straight and upright, bend the knees forward. Aim to get your knees bending over the toes or further. This squatting position is stretching the Achilles nicely.
Footwear
If you have Achilles tendonitis, it is best to avoid wearing high heel as wearing heels puts the Achilles tendon in an excessively shortened position. This leads to premature tightness of the tendon and puts them at higher risk of tendon injury when you exercise. Ensure your running shoes are suitable for your foot type. It is important to wear shoes that support the foot and the motions made by the foot whilst running. If you are thinking of increasing your physical activity do it gradually to avoid stress or inflammatory injuries.
Heel Raises
In-shoe heel raises are suitable for pain relief in Achilles tendonitis. A heel raise is a wedge-shaped foam rubber insert, around 6-10mm in height and is placed in the shoe under the heel. Lifting the heel increases the ankle angle and slightly shortens the Achilles tendon to reduce the strain on the tendon. This allows the tendon to heal. You should also limit intense exercise when you have Achilles tendonitis to aid healing, as you risk putting impact and stress through the tendon which can increase the inflammatory response.

Treating Sever's Disease
24-01-2018 22:07:00
What is Sever’s disease?
Sever's Disease is a cause of heel pain in children. The disease occurs when the growth plate of the heel is repeatedly injured by excessive forces during adolescence. Typically, sever’s disease is common in physically active growing children. The growth spurt of adolescence commonly occurs anytime between 8-13 for girls and 10-15 for boys and generally, patients will describe a dull ache in the heel, particularly during activity
Common visual symptoms include limping or walking/running with an awkward gait pattern. Parents are usually the first to sight the symptoms, or invariably the child’s coach/teacher. At home, parents can check pain levels when the child rises on to their toes – it will invariably increase. The heel pain is commonly felt on one foot but can be bilateral.
OAPL Plantar Fasciitis Sock for Management of Sever’s Disease
Sever’s disease can be treated with a multifactorial approach. Shock absorption around the heel is paramount during both the early and long-term management of the problem. This helps to reduce the accumulative load on the painful region. Our Plantar Fascia support sock will provide appropriate pressure relief under the heel apparatus with our silicone heel cup. This is designed to provide a cushioned and elevated feel under the heel.
Overall, our sock has the capacity to elevate, compress and alleviate heel symptoms particularly in active children who suffer from sever’s disease. This treatment method would be recommended in addition to regularly icing, resting and stretching; in conjunction with wearing comfortable, well fitted shoes as prescribed by your allied health professional.
For more information on our Plantar Fasciitis Sock call us on 1300 866 275 to book an appointment in one of our clinics or view our online shop. Plus, for a limited time only save 30% when you buy 2 Plantar Fasciitis Socks.

RehaGait Mobile Gait Analysis Technology - Part 2
28-11-2017 04:23:00
Orthotics
Oapl introduces the RehaGait Analyzer - Part 2
We are excited to introduce the new RehaGait Mobile Gait Analysis System to our customers in Australia and New Zealand. RehaGait is a completely portable system that takes minutes to set up. In just moments, you can record, measure, analyse and report on one’s gait patterns which makes it ideal for clinical analysis on the go.
This blog takes you through the setup and application of the RehaGait. Remember, all you need is your subject and enough space to walk 8-10 steps.
Hints and tips:
Everything we talk about in this article has come from the manual, so if you’re having troubles with your unit, slow down and refer to the manual. Hasomed has provided this in-depth resource to ensure using the device is easy! However, there are some basic things that are easy to forget.
The RehaGait works on a Windows tablet so always ensure your tablet is fully charged before use. The battery life differs depending on the programs and functions you are using.
The Bluetooth Motion sensors have about 11 hours battery life and are charged using a micro USB which plugs into each of the sensor hard cases. Ensure these are always charged before your subject arrives in the clinic to avoid delays in charging them - this will minimise the chance of a sensor switching off during a gait cycle.
Don’t forget your patient safety. Patients with a high risk of falling are contraindicated for the use of this device. You as the clinician must identify if the patient is able to walk independently, with an aide, or with physical support.
In the case that you are supporting or holding your patient as they walk, we recommend you have a carry bag for the tablet whilst you are moving.
Application:
The Rehagait can be used with just the foot sensors or with all 7 sensors.
Shoes should be worn throughout gait recordings.
Shoes shouldn't have a heel height of more than 2 cm (Small/paediatric foot straps are available)
Foot sensors must be secured well.
If you are attaching the other five sensors make sure they are secured tightly, and the sensors are on the lateral aspect of the legs. Ensure the lower leg sensors are above the malleoli and the upper leg sensors are clear of the knee.
The sensors should be at the same height on both legs. The middle (hip) strap should sit over L4-L5 and be secure.
Connecting:
The software is intuitive and will prompt you through all processes.
Firstly, log in and set up subject details and notes if required. (We recommend you do this before the client arrives to save time and energy)
Required fields are name, height, gender, and shoe size.
Next, with your subject, attach the sensors and turn them on (power buttons on each of the hard Motion Sensor cases). The system will prompt you to connect the sensors to the tablet via Bluetooth. This can take a few seconds as the sensors register one by one.
The system will then prompt you to perform a calibration. This is a two-step process, the subject standing still for 10 secs then the subject has the option to sit or stand for their moving calibration where the torso needs to be tilted back and forth (15deg) and the legs need to be extended and swung forward 30 deg one by one. Only do this once or twice.
Once calibrated you are ready for measurement. Select to record your subject with video or without. The tablet can connect up to 20m away, however must be within 5 meters of the subject for the start and finish. Press start to begin measurement then count down “3,2,1 go”. At the end of the walking cycle the subject stops close to the tablet and waits 3 seconds before the “stop” button is pressed by the clinician.

The NEW oapl Plantar Fasciitis Sock
10-11-2017 04:33:00
OAPL is excited to launch our NEW Plantar Fasciitis Support sock! It has been designed in-house by our team of podiatrists to offer relief of plantar fascial symptoms, heel and arch pain, and ‘first step’ morning pain.
Designed with multizone compression to relieve swelling and discomfort, our new Plantar Fasciitis sock includes an innovative silicone heel cushion for pressure release and advanced cushioning in every step. Providing you with a product that serves as an all day, everyday management solution for a range of heel and foot conditions.
What is Plantar Fasciitis?
Plantar Fasciitis stands for ‘inflammation of the plantar fascia.’ The fascia runs along the bottom of the foot from the heel bone to the toes. It forms part of the arch of the foot and functions as one of our shock absorbing mechanisms. Unfortunately, the cellular makeup of the fascia is not as elastic as muscle tissue and is limited in its ability to elongate or stretch. Functionally, the cellular makeup of the tissue is prone to breakdown given too much traction placed on the fascia (for multiple reasons) leads to microtears, which in turn leads to irritation; inflammation and ultimately pain.
Symptoms wise, Plantar Fasciitis usually causes discomfort and pain in the heel region. Some people make experience arch pain. Both heel and arch pain discomfort are related to Plantar Fasciitis however pain experienced in the heel is far more common than arch pain.
Key features
Medical grade compression to reduce swelling and discomfort
Anatomic silicone heel insert built into the sock to relieve and elevate the heel
Machine washable, breathable fabric
Can be worn with or without footwear
Other uses:
Chronic sore feet when standing for long periods
Elderly patients suffering from fat pad atrophy in the heel
Sever’s disease
Sock Care:
The Plantar Fasciitis Support Sock is made from a combination of polyamide, elastane, polyurethane, and cotton. The polyester insert is made from silicone. To ensure correct care of the sock, it is recommended that our sock is hand washed in cool water. The sock should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct heat or sunlight. It is not suitable for bleaching, ironing, or tumble drying.
Sizing
For more information on our new Plantar Fasciitis Sock, you can view the product on our online shops. Alternatively, feel free to call us on 1300 866 275 or email us at info@oapl.com.au

MotionSensors
The RehaGait Analyzer is equipped with 7 inertial sensors, which record spatio-temporal specific parameters during walking and running. The accuracy is clinically valid according to the gold standard and has been published several times in scientific studies (Schwesig et al., 2010, Donath et al., 2016).
The motion sensors are attached at 7 points; around the waist, above the knees, above the ankles and on the proximal, lateral aspect of the foot or shoe.
The motion sensors connect via Bluetooth to the tablet software and can be read from up to 20m away.
These sensors utilise the inertia of the mass to detect movement changes. The inertial sensors consist of a three-axis accelerometer for recording the linear acceleration, a three-axis gyroscope for recording the angular velocity and a three-axis magnetometer for recording the earth's magnetic field.
What data will I receive after a 10 step cycle?
The analysis of the therapy progression may take some seconds depending on the number of measurement since the measurements are recalculated. After a successful analysis, you will find the flow charts sorted by parameter group. The course of parameters is shown as score model. The recorded value is compared with a maximum of 1.0 to the reference value median of the corresponding parameter. The individual measurement sessions are indicated on the horizontal scale and the corresponding score points are linked to a regression line. Thus, increasing straight lines between the measurement session points show an improvement of the parameter. The selection box allows you to use predefined groups to select gait parameters. The following parameter groups are available here:
Kinematics
The kinematics of the individual steps are displayed for such parameters as foot height, ground clearance, circumduction, velocity and acceleration. The representation of the left side is displayed in blue and for the right side in red. The mean value band (brightened hue of the respective side) represents the respective minimum and maximum of each step, the line representing the corresponding mean value. With the right selection box, you can also display the individual steps next to each other. A grey band in the background represents a reference range that is calculated for each percent in the gait cycle from the respective 5th to 95th percentile of a healthy reference group.
Comparison, a Means of Justification
RehaGait analysis software uses a database for patient management and storage of measurements and analysis results. In this way, the user has at any time access to older measurements in order to compare them to each other or to present and evaluate the therapy progress parameters.
Compare interventions:
Efficiently compare a patient without the device, then with a device or vice versa. Show your patient before and after videos of them walking with different devices and compare which device creates the most aesthetic gait pattern versus the most functional gait pattern.
Reporting Back to a Referrer
The system gives the practitioner the ability to export information and send to referrers or other practitioners working in a multidisciplinary sense. To report your results, you can create and print a report. The report is created for the analysed measurement of the selected patient. If you have analysed two measurements for a comparison, both measurements are shown in the report.

3D Scanning for Plagiocephaly Helmet Therapy
11-10-2017 02:24:00
Orthotics
Oapl would like to introduce Liam, Senior Orthotist from our Sunshine Paediatric and Flemington clinics.
Liam has been treating children with Deformational Plagiocephaly for 8 years and has previously spent over 3 years at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne learning and developing treatment methods for paediatric patients. He has seen the development of new technologies such as 3D scanning systems and foam carving replace the old and dated plaster mould methods. Here is Liam describing the process of developing plagiocephaly helmets and the technology used in our oapl clinics…..
"Now In my fourth year treating across a range of oapl clinics, I am very excited to introduce the STARband® system from Orthomerica. This is a non-invasive and supremely accurate treatment method used to fabricate a cranial remodeling helmet. The process begins with an initial scan, which only takes minutes to complete and is done by taking a series of still photographs with a Samsung phone camera. There is no radiation or lasers and as such the process is pain free and relatively stress free for both the child and parent.
Once the scan is taken, a 3D image is generated and can be modified and viewed on a PC. The Measurement and Comparison Unit (MCU) is a state-of-the-art software package that an orthotist can use to provide concise and objective measurements of a child's head shape. Whether treating conservatively, with a helmet or just monitoring for growth, the MCU will show comparative changes in growth and symmetry. Using the MCU software a pdf report can be generated to clearly illustrate changes over time which can be communicated with parents and other health professionals.
The STARband® has been used to treat over 300,000 patients in the USA and is only available in Australia through oapl. We currently offer a wide range of cranial remolding orthosis designs, each created to effectively manage a variety of head shape deformities, levels of severity, and clinical indications. Treatment with a remodeling helmet usually begins at around 6 months of age and takes around 3-4 months depending on the patients age and severity. Due to the precise nature of the scan, a custom fabricated helmet ensures accurate fitting and enables much more symmetrical growth than alternative fabrication methods.
We are continually finding more and more clinical evidence that supports the positive results of helmet therapy. In 2015 Steinberg et al in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal showed that conservative and helmet therapy were both found to be effective in the correction of plagiocephaly. The usage of a helmet eliminated the factors that lead to failure in conservative management and may be more preferable from the outset. It was also highlighted that any delay in helmeting due to trialing conservative treatment does not ruin the chance of future correction as long as the helmet therapy is begun during growth stages at around 6-8 months of age."
For more information on the STARband® range and our clinical services please contact us. Alternatively, you can read more about Plagiocephaly here: http://www.oapl.com.au/plagiocephaly-helmet-therapy

Overcoming the odds

Meet Len Elliot, the first ever above knee amputee to pass the QLD Police Force Functional Capacity Test
Len Elliot is a Queensland Police Officer that was hit by a motorcycle during an RBT on the 14th April 2014 on the Sunshine Coast. The motorcycle was travelling at 180 km/h and the impact resulted in Len becoming an above knee amputee.
Such a life changing event would have made many people think of a career change. However, Len is not like most people.
The first prosthesis was fitted to Len in October of 2014, he could walk with the prosthesis however felt that he was not reaching his full potential.
In March 2016, a new team began working with Len. The new team was comprised of Saul Geffen (Rehabilitation Specialist), Jacqui O’Sullivan (Physiotherapist) and the team at OAPL prosthetics in Brisbane. Working closely with Gabriel form Work Cover and Sue form the Queensland Police a new plan was established.
A new prosthesis was fitted and a new gait training program commenced. Len experienced an immediate improvement. He became more active, started running and cycling again. The improvement was so great that he began competing regularly in triathlons towards the end of 2016.
On the 7th of March 2017, Len Elliot became the first above knee amputee to pass the Functional Capacity Test in Queensland, a requirement if he is to return to active duty in the Police force.
Undoubtedly the effort has come predominately from himself, however as Len stated, he has not worked in ‘isolation” and this achievement would not have been possible without the support from the professionals he began with early in 2016.
We wish you all the best in your future endeavours Len and congratulations on your amazing achievements so far!

YPSILON FLOW
Ypsilon Flow is the foot drop AFO of choice for your active patients who need sagittal plane assist.
It is designed to allow optimum range of motion and dynamic toe-off assist, providing the opportunity for functional or potentially functional muscles, tendons and ligaments to strengthen and prevent or reduce atrophy.
The footplate is engineered to allow the orthosis to adapt to and move with the lower leg with less resistance to ground reaction forces. The proximal ends of the “Y” provide fixation points, eliminating pressure on the tibia crest.
Recommended application:
Foot drop in combination with no spasticity to moderate spasticity. Limb proprioception deficit and mild proximal deficit.
Contraindications:
Severe edema, leg ulcers, moderate to severe spasticity, medial-lateral instability.
Other:
Interface and strap included. More information about product selection and customisation can be found below.
Please note the Original Ypsilon is still available for you current users.
More Information
Ypsilon FLOW
Ypsilon® Flow is the newest member of the ToeOFF family of products. It’s the AFO of choice for active patients with foot drop and no other ankle or proximal deficits. The increased range of motion accommodates different terrain and longer strides. The new geometry design provides a dynamic response for foot lift without restricting or immobilising normal joint or muscle activity. A gradual heel rise allows for an intimate fit in the patient’s shoe. It is OAPL's goal to provide dynamic response AFOs without limiting function. Call customer service for more information today.
