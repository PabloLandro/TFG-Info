Last Updated: January 6, 2019
Usually, most of the pimples leave a scar behind. When the acne infection reaches the dermis layer, it destroys the skin tissue which becomes a scar. Most of the acne scars are stubborn and they take quite some time to fade away completely. However, there are ways you can speed up the healing process. These great home remedies can be really effective for acne scars.
Though, home remedies may not lighten the scars overnight, you can observe the difference in few weeks. Lemon, honey, aloe vera and coconut oil are some of the ingredients you can try. In this article, we will learn about lemon for acne scars.

Have used bleaching cosmetic products for long and whenever I try to stop my skin get back to worse especially my face and neck, so on my 1month leavebi decided to stay home and get rid of this chemicals in my body .i got a lot of online adviced on how to deal with damaged skin by chemical. First i had to go natural, and yes with this natural way it helped me manage it in a short period. I couldn’t go out coz my face was terrible . at this point i avoided lemon coz i had rushes alover so I went for fresh aloe vera gel I had a plant in my backyard, i applied morning and night, also went for natural honey. Though my face isn’t that bad, but am Happy am going back to my natural skin. Recently i discovered the magi of lemon and coconut oils.. Men!!this working miraculous. Am 28 am being confused with 18yrs gal.. It bleaches naturally. No more leopard like face, scars and spots have completely gone. Leaving smooth young looks on. Me., also same procedure has cleared my legs , hands and boobs stretch marks , i mix one lemon and some drops of coconut oils and apply it to whole body and leave it overnight. You can as well try this, but remember what worked for me can fail in you.. So try different method till you get which suits you. Thanx to the advices given here. I don’t spend a lot of money again to buy expensive cosmetic which damaged my looks.

It is really difficult to tell the exact time as everyone’s skin is difficult. Don’t lose hope and repeat the application regularly. Avoid using lemon juice in the morning, as after applying lemon juice, if you head out in the sun, it can make the skin worse. So apply during night times.

It is difficult to tell the exact time as everyone has different skin tone and healing capacity. So be patient and apply regularly until you achieve the results. People with sensitive skin should be careful with the application, as the burning sensation caused by lemon can be harsh. If you are not able to handle the irritation avoid lemon method and try other remedies.

Hormonal imbalance is the main reason behind acne. So apart following the lemon juice application daily, consume diet rich in vitamin C, A and B, exfoliate regularly to clean the clogged pores, drink plenty of water to flush out toxins and exercise regularly.

You can treat the root cause of the problem to prevent new breakouts. As pimples can be caused due to many factors, the first thing is to observe the trigger like whether it is oily skin, nutrition deficiency or any other medical problem. Meanwhile eat a nutrition food rich in vitamins, zinc and potassium. Reduce stress levels and drink plenty of water to flush out toxins.

There are two tests to determine whether your skin type is sensitive or not. First one includes brushing your fingers across the side of the face with light-medium pressure. If the skin turns red then you have a sensitive skin. For deeper skin tone persons, this test may not be effective in determining so easily. So, they can try the second test. Apply lemon juice or any ingredient on a small area of the skin, if you observe stinging or redness, then you have a sensitive skin.

As your skin type is dry, lemon may not be suitable for your skin as it can dry out the skin further. We recommend following the routine mentioned in this article http://homeremediesforlife.com/skin-lightening/ for achieving the results.

Yes, if the application is not causing any unbearable burning sensation then you can leave it overnight.

It is difficult to tell the exact time as everyone’s skin is different. So, try the process regularly until you achieve the results. However, you can observe the improvement in 3 – 4 weeks of time.

Nope. Lemon may cause burning sensation if the skin is too sensitive.

Yes, it is ok to use it daily until the breakout clears completely. If you are experiencing any dryness then you can apply moisturizer but make sure it is non-comedogenic and oil-free.

I have used lemon juice and it has been wonderful. My question was will lime juice work the same way? For my moisturizer or mask I use coconut oil, vitamin e and tea tree oil. Tea tree oil and vitamin e have worked so well I had to add the carrier oil because tea tree dries when it heals. Another thing I’ve used if I dont have lemons is witch hazel my mask at night after witch hazel is blended oatmeal with coconut oil then mix with honey. The last thing which not so good for scars but works well for circles around my eyes is potato juice. Cut a free small pieces, ninja blend juice what ever gets the most juice out then pour through a small strainer or cheese cloth over clean cup use cotton to dab on your eyes use on you face if choose. Its vitamin a a lot cheaper than retinol products

After 5 – 6 hours of lemon juice treatment you can apply moisturizer or any other cream. Leaving lemon juice will not burn the skin, it may dry your skin. If you can add rosewater into lemon juice and leave it overnight, it will not dry out the skin and provides effective results as well.
