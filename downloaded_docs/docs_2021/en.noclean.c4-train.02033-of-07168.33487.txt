The Weird Way Milk Hurts Your Bones
New research sheds some pretty interesting light on dairy.

It may be time to get a new source of calcium. While milk is the poster child of strong bones, research from Sweden suggests that this form of dairy might not be the ultimate protection against osteoporosis we all thought it was. In the study, published in the British Medical Journal, women who drank three to five glasses of milk per day were at higher risk for bone fracture and even death than women who drank less than one per day.
The sugar content of milk may be to blame: The drink is especially high in lactose and galactose, two types of dairy sugar—and previous animal studies have linked dairy sugar to oxidative stress and inflammation. In this study, researchers found that regular milk drinkers had more biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.

Before you throw out all of your milk, keep in mind that the researchers say these findings should be interpreted with caution because this was not a clinical experiment. The findings were based on a survey of 61,433 women and 45,339 men. That being said, there are plenty of milk replacements that don't come with this potential risk:
Fermented Milk and Cheese
The researchers found that fermented milk—or kefir—had the opposite effect of regular milk: It decreased the risk of fracture or death. They found that whereas milk was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk factors (low HDL cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and higher insulin resistance), fermented milk and cheese had the opposite effect on these characteristics.
While fermented milk has plenty of other benefits (such as balancing out your gut bacteria), keep in mind that unless it's organic and humanely raised, it can have similar antibiotic and hormonal pitfalls as regular milk. Same goes with cheese.
Milk Alternatives
There are so many choices on the market today: rice milk, almond milk, hemp milk, and coconut milk, just to name a few.
Food
If you want to avoid milk altogether, there are plenty of foods that can give you the same—if not an even greater—dose of calcium. While whole milk has 118 grams of calcium per 100 gram serving, chickpeas have 150 grams, collard greens have 203 grams, almonds have 234 grams, and sesame seeds have 1,160 grams.
