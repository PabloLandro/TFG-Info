Abstract: (1063 Views)
Background: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) predisposes the human body to a variety of chronic diseases.
Objectives: This study, for the first time, aimed to assess the effects of Fermented Camel Milk (FCM), a functional dairy food, on the obesity measures and blood pressure of adolescents with MetS.
Methods: This was a crossover, randomized, double-blind trial. We enrolled overweight or obese adolescents, aged 11-18 years, meeting the diagnostic criteria for MetS. We randomly assigned the study participants to receive FCM 250 mL per day for 8 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout, then, consuming Diluted Cow Yogurt (DCY) 250 mL per day for 8 weeks, or the reverse sequence. General and abdominal obesity measures consisting of weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI z-score, Waist Circumference (WC), Hip Circumference (HC), waist to height ratio and Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (SBP, DBP) were measured before and after each of the 4 periods. A three-day food record and physical activity questionnaire were completed before each period. Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab and SPSS considering the significance level of 0.05.
Results: Twenty-four participants with the Mean±SD age of 13.77±1.87 years (age range: 10.45-16.25 years) (58% girls) completed the study. It resulted in nonsignificant mean changes (increase or decrease) in weight of -0.67 kg (95%CI: -1.97; 0.61; P=0.28), BMI (-0.10 kg/m2, 95%CI: -0.65; 0.45; P=0.70), BMI z-score of -0.06 (95%CI: -0.33; 0.19; P=0.59), WC of -1.10 cm (95%CI: -3.22; 1.01; P=0.29), and HC of -0.12 cm (95%CI: -2.04; 1.79; P=0.89) by FCM consumption in comparison to DCY. The study also resulted in non-significant mean reduction in DBP of -4.45 mm Hg (95%CI: -10.04; 1.12; P=0.11).
Conclusions: According to some positive impacts of FCM on obesity measures and blood pressure, we suggest conducting further studies to validate the clinical impacts of fermented camel milk.
