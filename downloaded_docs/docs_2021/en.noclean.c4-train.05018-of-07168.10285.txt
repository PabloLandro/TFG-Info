Warts? Here's an at-home Remedy.
by Liz 1:26 AM

Over the counter salicylic acid treatments have a 75 percent success rate at exfoliating warts away in six weeks. But you'll be surprised that a more effective and faster treatment may actually be in your toolbox. In a recent study, a duct tape was found to be 85% effective at removing warts in just 28 days. The adhesive slightly irritates the wart and the skin around it, triggering the body to attack and remove the unsightly lump.
To do: Simply cover the wart with a bit of duct tape for six days. Then remove the tape, soak the area in warm water for 10 minutes and rub it gently with a pumice stone. Leave it uncovered overnight, then cover again in the morning to kick-off the next six day cycle.

Surprisingly, this works for corns on dog feet, too! Most breeds can get corns and don't turn a hair but they can make a greyhound dead lame. Duct tape does seem to work well - not 100% of the time, but it's a great cure for some!

This is good to know. Surprising but as long as it works, I'll keep it in mind.
