Alzheimers Home > L-Theanine and Breastfeeding
Until more information is available about the safety of L-theanine, breastfeeding women are advised to avoid using the supplement. Although many people assume that "natural" products are safe, that is not always the case. Before taking L-theanine, breastfeeding women should talk to their healthcare providers about the benefits and potential risks in their particular situation.
An Overview of L-Theanine and Breastfeeding
It is not known whether L-theanine (also known as just theanine) is safe for use in breastfeeding women. L-theanine is a dietary supplement that is sometimes used to treat anxiety or numerous other conditions. Until more information is available, it is probably a good idea to avoid L-theanine while breastfeeding. Although L-theanine is an amino acid, it is not essential to human nutrition and should not be assumed to be safe just because it is an amino acid.
Is L-Theanine Safe for Breastfeeding Women?
At this time, there is no information available to suggest that L-theanine is safe (or unsafe) for breastfeeding women. Although it is a "natural" product, this does not necessarily mean that it is safe for use during breastfeeding. Many women try to avoid medications while breastfeeding and turn to herbal remedies as an alternative, assuming that "natural" automatically means "safe." However, natural products can be quite toxic. For instance, many poisons and toxins are natural products. It just does not make sense to use an herbal supplement for which there is no information available about safety during breastfeeding.
Talking With Your Healthcare Provider About L-Theanine and Breastfeeding
You should talk with your healthcare provider about L-theanine and breastfeeding. Each woman's situation is different, and you and your healthcare provider understand your situation best. After considering what you want and expect, as well as your current health situation, you and your healthcare provider can make a shared decision about L-theanine and breastfeeding in your particular situation.
