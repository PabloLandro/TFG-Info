Info on Sumatriptan/Naproxen Sodium
If you get migraine headaches, your healthcare provider may recommend a drug called sumatriptan/naproxen sodium (Treximet™). This prescription product is a combination of two different drugs:
Sumatriptan (which belongs to a group of medications known as triptans)
Naproxen sodium (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID).
It comes in tablet form and is taken as soon as possible once the migraine starts. This medication is not designed to prevent migraines, and it is approved for use in adults only.
Because this product is not suitable for everyone, make sure to review the prescribing information on sumatriptan/naproxen sodium before starting treatment. For example, you may not be able to use this drug if you have certain medical conditions, such as heart disease or problems with your kidneys. Also, let your healthcare provider know if you are currently taking any other medications, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
(For more info, including a discussion on how this medication works, click Sumatriptan/Naproxen Sodium.)
