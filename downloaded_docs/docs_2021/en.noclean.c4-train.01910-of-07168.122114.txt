In fact, there are dozens and dozens of different pathways that can produce the physiological effects and cumbersome symptoms of throbbing cranial pain. Taking this into consideration, how is it even possible to get a headache? And what is a headache? Where does the pain come from? Headaches can occur on one side of the head a cluster headache , all over the head, or in one specific, acute location. So taking into consideration the fact that headaches are the result of inflamed tissue or blood vessels in the cranial region, how do conventional OTC over-the-counter drugs work to make them go away?
These makes them effective options for the onset of headaches, which as we just discussed, are the result of inflamed tissues and blood vessels in the region surrounding the head and neck.
Functionally, the drugs work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are inflammation-inducing substances produced by the body that are released as a response to illness or injury. This is why ibuprofen is also a good fever-reducing OTC medication.
In addition to their inflammatory roles in the cranial region, prostaglandins are important for dilating blood vessels in the kidneys. Thus, when you take prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs like ibuprofen especially on a daily basis , you drastically increase the chance of developing chronic kidney conditions such as ischemia, which is the accumulation of dead tissue in the kidney from lack of blood flow. In fact, acetaminophen drugs pose even more of a long-term threat to liver functioning than does ibuprofen; an FDA advisory committee has actually released statements in the past which propose that limits be set on acetaminophen due to their high risk of liver damage when taken frequently.
In short, while headache-relieving OTC drugs are generally safe when taken sporadically, they can cause very real and serious health conditions when relied on on a frequent basis.
Also, the onset of severe headaches can cause a host of other physiological conditions as well, including:. But how true is this, if at all? Is it just another myth drummed up by all the potheads who claim cannabis to be some kind of miracle worker?
Well, instead of relying on opinion or anecdotal evidence to answer this question, we can rely on science and physiology to do the speculating for us hooray for science! The endocannabinoid system, or ECS, is a massive network of cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors that exists naturally in the human body.
Cannabinoid receptors have been found to exist in virtually every single cell and tissue type in the human body, including the vast network of nerves, muscles, and soft tissues in the cranial region. Thus, in the case of headaches which remember is the result of inflammation in structures of the head and neck , CBD interacts with localized ECS receptors to either A revert neurochemical release back to appropriate levels, or B reduce headache-inducing inflammation in acute muscles, tissues, and blood vessel networks.
Fortunately, there has actually been a fair amount of research and published studies on cannabis and the physiological role of CBD for headaches.
