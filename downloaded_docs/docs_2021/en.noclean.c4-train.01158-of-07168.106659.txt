Does Selenium Prevent Esophageal Cancer?
Selenium is an essential mineral, but it also is a component of antioxidants, essential cancer-fighting tools. Selenium supplements are being studied to see if they can help prevent cancer.

Selenium is a mineral, like calcium and iron, and the body needs these minerals to stay healthy; selenium is necessary, for example, for proper thyroid function and a healthy immune system.
How to Be Supplement Savvy
But selenium also has antioxidant properties. In this role, it may help reduce the damage to cells that can lead to cancer. Selenium, which is taken from the soil, occurs naturally in many foods, including nuts, vegetables, bread, and certain meats.
It also comes in supplement form, and researchers have been examining the role selenium supplements may play in preventing certain types of cancers, including esophageal cancer. So far, it’s not promising news: The U.S. National Cancer Institute includes selenium on a list of supplements which have not been shown to be effective in cancer prevention. Research into the use of supplements in cancer prevention is ongoing.
Digesting Selenium Research Results
Selenium is thought to help protect cells from the damage that can lead to the development of cancer, boost the body’s immune response, and prevent the growth of abnormal cells. Studies have shown a reduced risk for a number of certain cancers — prostate, colorectal, and lung — among people with higher levels of selenium in their blood.
A recent lab study showed that combining selenium and zinc may inhibit the growth and multiplication of esophageal cancer cells.
Researchers in China studied health data from people who had esophageal cancer and compared the information with people who were cancer-free. They found a correlation between those who ate foods higher in selenium and lower rates of esophageal cancer. The researchers concluded that selenium supplementation could help protect against esophageal cancer, particularly for people who do not have enough selenium in their diet.
A recent analysis out of the Netherlands found similar results. It reviewed extensive data on 120,852 middle-aged adults and found that those with higher selenium levels — as demonstrated by tests of their toenail clippings — were less likely to develop esophageal cancer. Study results showed that women, people who had never smoked, and those who generally had low intakes of antioxidants were most likely to benefit from selenium supplementation.
Scientists have observed that cancer rates are lower where there are higher levels of selenium in the soil, suggesting a tenuous link between the presence of selenium in the food supply and cancer risk.
Common Questions About Diet and Cancer
How Much Selenium to Take
Food sources can provide the daily recommended amount of selenium, which is 70 micrograms (mcg) per day. Cancer prevention has been linked to supplemental levels as high as 200 mcg.
You may be at risk for low levels of selenium if you smoke, use birth control pills, drink alcohol, or have health problems such as Crohn’s disease that make it hard to absorb the nutrition you need from your food.
There are some risks to taking too much selenium — over 400 mcg for adults — per day, including:
Hair loss
Fatigue
Irritability
Mild nerve damage
White blotchy nails
Mild garlicky odor to the breath
At least one study has suggested that taking more than the recommended daily levels of selenium could increase other health condition risks, such as diabetes.
Being healthy means eating a healthy and varied diet, and selenium, regardless of whether it prevents esophageal cancer, is a necessary component of a healthy diet. So if you are eating well, know that you probably are getting enough of this essential mineral in your diet.
