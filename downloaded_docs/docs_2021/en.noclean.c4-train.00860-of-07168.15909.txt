I have a cold, and I don’t think “starve a cold, feed a fever” means you should go hungry when you have a cold, and eat when you have a fever. I think it means that if you don’t eat when you have a cold, you are increasing the chance you will become even more ill by weakening yourself. That is to say, if you starve a cold, then you feed a fever. So I’m going to go have a bowl of soup or something.

I think it’s the other way ’round Dave….Feed a cold and starve a fever….at least that’s how I’ve always done it…(and I rarely ever get a fever…which is convenient)

Shirley: If I’m right, then it works both ways.
