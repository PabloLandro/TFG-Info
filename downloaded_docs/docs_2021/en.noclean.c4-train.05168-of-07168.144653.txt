You have already helped us learn:
Lithium carbonate wasn't helping ALS patients, and we learned it faster than the clinical trials did. Read about it in Nature.
Insomnia is more common—in fact worse—for people with chronic conditions. Read about it on the blog.
Interacting with other PatientsLikeMe members improves your health. Read it on healthaffairs.org.
The severity of Parkinson's Disease symptoms changes faster than researchers thought, so clinical trials should be designed differently. Read about it on JMIR.

What is iron deficiency anemia?
Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of microcytic anemia (anemia characterized by small red blood cells). It occurs when the dietary intake or absorption of iron is insufficient, and hemoglobin, which contains iron, cannot be formed.
