What is Imitrex?
Imitrex (sumatriptan) is a headache medicine that narrows blood vessels around the brain. Imitrex also reduces substances in the body that can trigger headache pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and other migraine symptoms.
Imitrex is used to treat migraine headaches. Imitrex will only treat a headache that has already begun. It will not prevent headaches or reduce the number of attacks.
Imitrex should not be used to treat a common tension headache, a headache that causes loss of movement on one side of your body, or any headache that seems to be different from your usual migraine headaches. Use this medication only if your condition has been confirmed by a doctor as migraine headaches.
Imitrex may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
Important information about Imitrex
You should not use Imitrex if you are allergic to sumatriptan, if you have any history of heart disease, or if you have coronary heart disease, angina, blood circulation problems, lack of blood supply to the heart, uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe liver disease, ischemic bowel disease, a history of a heart attack or stroke, or if your headache seems to be different from your usual migraine headaches.
Do not use Imitrex within 24 hours before or after using another migraine headache medicine, including sumatriptan injection, almotriptan (Axert), eletriptan (Relpax), frovatriptan (Frova), rizatriptan (Maxalt), naratriptan (Amerge), zolmitriptan (Zomig), or ergot medicine such as dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), ergotamine (Ergomar, Cafergot, Migergot), dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), or methylergonovine (Methergine).

How should I use Imitrex?
Use Imitrex exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Overuse of migraine headache medicine can actually make your headaches worse.
Use Imitrex as soon as you notice headache symptoms, or after an attack has already begun.
Your doctor may want to give your first dose of this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting to see if you have any serious side effects.
Take one Imitrex tablet whole with a full glass of water. Do not split the tablet.
After taking a tablet: If your headache does not completely go away, or goes away and comes back, take a second tablet two (2) hours after the first. Do not take more than 200 mg of sumatriptan oral tablets in 24 hours. If your symptoms have not improved, contact your doctor before taking any more tablets.
Imitrex nasal spray comes with patient instructions for safe and effective use. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. Blow your nose to clear your nasal passages before using the nasal spray. Try not to sneeze or blow your nose just after using the spray.
After using the Imitrex nasal spray: If your headache does not completely go away after using the spray, call your doctor before using a second spray of Imitrex. If your headache goes away and then comes back, you may use a second spray if it has been at least two hours since you used the first spray. Do not use more than 40 mg of sumatriptan nasal spray in 24 hours. If your symptoms do not improve, contact your doctor before using any more sprays.
Contact your doctor if you have more than four headaches in one month (30 days).
Store Imitrex at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.
