My Current Vitiligo Treatment Plan
What I’m Doing to Treat My Vitiligo
Updated March 4, 2015 – You can see photos of my progress here.
Supplements I’m Currently Taking
I am currently on a Nutritional Balancing Program, so I take a number of supplements that are specific to my individual needs. Included in these are Zinc, Vitamin D, PABA, B-Vitamins (including extra B-12 methylcobalamin since I have a genetic mutation that makes it difficult for me to methylate B12), fish oil, and probiotics. I DO NOT take copper. I think the zinc has been very instrumental to my progress.
I have taken the Merry Clinic Treatment Program – which I started on August 10, 2013. It’s designed to treat and control vitiligo by balancing your immune system from the inside while stimulating re-pigmentation of the skin from the outside. I stayed with this treatment for about 5 months, and it did seem that my spots slowed down, but they continued to spread.
I have also heard good things about Kalawalla – it was actually recommended to me by my holistic doctor. He told me that one of his colleagues was having good results with his vitiligo patients. I thought I’d mention it here if any of you would like to give it a shot. You can read more about it here.
I ultimately decided to stop the Merry Clinic and go with Nutritional Balancing.
Sunlight and Skin Oil
I’ve decided that it’s about time to get serious about getting some sun on my spots. I’ve been off and on with it, and I didn’t see any results so I stopped. But now, I am suddenly getting lots of freckling! I know I probably should have stuck with the sun exposure from the beginning, but I was confused and lost. So many things I read said to stay out of the sun. So if you’re reading this, get yourself some good protective skin oil (like Dr. Wanakee’s below) that also increases the photo-sensitivity of the skin – and get some sun on those spots!
I have been sitting in the sun consistently for a couple of weeks now, at least three times a week for 15-30 minutes at a time – whatever I have the time for.
Up to about two weeks ago, I had been using Vitiliax skin oil with sun exposure to start regaining some pigment with pretty good results as you can see here.
However, I ran out of the oil and decided to instead use Dr. Wanakee Hill’s boosting oil and cream. (NOT an affiliate link).
I’ve gotten REALLY good results with hers! You can see in the picture to the left, all the little dark pigment spots starting around the edges of the white spot on my shin and also in the middle of it. And in the picture to the right, you can see that it has started to fill in.
I will continue using Dr. Hill’s oil and lotion from here on out. Plus, hers contains some good protective oils that help protect your skin from sun damage (as I mentioned above), so you can sun your spots without worrying that you are harming yourself ;).
I have also grown VERY fond of TheraNeem’s entire line of skin creams, soaps, and lotions . I have terribly itchy skin, especially in the wintertime that NO lotion can relieve.
This ThereNeem is unbelievable. It stops the itchiness instantly and give your skin a nice, tight hydrated look. I have to be honest – since neem is an anti-fungal, it smells kinda funky – has a bit of a garlicky after-smell. The vanilla cream (affiliate link) has the best smell and works the best. It’s my favorite!
The really fantastic thing about neem is that it is very high in Quercetin. Quercitin has both antifungal and antioxidant properties. It actually can protect the skin from UVB damage – which is great if you are sunning your spots.
What I’m Eating
I am no longer following the Paleo Autoimmune protocol, but I do something very similar called Nutritional Balancing . Click here to read about the FREE program. I have also discontinued green smoothies.
1. No Dairy
I have eliminated all dairy products from my diet, with the exception of grass fed butter and raw milk cheese. I have also limited the amount of animal protein I consume, which means I eat poached egg for breakfast, and a 3oz portion of chicken, turkey, or beef for lunch and dinner. I also limit my red meat consumption to no more than twice a week so that I don’t raise my homocysteine levels.
High quality protein is important for the proper function of the thyroid, and also red meat specifically helps prevent the accumulation of copper – which leads to copper overload and is an enormous problem today. I am trying to get my copper overload under control as we speak (one symptom of copper toxicity in women is PMS anxiety and migraines). So since these are my issues, I know I need high quality protein to heal. Which brings me to my next point…
There is a lot of talk about vegan diets possibly being helpful to vitiligo, but I will never go vegan. Vegan diets are problematic for a number of reasons, but the main problems in relation to vitiligo are that vegan diets are very low in zinc (since animal protein is the main source of zinc). Zinc maintains gut wall integrity and prevents leaky gut, is essential for proper immune response, is anti-inflammatory, helps prevent copper accumulation in the body, and helps maintain healthy skin. You can read a great article on why vegan diets aren’t all they’re cracked up to be here.
2. No Gluten
This is a controversial one. Some feel there is a definite connection, and some feel there is not. Xichao Mo is not convinced there is a a connection, and he was able to reverse his vitiligo without avoiding it. Also, Caroline H. did not completely avoid gluten, and managed to completely repigment despite continuing to eat gluten occasionally.
However, Dr. Wanakee Hill stresses the importance of avoiding gluten when you have vitiligo because of the connection between vitiligo and celiac. There’s also stories like this one that show a definite link between gluten and vitiligo. Because of this, I have personally chosen to avoid gluten.
One thing about gluten that I have recently learned is that a person can have an issue with gluten itself, but also gluten causes a secondary allergy due to the gut wall damage it causes. So this means that you can start becoming allergic to many different things…which was what was happening to my three year old son. He doesn’t have vitiligo, but I keep him away from gluten for these reasons. He was becoming allergic to everything, he almost couldn’t eat without breaking out in a rash or hives. But once I eliminated gluten all of that went away.
Food allergies are often implicated in vitiligo, so it’s something I really pay close attention to.
3. Lots of Cooked Vegetables
Vegetables, specifically cooked vegetables, are absolutely vital for your body to detoxify, and most of us don’t get nearly enough. They are also very high in folate, another nutrient those with vitiligo are shown to be deficient in.
4. Juicing
I juice 6-7 carrots daily, which gives me 10-12 oz of juice. Carrots are high in antioxidants that protect the skin from sunburn, which is very helpful with re-pigmentation. Also, juicing extracts all of the vitamins and digestive enzymes into an easy to drink liquid. The primary advantage to doing this is that it requires absolutely no digestion at all. Your body can just immediately absorb the vitamins and nutrients it needs. You can read my article about carrot juice here.
Detox Procedures
I am currently focusing on detoxing my liver, kidneys, and skin. For liver, I drink carrot juice daily along with coffee retention enemas. For my skin, I use an infrared sauna for 30-40 minutes before bed. I also brush my skin with a dry skin brush when I wake every morning to help lymphatic drainage.
Cosmetics
Eliminate Chemical-Laden Cosmetics/Toiletries
I have eliminated almost all chemical-laden cosmetics and toiletries. I now use coconut oil as my body lotion and Truly’s natural deodorant with coconut oil. It’s fantastic! I’ve tried the “natural deodorants” like Tom’s of Maine and Nature’s Gate, but I always stink by the end of the day. You can also make your own very similar version, it’s very easy to do. Here’s the recipe I used.
Minimize Make-up
When I need to wear make-up, I just wear mascara and a natural lip gloss like Burt’s Bees. As far as foundation, you can try Aubrey Organics mineral foundation or any of 100% Pure’s products. I hear good things about them. The good thing about eating really healthy is that it tremendously improves your complexion, often to the point that you don’t need much make-up at all.
Household Cleaners
I had already been using a natural laundry detergent for years, so I didn’t have to change much here. No more fabric softener…instead, I just add vinegar to my final rinse to dissolve any soap residue that may be left on my clothing.
Exercise
Exercise is very important for healthy blood circulation. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), blood circulation is a problem for vitiligo patients. I workout 3-4 times per week with barre workouts. They are my favorite because they are moderate in intensity and low-impact. Overexertion or high intensity exercise can be very stressful to the adrenals and thyroid, and can be counterproductive to healing your vitiligo, so keep it light and refreshing.
Other
I no longer wear a copper bracelet on my arm due to the fact that I have copper overload in my system.

Try chaga mushroom. It is rich with melanin and have a lot of benefit to skin health. I had tried other methods before. Chaga tea works best to me. Within 1 month, my body generates a lot of pigments and the white patched areas seem to get smaller. You can read and research about chaga on the internet everywhere.

Hi, just came across your blog!! Thank you for all the amazing information. I, too, have had vitiligo since I was a young teen (15-17 years now) and I am a MTHFR homozygous carrier. I looked at the Boost supplements and as you may know I can’t take them because they have folic acid in them. Where exactly are you getting your supplements, for example, PABA. I’ve noticed it’s very difficult to find it. Any info you have would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you again! God Bless

Hello. I wanted to share some hope with this wonderful community of people. Vilitligo is curable. My daughter was diagnosed when she was 7 years old, she had it all over her body. She is now 15 and it is mostly confined to her feet, and they are still freckling!!
We used a mind, body and spirit approach to her healing. I believe the main ingredient to repigmenting her skin was love. My philosophy has always been ” do all things with love and you will always succeed.”
Our story is long and extensive, there isn’t enough room on this page to share her wonderful story. It has been a journey and I have have some much gratitude for what I have learned along the way.
I wish all of you the best in your journey, and remember that you are all natural born healers.
Give the body what it needs and it will repair itself.
Love and Light,
Kristi

Hi, I wonder if you have considered taking N acetyl cysteine which has been shown to protect melanocytes from oxidative stress at dose of 1200mg daily.Also R lipoic acid that can induce Nrf 2 that uptegulates most of antioxidant enzymes including catalase in dose of 600-1000mg…Gingko Biloba has been used with bit of success as well with a daily dose of 120mg which in my view is to low.. mechanism behind Gingko is quite the same upregulation of Nrf2 causes upregulation of glutathione and catalase in melanocytes..Combination of these 3 agents should target redox balance in melanocytes..

Hello Tawny,
I am following for a while all the post and information of you site, congragulations.
I suspect that I have MTHFR mutation, and B12 bad absorption. So I take folic acid supplement and liquid B12 cobalamine form.
Do you take B12 metilcobalamine or cyanocobalamin form? Seems that the sublingual metil form is the good one to be aborbed on the streamblood , because is avoiding the digestion issues. right?
As far I read, you take folate from cooked vegetables.
Did you ever consider to take suplements of methylated folate (L-5-MTHF) as an aid?
I have found this complete and interesting post about this issue. It recommends natural folate and avoiding Folic acid. At the end, some recommended supplementation . Hope that helps.

Hi,
Thanks so much for sharing your experience. It’s very helpful to have access to such a wealth of information on Vitiligo,
I have a quick question regarding the efficacy of using anti-microbial essential oils, such as tee tree oil, in a safe carrier oil, such as coconut oil directly on vitiligo lesions. I’m working on my diet and will invest in the vitamins and minerals suggested but am seeking a low-cost and low-barrier oil to apply directly to my lesions.
Thanks!

Hey,
I am excited to find your blog, and to see that you are experiencing results with stopping vitiligo’s progression.
I am relatively new to researching vitiligo, as I am searching for help for my 6.5 year old godchild, and a friend’s husband.
I am confused about the recommendation for follate instead of Follic Acid, based on this Pubmed study.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9394983
Can you explain the conflicting information?

Managed WordPress Migration User says

Hi Jennifer!
The issue with methyl folate (or natural folate from vegetables) vs. folic acid is that recent research has found that many people suffering from autoimmune disease, fibromyalgia and other disorders actually have a genetic mutation that prevents their body from converting folic acid into a usable form. The mutation is referred to as MTHFR. As a result, they end up folate deficient. In addition, because they are unable to process and use folic acid, it builds up in the body and can cause cancer, among other things. Folate (L-5-MTHF) is the methylated form, which means it is ready for the body to use. No conversion necessary. Natural folate from vegetables of course, is always good. Ideally, anyone with an autoimmune disease should get genetic testing to identify any genetic mutations. However, if that’s not an option, its best to take methylated folate instead. Of course check with your doctor before taking any supplements! Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any more questions ;). Thanks for visiting!

There are studies showing that vitiligo is helped by folic acid. MTHFR can be a problem for some whose vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder. Vitiligo is caused in different people for different reasons. B12 and folic acid need each other. Taking one without the other can deplete your body’s store of the other and also could lead to pernicious anemia. Recouleur http://www.Recouleur.com contains the correct dose of vitamins and minerals for vitiligo sufferers. Also studies about Vitamins and Vitiligo are in our Learning Center.

HI! Can you talk a bit about why you are no longer doing green smoothies? I actually cannot digest dark leafy greens like kale and chard and even spinach…even with digestive enzymes. I also have the MTHFR mutation along with several other mutations and I know dark leafy greens are good for people like us. I was thinking about adding in a green drink or smoothie as a work around. If the greens are pulverized maybe I can get digest them and get the benefits. On another note…I have been working with a functional medicine practitioner to deal with a myriad of issues…vitiligo, candida, SIBO, adrenal fatigue, MTHFR, etc…it seems like they all tend to go together somewhat. My vitiligo had seemingly slowed down, if not stopped. Recently, it has started to spread again at a pretty rapid rate. No new spots, yet, but expanding. I looked at the nutritional balancing info and I am actually allergic to any type of grain…corn, rice, any gluten grain and buckwheat actually being the worst. It looks like the NB program “requires” certain foods, blue corn being one of them. In your experience, were you able to tailor your NB program to your sensitivities?
Thanks for what you are doing…

You’ve mentioned that there may be a connection to chlorine. My thought is that if you take a hot shower and all of your pores open up… the skin is absorbing too much chlorine which could kill good bacteria. Do you agree and if so have you taken any precautions like a carbon filter for your shower or cooking with distilled water? Thanks again. I appreciate your insight.

Hi Kobbie!
It is true, but it does not work for everyone. Gingko Biloba is an antioxidant, and those of us with vitilio are suffering from oxidative stress. So theoretically it would work. It just depends on the underlying cause of your vitiligo. If your vitiligo is caused by adrenal fatigue for example, the Gingko may not do much. Hope that helps!

i increased gradualy the dose to 480mg and i took 480 mg for like 3/4 days,
i get a spot almost 60% repigmented in 2 days, the difference of pigmentation was visible between morning evening.
I havn’t been to any uv during this time
and i took Vitamine B complex along with ginkgo.
The bad effect : i do not support ginkgo
ginkgo create the worst anxiety and stress i ever lived and the effect stay for months.
I used to have the same fast repigmentation result with olive leaf.

Please if you have vitiigo esp on your face go to a Dermatologist and get script for Tacrolimus 0.1% and use twice a day. Also Narrowband uv treatment almost completely repigmented by extensive vitiligo within 6 months going 2 to 3 times per week. You can even buy narrowband uv lights (Phillips brand) although I got a German one off ebay for my hands as the hands and feet are most stubborn so still working on them. Google article from the “Dermatology Times” called Vitiligo the big picture” Excellent article and outlines all you need to know. Its the protocol ive used in Australia. We are lucky narrowband uv is free here on our healthcare system. The Tacrolimus is dear also know as Protopic. It stops people rejecting donor organs , in vitilgo stops you rejecting your own melanin and is great and quick working for the face, esp for children. Check tacrolimus on Wikepeadia. Vitamins I take are omega 3s, natural vit E, gram of vit C a day , zinc, magnesium, milk thistle for liver. Also juice every day, beets, celery(antiinflammatory), green apple and silverbeet and carrot.

Also SuperSea Minerals (drink it daily) it is available online. I am not promoting these products but I have researched and it works.

HI TJ!
I found out about a month ago that I have celiac disease and IBS. The biggest reason my husband encouraged me to see a doctor, aside from bloating and serious fatigue, was that my skin was breaking out.. Not a typical kind of break out.. it was white patches on my arms. They kept popping up or growing in size so I sought out a doctor. They didn’t pay too much attention to my skin. They just went straight to my cut and confirmed that I have celiac. But now, I can’t stop paying attention to my skin. I am losing pigment all over my arms and its showing up on my knees. I haven’t seen a dermatologist but from all that I have read and seen, it seems pretty obvious that it is vitiligo. All of that to say, I have changed my diet, but I eat a lot of raw fruit and vegetables. Would it be more beneficial for me to cook them?
I also make green smoothies daily. Usually with spinach, banana, berries, whatever I have! Is this something I should stop doing?
I am considering JuicePlus as well. What do you think?
Sorry for all the questions! The more I type the more that come to mind!
I really look forward to hearing from you!

Hi Maggie!
No apology necessary for the many questions…I know how you feel :)!
Yes, it would be better to eat cooked veggies, preferably 4-6 cups a day.
Also, be careful about eating a lot of fruit. Yes it is natural, but it is high in sugar which upsets body chemistry and is not good for the gut. Green apples are the best since they are more tart than sweet. But honestly, I would avoid fruit as much as possible right now. Maybe when you stabilize you can add it back in slowly. Is juice plus a supplement?

Hi T.J
I gone through ur blog…It is very informative and helpful too….I m suffering vitiligo since last 15 years…I gone through all types of treatment i.e. Allopathy, Ayurvedic, Homeopathy etc..Unfortunately no one worked for me…Currently i m using Dr. Batra’s homeopathy treatment…before this homeopathy tretment, i have tried Natural Vitiligo Treatment System by Michael Dawson for 3 months but it was not worked for me…Currently in my diet, I m drinking Juice made up of Spinach, Root Beet, Carrot, Coriander & bottle gourd daily, I also eating atleast one fruit daily(Apple, Orange, Banana etc) & also dry fruits -nuts(Fig, Walnut, Almond etc). As directed by my homeopathy doctor i m drinking skimed milk before bed and copper vessel water in the morning. But yet i havent seen any improvement. I heard that thyroid may be responsible for vitiligo, so i checked my thyroid level but my thyroid is ok. My Vitamin B12 level is also ok. I would like to ask some questions regarding vitilgo.
My 1st question is How can i know about leaky gut? How can i know about copper level in my body?
My 2nd question is which are other things needs to check in vitiligo?
waiting for your quick reply

Hi GH,
I am sorry I did not get back to you, I have not had my computer for over a month…hard drive crashed :(.
I am also sorry that you have tried so many things without success. I did not find Michael Dawson’s book to be helpful at all.
As far as leaky gut goes, it is assumed that anyone with an autoimmune disease has leaky gut…so it’s likely you have it. There are a number of other tests that can be done. The most important, in my opinion is to find out if you are suffering from adrenal fatigue. This one issue alone contributes to a number of issues, the most important being low stomach acid and copper retention/toxicity. I would be careful about adding copper because it can actually worsen your condition if you do in fact have adrenal fatigue.

Here is the link to Dr. Wanakee Hill’s oil and cream…http://thewellnesswell.net/cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=109. And yes, the oil and cream will protect your skin while you get sun. Personally I did not apply sunscreen, but I don’t burn easily. So you may want to apply sunscreen depending on your particular situation.

The Hair Mineral Analysis sounds like it has been beneficial. Is this something an online service can provide or did you go through your primary care physician?
Also, any reason for not using NAC? I had heard that it has tons of benefits including thinning out mucus and increasing your immune system.
Thanks again for your help and support. It can be very frustrating dealing with Vitiligo. Sites like yours really do help!!

Hi Tim!
I am so sorry, I thought I replied to this question awhile back, but it looks like I didn’t, forgive me. For Nutritional Balancing you have to work with a practitioner who works under Dr. Larry Wilson. You can find a practitioner online here http://drlwilson.com/do%20hair%20analysis.htm. The Nutritional Balancing has been very beneficial because it restores the body’s energy system and detoxes at a very deep level. There really is nothing like it. I should mention that there is no guarantee that it will work for vitiligo. However, since vitiligo is a manifestation of internal breakdown it made sense that Nutritional Balancing could only help me.
I do not use NAC because the Nutritional Balancing helps the body restore Glutathione naturally, so NAC is not needed.
I am so glad the blog is helping you 🙂 Thanks for reading!

Do you use Apple Cider Vinegar? I was reading a lot this weekend on how people with vitiligo tend to have low stomach acid and taking ACV before meals can help people break down their meals with increasing their stomach acid. Also, people have claimed that ACV has helped with re-pigmentation. It seems like ACV has tons of other benefits too… helps with back pain, reducing inflammation, killing any candida yeast, etc. Thoughts?
Thanks again for your help. I do appreciate your insight.

Hi Tim,
Yes ACV is good for low stomach acid. Stomach acid is needed to activate the pancreatic enzymes necessary for digesting proteins. It can only help, I would think.

Who do you recommend to go to have tests done with? And what tests do you recommend I should get done. I have had vitiligo for 31 years and seen it spread mostly over the last couple of years. I have not done much treatment at all. I have a pretty severe case on my hands, feet, legs and torso.

Hi Melissa,
So sorry to be getting back to you so late. I have been without a computer due to a bad hard drive.
The tests I recommend are adrenal strength (which can be done by hair mineral analysis or 24 hour urine test), b12 utilization, full thyroid panel, and genetic testing to check for any polymorphisms that can be bypassed with appropriate supplementation.

Hi T.J.,
Thanks so much for sharing your story! It’s really so inspiring to read your story and so many others’ and know that re-pigmentation is possible! I was first diagnosed with my vitiligo in May of this year when a small spot appeared around my mouth, followed by three more within the next few weeks. Once I found out it was vitiligo, I started to do something about it. Near the end of June I started going as paleo as possible, and completely cut out gluten, dairy, and soy. I’m also taking probiotics, vitamins B12, D, magensium, l-glutamine, and folate. More recently, I started drinking a glass of apple cider vinegar every morning. I haven’t tried any creams yet, but after reading your posts, I may try Dr. Wanakee Hill’s. After my change in diet, my spots stopped spreading, but I didn’t really see any progress until last week I started to notice that the two spots around my mouth (these also happened to be the two that first appeared), noticeably shrunk. That got me really excited!! But just today, I noticed a tiny small spot on my left hand, which got me back into kind of a mental funk again. It’s definitely discouraging, but it’s so helpful to see that other people on this site have had the same roller coaster ride as me and have eventually figured it out. I’m hoping that if I just stay determined, I’ll find the treatment combo to heal me completely!

Have you researched supplementing with folate? I’ve read a lot about how Folic Acid can be helpful, but there may be risks with too much! Are you taking/considering any other vitamins/supplements? NAC? probiotics? etc?
I really appreciate your blog as it’s a struggle trying to solve this puzzle. I’m currently following a lot of what you described… dairy free and gluten free. I’m also starting to really reduce the amount of red meat that I eat each week.

Hi Tim!
I agree, vitiligo is such a puzzle, it’s very frustrating.
From what I understand, Folate with L-5MTHF on the label is the one you want…NOT folic acid. I take many other supplements including EPA/DHA, Vitamin D3, probiotics, zinc, selenium, ox bile with pancreatin (for digestion), thyroid and adrenal glandulars, multivitamins, calcium/magnesium, and TMG. These were all given to me based on a hair mineral analysis. I do not take NAC.

Hi-
I am wondering if you have tried the kalawalla? There were conflicting reports when I googled it. Also, have you tried gingko at all? Regarding the nutritional balancing do you actually get a program written out for you to follow? And the infared sauna do you purchase these? I haven’t seen updated pictures since 2014 are you still experiencing re-pigmentation with these steps? It seems something always works for someone that doesn’t work for someone else.

Hi Leah,
I have not tried Kalawallah, but I did try Gingko for a short time…maybe two months or so. I ended up seeing a holistic doctor and ultimately chose a different route that didn’t include Gingko. I know it works for some people, but I probably didn’t stick with it long enough for me to know whether it would have worked for me or not.
As for the infrared sauna, I purchased a unit kind of like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNGTJISrYU. I have it set up in my second shower that I don’t use.
My last group of photos was taken April 2015 that you can see here at the bottom of the page http://realvitiligotreatment.com/pictures-of-my-vitiligo/.
I actually just took new photos this week and I will updating in a few days.
I think one of the reasons why one thing works for one person and not another is because often times people just try one thing, or maybe a few. Vitiligo has to be approach from many different angles, all at the SAME time (reduce toxic load, stress reduction, dietary changes, supplementation, detoxification, plenty of rest/sleep, lots of water, etc.) It can seem overwhelming at first, but it does become a new way of life….especially if you truly want to rid yourself of the vitiligo.

Hi TJ,
Once you got ‘serious’ about healing your vitiligo how long did it take for you to see improvement?
I have been gluten and dairy free for 5 months now, have been taking ginkgo, probiotics, and recently started taking NAC and folinic acid. I have also made several dietary changes to inprove gut health. I’ve seen pretty much no improvement thus far. I had a small spot on my hand that is almost gone, but that’s it. It was pretty small anyway.
I started UVB back in March but my vitamin D levels were way too high so I stopped until they came down. Started again in June but I am now pregnant. My vitamin d levels started to rise so I stopped UVB as I didn’t want to harm baby. I was also using tacrolimus for a few months but stopped that too because of the pregnancy.
I am just so discouraged lately!!! I just need to see some improvement to give me some encouragement! Or to hear about a success story that took a bit longer. In the success stories people say they see improvement within a few months! My vitiligo only appeared in January this year.
Sigh.

Hi Bec!
I know exactly how you feel, it’s so tough when what you are doing doesn’t seem to be working. It took me a year before I finally got the right combination of diet and supplementation that gave me results. I was breastfeeding when my vitiligo first appeared, and I had to wait until I stopped in order to really do something about my vitiligo. You may have to just wait until you have your baby to really try and get it under control. Do what you can in the meantime and try not to stress over it. When did it start? Did it begin spreading during your pregnancy?

It started in about January or February this year. I was breastfeeding at the time and stopped in about March. Fell pregnant again in June. I started seeing my naturopath again in March as well.
It’s just so discouraging! But a little more encouraging to hear that even after a year you started to see some results.

Hi there,
I’ve added a few things into my diet including raw garlic and golden milk daily as well as spirulina. At the same time I started UVB treatment again. I use sunscreen on all the unaffected areas and just expose my patches.
Prior to resuming UVB I saw a very small amount of repigmentation on a patch on my back but that was it. Since UVB I have noticed that same area has grown a bit and patch under my arm has started to repigment as well.
Both very small areas but it’s great to FINALLY see some improvement!! I have only had vitiligo for 9 months, 8 of which I have been actively trying to get rid of it through diet and lifestyle changes.
Just thought I’d share to perhaps give some hope to those who are taking a bit longer to see resultS.

I did try Merry Clinic for about 6 months or so, although it did not work for me. The Vitiligo Miracle is a very good book about what causes vitiligo and all the ways it needs to be treated. However, it is not going to tell you exactly how much of any supplement to take. If you can, I would get her to a holistic/natural doctor who specializes in autoimmune diseases.

Hello, have you tried piperine? Its one of the latest discoveries on curing vitiligo (only tested on mouse though).
I also have vitiligo on my face and neck it seem to spread whenever i go swimming and i have found that chlorine agrevates vitiligo. I stopped swimming and i’m also taking a lot of supplements which is b12 ,folate ,gingko biloba,L-Phenylalanine, copper, zinc, green tea extract, fish oil. I also use protopic ointment 2x a day. Im worried taking this much supplement can have side effects in the long run but my skin is starting to repigment on the face and neck. On the bad side though is i also have it on the private area and it hasnt improved because i have not been putting protopic in the area but i just started putting it there also. If you have any recommendations please let me know thanks!

Hi Francis,
I’m so glad to hear you are starting to repigment! That’s great news, and means you are on the right track. I’ve not heard of piperine, I will have to check that out!
You know, my vitiligo started after being in a swimming pool, and I have come to learn that swimming pools are often treated with copper because it is an anti-bacterial/anti-fungal. In actuality, most us are over loaded with copper. Do you also have bad PMS? I did, and that’s a sign of too much copper in the body. Personally, I was not able to take the L-Phenylalanine…it gave me horrible anxiety. Just be mindful of how you feel and I would recommend seeing a holistic doctor, naturopath, or functional medicine doctor if you are in doubt. It’s a good idea to have your blood tested occasionally to measure your B-12 levels. Take care, and keep me posted on your progress! If you continue to make progress, I’d love to have you do an interview for me if you are interested 🙂

Hello Rajeev,
Thank you so much! I’m so glad to hear that the site has been informative to you and that you are enjoying it.
Yes, I am doing Dr. Wilson’s Nutritional Balancing program. I would say that the Nutritional Balancing (NB) was a definite turning point for me. Three months into it I noticed I wasn’t getting any new spots and the ones I already had weren’t spreading nearly as fast. What’s so unique about NB is that it not only detoxifies the body at a very deep level, but it restores the body’s energy system which is highly complex and nothing short of amazing. Majority (if not all) of us with vitiligo have adrenal and thyroid issues, and in many cases, this must first be corrected before any healing can take place. We did not focus on my vitiligo at all during NB since vitiligo is not a skin issue, but a result of a breakdown in complex body systems and altered biochemistry. I had pretty severe adrenal fatigue and sluggish thyroid when I started NB over a year ago. My adrenal fatigue has greatly improved and my thyroid is not far behind. For me, NB has been very effective!

I try to get 30 minutes of sun on my spots everyday, but it’s been overcast and gloomy where I live lately, so I haven’t been getting sun. I will have to wait until July to get going again.

Do you take birth control pills or have you read about the connection between hormonal birth control and vitiligo? It doesn’t really explain how men could have it too though and for most women, getting off the pill isn’t even up for debate. I read a book called The Paleo Approach where the author says “sex hormones play a complex role in regulating the immune system and messing with them by using oral contraceptives may make it a lot harder to manage your autoimmune disease through diet and lifestyle”.
The book also mentions zinc and so do you here. I need to get on that!

Hi Kai!
I also have the book The Paleo Approach, and she is correct about the immune system and its relation to sex hormones. I do not take birth control pills, although I have in the past. I have never heard of a DIRECT connection between birth control pills and vitiligo. However, I do know that birth control pills contribute to copper accumulation/imbalance within the body. Copper accumulation in the body is associated with higher estrogens in the body, along with low zinc levels – since zinc opposes copper. “Copper is also linked to many other types of infections because zinc is needed for the proper immune response. Elevated or biounavailable copper often goes along with a low tissue zinc level, even though blood tests may be normal. Even a hair analysis is often normal.” (source).

Hi! I stumbled upon your blog and I was curious if you also have hypothyroidism or hashimotos by any chance. You seem to be supplementing a lot of the same deficiencies that most of us also have.

Hi there! I do have low thyroid function, but not hypothyroidism. My issue seems to be at the cellular level, meaning the thyroid hormone is not getting into the cells where it needs to go. This is caused by vitamin/mineral deficiencies, many of which I am in the process of correcting. I have more and more energy as the days go by, but it is somewhat of a long process. I had some genetic testing done, mainly to test for the MTHFR mutation you mentioned, but that too came back negative. I did however, find out that I have a mutation that prevents me from methylating B12 – which was good to know since B12 deficiency is associated with vitiligo. I supplemented with extra methyl B12 for a few months, and now just take a multivitamin that contains methyl B12 to be sure I bypass that mutation. By antibodies, do you mean the ANA test? I had that done as well, and it came back elevated which prompted further testing to rule out Lupus. It turns out I had no other Lupus markers (yet), I only had the slightly high ANA titer. I was told that the vitiligo would not cause this, but I believe otherwise. Everything in our bodies are connected. Thanks for visiting and commenting!

Hi there!
I’m so glad I came across your blog…
I am a white South African and I have recently developed tiny white spots on my skin – I found out it is vitiligo.
The main cause of this in my body seems to be my terrible nutrition. I have been vegan for about 7 years and not knowing what to eat most of the time, I turn to processed foods: soya, bread etc.
Also… I had a terrible relationship with food when I was younger, which sometimes lead to me NOT eating, out of fear of getting fat.
Now I have all these health problems and I am forced to heal my body with food – go figure!
I might even need to change my diet, it seems. Amazing how different we all are – one person thrives on a vegan diet… another doesn’t.
Thanks for your updates on your blog – I wish you all the best with your healing journey!!

Hi Lani!
Thanks so much for visiting, I’m glad you are happy to have found me ;)! Yes, vegan diets are problematic for a number of reasons, but the main problems in relation to vitiligo are that vegan diets are very low in zinc (since animal protein is the main source of zinc). Zinc maintains gut wall integrity and prevents leaky gut, is essential for proper immune response, is anti-inflammatory, helps prevent copper accumulation in the body, and helps maintain healthy skin. I hope you can find some helpful tips on diet here, and thank you for your well-wishes. I really appreciate them 😉 I wish you success on your journey to heal as well. Take care! 😉

Hi Everyone,
I have had vitiligo for about 10 years and it always flares when I begin work again so the link between stress and symptoms is accurate, at least for me. I have completely altered my diet and have seen improvement. I was a vegetarian and then started my treatment on the Makers Diet with a Vit B complex. I did begin to repigment. I have seen many people give up red meat with sucess. I actually find I need red meat and when I lapse on it, I get worse, in physical and emotional aspects. My point is, it seems we all are different in what our body needs so if something you read doesn’t help… Keep trying. Also, reguarding copper, I just read a study that said some people with vitiligo actually show high levels of copper not due to toxicity, but because we are loosing it. I will see if I can find it again. Wondering if you are familiar with it? I am having tests done and will see a functional medicine doctor at the end of March. I will post what they find.

I am so glad to find your blog! I’ve had it for almost 13 years. I haven’t tried much to treat it. It has spread a lot the last few years for me. I moved into a new house a few years ago and broke out into major hives for almost 6 months! (I think it was te stress of moving and new expenses) During that time my vitiligo got worse along with the hives. I have been so emotionally affected by this. I keep most of my body hidden. I have kids and I know they suffer too since I don’t want to go outdoors in the summer time. I live in So Cal! Anyway thank you for sharing. I’m going to give some of your suggestions a try. Thank you again!

Hi Andrea!
Thanks so much for your kind words. I’m sorry to hear your vitiligo is spreading. Stress is definitely a major factor – one reason is that when we are stressed we burn through tons of zinc. Zinc keeps the copper in our bodies balanced, among other important things such as proper immune system function. If you can get your stress levels down, it will really help you. Also eat lots of cooked spinach and other cooked veggies! I’m glad you are enjoying the blog! Take care and keep me posted! 😉

Hi TJ
I’m so excited to have found your blog. My brother has vitiligo and he has had it since he was a teenager. I never thought to think that the small white spots I have through out my body could also be vitiligo. I guess because they never expanded my mind was focus on helping my brother. Well I do believe I have vitiligo now after seeing new spots show up around my body. So now I’m researching and trying to figure out what would help the vitiligo from spreading and get pigmentation back. My question to you is have you used or know anyone who has tried the started kit from the wellness website you get your cream and oil? Also are you still using the same nutritional regime that you have on your site. Thank you!!

Hello Aj!
Glad you’re enjoying the blog 🙂
Yes, everything on my treatment plan page is current, I make sure it gets updated whenever I change something. I initially purchased the starter set from Dr. Kee at the WellnessWell.net, but I eventually decided to go with Nutritional Balancing instead. I still use her boosting oil and Extra Strength cream though, it works great when I sit in the sun.

Hi Jennifer!
Have you tried searching google for any? I make my own greek dressing, but it does call for fresh lemon juice. Maybe you could try eliminating the lemon and see how you like it? Let me know and I will post the recipe for you!

Hi T.J.
I came upon your blog today. I also have vitiligo and I find your blog very informative and inspiring. Thank you for sharing your story with us T.J.
I wanted to ask you if you have tried Apple Cider vinegar. I have read in some websites that having Apple Cider vinegar before food increases the stomach acid and thus helps in curing vitiligo. Do you have any experience with this. Please let me know.
Thanks again for taking out so much time and working on this blog.

I have not tried apple cider vinegar myself, although I have heard it helps increase stomach acid – which may contribute to reversing vitiligo. It’s probably worth a shot and I don’t think it could hurt.What other things have you tried?

Hi T.J.,
Thanks for your reply. I have reduced dairy and gluten and I see repigmentation on few spots but at the same time I see new spots as well 🙁 also I am trying some breathing exercises. I will update if I see any progress. I will also try ACV and see if there is any change. I have a very supporting husband so he encourages me to try new things if one fails 🙂
And btw your smile is infectious 🙂

I have heard that it is possible to re-pigment and lose pigment at the same time, so please don’t let that discourage you!
Yes, please keep me posted! 🙂 Take care!

Hi T.J.,
Thank you for the very informative blog! I’ve had vitiligo for about 10 years and just recently it started to spread like crazy so I’m starting to do something about it. Can I ask how much zinc supplement you’re taking? And what brands of the other vitamins? There’s so much selection!
I have very many spots so I’m going to try different things on different ones, and I can keep you updated on the progress if you’d like. Each spot will get either onion juice, aloe vera gel, neem oil, or tincture iodine.
I don’t know if this was a one-off situation, but my father had just one large vitiligo spot. He put tincture iodine on it daily and it went away in a few months.
Actually, I’m confused about one thing – are you saying vitamin c is bad for vitiligo? But you’re eating lots of carrots?
Thank you

Hello Rah!
Thanks so much for visiting the blog! The amount of zinc I am taking is very specific to me, since it is based on my hair mineral analysis….so I’d rather not say how much I am taking – also I really cannot make any recommendations since I am not a doctor. However, I will say that taking extra zinc in any amount is probably going to be helpful. I personally like the NOW Foods brand or anything by Pure Encapsulations
That’s interesting about the iodine, I’ve never heard of that before. I’m thinking about starting onion juice myself, since I am starting to see lots of tiny spots emerge.
Taking extra vitamin c is not recommended for vitiligo. However, the vitamin c contained in carrot juice doesn’t seem to be an issue. The carrot juice is very protective while doing sun exposure, plus it’s very nourishing to the skin and liver so it can only help you. I hope you see some results Rah! Please do keep me posted, I would love to hear of your progress and I’m sure all of my readers would love to hear of it as well! Take care!

Hi there,
I just saw and had a look around your blog. I found it is really helpful for vitiligo suffer like me and most unlucky people getting this disorder.
I’ve got vitiligo like around last 7 months with a small white spot in the corner of mouth and another small piece in the chin. At first, I did not really care about it and just wondered that the time passed and I would get better again, but the result has turned out to be not.
However, I suppose that I am still fortunate enough due to the fact that my symptoms are not spreading like some people who even worse get nearly across the body. They are still those two small spots on my face, I think they’ve been the same size and the color as it first started 7 months ago.
I am now following the Vitiligo Miracle and reduce stop eating gluten as well as dairy foods. I also eat a lot vegetables in every meal and avoid red meat ( actually only eat Fish and Chicken ).
I read some of your previous comments about the vitiligo on the face which is the easiest are to get back pigmentation. Do you have any idea with my current condition?

Hi Hong!
I’m so glad to hear you are trying to fight your vitiligo! You are on the right track for sure. I use Vitilax skin oil from Merry Clinic to help get my pigment back and it works well. I am sitting in the sun with it on my legs as we speak 😉 I think you could try that with sunlight and see how your skin responds.

It’s really interesting to see comments from parents treating their children, as I’m doing the same for my almost 5 year old daughter. Removing dairy and gluten has been ok, although we have continued with oats and rice and hope that this won’t impede progress. The Merry clinic recommended avoiding shellfish and citrus….her ok-food list is shrinking by the day! It’s so unfair that I can seemingly eat junk and have no problems.
TJ – I read that you supplement with copper and wear a copper bracelet, but hair analysis shows that you are copper toxic? I found this confusing- should we be avoiding copper with vitiligo or supplementing?
Thanks so much for starting this blog, it’s really helpful to read what others are trying.

Hi Fh-
I’m so sorry, somehow I missed your comment!
Yes, you are correct, thank you for pointing that out. I am copper toxic, and I do not currently take copper. I did in the past, but because of my particular issue with copper, it did not help me. I would say to be careful with the copper and focus more on zinc.
I’m so glad the blog is helpful for you!

Hi T.J.,
I love your blog! My daughter was diagnosed with vitiligo at 2.5 years old. She has it on her left eye lid and a few of her lashes are white. She also has 2-3 gray hairs. During the week, I try to keep her on a gluten free diet. She eats lots of lentils, beans, broccoli, fruits, almond milk, plain yogurt with organic honey, rice with organic chicken 2-3 times a week and only drinks water. She also wears a really cute copper bracelet. She just turned 5, and until now it hasn’t spread. I think diet, sleep and stress has a lot to do with it. I do let her have pizza, chocolate, etc on weekends – hey, she is a kid, right?! 🙂 In April of this year I began applying extra virgin coconut oil in the morning, afternoon and night – by June, she had a pretty noticeable repigmentation area on her eye, and it’s very noticeable now. It’s now October, and the repigmentation seems to be at a halt, but I continue to apply the coconut oil every morning and night, and especially when we go out to in the sun. I will update at the end of the year. TY!

Sounds like you’ve done a great job, this is so encouraging to hear :)! I hope you continue to make progress. If you do have trouble making further progress, I would really watch the gluten intake closely. It’s hard for a child, I know. I have a three year old who I have taken off of gluten. It was hard at first, but many of his allergies have disappeared. He can now have organic raw cheese and tomatoes – things he couldn’t handle when he was eating the gluten.

I have just started her gluten free diet and cut down Dairy Milk but do give her yoghurt since it acts as a probiotic.It feels great to know that I am on the right track after reading your blog.She is taking the Merry clinic Vitalax too.

I am African American with vitiligo and the thing that has helped me the most is going out in the sun for 1 hour a day in the summer time. I repigmented the back of my neck that is turning white it is about 70 percent repigmented. It’s coming back in brown dots that come together. The front is repigmenting slowly. This has taken me about 5 months.
I have also been taking vitamins you can buy at the store and health food store. I take liquid b-12, vitamin e softgels, alive multivitamins, green juice that is already made at the grocery store, gingko biloba pills, grapefruit seed extract, oil of oregano, folic acid vitamins, selenium vitamins, vitamin c , probiotics, carrot juice. I also eat collard greens, and kale greens, celery juice made in blender with celery and filtered water, I eat about 2 to 4 cups of green frozen vegetables a day. Sometimes, I drink green tea, and ginger tea.
I also put vitamin e oil from the softgels on my vitiligo on my neck when I go out in the sun for 1 hour and I also use liquid vitamin e that comes in a bottle at the grocery store. I also use liquid vitamin e when I do my hair by putting it on my neck on my vitiligo while I’m drying my hair it turns my vitiligo red and I get spots. I also put tea tree oil on my neck where I have vitiligo before I go to bed. I have gotten the most spots on my neck when I was eating a bag of frozen green vegetables a day for a month and no red meat. I turned around and my neck was full of brown spots. My skin color is coming back on my neck.
I personally think you should add tanning or going out in the sun to your regimen so you can see some results. I also think you need to try liquid vitamin b12 and folic acid vitamins. I still eat dairy like cottage cheese, cheese, and lactaid milk, yogurt sometimes. I’m not sure if I should keep eating dairy or not or should I stop eating sugar also.

Hi Carla! Thanks so much for your long and helpful comment! I actually do take sublingual B12 and I eat 4-6 cups of cooked veggies a day for folate and detox. I just started sun exposure and have been getting good results. It’s good to hear how long it took for you to repigment, it helps prevent discouragement. Would you like to do a question and answer interview for the blog? I would love to have your story here for others to read It is so helpful!

Hi TJ. Thank you for your blog. It is time I start to get serious about finding a nutritional solution to my vitiligo. It is affecting my mental health and adding to my depression, and I am beginning to avoid outdoor activities I love, such as going to the beach and wearing shorts. I have no idea what my family thinks about what they see. I haven’t discussed with anyone yet other than my wife. My vitiligo began when my first divorce was almost finalized, maybe it does have to do with state of mind. Also, I had hyper-active thyroid, which I did take medicine for 15 years ago for a while – that helped my hyper-thyroid condition and I have been off that medicine since then without the symptoms recurring (night sweats and hand tremors). I need to get serious about this now and your blog will help.

Hello Alan!
I’m so glad to hear you are enjoying the blog and thinking about getting healthy and finding a nutritional approach that will help your vitiligo. I’m sorry you are feeling you have to hide your skin, but I know how you feel. I myself wear long skirts to hide my shins because I hate the way they look. I have not yet embraced my shins to the point that I really don’t care about showing them…depends on what kind of mood I am in. But I am working on it. It’s tough, and most people just don’t understand the humiliation.
I sincerely hope the blog can help you, and remember that you really can do something about your vitiligo. Half the battle is getting into the proper mindset. If you remain positive and determined, you will succeed. Thanks for stopping by!

TJ,
I’m pretty much following the same strategy as yours.
I’m currently investigating Dr’s Matteo’s research (an Italian doctor).
We know that oxidative stress plays a big role in vitiligo. So, are you taking anti-oxidants like NAC, ALA, Vit E, etc.?
Recently I found a lot of contradictory information about the anti-oxidant subject, so that I would like to hear your opinion. Please check (http://www.skinwhiteningscience.com/skin_whitening_agent_types_antioxidants.html )
Regards.

Hello Flavio!
Thanks so much for visiting and for your helpful comments. I love comments like yours This is an interesting article you have linked. I’ve never seen or heard this before, except for the vitamin c part of it – which I know is not recommended for vitiligo since vit c interferes with copper. I don’t take NAC or any other antioxidants since it isn’t necessary on a Nutritional Balancing program. However, I’ve always heard they are helpful.
I’m no scientist, but I think this article is simply showing how glutathione itself can be used for skin whitening. However, if we are talking about NAC, that’s a different subject. NAC, as I’m sure you know, is not actual glutathione. It helps the body restore its own glutathione levels.
This is important since low glutathione levels have been linked to autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo, and so restoring it can only help. In fact most people today are deficient in glutathione and one really big reason is toxic metal exposure.
I hope this helps! It’s just my opinion, but I’d love to know what you think. Thanks again for visiting the blog!

I just thought I’d mention that there are very high quality microfiber towels available for household and personal cleaning that work better than vinegar (which I was using and my house was getting dirtier by the day). Two brands I am aware of are Norwex and eCloth. I can’t speak to eCloth but Norwex is AMAZING and offers many, many household and personal care products. The silly cloth is worth $16!!!
Best in treating your condition!

Hi Andrea!
Thanks for the tip! You know I was just thinking about how I don’t really like my natural cleaners because they don’t clean as well as the harsh stuff. I’m definitely gonna try this! I actually use microfiber towels with warm water to remove my makeup – which works great, no makeup remover needed. So it makes sense they would work well on grabbing dirt. Thanks for your well wishes as well 🙂

Hi Luis!
This is absolutely real, and was just updated in February 2014. I actually need to do another update since I have changed my supplement regimen drastically. I still avoid gluten and dairy and I take extra B-12 and eat lots of cooked veggies for folate. After about 8-9 months of eating this way, my vitiligo slowed down considerably. My main focus is to get my immune system to function properly, since vitiligo is thought to be autoimmune. Hope that helps you 🙂 Thanks for visiting the blog!

Sounds healthy. I have read good things about spinach. I am making a variety of spinach shakes. No results yet, but it is a recent addition to everything i do, which is practically the same as you. Three years since it’s first appearance, but no significant spread. I am considering ordering a UV light. Any experience with that? ….I recommend yoga and meditation as a part of your lifestyle. Best of luck!

Hi JJ!
I’ve heard good things about spinach too. I don’t have any experience with UV light, since my main focus has been to stop the spreading first. It’s been two years since mine first appeared, and it has slowed down significantly in response to all of my dietary changes and supplementation. Thanks for the recommendations, I really do appreciate them 😉 And thanks for visiting the blog!
