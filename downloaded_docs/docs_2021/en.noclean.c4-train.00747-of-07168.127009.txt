Tendonitis
2-minute read
Listen
Tendonitis is an irritated or inflamed tendon. It can develop in many places in the body, but is most common in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees and heels. The condition often gets better with rest, but treatment may be needed if the pain persists.
What is tendonitis?
Tendonitis (also called tendinitis) describes an inflamed and painful tendon. Tendons are the bands of tissue that attach muscles to bones and help you move.
Tendon conditions can be acute (sudden-onset), such as those caused by a sports injury, or chronic (longer term), when a tendon gradually deteriorates, usually due to overuse or repetition. The terms ‘tendinopathy’ and ‘tendinosis’ describe chronic tendon conditions.
Tendonitis symptoms
The main symptoms of tendonitis are pain and tenderness in the affected tendon, which is often worse when you move it.
Other symptoms can include:
swelling
a grating sensation as the tendon moves
a lump on the tendon
weakness in the affected area
If you have symptoms of tendonitis that don’t get better after a few days’ rest, you should seek medical attention.
Tendonitis diagnosis
Diagnosis of tendonitis is usually straightforward. A doctor is likely to examine the affected area and ask about how you injured the tendon. Imaging tests such as x-rays and ultrasounds may also be necessary.
Tendonitis treatment
Tendonitis often only lasts a few days, but can last for longer. If you have a sore tendon, it’s important to rest it. You can apply ice packs and take pain killers, and in some cases, using a brace can be helpful.
To prevent swelling, avoid hot baths, heat packs, alcohol and massages for the first few days. When it’s not painful, try to keep moving so the tendon doesn’t become stiff.
Rehabilitation exercises, as suggested by a doctor or physiotherapist, may also help you recover full movement and function.
More involved treatments include shock wave therapy (a physiotherapy technique), and corticosteroid injections to reduce inflammation. In a small number of cases, surgery may be required.
Preventing tendonitis
If you’ve had tendonitis before, you can help prevent further injury by making sure you warm up and warm down before and after exercising, learning correct techniques if you play a sport, and strengthening muscles in the affected area.
You may also need an ergonomic assessment of your work space and adjust your chair, keyboard and desktop to help protect your joints and tendons from excessive strain.

Injection treatment for painful Achilles tendons in adults | Cochrane
The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. Painful and stiff Achilles tendons are common overuse injuries in people undertaking sports, such as running, but also occur for other reasons in inactive people. The underlying cause is an imbalance between the damage and repair processes in the tendon. Painful Achilles tendons are often disabling and can take a long time to get better. Many treatments exist for this condition and this review set out to find out whether treatment with an injection, with a variety of agents, decreases pain and allows people to return to their previous activities.

Surgical interventions for treating acute Achilles tendon ruptures | Cochrane
Rupture of the Achilles tendon is common and said to be increasing. It typically occurs in males in their 30s and 40s who play sport intermittently. People present with severe pain in the tendon, at the back of the ankle. Signs include a palpable gap at the rupture site, and marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion (movement so toes point downwards). Options for management include non-surgical interventions (plaster of Paris, bracing or splinting) or surgical repair of the tendon. Following either method of treatment, the ankle may be immobilised for up to 12 weeks (in a cast, allowing no movement at the ankle and variable weight-bearing), or mobilised early (in a brace, allowing movement at the ankle and partial to full weight-bearing).

Patellar or hamstring tendon grafts for ACL reconstruction in adults | Cochrane
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is important for maintaining the stability in the knee, particularly in activities involving cutting, pivoting or kicking. People with ruptured ACLs have unstable knees that generally become more damaged over time. Reconstruction of ruptured ACLs commonly involves using autografts (grafts taken from the person undergoing surgery), obtained by removing part of the patellar tendon or the hamstring tendon. This review aimed to find out if one graft was better than the other.

Interventions for treating mallet finger injuries | Cochrane
Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened out due to injury. Typically the skin remains intact, and the impairment results from a tear of a finger tendon or a small fracture where the tendon attaches to the bone. Treatment commonly involves immobilising the finger-end in a splint for six or more weeks. Surgery may be used for more severe injuries.

Computer-assisted surgery for knee ligament reconstruction | Cochrane
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are centrally located ligaments in the knee. An ACL injury is common in sports such as football and basketball, while PCL injury is far less common. An operation to reconstruct the ACL, usually with a tendon, is one of the most frequently performed orthopaedic procedures. It is very important to perform this operation accurately to obtain a satisfactory outcome and a computer may be able to assist with this. This review set out to examine the evidence for using an additional computer during the operation to help with the positioning of the bone tunnels in which to place the replacement tendon.

Non-removable pressure-relieving interventions help to heal foot ulcers in people with diabetes | Cochrane
Foot ulceration is a complication of diabetes and can lead to amputation. Ulcers can occur due, in part, to abnormal pressures on the sole of the foot. The studies included in this review compared non-removable pressure-relieving interventions (foot casts) with other ways of relieving pressure on the ulcer site to improve healing. The comparisons included dressings alone, temporary therapeutic shoes, removable pressure-relieving devices and surgical intervention. The review found that the non-removable interventions were more effective than any of the other external pressure-relieving methods. Non-removable casts used with Achilles tendon lengthening were more successful in one forefoot ulcer study than using a non-removable cast alone.

Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating anterior cruciate ligament injuries | Cochrane
Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee is a common injury in young, active individuals. It often results in an unstable knee that increases the risk of further knee damage, such as to the knee meniscii. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletic individuals are often treated surgically. Surgery usually entails ACL reconstruction, that involves removing the torn ligament and replacing it with a tendon graft, often taken from another part of the patient's knee. Conservative (non-surgical) interventions are also used as treatment for this injury. This usually takes the form of a progressive rehabilitation programme that includes exercises aimed at improving strength and balance. We aimed to assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ACL injuries.
