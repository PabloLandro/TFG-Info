Buyer’s Guide
What is L-Theanine?
L-Theanine is a relaxing and no dietary amino acid found exclusively in teas from Camellia sinensis (alongside green tea catechins and caffeine) it is known to promote relaxation.
It appears to be effective at this as well as reducing stress at standard dosages.
The relaxing and attention promoting properties of L-theanine together with the lack of sedation allows L-Theanine to have its most significant supplemental role in relieving the ‘jitteriness’ of many stimulants.
A combination of L-Theanine with caffeine (200mg each) is apparently synergistic in promoting cognition and attention in most users. (1)
What are the benefits of taking L-Theanine supplement?
L-Theanine is seen to help relieve stress by inducing a relaxing effect without drowsiness; it could also possess immune boosting properties.
Theanine may also have positive effects on the cardiovascular system and plays a preventative role in cancer; there is however limited clinical information available to support these claims.
Who can benefit from L-Theanine supplement?
Theanine supplements may help people who feel stressed out to be more relaxed and lower anxiety.
Theanine supplements helped boys with ADHD sleep better.
Another small study showed that when combined with caffeine, Theanine sharpens your thinking.
More research is needed to see how Theanine affects these conditions.
People who drink green tea had a lower risk of stroke, one study found.
We don’t actually if it was the theanine in the green tea that produced this benefit.
Some animal and lab studies show that theanine could help with disorders such as:
dementia
high blood pressure
unhealthy cholesterol levels
Theanine could also boost benefits whilst reducing side effects of some drugs for cancer treatment.
But no one knows yet whether theanine supplements would have these benefits in people.
More research is needed for sure. (2)
Are there any side effects of L-Theanine supplement?
Studies have not found side effects from using theanine supplements but drinking lots of green tea can cause an upset stomach and irritability from the caffeine.
It’s not clear if using theanine supplements in the long-term is a safe option.
It is also unclear if theanine is safe for children or for women who are pregnant /breastfeeding.
If you take any medication, talk to your doctor before you start using theanine supplements.
They could interact with stimulants, sedatives, and drugs for high blood pressure.
There are a few adverse reactions that have been reported.
An adverse reaction recorded in human studies using tea extracts included headaches, dizziness, and GI symptoms.
How much should I consume L-Theanine supplement on a daily basis?
Standard doses of theanine have not been set for any condition and although ingredients in supplements may vary widely, it is estimated that L-Theanine should be taken in the dosage of 100-200mg, usually with caffeine. (3)

This product could also reduce anxiety attacks.
This supplement also claims to aid the boosting of your immune system.
This supplement brand not only alleviates the everyday stresses that we deal with on a day to day basis but also gives you a slow release of energy that will keep you alert, unlike caffeine which spikes your energy levels and then drops you again, Suntheanine keeps you at a comfortable level that will ensure you have sustained energy all day long.

Supplement Facts (Per Serving)

If you have ever struggled with maintaining your energy levels in a world full of pre-workout supplements or if you get really stressed out and can’t seem to chill out, then this is the product is for you, of course it will not work for everyone but you will never know until you try.
2. BulkSupplements Pure L-Theanine Powder
Check the reviews & price
Features
Pure powder.
Relaxing agent.
Non-GMO.
There is good feedback from users of this product that say that this particular brand is of high quality, even though one user mentioned that the product smells a bit like paint, they still rate the product highly, one user also claims that it works better than green tea.
One user stated that they use it daily as it helps calm them down and focus.
It’s like brewing up green tea, smelling it, and drinking it. Except you have the feeling all day long.
Another user tried BulkSupplements L-Theanine to see if it was as good as the former Powder City version.
They claimed it tasted the same and the effect was the same.
They put about 3 grams in a cup of coffee along with CDP Choline and rated as a great product.
BulkSupplements manufactures this product and is a very well-known brand for their diverse range of products and the quality that comes with it, this company really seems to give good value for money.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
250 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.02
Bottom Line
You should definitely try this supplement to see if it works for you, the reviews are endless on how this brand has worked for different people, everyone that has used this product has been pretty satisfied and as it is in the purest form with nothing else added, you know exactly what you are putting into your body. It is above the rest because you get better value for money with a high effectiveness.
3. Now Foods L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Supports cardiovascular function.
Promotes relaxation.
One reviewer tried this product on her cats to try and keep them calm but it seemed not to have worked.
Most other human users found that this product worked well with them with regards to treating ADHD and one even claimed that it cured their sore jaw in the morning due to the relaxing effect that this product has.
Drawbacks will include the fact that dosing instructions are not very clear, as we each need different dosages according to our body weight.
Now FOODS manufacture this product and they sell mainly oils with a bit of supplement thrown into the mix, most of their products are rated high so I don’t see a reason not to try this particular product.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
200 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.21
Bottom Line
This product has good reviews and works for most people but not for cats (which is what they advertise it for); they will have to ensure that they change their label to ensure that people know exactly how much to take and how much is too much. This product is good but does not come close to “Bulk supplements L-Theanine” when it comes to purity coupled with effectiveness.
4. TR Supplements Premium Natural L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Feel more focus.
Jitter-less energy.
Improved attention.
At first glance, by looking at this product I can honestly say that it looks like a quality product without me even trying it.
One user said that they take L-Theanine every morning with coffee to help them stay focused (without Jitters) throughout the day.
They also took another one before bed to relax their muscles, settle their mind, and fall asleep easily and this user preaches that if you have anxiety, restlessness, or trouble focusing, you should definitely give this a try.
Another user claimed not feeling any difference.
They bought the supplement for chronic fatigue syndrome in addition to their future biotics Stress Assist that they have been taking for years.
The drawback here is that this product does not work for everyone and the people that were unsatisfied with the product felt as though they threw their money away.
True Recovery is the manufacturer of this product and they have mainly good reviews from the little products that can be found, only a 79% satisfaction rating which is too low for me to try especially considering the price.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
200 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.14
Bottom Line
I would rather go for something a bit cheaper first like BulkSupplements Pure L-Theanine Powder and then if I was feeling a bit brave, give this product a go.
5. Superior Labs Pure L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Induce relaxation.
Improve brain function.
Support cardiovascular function.
Relieve mental and physical Stress.
I have a good feeling about this product as it claims to be 100%natural and it is FDA approved, if everything is natural I believe that I will get the best benefit out of it.
Some users claimed a bad aftertaste and that the products effects were minimized after a few uses, some users even claim that they had less energy after taking this product.
Superior Labs manufactures this product; I do not trust this company as they send out free bottles to customers in order to get high reviews.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
250 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.26
Bottom Line
I would not recommend this product as it seems to give mediocre results and in my opinion, seems very underdosed from the reviews. Stick to a high quality and value for money supplement such as BulkSupplements Pure L-Theanine Powder.
6. Doctor’s Best Suntheanine L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Promotes relaxation without drowsiness.
May improve sleep.
This product is backed up by scientific facts to educate people on what doses are effective and what is too much, this makes me trust this supplement as it provides me with a lot of information on the supplement itself and not just the product/brand.
One user stated that this set their stomach on fire and tried it three times, each time giving the same result.
They also didn’t notice any calming effects.
Doctor’s Best manufactures this product and most of their other products are rated very high for their effectiveness, I would trust this company as they know what they are talking about in their descriptions which they back by science.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
150 mg of Suntheanine L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.15
Bottom Line
I would not recommend trying this product if you don’t have the budget for it and rather go for Now Foods L-Theanine, I do however like the information that they give on the supplement so I would definitely give it a try.
7. Nature’s Trove L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Promotes relaxation without drowsiness.
Found naturally in green tea.
Natural ingredients.
Users report that this brand is not more or less effective than Suntheanine which they are completely okay with, I have just one concern where one user said that he asked for a certificate of analysis and they failed to comply.
The drawback here is that this product may not be in regulation with health and safety Nature’s Trove is the manufacturer and I would not trust this company as they do not provide the legal documentation required when asked, most of their products are rated high but there are very little customers that have reviewed their products.
Rather look at supplement ranges for BulkSupplements as they have really good and diverse ratings.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
200 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.07
Bottom Line
I will not recommend or try this product as the feedback received back from users is not positive enough to convince me to try this.
8. Jarrow Formulas Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Enzymatically produced Suntheanine.
A unique relaxant prominent in tea.
Supports alpha-wave generation.
The reviews do show that this product is often effective in stressful situations, which tells me that it is quite functional.
This product is not effective for everyone and gave one user a migraine.
Jarrow Formulas manufactures this product and can be trusted due to the many reviews on all of their products; they have many nutritional supplements and products with excellent reviews, but rather go with either BulkSupplements L-Theanine or Now Foods L-Theanine for the same quality at a better price.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
200 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.25
Bottom Line
This product has shown and reviewed as a trusted and beneficial brand, would recommend a try.
9. Enzymatic Therapy L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Suntheanine.
Patented amino acid.
Promotes relaxation.
This product is mediocre at most and one customer had to take a high amount in order to get some effect from it.
One user claimed that the 100mg dose was too little for them but had some noticeable positive experiences with 5-6 pills per day.
The drawbacks here are that if you need to take high doses for it to be effective then it is not very effective at its job.
Enzymatic Therapy manufactured this product but I trust this product as only one person claimed it didn’t work.
For better value for money, rather go with Now Foods L-Theanine.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
100 mg of Suntheanine L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.16
Bottom Line
Overall I would not recommend this product as it is way too expensive especially if you have to take 5-6 pills for effectiveness.
10. SYM Nutrition L-Theanine
Check the reviews & price
Features
Unwavering energy.
Cheaper and faster.
Uncompromising.
80% of reviews are positive which looks good so far but on the other hand, one reviewer stated that they weighed the capsules and they varied in weight greatly.
Drawbacks are that it doesn’t work for everyone and that all the capsules don’t weigh the same.
SYM Nutrition manufactures this product, but I would not trust this company as most of their other products have no reviews at all.
Supplement Facts (Per Serving)
200 mg of L-Theanine
Cost Estimate (Per Serving)
$0.12
Bottom Line
I would not recommend this product at all, the product is cheap but it doesn’t help that you waste your money and you don’t always get the same weight in each serving. Go with BulkSupplements L-Theanine Powder to get the exact weight you need.
Final Thoughts
Buy one of the three recommended supplements in the Quick Recommendation table and you’ll be fine, because they’re premium supplements.
But if you opt for the cheaper supplements from the list, it’s okay too, just don’t expect the same quality.

I’ve been taking this L-Theanine supplement and I’ve really been getting this relaxed feeling. I also noticed I don’t get anxious or giddy all the time like I used to. But I’ve not really tried taking it with caffeine for sharpening my thoughts. I think it would be a good thing to try out though.
