40 Million Americans suffer from Athlete's Foot Fungus every year and around half of them will successfully treat the fungal infection, only to have it return within a couple months. 25% of individuals who suffer from Athlete's Foot Fungus have a systematic condition. This means that they must continually protect their feet from fungus breakouts and from Athlete's Foot Fungus From Returning or they will perpetually suffer the effects of fungus such as: peeling skin under toes, itchy feet, and thick, cracking heels.
Preventing Athlete's Foot and Foot Fungus from returning is an on-going battle.
There are many treatments designed to eliminate Athlete's Foot. The most prominent ones are Anti-Fungal Creams and Sprays. Unlike the treatment of Toenail Fungus, Athlete's Foot Fungus treatments are actually highly effective at eliminating fungus on the skin.
Systematic foot fungus sufferers need to use an anti-fungal agent at least three times a week in order to stop the Athlete's Foot Fungus From returning. For people who suffer from a systematic condition or are worried about contracting another fungal infection widely distributed creams such as Lamisil and Lotromin can have some adverse side effects. Frequent use of creams such as Lamisil and Lotromin can dry out and even irritate the skin. It is essential that if one were to use these treatments on a regular basis in order to prevent future fungal infections that they pair them with another moisturizing foot cream.
It is also not recommended to use Lamisil and Lotromin anti-fungal cream's when one does not show any signs of fungus; even if one has had a fungal infection in the past and the feet are still susceptible to contracting another fungal condition. For this very reason PediMD engineered a Moisturizing Foot Cream that has anit-fungal properties and is designed for everyday use.
