What Exactly Is L-Theanine?
L-Theanine is an amino acid that is found in tea leaves and various mushrooms. It can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, creating positive effects on the brain. Once in the brain, it helps stimulate the production of certain neurotransmitters, such as L-Glutamine.
It also increases GABA production, which helps decrease stress levels, creating a more calm sense of self. At lower doses, L-Theanine can help improve your ability to focus. When taken in larger doses, it can help you increase calming effects. This is why L-Theanine is of great interest to individuals that suffer from anxiety and depression.
Users typically like L-Theanine, becomes it’s a more natural supplement. It helps boost levels of serotonin and dopamine as well. Not only is used for cognitive purposes, but it also benefits one’s immune system. Due to it’s overall effects on one’s health, it is a great addition to many stacks.
How Does L-Theanine Benefit the Effects of Caffeine?
When L-Theanine and caffeine are taken together, they increase the benefits of one another. Many of the undesirable effects of caffeine, are counteracted by L-Theanine’s inhibitory properties. When taken together, users are able to rest, maintain their attention span, reduce jitters, and control hyperactive energy.
This stack helps improve one’s visual acuity, mental focus, alertness, muscle dexterity, reaction times, memory recall, and more. These amplified benefits are due to this effective stack. When taken together, they provide twice as many positive results.
Are There Any Safety Concerns?
When caffeine is consumed in large doses, it does create some undesirable effects. Too much caffeine can disrupt sleeping patterns, while increasing your risk of cardiac arrhythmias. You can also experience feelings of nausea and diarrhea. Although these effects tend to dissipate after a few hours, they’re not desirable.
When L-Theanine is introduced to the mix, it helps eliminate these effects. L-Theanine itself does not have any major side-effects. When combined with caffeine, it decreases the severity of caffeine’s side-effects. Since L-Theanine is water soluble, the body simply eliminates whatever it doesn’t need. This means that no toxicity will occur.
Whenever you begin taking a new nootropic, it’s important to start with low doses. You’ll want to see how your body reacts. Once you’re familiar with your body’s reaction, you can increase the dosage. Start with a 1:1 ratio of caffeine and L-Theanine. Then, gradually increase the amount of L-Theanine.
What’s the Best Possible Dosage?
On average, the most common dose for this stack is a 2:1 ratio. Consume two parts L-Theanine and one part caffeine. Some users have experienced great success at a 4:1 ratio. These users consume 400 mg of L-Theanine and 100 milligrams of caffeine. One cup of coffee generally has about 100 mg of caffeine.
As mentioned above, it’s important to get familiar with the way your body personally reacts. If you drink coffee on a regular basis, you may have already developed a tolerance. It’s important that you keep your caffeine doses below 400 mg in one day.
Aim between 50 mg and 400 g daily, when taken with L-Theanine. If you take more, you increase your risk of complications. You could affect you heartbeat and interfere with your regular sleeping patterns. Getting enough sleep is essential for your overall health.
If you’re already a coffee drinker, try reducing your intake over the course of two weeks. Then when you introduce L-Theanine, you will experience the best effects. As always, speak with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.
What Other Stacks Are Effective?
You’re not just limited to caffeine and L-Theanine in terms of beneficial stacks. As mentioned, caffeine and L-Theanine are great for beginners. If you’re looking for something more advanced, then you can try one of the following stacks:
Piracetam, Oxiracetam, and Aniracetam
This stack is known as PAO, as it incorporates three nootropics from the racetams family. All of the options increase your mental performance, however they each provide a unique benefit. Piracetam improves learning and memory; Aniracetam boosts mood; and Oxiracetam increases your processing power.
Most of the time, users only take one of these options. Taking all three can increase the benefits that are experienced. To counteract potential side-effects (such as headaches), add a choline supplement to this stack. This will help increase acetylcholine levels.
Noopept and Citicoline
This stack is great in terms of value. The effects experienced, are provided at a low cost. Purchasing Noopept may seem more expensive, but it’s very cheap in terms of a single dose. This is because Noopept is approximately 1000 times stronger than Piracetam. Adding Citicoline to this stack, helps boost acetylcholine levels as discussed above.

What Is L-Theanine? How Does it Work?
L-Theanine is derived from tea leaves. It is an amino acid, which was discovered in 1949. In 1950, it was first derived from gyokuro leaves, as they have a high theanine content. The chemical structure of L-Theanine is very similar to tryptophan (which is an essential amino acid).
Once consumed, it crosses the blood-brain barrier. Within the brain tissue, it targets neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters regulate stress, pleasure, attention, and arousal. GABA for instance, helps create a sense of calmness, reducing feelings of anxiety.
GABA essentially stops neurons from over-firing. This is what creates a feeling of relaxation. Taking a L-Theanine supplement also helps produce the neurotransmitter serotonin, which helps control sleep patterns and mood. Dopamine is also affected, making us feel good.

The Benefits of L-Theanine
There are a wide variety of benefits regarding L-Theanine supplementation. It improves mood, positively affects focus and mental performance, and eases symptoms of anxiety and depression. L-Theanine combines all the best qualities of nootropics, as it’s a great addition to an daily wellness regimen.
Mental Benefits
The most powerful effects of L-Theanine are produced by limiting specific neurotransmitters, which cause stress and hinder mental clarity. As mentioned, GABA is produced, calming the body and mind. This is achieved by blocking parts of the brain that receive messages regarding stress.
L-Theanine also blocks L-glutamic acid, not allowing it to bind to glutamate receptors. This reduces our ‘fight or flight’ reaction. This is an innate ability, allowing us to choose the best option in a stressful situation. It is deeply rooted in our ancestors, as they were exposed to danger on a regular basis.
Since glutamic acid is known as an excitatory chemical, it has been linked to seizures. When this neurotransmitter is less stimulated, feelings of calmness increase Basically, it has the ability to calm the mind, avoiding over-excitement and stimulation.
Physical Benefits
Our mental health is linked to our physical health. Heart and brain health go hand-in-hand. The benefits experienced within the mind, are also experienced throughout the rest of your body. Mental focus and muscle function are linked. This is seen within basketball players, as they’re able to coordinate muscles and movement with mental focus.
L-Theanine also lowers one’s heart rate, reducing blood pressure. This improves overall circulation, which is beneficial to many internal systems. When this circulation increases, it has been shown to positively affect lung capacity and arthritis pain.
Benefits for Focus and Creativity
Our brain’s produce natural alpha waves. These waves are electrical frequencies, which tend to accompany periods of creativity and mental focus. L-Theanine increases the generation of alpha waves, leaving users feeling inspired and productive.
Similar effects have been seen within Modafinil use. This drug is generally known under the name Provigil. It is considered to be safe, however most people prefer L-Theanine. This is because it is a natural supplement, being more gentle in comparison.
What are the Side-Effects?
L-Theanine does not have any significant side-effects. It does not cause headaches, withdrawal effects, confusion, or any other associated effect. There hasn’t been a case recorded regarding L-Theanine overdose. This is no surprise, as this compound has been ingested for thousands of years.
Some individuals are sensitive to green tea in terms of their stomach. If this is the case, it’s best for you to supplement; ingesting capsules orally. Finding the right dose for you can take some time. Like any supplement, it’s best to start with a low dose.
You can gradually increase your dose over time. Most people find that 50 mg daily is the minimum dose required. A common dosage is 200 mg per day, but some take up to 400 mg. Tolerance has not been recorded as an issue. In fact, nootropics are known to produce less tolerance in comparison to pharmaceuticals.
L-Theanine and Caffeine in a Stack
The combination of L-Theanine and caffeine is a popular stack. L-Theanine and caffeine are commonly consumed within green tea. Unlike coffee, green tea does not create hyperactivity, followed by a crash. This is why these two balance one another so well.
When this combination is used, the benefits of each supplement are amplified. The drawbacks of caffeine (jitters for example) are eliminated when consumed with L-Theanine. This is due to its relaxing, calming effects.
Taking this stack for cognition is beneficial. It is said to increase mental focus, alertness, reaction time, memory recall, attention, and visual acuity. This stack is most beneficial when taken as follows: 2 parts L-Theanine and 1 part caffeine.
However, some even use as much as 4 parts L-Theanine to 1 part caffeine. A popular dose is 400 mg of L-Theanine and 100 mg of caffeine. A standard cup of coffee has approximately 100 mg of caffeine. If you’re an experienced coffee drinker, you may have a slight tolerance.
If this is the case, you can increase your caffeine dose. However, do not exceed 300 mg daily. At high doses, you can affect your heart rate. Like any supplement, speak with your doctor if you have any questions of concerns.
