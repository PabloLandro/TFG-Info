Tick bite?
Tick bite?
If you’ve been bitten by a tick:
1. If the tick is attached to you, remove it right away. Use a pointy tick removal tweezer and disinfect with rubbing alcohol. Grab tick close to the skin and use a slow, steady motion to pull the tick out. Disinfect the tweezers and your skin with alcohol after removing the tick. Do not use a match or vaseline to remove the tick. Avoid jerking motions, and do not squeeze the body of the tick, as this can release bacteria. (If you’re in the Monterey area and you find a tick attached to you, please call our office right away. We will have you come in so we can remove it and send it for testing.)
2. After you remove the tick, save it! Ticks can be tested in the lab to see which diseases they carry, and identifying what kind of tick it is can help the doctor decide what tests you may need. You can store the tick in a jar or presciption bottle and bring it to your appointment.
3. Make an appointment with Dr. Wright as soon as possible. It is best to be seen within 48 hours of a tick bite. Call our office at (831) 717-4444.
4. Monitor yourself for symptoms of tick-borne infection, including fever, chills, night sweats, headache, rashes, and joint/muscle pain. During your appointment, let Dr. Wright know about any symptoms you’ve experienced.
