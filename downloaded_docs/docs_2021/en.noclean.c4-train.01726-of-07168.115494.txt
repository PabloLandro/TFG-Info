Best Ankle Braces For Cricket
HOW AM I ABLE TO PREVENT OR AVOID AN ANKLE INJURY DURING CRICKET?
Sharp sprints, high impact with the ball, repetitive motions, twisting and putting extreme force on the ankle are common causes of injury for cricketers. Minimise your chances of injury with a Bauerfeind ankle brace, providing enhanced stability, proprioception and medical-grade compression.
Some common forms of ankle injuries include ligament tears and sprains, stress fractures, Achilles tendonitis and heel pain. Bauerfeind ankle braces help to promote blood flow with the use of medical grade compression, something not found when using simple neoprene sleeves and braces. A good ankle brace for cricket is the MalleoTrain, which provides support and stability. Protect your ankles with a Bauerfeind ankle brace without limitations to batting, bowling, and being quick between wickets.
HOW TO TREAT COMMON ANKLE INJURIES FROM CRICKET
We recommend visiting a physiotherapist for treatment and advice on treating common cricket injuries. They may recommend the following treatments.
Ligament Tearing. Ligament tears generally always require surgery. A torn ligament rebuild uses a graft of tissue, as the ligament will not typically heal properly otherwise. Surgery is minimally invasive, however it can take time for the tear to heal.
Stress Fractures. A stress fracture is caused by overuse or repetitive movements that leads to a small crack or bruising in a bone. Refraining from high impact activities and allowing optimal time for recovery is recommended. The RICE method and anti-inflammatory medications will also be beneficial.
Achilles Tendonitis. Symptoms of Achilles Tendonitis such as pain and swelling above the heel often occurs following prolonged periods due to constant loading on the ankle. Adequate rest and non-surgical treatments can usually relieve these symptoms.
Play it safe: Consult a doctor if you experience unusually intense and persistent tendonitis pain.

Stop playing immediately and apply a cold compress or ice pack to the area to reduce swelling. If the pain persists for a few days, seek medical attention to check for potential injury.
