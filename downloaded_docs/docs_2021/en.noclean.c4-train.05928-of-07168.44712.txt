If you're someone who has someone who has some scarring issues, then you may have heard that Vitamin E for scars is one of the best things that you can do for your skin. Vitamin E has got a pretty good rap, I do have to admit, and it can sound really good for these sorts of things. However, is Vitamin E what it's all cracked up to be, or it is just another scam that actually doesn't work?
Well, I'm sorry to say that if you want to use Vitamin E for scars you probably aren't going to have that much success. The Vitamin does lots of really great things, such as blood thinning, however removing and fixing scars probably isn't one of them. It's claimed to because it can stimulate collagen (something which contributes to the elasticity of your skin) production, however in studies done, this just isn't the case.
Studies have been done on burn victims who have recently undergone reconstructive surgery to see if the Vitamin can reduce the scarring that occurs. Two groups were formed, one which used a Vitamin E cream and the other a different formula which had no medical benefit. At the end of the trial period (about 10 weeks) there was no noticeable difference in scars between the two groups on average.
The scars were the same width and color and texture. In fact, in some cases, the scars were worse then they should have been for someone healing naturally. It's been put down the fact that healing skin requires oxygen, and lathering up the scars with a cream (regardless of whether it was Vitamin E for scars) prevents that healing process from taking place.
So, should you use Vitamin E for scars? Well, if you've been using it before and it seems to be helping you, then I'm not about to be stopping you at all. However, if you've never used Vitamin E for scars before, then it's probably something that's best left alone for now. There are far better and far more effective ways to reduce scarring, including natural remedies.
For more great scar solutions, make sure you visit The Scar Solution Review for a great guide on the best, most natural ways to remove scarring. And if I haven't quite convinced you that Vitamin E for scars isn't the way to go about things, take a look at my blog posting.
