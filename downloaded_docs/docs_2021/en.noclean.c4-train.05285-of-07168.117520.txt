But current research suggests that more adults may have it than once thought. AD is also sometimes called eczema. There is no cure.

New Treatment Options for Those With Atopic Dermatitis
AAFA Community Services · 10/30/172:40 PM
If you think only infants suffer from eczema, think again. The uncomfortable, itchy rash that most people relate to babies and young children occurs frequently in adults. Although many adults with atopic dermatitis (commonly known as eczema) develop the disease in childhood and carry it through life, a large number are first diagnosed in adulthood – a trend being discussed at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting.

October Is Eczema Awareness Month
AAFA Community Services · 10/2/182:47 PM
If you have eczema , or care for someone who does, you know it can be a frustrating disease. This skin condition can be embarrassing, uncomfortable and tricky to manage. Atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, affects about 16.5 million Americans. Those who have it know it’s much more than “dry skin,” “sensitive skin” or a “rash.” But many who aren’t familiar with eczema don’t realize the social, emotional and financial impact it can have on people and families who manage it.

Welcome One Woman. I don't know that it has been approved for dyshidrotic eczema, but it's worth talking to the doctor. Have you figured out any triggers that make it worse?

Re: New Eczema Drug Dupixent Approved by FDA
OneWoman · 4/1/179:22 PM
I was just wondering if anyone has any knowledge or experience with Dupixent and Dyshidrotic Eczema? I have had it for almost 2 years now. I have tried everything I know to do, as well as Rx creams from my Dr., and nothing helps...not even a little. The skin on my hands (back, front, sides, all fingers- sides, top, bottom) is so thick and itches so bad all the time. The only way I can relieve the itching is by popping the blisters. I'm about to go insane. I don't know what to do. The subject...

Re: These Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis Can Be the Most Frustrating
StuffywithCare · 10/15/188:41 PM
Hi. I was unaware that atopic dermatitis has the symptom of sleep disturbance. Is the sleep problem due to the discomfort caused by the other symptoms or is the sleep problem a separate symptom? My 21-year-old has a small amount of eczema and he has trouble sleeping. He has never blamed the eczema for his sleep problems. Could there be a connection? Thank you.

Hi @StuffywithCare , thanks for your blog comment! It's possible that there is a connection. Have you mentioned his sleep issues to his doctor? Here's an article from the American Academy of Dermatology that may answer some of your questions. Although the article is targeted to parents of small children, the information is relevant for anyone with eczema. The article also mentions, " When eczema itches, it can keep a child awake or wake the child from a sound sleep." What Can Help a Child...

How Do You Treat Your Eczema?
AAFA Community Services · 10/31/1812:42 PM
There are a variety of treatments for eczema, including creams and ointments. But your doctor may also recommend moisturizing methods, like "soak and seal" and "wet wrapping." These therapies can help your topical medicines be more effective. Everyone's eczema is different, and there are many ways you can manage flare-ups. Talk to your doctor about therapies that may work best for you.
