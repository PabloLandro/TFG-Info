Buy on Amazon
If you’ve got heavy-duty scars or just want to soothe scars fast with potent ingredients, reach for Puriderma’s Scar Removal Cream. It uses a combination of herbal extracts like chamomile, dandelion, and aloe to gently remove unwanted scars.
It may also improve your skin’s elasticity and its overall texture and appearance. This cream works wonders on every skin type from dry to oily to sensitive, and it shrinks old or new scars from burns, cuts, surgery, and more.
Best Budget: Mederma Advanced Scar Gel
Buy on AmazonBuy on WalmartBuy on Target
Mederma’s ubiquitous scar cream is easy to find at the drugstore or online, and it's less expensive than many other scar creams on the market. This topical gel is clinically proven to reduce the overall appearance, color, and texture of scars. It works on both older and newer scars, burns, surgery scars, acne scars, and more. You only have to apply it once a day to reap the benefits, and with regular use over the course of four weeks, you should notice a positive difference.
Best for Acne Scars: Puriderma Acne Scar Removal Cream
Buy on Amazon
Acne is a common yet complex skin condition. It can strike at any age, affect almost any part of your body, and it can leave deep scars long after you’ve conquered it. You may need to consult a dermatologist for treating some types of scars, but if you’re mostly struggling with discoloration or smaller marks, talk to your doctor about using Puriderma’s Acne Scar Removal Cream.
This powerful topical treatment reduces the appearance of both old and new scars with a gentle, chemical-free formula. Much like Puriderma’s regular Scar Removal Cream, it uses extracts like dandelion, aloe, and chamomile to soothe irritated skin and shrink acne scars. It may also soften your skin and improve your skin’s overall texture, making your acne scars a thing of the past.
Best for Kids: Mederma for Kids Gel Skin Care for Scars
Buy on AmazonBuy on Jet
Any parent knows that bumps, bruises, and accidents are a part of growing up—but the resulting scars don’t have to be. Mederma makes a special gel treatment for children’s scars that makes treatment a little less scary.
This gel is approved for kids ages two to 12, and it goes on purple for a fun splash of color when your child isn't feeling their best. It massages in clear and won’t stain clothes or furniture. The formula helps soften and smooth your child’s skin without irritation. Massaging in this gel three times a day for several weeks will leave your kid’s scar in the dust.
Best for Burns: MD Performance Professional Skincare Ultimate Scar Formula
Buy on Amazon
Burns happen, and they’re never fun. You'll need to treat your burn as soon as possible and contact your doctor to be certain you're treating it correctly. However, burns don’t have to stay with you forever. This pick uses powerful silicone to reduce resulting scars.
This dermatologist-formulated blend is designed to fade burn scars for smoother skin with a finer texture. Medical-grade silicone is accepted as one of the best non-surgical treatments for burn scars, and this cream has plenty. It blends easily, and it should begin improving your scar’s appearance within two months of twice-daily treatments.
Best for Old Scars: Honeydew Anti-Aging Scar Cream for Face & Body
Buy on Amazon
The pain that came with an old scar may have faded, but that doesn’t mean that you don’t have a mark left behind that you’d like to diminish. Honeydew’s Anti-Aging Scar Cream is Amazon’s Choice for treating old scars.
This potent blend contains enriching avocado, coconut, and jojoba oils for superior moisturizing power and anti-aging properties. Vitamin E soothes older scars, while shea butter and rosehip improve your skin’s elasticity and texture. The cream is designed to play well with sensitive skin for daily use, and it’s free of drying chemicals, parabens, and harsh additives that would negatively affect your scar’s healing.
Best for Body: Derma E Scar Gel
Buy on AmazonBuy on Jet
Scars can occur anywhere on your body, but finding a cream that’s tough enough to tackle scars on your legs or arms without causing irritation is tough. Derma E’s gel softens and smoothes scars for healthier, smoother skin.
This cream’s botanical extract contains vitamin B5 for a gentle yet powerful approach to treating your body’s scars. The cruelty-free, gluten-free, and GMO-free formula encourages healthy skin by resolving burns and discoloration without irritation.
Best for Surgical Scars: Scarless MD Advanced Silicone Scar Removal Cream
Buy on Amazon
Surgery is an exhausting endeavor on its own, and waiting for your body to recover afterward adds even more stress. Surgical scars are notoriously difficult to get rid of, but Scarless MD’s Advanced Silicone Scar Removal Cream can help fade your post-surgery marks.
Silicone is considered a first-line treatment for scars. Self-adhesive silicone gel sheets have long been a go-to for fading scars, but silicone creams can be just as effective. Using this cream about one to two weeks after your stitches have been removed can give you a head-start on scar removal.
It contains 100 percent pure medical-grade silicone, which helps your skin heal while maintaining moisture for a flatter, less noticeable mark. Additional ingredients, like Vitamin E and antioxidants, add even more scar-fighting power to this cream. Post-surgery customers on Amazon loved this powerful cream’s effects, saying that it reduced or eliminated scars from tummy tucks, hip replacements, and even open heart surgery.
Our Process
Our writers spent 5 hours researching the most popular scar creams on the market. Before making their final recommendations, they considered 20 different creams overall, screened options from 17 different brands and manufacturers, read over 33 user reviews (both positive and negative) and tested 1 of the creams themselves. All of this research adds up to recommendations you can trust.
