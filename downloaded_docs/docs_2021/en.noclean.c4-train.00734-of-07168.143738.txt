Description
Evening primrose oil comes from the seeds of the wildflower Oenothera biennis, which grows throughout the United States. The species varies in size from small plants 10 centimeters tall to vigorous lowland species growing to 3 meters. The leaves form a basal rosette at ground level and spiral up to the flowering stems. The blades are deeply lobed, and the flowers open in the evening, hence the name “evening primrose”. The flowers may open in under one minute and, vary in color from yellow, white, purple, pink or red.
Evening Primrose oil has been labeled as the most incredible preventative discovery since vitamin C!
