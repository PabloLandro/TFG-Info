HELP STOP MIGRAINE HEADACHES ‚Äì With Magnesium
My daughters have all had challenges with migraines in the last couple of years. I really hadn‚Äôt cared much until they became a real part of our daily lives. When I realized that a lot of migraines come about simply because the body doesn‚Äôt get enough magnesium, we began to consciously take extra.

A lot of research has proven that without sufficient magnesium our bodies hurt a lot, the muscles don‚Äôt function right and are likely to spasm. We are likely to experience more stress and may not be able to sleep well. Getting enough magnesium is vital to help prevent and ‚Äútreat‚Äù migraine headaches.
To prevent these, try to keep a diet rich in these natural substances, such as dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, beans, brown rice, quinoa, avocados, yogurt, bananas, dried fruit and last but definitely not least, dark chocolate. üòÄ
Magnesium supplements may also prove necessary. Because some oral magnesium can cause challenges to the intestinal system ‚Äì at times acting like a laxative ‚Äì we have found that Magnesium oil or lotion at times may a better option. It can be rubbed directly on a tense neck, or other parts of the body. The Dead Sea magnesium oil has been a real help to our family without causing any intestinal distress.
One oral magnesium supplement that works quickly and does not cause intestinal distress is Angstrom Magnesium. It is a liquid and placed under the tongue, the nano particles rapidly enter the blood stream.
You can also take a bath with Epson salts in the water. Epson salts are another form of magnesium that does not harm the intestinal system.
Oral magnesium supplements are easily excreted from the body, so it is rare to overdose unless you have impaired kidney function.
Since all three of my daughters have suffered from migraines, we found magnesium to be one of the most beneficial helpers.
Through research we‚Äôve also discovered that there are other natural substances that have been shown to be of benefit in fighting migraines. These include Niacin (vitamin B3) and Feverfew.
We also started dabbing Peppermint Essential Oil directly the temple or neck. It is cooling and refreshing. You might also consider using doTERRA PastTense which is known for it‚Äôs ‚Äúsoothing effects on both the mind and body, the essential oils in PastTense quickly, promote feelings of relaxation and calm emotions.‚Äù These can both be purchased through my own doTERRA website.
Hopefully these simple tips may be helpful in fighting those nasty headaches.

Great tip! And it is very true. When I was having issues with my thyroid, I experienced the worst headaches of my life. My naturopathic doctor advised me to take Magnesium supplements, and the headaches improved significantly!
And I‚Äôd much rather be taking Magnesium than lots of Tylenol üôÇ

It is pretty amazing, isn‚Äôt it? Magnesium has so many uses in our body for well being, and from all I‚Äôve read, it is rare to overdose from it.

I agree. Magnesium is pretty great stuff. I take magnesium in a powdered drink form that helps with both sleep and digestion issues that I have. Really don‚Äôt want to be without it. I‚Äôm surprised I don‚Äôt hear more buzz about it.
