Migraine management tips
Avoid migraines by eating regularly
It's not always easy to maintain a balanced diet, especially if you're juggling the demands of work and family. But fasting or dieting can bring on a migraine attack, so if you're prone to migraines, it's essential that you eat at regular intervals. Be sure to pack some snacks in your purse, briefcase or glove compartment, and drink lots of water throughout the day.
Ease stress to keep migraines away
Whether it's exercising (which has all sorts of other benefits, of course), going for a massage, taking a walk or just enjoying a warm bath, know what calms you down - and then commit to doing it. Stress management can go a long way towards preventing migraines.
Prevent migraines by getting enough sleep
When you get a migraine, you may just want to close your eyes and go to bed. That may seem like the best way to deal with your symptoms, but in the long run, a better idea would be to ensure that you get enough sleep every night (most people need 7-8 hours) to prevent migraine headache occurrence. You also want to make an effort to go to bed and get up at the same time every day (and resist the urge to sleep in on weekends).
Use proper lighting to keep migraines at bay
Straining your eyes may not just be uncomfortable; for some people it may bring on a migraine headache. If you spend a lot of time in front of a computer, invest in an anti-glare screen and a good desk lamp. When reading, especially in bed, make sure you have bright enough lighting. What's more, poor posture in bed when reading or watching TV is also something that can cause a migraine. The best position (although maybe not the most natural) is to actually sit up.
Get your eyes checked to steer clear of migraines
When was the last time you had your eyes examined or your glasses' prescription changed? You may be overdue for a visit to your eye doctor or optometrist. Along with poor lighting, straining your eye muscles on a regular basis can lead to headaches.
Take deep breaths to elude migraines
While you may not always be able to find the time to go to a yoga class, you can definitely fit in a few deep breaths, no matter where you are. Oxygen helps with migraines, so whether you're on the bus or at your desk, go ahead and breathe in and out slowly a few times. You'll immediately feel more relaxed.
Identify and avoid migraine triggers
Many people know what their migraine triggers are, but others need the help of a tracker to help them figure out what they were doing, eating or taking (some medicines can cause migraines) when they had an attack. Check out the list of migraine triggers to help you identify yours.
