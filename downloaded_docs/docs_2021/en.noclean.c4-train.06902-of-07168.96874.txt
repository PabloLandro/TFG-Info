Aromatherapy for Arthritis
By Andrew Krieger
Medically Reviewed by Farrokh Sohrabi, MD
Essential oils have more to offer than just a pleasant scent — they can also provide arthritis relief. Here are six that may be worth a try.
About 40 percent of American adults currently use some type of alternative or complementary therapy to help manage health conditions. And if you’re battling arthritis, you may just be one of them. Aromatherapy, which uses essential plant oils, is one approach gaining in popularity because of its pleasant smells and potential anti-inflammatory effects — a perfect combination for easing joint pain from arthritis. Keep in mind that because research on aromatherapy is limited, you should be sure to talk with your doctor before starting any new regimen to find out about side effects and possible interactions with your current medications.
Eucalyptus
Most of us know eucalyptus as an ingredient in cough drops and some over-the-counter topical medications, but you can also add aromatherapy to the list of its uses. According to Scott Zashin, MD, a board-certified rheumatologist and a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, this essential oil has solid evidence to back up its pain relief effect. “It has a soothing aroma and has been shown to have benefit with pain," he notes. This would be a good oil for your aromatherapy rotation — maybe for a midday recharge when your joint pain from arthritis is acting up.
Lavender
Lavender oil aromatherapy has been used for some time to reduce stress and lessen anxiety. That could make it helpful for osteoarthritis too. “Anything that helps you relax will help with your pain and, over time, is going to give you a little boost," says Dr. Zashin. The next time you're ready for some planned decompression, break out the lavender oil for a little extra arthritis relief. Easing your stress may do your joint pain a world of good.
Helichrysum
Inflammation is one of the main problems associated with arthritis that can lead to joint pain. Helichrysum oil has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect that may help lessen arthritis symptoms. A diffuser full of this oil on your desk can add a nice aroma to your work space and might lessen arthritis pain as the day wears on.
Orange Oil
A study from Hong Kong on knee pain showed that massage with ginger oil and orange oil relieved joint pain in the knees of elderly people. The scent of orange oil has also been found to reduce anxiety and improve mood under stressful situations, such as during dental visits. You can try rubbing orange oil into your affected joints when your arthritis is flaring up. The added benefit of aromatherapy follows as the oil evaporates from your skin and wafts into your nostrils.
Ginger
Ginger has had many medicinal uses over the years — when you were a kid, your parents may have given you ginger ale to settle an upset stomach. According to the National Institutes of Health, ginger may also have a role in treating arthritis pain. Ginger oil can be set out near your comfiest chair for aromatherapy or be rubbed into achy joints as part of massage therapy. A warm compress soaked with some diluted oil may also soothe arthritis pain.
Vanilla
The jury is still out on vanilla oil aromatherapy for arthritis pain, but that shouldn’t necessarily stop you from trying it. “Relaxation is one of the mind-body things we do to help with arthritis pain," Zashin says. In other words, what puts the mind at ease will help the body as well. Adding some bath salts with vanilla extract to your next soak is a great way to relax the mind, ease stress, and perhaps lessen joint pain.
