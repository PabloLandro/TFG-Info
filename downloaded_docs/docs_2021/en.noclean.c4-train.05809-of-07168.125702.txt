Aromatherapy Massage
Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils distilled from plants to improve physical and emotional wellbeing.
Aromatherapy oils are used through the mediums of massage, bathing, vaporisation and inhalation. However aromatherapists most frequently use essential oils in massage.
An aromatherapy massage consists of a short consultation, blending of essential oils tailored to the individual followed by a massage incorporating Swedish, deep tissue and acupressure techniques.
Aromatherapy massage is good for a wide range of complaints that include stress, insomnia, depression, poor circulation, digestive disorders, aches and pains, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, hormonal imbalances and low energy.
