Why Should You Trust Us?
Let me first explain why you should trust Supplemania. We have been running scientific based product research for 60 months. In other words, we have the experience to give you the right information about the best quality evening primrose oil reviews.
Our major goal is to help you, our valued reader, with picking the product that is right for you. We have put in over 17 hours of research on Evening Primrose oil acne, for skin, evening primrose hair loss, and other problems.
We’ve used several different people, including a team of dedicated volunteers, and have eliminated any subjective or biased reviews. We have also reviewed different brands of evening primrose oil. This shows that we are not biased towards or trying to promote any specific brand.
We chose and reviewed different brands and over 25 different products before making a shortlist of 20 of the best. After that, we further researched and compared the results so that we could select the top 10 and placed them in this review.
Further, we have selected and picked only those Evening Primrose products that actually supports and promotes healing of psoriasis, eczema, helped in maintaining prostaglandin levels, promoted balanced immune response, relieve symptoms of PCOS and PMS, acted as a hormonal acne and cystic acne treatment, helped with bloating, decreased wrinkle and many more.
All the products we picked are also suitable for both men and women and for any age group.
What is Evening Primrose?
Evening primrose oil is a supplement made from the seeds of a plant named Evening Primrose. It is a wildflower which is now being domesticated in Mexico and the US. The flower itself is pretty but not overly so; but healers have known of its healing powers for a long time.
Native American healers would use the whole plant to treat illness. The leaves could be boiled to make a tea as a stimulant like coffee. The roots were ground and mixed with animal fat to treat such things as hemorrhoids and boils. They also believed that chewed primrose, or primrose rubbed onto the skin would increase strength and vigor.
Originally, other uses were to treat minor injuries such as bruises, cuts and other skin conditions. Today, it is used for many other uses as well. Some practitioners have found that it helps with the hot flashes associated with menopause, breast swelling and soreness after giving birth, PMS, PCOS, and even acne.
There are currently three ways that you can use evening primrose: Tablets, Oil (rubbed directly onto the skin) or in a softgels form. It is important to remember it must be kept out of direct sun, and that it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to six months. Always be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
Agricultural practice regarding primrose is new and currently only the production of the plants seed oil is being commercialized. Evening primrose was and still is considered a wildflower. The tiny seeds need 21 days to form before they can be harvested and made into oil.
Benefits of Evening Primrose
Evening Primrose oil is known for helping to fight inflammation of the skin and to help those who have skin that may react to other commercially prepared treatments. Full of Omega 6, this awesome oil can form an amazing skin barrier for those who have eczema or other types of atopic dermatitis.
Once it is extracted from the seeds of the primrose plant, it contains up to 85% linoleic acid, 12% oleic acid and gamma-linoleic acid, 4% stearic acid, and 10% palmitic acid. What all these ‘acids’ do is to aid in the stabilization of prostaglandins, cytokines, and leukotrienes. In plain English, these are the agents which can cause the immune system to stumble and create a response which causes inflammation.
This is why it is reported to help with such conditions as cystic acne and other skin conditions. It works by reducing the redness and swelling which comes along with these conditions, making the skin look less irritated. There are other skin conditions which it can help too.
Take, for instance, wrinkles. We all face these sure signs of aging. In men, they are deemed to be ‘character’ lines. In women, they are signs of the aging process. Actually, what is happening is as we all age, the collagen, which is the proteins which give skin its firmness and youthful look either breaks down or is not produced in quantities as high as in younger years.
Evening Primrose Oil stimulates this production naturally, so the appearance of a wrinkle looks less noticeable. It has also been proven to help to rebuild the collagen in our skin and therefore prevents the future lines and crows’ feet we all tend to gather as we age.
Other problems, such as menopause, bloating, PMS, and PCOS are also associated with the instability of prostaglandins in our systems. These signs and symptoms can strike women at any age. Some of these are considered age associated, while others affect women of child bearing years. Evening primrose can help to also stimulate the sex-related hormone production and help to alleviate the accompanying signs and symptoms.
While these conditions are not really a deficiency in relation to thing like vitamin deficiency, they do have signs and symptoms, such as bloating, increased wrinkles, decreased skin elasticity and skin problems. If you are suffering from any of these, could the best quality Evening Primrose Oil help you? Read on to find out!
Evening Primrose supplements are found in many forms on the market. You can use oil, lotion, capsules or soft gels.
Lotion and oils can be used directly on the skin. These are good for skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, cystic acne, wrinkles, and such things. They work on the top of your skin and do not work systemically. In other words, they are mainly for skin problems.
Capsules and soft gels, on the other hand, treat the whole body more intensely than if you just rubbed it on affected areas. In other words, once ingested, it is absorbed like other nutrients from your intestines and circulates through the body in your bloodstream.
Most experts recommend the soft gels or capsules for problems like PMS, PCOS, wrinkles and other medical conditions. It will also work for acne, psoriasis, and eczema. Essentially, when taken by mouth, it treats the condition from the inside out, rather than just on the surface.
Side effects- Evening Primrose Supplements?
According to some sources, evening primrose oil is meant to be taken for only a short amount of time. There are also some sources which state that the use of this supplement isn’t supported by any research, but the same sources state is probably safe to do so.
Safety and side effects
Remember to take Evening Primrose oil only for short term and to take in the amount as listed on the label. This supplement, even at the recommended dosage can cause some symptoms such as stomach upset and/or headache.
It is also ill advised to take this supplement if you have a problem with bleeding or clotting of the blood. If you have surgery planned, no matter how minor, you should stop taking evening primrose 14 days before the surgery happens.
If you have a seizure disorder or have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The use of this supplement may increase the risk of seizure like activity. Also, do not take if expecting a baby, due to the risks of complications.
Interactions
As with every drug or medication, there is the chance of interactions between evening primrose and drug which may affect the clotting of the blood. These include: anticoagulants and anti-platelet medications, herbal remedies and supplements. These substances in addition to evening primrose may increase the risk of bleeding and reduce clotting times.
Lovastatin or Altoprev which is a medication which helps to lower cholesterol. It too can interact with evening primrose oil. Also, Lopinavir and ritonavir, which is a combination of medications which is used to treat HIV should not be taken with Evening Primrose oil as it may slow down how fast the medication is used by the body.
The good news is that the best quality Evening Primrose oil may help in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic nerve disorders. However, some research has cast some down of its effectiveness in the treatment of some skin conditions, menopausal symptoms, breast pain, or multiple sclerosis (MS).
Evening primrose oil may be effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and diabetic nerve disorders, but its usefulness is not clear in the resolution of eczema, menopausal symptoms, breast tenderness, or multiple sclerosis.
What is the recommended dosage?
In some clinical trials, Evening Primrose oil has been given by mouth at doses between 6-8 grams per day for adults and between 2-4 grams a day for children. The normal concentration of the active ingredients in the oil is between 8-10%.
Contraindications
No contraindications have not yet been identified. There is ongoing research but as this was written there have been no contraindications documented.
Pregnancy/Lactation
The safety and effectiveness when used during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been tested or proven. However, both oral and intravaginal evening primrose oil for preparing the cervix for birth one week prior to labor, has shown some minor complications.
Children born after this application did experience bleeding under the skin, which resolved shortly after delivery. Research has also found both active agents in breast milk, even if the mother does not take it by mouth, so it is relatively safe to believe that evening primrose oil is safe to use while lactating.
Toxicology
No toxicity, promotion of cancer, or birth defects have been reported.
Conclusion
As with any drug, supplement, or herbal remedy, it is important to remember that there are different reactions and different results. Each person is different and while one substance maybe harmless to one subject, another may suffer allergies or other untoward effects.
Remember to follow the instructions, warnings, and disclaimers on the product. For example, if you should have increased redness, irritation or discomfort occurs while using the product, discontinue use and contact your professional care provider as soon as possible. It is also suggested that you test the Evening Primrose Oil on a small area of your skin before using on a visible or bigger area.
Evening Primrose Oil and Early Birthing
Evening Primrose Oil comes in gel caps which can be used either orally or inserted into the vaginal canal for the purposes of softening and thinning of the cervix prior to giving birth. Because Evening Primrose Oil contains prostaglandins, and this is what affects the cervix.
It is important to remember this is to be used in this manner only if you are forty weeks into your pregnancy and under the supervision of qualified medical professionals.
There is some evidence that this does indeed help to speed up the birthing process, but there are studies that show that some women who took the active ingredient in Evening Primrose also had longer labors than those that did not. Other studies contradict this, stating that it can shorten labor time. Often, this is only part of the process and other herbal induction methods are included to induce labor; but this varies from medical professional practice.
How about Hot Flashes? Will Evening Primrose Help?
As with a lot of supplements on today’s market, it depends on what study you are looking at. In one study from England, there was no improvement in hot flashes and other signs and symptoms associated with menopause when Evening Primrose Oil was used alone. However, when used in combination with other herbs, such as ginseng and royal jelly, the signs and symptoms of menopause were greatly reduced.
Keep in mind however, that there have not been any large-scale studies conducted in clinical settings to prove or disprove the effectiveness of Evening Primrose Oil helping with menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. Many people do report personal success stories with the use of this supplement.
Keep in mind that results may vary from person to person, and study to study. It would be wise to contact your professional care provider regarding his/her recommendations.
Evening Primrose Oil during Pregnancy – Is it safe?
After searching through many articles, the question regarding taking Evening Primrose Oil during pregnancy has been answered! It is a resounding, Yes and No! This natural oil has been known for centuries to help with easing childbirth by affecting the cervix in a manner which makes it thinner and therefore easier for the baby to pass through during labor and delivery.
The scientific studies, however, show mixed results regarding effectiveness of this herb to induce labor. It is a precursor of prostaglandins but is more effective if mixed with other herbs and medications.
So, according to may physicians, the best quality Evening Primrose Oil is safe to take IF you are over thirty-six weeks into your pregnancy. This is time frame when labor usually occurs, and the fetus is fully formed and ready to make its appearance into the world. However, always ask your professional medical provider before taking this, any other herbal supplement or medication.
Evening Primrose Oil. Hormone or not?
Actually, evening primrose oil is not a hormone. I know that is surprising to many because it’s reported effects helps with so many hormone related conditions, such as menopause, hot flashes, PMS, and PCOS.
What this magic oil does is stimulate the substances in the body which acts on the endocrine system. It in effect, it gives the complicated hormonal system a kick start. When this is introduced into the body, the hormones wake up and begin to circulate through the system and reportedly decreases the signs and symptoms associated with the conditions by increasing hormone production.
In some recent studies, women who have had cancer, or who have a strong family history of female type cancers, were given primrose oil. This was due to the fact that some studies show that the introduction of artificial hormones can activate, or reactivate, cancer cell production. These women could take the oil, since it encourages the body to produce it’s own.
Evening Primrose Oil can treat infertility
The positive effects of this oil are amazing! Some recent studies have shown that the best quality Evening Primrose Oil can reduce inflammation in the female organs and improve their overall health. This is due to the large number and amount of essential fatty acids it contains.
These fatty acids have been shown to increase the production of the body’s own prostaglandins. There are several different kinds of these natural substances produced, and most of them are centered around the reproductive system.
Acting as almost instant messaging, they instruct other cells to do their jobs. Unfortunately, some women suffer will low levels of natural chemicals in their bodies, and this often leads to problems with fertility. By using best quality evening primrose oil, the uterine wall cells will be in better health, as well as the production of eggs needed for fertilization.
While some studies show no correlation between the use of this oil and an increased number of pregnancies, there are thousands of personal accounts which attest to the efficacy of this herbal supplement.
