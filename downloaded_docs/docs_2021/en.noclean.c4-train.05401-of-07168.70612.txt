Men often first notice hair loss on the temple area or on the hair line. Many refer to this as a "receding hair line." While this is not necessarily the beginning of progressive male pattern baldness, it can be distressing. It can also be very confusing sorting through hundreds of hair loss products and misinformation on the topic. Although it can be moderately challenging to regrow temple hair, it can be done and there is an additional permanent option if you are unsuccessful.
How to Regrow Temple Hair
Step 1
Make a doctors appointment. The American Hair Loss Association reports that androgenic alopecia, also known as male pattern baldness, is the cause of 95 percent of hair loss in males. Male pattern baldness is a hormonal condition caused by hairs being attacked and thinned by DHT.
The American Hair Loss Association strongly suggests against researching or purchasing hair loss products on commercial websites. See a doctor or dermatologist that has experience in treating the condition. It is important to determine that your hair loss is a result of male pattern baldness and not another, far less common condition.
Step 2
If your hair loss is from traditional male pattern baldness, ask your doctor about the prescription drug Propecia. Omnimedical Search states that Propecia is only FDA approved pill for hair loss. It functions by lowering DHT levels. Less DHT results in less hair loss.
Step 3
Buy some minoxidil at the grocery store. Minoxidil, formerly patented as Rogaine, is the most sold hair loss treatment in the world according to Hair Site. Minoxidil is thought to function by increasing blood flow to the scalp hair, providing an ideal environment for hair to grow.
Step 4
Buy Nizoral shampoo at the grocery store. Ketoconazole, the primary ingredient in Nizoral, was proven in a Belgian study entitled, "Ketoconazole Shampoo: Effect of Long-Term Use in Androgenic Alopecia," published in the 1998 Journal of Dermatology to be as effective for stimulating hair growth and increasing hair density as two percent minoxidil. Researchers considered ketoconazole a promising addition for the long-term treatment of androgenic alopecia.
Step 5
Be consistent. Dr. Robert Bernstein, a respected hair restoration surgeon suggests staying on Propecia and minoxidil for 12 months because hair growth may take a long time to become visible. Bernstein also notes that although Propecia and minoxidil were only proven to regrow hair on the top of the scalp, they "definitely can" work for the temple region so long as there is still hair remaining in that area.
If your Propecia, minoxidil and ketoconazole shampoo hair loss treatment is unsuccessful, a hair transplant can provide a permanent solution.

Tip
Follow your doctor's advice. Use Propecia and minoxidil as directed. Try not to miss taking Propecia. Try not to miss minoxidil applications. Relax, it make take awhile to see results.
Warning
According to Merck, sexual side effects from Propecia occurred in 3 percent of males taking Propecia in their five-year study published in October of 1998.
