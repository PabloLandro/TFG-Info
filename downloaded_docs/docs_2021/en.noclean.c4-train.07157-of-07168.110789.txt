In this video, we learn how to remove a tick with Vaseline. First, find the tick on the body of the animal. The tick will be obvious because the skin will swell up around where they are. Use a special tool to help pull the tick off, which has a slit in the middle of it. Now, slide the tool underneath the tick so it's in the middle. Twist the tool a couple of times and then pull the tick off from the body of the animal. After this, apply some Vaseline to the tick and it will kill it off, enjoy!
