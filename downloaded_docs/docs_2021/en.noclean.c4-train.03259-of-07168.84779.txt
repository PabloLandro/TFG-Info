J Foot Ankle Surg 2019 Mar 3;58(2):236-242. Epub 2019 Jan 3.
Director of Residency Training, Division of Foot and Ankle Surgery, West Penn Hospital, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA. Electronic address:
Calcific insertional Achilles tendinopathy (CIAT) is a relatively common musculoskeletal entity that results in significant pain and disability, as well as posterior muscle group weakness. There is a lack of evidence criteria to support the timing of operative intervention, choice of procedures, or whether equinus requires treatment. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review 45 patients (48 feet) who have undergone surgical management of CIAT with concomitant posterior muscle group weakness with the single heel rise testing.

[Arthroscopic Treatment of Chronic Retrocalcaneal Bursitis - Endoscopic Calcaneoplasty].
Authors:
L Paša J Kužma R Herůfek J Prokeš A Šprláková-Puková
Acta Chir Orthop Traumatol Cech 2018 ;85(3):209-215
Klinika traumatologie Lékařské fakulty Masarykovy univerzity Brno.
INTRODUCTION The authors evaluate the results of endoscopic treatment and analyse the causes of persisting difficulties in retrocalcaneal bursitis unresponsive to conservative treatment. Stated as one of the causes is the possible chronic irritation of minor/partial tears of anterior parts of the distal portion of the Achilles tendon, which have no chance to heal due to continued overload and impingement syndrome of the superior prominence of the calcaneal tubercle. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors evaluate the group of 24 patients (10 women and 14 men) diagnosed with retrocalcaneal bursitis, who reported more than 12 months of difficulties and in whom the conservative therapy options have already been exhausted.

Cardiff Regional Foot & Ankle Surgery Unit, Department of Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital Llandough & University Hospital Wales, Cardiff & Vale University Health Board, Penlan Road, Llandough, Wales, CF64 2XX, UK.
Haglund's syndrome encompasses several different pathologies, including Haglund's deformity, insertional Achilles tendonopathy, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and superficial bursitis. Traditionally treated with open surgery, there is increasing interest in a more minimally invasive approach to this difficult region to reduce complications and improve the rate and ease of recovery. We review the evidence available for 2 of these techniques: the endoscopic calcaneoplasty and percutaneous Zadek's calcaneal osteotomy (also known as Keck and Kelly's osteotomy). Read More

Enthesitis is considered as the primary anatomical lesion in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We aimed to investigate the potential of ultrasound to detect early changes after TNF-a antagonist therapy of Achilles enthesitis of AS patients. One hundred AS patients with active disease, requiring TNF-a antagonist therapy, were included (etanercept n = 25, infliximab n = 25, adalimumab n = 25, non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) n = 25).

Complete Achilles tendon rupture after local infiltration of corticosteroids in the treatment of deep retrocalcaneal bursitis.
Authors:
Ganfranco Vallone Tarallo Vittorio
J Ultrasound 2014 Jun 29;17(2):165-7. Epub 2014 Jan 29.
Institute of Radiology, The IRCCS Foundation Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Piazzale Golgi 2, Pavia, Italy.
Complete rupture of the Achilles tendon is relatively rare, but it is an injury of considerable clinical relevance. A common cause of non-traumatic tendon rupture is local corticosteroid infiltration. Corticosteroid injections may start a degenerative process resulting in partial rupture and subsequent complete rupture of the tendon due to a direct toxic effect, because corticosteroids inhibit production of extracellular matrix collagen and also because of poor local vascularization.

Foot Ankle Spec 2013 Aug 27;6(4):323-7. Epub 2013 Jun 27.
Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, North District Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.
Unlabelled: Pain in the posterosuperior portion of the calcaneus can be caused by a retrocalcaneal bursitis, enlargement of the superior bursal prominence of the calcaneus, insertional Achilles tendinopathy, stress fracture of the calcaneus, or inflammation of an adventitious bursa between the Achilles tendon and the skin. Hypertrophied tendon impinging on the posterosuperior calcaneal tuberosity can be a cause of retrocalcaneal pain after repair of acute rupture of the Achilles tendon. This can be effectively treated by endoscopic calcaneoplasty. Read More

Haglund's syndrome, which is an inflammation of the bursa and a bony enlargement on the back of the heel that most often leads to painful bursitis, is a rare cause of retrocalcaneal pain. The clinical diagnosis is often confusing as the clinical picture may mimic other causes of hindfoot pain such as isolated retrocalcaneal bursitis or hindfoot involvement from more systemic disorders such as seronegative spondyloarthropathies (Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis) or rheumatoid arthritis. This report is of a 60-year-old woman with a painful swelling of the right heel, who was diagnosed with Haglund syndrome. Read More
