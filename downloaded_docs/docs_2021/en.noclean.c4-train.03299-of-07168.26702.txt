Description
DescriptionBenefitsRecipesIngredientsHow to UseRecommendation
Though it sounds like it might be related to the ever-romantic and regal rose we all know and love, evening primrose is actually quite different. It’s a small, yellow wildflower found in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia that’s most sought-out for its oil. In fact, generations have been using primrose oil for centuries for its beauty and health benefits—some people even use it to manage diabetes, along with these other natural remedies.
Pure Evening Primrose Carrier Oil Benefits & Uses
Here Denise Baron wellness Educator and Ayurveda Expert Said:
“Evening primrose oil is rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid that has been used to treat everything, including female reproductive tissues, blood channels, the respiratory passages, and the nervous system”
These days, you can find primrose oil in a variety of beauty products, as well as in supplement form. Here are some remarkable ways primrose oil can improve your life.
Evening Primrose Oil contains high levels of nourishing fatty acids and is excellent for use at up to 20% in skin blends. It penetrates deeply and is very soothing to the red or irritated skin.
Relief From Skin Condition
Evening primrose oil might help relieve symptoms of notoriously difficult-to-treat and painful skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema.
The high omega-6 fatty acid content of primrose oil helps ease symptoms. If you have eczema and psoriasis, We recommends you applying a combination of evening primrose oil with coconut oil topically every day, though it’s important to consult your doctor to ensure it won’t interfere with any medications you might be taking.
Acne
Is evening primrose oil acne clearing? dermatologists are known to recommend it as part of an anti-acne regimen and first-hand accounts by acne sufferers also celebrate its skin-clearing benefits when used externally. Hormonal acne can be troublesome for many people, especially teenagers who are dealing with fluctuating hormones during puberty. A hormonal imbalance can lead to acne in teens and adults alike, and many people don’t realize that acne can be treated naturally.
In order to treat hormonal acne, you need to tackle the root of the problem — the hormonal imbalance. No topical treatment does that for you; it only treats the already existing pimples or scars. Getting a proper balance of omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids from healthy sources (like evening primrose oil) may help to overcome and prevent acne. These fatty acids also play a role in cell structure, improving nerve function and promoting skin elasticity.
Hair Loss
Pure Evening Primrose Oil has been shown to improve skin inflammation and dryness, it makes sense that these benefits would transfer to the skin on our scalps and likely help to boost hair growth and quality. You can apply evening primrose oil directly to the scalp and hair. Let it sit for 30 minutes as a rich, hydrating mask, and then wash your hair as you normally would.
Skin Health
Evening primrose oil has proved to be a valuable treatment choice for people suffering from skin conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Studies published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science have even shown that evening primrose oil can help with age-related structural and functional changes in skin tissues, such as redness, firmness, roughness and fatigue resistance. Eczema is generally caused by an allergic response to foods, chemicals or other substances, such as perfumes or soaps; it causes dry, red, itchy skin that can blister or crack.
Treat Eczema
People with eczema don’t have the normal ability to process fatty acids; this results in a deficiency of gamma-linolenic acid or GLA. GLA is an omega-6 fatty acid that the body can convert to substances that reduce inflammation and cell growth. Psoriasis occurs when skin cells replicate too quickly, which results in swollen patches under the skin covered with whitish scales on top. The scaly patches, also known as psoriatic plaques, are areas of inflammation and excessive skin production. The cause of psoriasis includes hormonal changes, poor diet and difficulty digesting protein. An evening primrose oil benefit is its ability to help naturally cure psoriasis — because the essential fatty acids help with hormone balance and digestion.
