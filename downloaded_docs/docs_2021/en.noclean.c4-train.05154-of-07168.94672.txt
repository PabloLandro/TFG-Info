5 Great reasons to buy from us:
Pimples are terrible & they often leave behind embarrassing acne scars. Tackle discoloration and scars for gorgeous skin with my supercharged formula made with Organic Shea Butter, Organic Rose Hip Oil and more powerful skin healing ingredients.
Scarring is a permanent condition, so scar treatments may improve the condition, but rarely remove it completely. The aim should be improvement, not curing it. The combination of the ingredients in this formula will help to significantly diminish the appearance of discolored skin and heal acne scars over time.
SHEA BUTTER has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in it which helps to treat blemishes.
Antioxidant properties in Shea butter fight bacteria and refrains skin pores from blocking.
Anti-inflammatory property helps reduce inflammation caused due to break outs.
Shea butter has vitamin A and E. Both of the vitamins help to maintain a spotless, healthier and younger skin.
Shea butter absorbed by the skin rapidly and gives moister. Moisturizer eradicates the skin marks created by acne. Secondly, the antibacterial quality of the Shea butter inhibits bacterial growth on the affected area.
Shea butter also protects against sun exposure and UV rays. Sun exposure is one of the main enemy of acne where UV rays damage the skin cells.
*Tamanu Oil - Each drop contains at least 10 types of different active molecules that gently urge skin to heal & rebuild.
Molecules includefriedelin, canopyllic acid and canophyllol,xanthones and coumarins as well as moisturizing omega-6 and 9 fatty acids.
Provides antibacterial, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant promoting healthy cell growth.
Has been found to minimize scarring and speed growth of healthy new cells.
Shown to reduce swelling and irritation with topical application
Is an antioxidant that can help prevent UV related cell damage and aging. It was shown to exhibit significant UV absorption capabilities and had a sun protection factor of 18 to 22 even at low concentrations.
85% of the DNA damage caused by UV exposure was inhibited with just a 1%Tamanu oil preparation and was deemed gentle enough to even be used in the eyes as a UV filter
Sun damaged skin can become hyperpigmented and loses crucial collagen and elastin structures which causes fine lines, deep wrinkling, and loss of firmness.
ROSEHIP SEED OIL FADES ACNE SCARS AND DARK SPOTS
Rosehip Seed Oil is packed with the fatty acids and nutrients your skin need to stay healthy, and moisturized: provitamin A, linoleic acid (omega-6) and linolenic acid (omega-3).
These fatty acids are part of what makes rosehip seed oil such an effective acne scar remedy. When they are absorbed through the skin, they convert to a compound known as prostaglandin. Prostaglandins help your body regenerate its cellular membranes and tissues, which can help to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, stretch marks, and acne scars.
Research shows that regularly applying Rosehip Seed Oil can help to reverse damage caused by overexposure to the sun as well as keep skin looking healthier. It can also help to even out your skin tone, reducing the impact of age spots and hyper-pigmentation.
Unlike other oils for mature skin, rosehip seed oil is astringent and considered a “dry oil,” which means it sinks into skin quickly. This allows its essential fatty acids to really penetrate and soothe dry skin.
Rosehip seed oil actually encourages skin to form its own collagen due to its naturally occurring vitamin A.
TUMERIC is a miracle remedy for acne..
Is rich in fiber, iron and vitamin B6.
Tumeric’s main active is Curcumin which has strong anti-inflammatory effect. Anti-inflammation reduces red swollen pimples. Studies show that curcumin fights inflammation at molecular level.
It’s also a strong antioxidant agent, which thwarts free radicals and also boosts antioxidant levels in the body.
Antiseptic and antibiotic properties make it a natural remedy for scars.

Amino acids in aloe acts on hard skin cells to soften it and zinc acts as an astringent to tighten pores and control excess sebum production.
Along with anti-inflammatory properties salicylic acids consists of antibacterial properties, which kills acne causing bacteria.
Is acclaimed for its healing properties. Gibberellin and glucomannan enhances collagen production. This in-turn results in fading acne scars.
LEMON contains vitamin C which helps repair acne scarred tissue.
AHAs present in lemon juice works to remove dead cells accumulated over skin and stimulates growth of deeper layers of the skin.
Topical application of lemon will increase the formation of collagen and thickness of skin, without any inflammation.
Vitamin C in lemon juice also known as ascorbic acid plays vital role in formation of collagen which promotes the growth of cells and blood vessels.
Is a natural bleaching agent. It lightens the skin tone considerably and helps to reduce acne scars.
ALMOND OIL has rich amounts of Vitamin E and it is a great skin tonic.
Almond oil reduces acne scars and it improves skin texture.
