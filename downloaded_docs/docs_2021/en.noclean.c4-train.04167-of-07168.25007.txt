Under the arm (Armpit) temperature: 99° F (37.2° C) or higher

Causes of Fever
Overview. Almost all fevers are caused by a new infection. Viruses cause 10 times more infections than bacteria. The number of germs that cause an infection are in the hundreds. Only a few common ones will be listed.
Viral Infections. Colds, flu and other viral infections are the most common cause. Fever may be the only symptom for the first 24 hours. The start of viral symptoms (runny nose, cough, loose stools) is often delayed. Roseola is the most extreme example. Fever may be the only symptom for 2 or 3 days. Then a rash appears.
Bacterial Infections. A bladder infection is the most common cause of silent fever in girls. Strep throat is also a common cause of unexplained fever.
Sinus Infection. This is a problem caused by a cold. The main symptom is the return of fever after it has been gone for a few days. The sinus congestion also changes to sinus pain. Color of nasal discharge is not very helpful for making this diagnosis.
Vaccine Fever. Fever with most vaccines begins within 12 hours. It lasts 2 to 3 days. This is normal and harmless. It means the vaccine is working.
Newborn Fever (Serious). Fever that occurs during the first 3 months of life can be serious. All of these babies need to be seen as soon as possible. The fever may be due to sepsis (a bloodstream infection). Bacterial infections in this age group can get worse quickly. They need rapid treatment.
Meningitis (Very Serious). A bacterial infection of the membrane that covers the spinal cord and brain. The main symptoms are a stiff neck, headache and confusion. Younger children are lethargic or so irritable that they can't be consoled. If not treated early, can suffer brain damage.
Overheated. The fever is usually low grade. Can occur during heat waves or from being overdressed. The temp becomes normal in a few hours after moving to a cooler place. Can also occur during hard exercise. Fever goes away quickly with rest and drinking extra fluids.
Not Due to Teething. Research shows that "getting teeth" does not cause fevers.
Fever and Crying
Fever on its own shouldn't cause much crying.
Frequent crying in a child with fever is caused by pain until proven otherwise.
Hidden causes can be ear infections, kidney infections, sore throats and meningitis.
Roseola: Classic Cause of Unexplained Fever in Young Children
Most children get Roseola between 6 months and 3 years of age.
Cause: human herpes virus 6
Rash: pink, small, flat spots on the chest and stomach. Rash is the same on both sides of the body.
Then spreads to the face.
Classic feature: 2 or 3 days of high fever without a rash or other symptoms.
The rash starts 12 to 24 hours after the fever goes away.
The rash lasts 1 to 3 days.
By the time the rash appears, the child feels fine.
Normal Temperature Range
Rectal. A reading of 98.6° F (37° C) is just the average rectal temp. A normal low can be 96.8° F (36° C) in the morning. It can change to a high of 100.3° F (37.9° C) late in the day. This is a normal range.
By mouth. A reading of 97.6° F (36.5° C) is just the average mouth temp. A normal low can be 95.8° F (35.5° C) in the morning. It can change to a high of 99.9° F (37.7° C) late in the day. This is a normal range.

Care Advice for Fever
What You Should Know About Fever:
Having a fever means your child has a new infection.
It's most likely caused by a virus.
You may not know the cause of the fever until other symptoms develop. This may take 24 hours.
Most fevers are good for sick children. They help the body fight infection.
Use the ranges below to help put your child's level of fever into perspective:
100° - 102° F (37.8° - 39° C) Low grade fever: helpful, good range. Don't treat.
102° - 104° F (39 - 40° C) Average fever: helpful. Treat if causes discomfort.
Over 104° F (40° C) High fever: causes discomfort, but harmless. Always treat.
Over 106° F (41.1° C) Very high fever: important to bring it down. Rare to go this high.
Over 108° F (42.3° C) Dangerous fever: fever itself can be harmful.
Treatment for All Fevers - Extra Fluids
Fluids alone can lower the fever. Reason: being well-hydrated helps the body give off heat through the skin.
Offer your child extra water or other fluids by mouth. Cold fluids are better. Until 6 months old, only give extra formula or breastmilk.
For all children, dress in 1 layer of light weight clothing, unless shivering. Reason: also helps heat loss from the skin.
Caution: if a baby under 1 year has a fever, never overdress or bundle up. Reason: babies can get over-heated more easily than older children.
For fevers 100°-102° F (37.8° - 39°C), fever meds are rarely needed. Fevers of this level don't cause discomfort. They do help the body fight the infection.
Exception: if you feel your child also has pain, treat it.
Fever Medicine:
Fevers only need to be treated with medicine if they cause discomfort. Most often, that means fevers above 102° F (39° C). Also use for shivering (shaking chills). Shivering means the fever is going up.
For fevers above 102° F (39° C), give an acetaminophen product (such as Tylenol).
Another choice is an ibuprofen product (such as Advil).
Goal of treatment: Bring the temperature down to a comfortable level. Most often, the fever meds lower the fever by 2° to 3° F (1 - 1.5° C). They do not bring it down to normal. It takes 1 or 2 hours to see the effect.
Do not use aspirin. Reason: Risk of Reye syndrome, a rare but serious brain disease.
Do not use both acetaminophen and ibuprofen together. Reason: Not needed and a risk of giving too much.
Sponging With Lukewarm Water:
Note: Sponging is an option for high fevers, but not required. It is rarely needed.
When to Use: Fever above 104° F (40° C) AND doesn't come down with fever meds. Always give the fever medicine at least an hour to work before sponging.
How to Sponge: Use lukewarm water (85 - 90° F) (29.4 - 32.2° C). Sponge for 20-30 minutes.
If your child shivers or becomes cold, stop sponging. Other option: You can also make the water warmer.
Caution: Do not use rubbing alcohol. Reason: Can cause a coma.
Return to School:
Your child can return to school after the fever is gone. Your child should feel well enough to join in normal activities.
What to Expect:
Most fevers with viral illnesses range between 101° and 104° F (38.4° and 40° C).
They may last for 2 or 3 days.
They are not harmful.
Call Your Doctor If:
Your child looks or acts very sick
Any serious symptoms occur such as trouble breathing
Fever goes above 104° F (40° C)
Any fever occurs if less than 12 weeks old
Fever without other symptoms lasts more than 24 hours (if age less than 2 years)
Fever lasts more than 3 days (72 hours)
You think your child needs to be seen
Your child becomes worse
And remember, contact your doctor if your child develops any of the 'Call Your Doctor' symptoms.
