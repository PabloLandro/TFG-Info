Male groin - irritation and infection
3-minute read
Listen
Groin irritation
Irritation in the groin is painful and annoying. It can be caused by many different things, including:
getting sand in your swimming costumes or board shorts
a build-up of sweat after exercise
excess rubbing to the area such as through exercise or sex
lubricants and spermicides
latex products, such as condoms
soaps, shower gels, shampoos, deodorants or hygiene sprays
disinfectants, antiseptics and ointments
washing powders or liquids
new underwear, especially if it is not made from cotton.
Irritation can also be due to:
skin conditions such as eczema (dermatitis) or psoriasis
infections
infestations such as scabies or pubic lice.
You can ease some of the irritation by using a cool compress or an ice pack – ice packs should never be placed directly on the skin, but should be wrapped in something soft like a tea towel.
If you have broken skin or sores, don’t put on any cream or lotion until you have checked with your doctor.
If you are in pain, get advice on medicines you can take. A pharmacist can advise on soothing creams and lotions.
Don’t use any cream or lotion you already have at home until you have discussed your problem with a doctor or pharmacist.
Groin infections
Groin infections can be caused by a fungus (known as ‘jock itch’), by sexually transmitted infections like herpes, or by other types of infections.
Some skin infections will clear up by themselves if you keep the area clean and dry. But if you have a groin infection that you have not had before, it would be wise to see a doctor or go to a sexual health clinic.
A mild case should clear up quickly with an over the counter ointment from a pharmacy. However, if it is hard to treat you may need a prescription medicine.
If you have a sexually transmitted infection, you will need antibiotics or other medicine. If you have been told you have a sexually transmitted infection, tell any sexual partner so they can also be examined and treated as necessary. Avoid sexual contact until your doctor says it is OK.
Other causes of groin irritation such as pubic and body lice or scabies need to be treated with medicated creams or washes. Talk to your doctor.
If the cause of the irritation is an allergy, antihistamines can help but you will need to try to avoid the trigger in future.You can ease some of the discomfort of an infection by keeping the area clean and dry.
Clean the area in lukewarm water at least twice a day. Dry carefully and then apply any cream you have been given by your doctor or pharmacist according to their instructions. Wash your hands before and after cleaning.
Do not share towels.
If you are in pain, get advice on pain relief medicines you can take.

Oral antifungal drugs for treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis) | Cochrane
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the feet that is easily spread and difficult to get rid of. This review compared different oral antifungal drugs (i.e. drugs taken by mouth), and it included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. There are several different kinds of oral treatments, and the trials we found considered all the oral drugs used to treat athlete's foot. We found terbinafine and itraconazole to be more effective than placebo. And we found terbinafine to be more effective than griseofulvin. Griseofulvin is a treatment that was developed much earlier than the new treatments, such as terbinafine and itraconazole; these newer treatments tend to be most evaluated. Trials of other drugs were not large enough to show differences between them. All drugs had side-effects; gastrointestinal effects were the most common.

Antifungal medicines for treating children with ringworm | Cochrane
Tinea capitis, or ringworm, is a fungal infection of the scalp caused mainly by two species of fungi called Trichophyton and Microsporum. It is common in children. Most fungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams applied directly to the skin (topical treatments). However, because the fungal infection is found at the root of the hair follicles, where topical treatments cannot reach, tinea capitis always requires medication administered by mouth so that the treatment spreads throughout the entire body (systemic treatments). There are several different types of antifungal medicines available.
