Chest congestion is a very uncomfortable condition that is caused by the build up of mucus in the respiratory tract. The mucus build up can be a result of common cold, flu, asthma, pneumonia, and other respiratory tract infections. The symptoms of chest congestion include chest pain, wheezing cough, throat pain, difficulty in swallowing, dizziness, tightened chest, and phlegm in the lungs. Even though most people consult the doctor when suffering from chest congestion, home remedies work very well in relieving the agonizing symptoms.
1. Hot Water
Drink a cup of hot water 2 to 3 times a day. The water will help dissolve the mucus accumulated in your respiratory tract and will provide some relief.
2. Salt Water Gargle
Take a glass of hot water and add a tablespoon of salt to it. Gargle with it for 1 to 2 minutes, 3 to 4 times a day. The salt water will loosen the phlegm and soothe the cough. If you feel that phlegm is backing up your throat, it is better to spit it out rather than swallowing it. The phlegm can contain bacteria and dirt which will slow down your recovery if you swallow it When you spit the phlegm, make sure that you do it hygienically to avoid transferring your disease to those around you.
3. Hot Lemon Juice With Honey
Honey is a natural decongestant and the vitamin C present in lemon will help boost your immunity. Drinking this mixture will help prevent the spread of a bacterial infection in your throat and lungs and will loosen the accumulated mucus in your chest. Take a hot glass of water, add a table spoon of lemon juice and a tablespoon of honey, and drink this mixture 2 to 3 times a day.
4. Ginger Tea
Ginger helps reduce the inflammation in your respiratory tract and reduces mucus accumulation. You can chew ginger in its raw form, or your can grind a few pieces of ginger, boil it in water for 10 minutes, and drink it 2 to 3 times a day. You can add honey for better results.
5. Inhalation Of Steam With Eucalyptus Oil
Taking deep breaths and inhaling steam will give you relief from stuffy nose and will ease up the congestion in your chest. Adding a few drops of eucalyptus oil to hot water and inhaling the steam will provide better results as eucalyptus oil has analgesic properties and antibacterial properties. Taking a hot shower and inhaling the steam deep into your lungs will also he helpful. You should run a humidifier in your room when you sleep to prevent your airways from becoming dry.
6. Parsley
Chewing a few of parsley leaves thins the mucus in your throat and lungs so that it can be removed easily. It will also help relieve chest pain caused by congestion.
7. Milk With Turmeric, Honey, And Black Pepper
A mixture of milk, turmeric, honey, and black pepper can treat cold and chest problems caused by infection. Turmeric has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Black pepper helps increase the bioavailability of turmeric, so they make a great combination. Boil a glass of milk, add a tablespoon ground turmeric, a teaspoon of ground black pepper, and a teaspoon of honey, mix it, and drink it 2 times a day.
8. Onion Juice With Honey
Onion contains sulfur and quercetin which prevent the build up of mucus and provide relief from congestion and pain. It also has antibacterial properties that helps prevent the spread of infection. Grind a piece of onion and squeeze the juice out. Take a tablespoon of the onion juice, add a few drops of honey, and take it 2 to 3 times a day.
9. Black Coffee
Black coffee can be used as a temporary relief. It reduces symptoms of asthma-like conditions and helps the airways by dissolving mucus. Do not exceed 2 cups of hot coffee per day as too much caffeine is not good for your health and can keep you awake at night.
10. Licorice
Licorice is a natural expectorant, which means that it helps bring up the mucus from your respiratory tract and helps expel it from your system. It also reduces inflammation of your airways and soothes throat irritation. Take a piece of licorice, boil it in hot water for 5 minutes, and drink it 2 to 3 times a day.
Home remedies are great for relieving symptoms of chest congestion, but if you are suffering from a serious lower respiratory tract infection, you should consult a doctor. Viral infections can last much longer than bacterial infections and getting help from a medical professional can help you recover faster. Stay warm, drink plenty of fluids, and take proper rest when you are on the road to recovery from chest infections.
