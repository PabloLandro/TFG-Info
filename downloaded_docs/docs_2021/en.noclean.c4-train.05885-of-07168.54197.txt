Music Therapy can be instrumental in alleviating the symptoms of depression. Simply listening to certain kinds of music can relieve stress or brighten your spirits. Experiential music therapy is a great way to express your feelings through drumming, singing, improvising or dancing.
I used several music therapy techniques while working at a school for emotionally impaired teens. I found that playing instruments not only brought them joy but did great things for focus and behavior. Guided listening to music also helped focus as well as bringing a calm atmosphere to the classroom.
