How to Treat an Ovarian Cyst During Pregnancy – Methods to Get Rid of Your Cyst, Even While Pregnant
When you have to treat an ovarian cyst during pregnancy, it can be difficult. Traditional treatment methods are not available or are especially dangerous to you. Even pain management is more complicated. So how do you successfully treat an ovarian cyst while you are pregnant?
The traditional methods of treating an ovarian cyst are prescribing birth control pills or surgically removing the cyst. Birth control pills are out of the question while you are pregnant. If the cyst is especially large, dangerously positioned, or has solid components, you may need to get it surgically removed. This is generally done during the second trimester using laparascopy.
The rest of us afflicted by an ovarian cyst during pregnancy are left to wait and see if the cyst will clear up on its own. Fortunately, for most women, it does, though it may take a few months. However, there are natural methods you can use to help it on its way.
Controlling the Pain
First, if you have ovarian cyst pain, you need to control it. Pregnancy itself can be uncomfortable enough as it is. You can use over the counter medicine containing acetaminophen to help you. However, never use medications containing ibuprofen. This can severely harm your unborn child.
You can also try to manage your pain naturally. Hot compresses and water bottles can help relieve the tension in your abdomen, which will lessen the stress on your ovary. This should take some of the pressure off and ease your pain. You can also try other relaxation methods, such as prenatal yoga or herbal teas.
Getting Rid of the Cyst
In order treat an ovarian cyst during pregnancy, you need to first cleanse your body. While you are pregnant, you will want to avoid most herbal supplements, as those can be harmful to the baby. However, just drinking plenty of water and improving your diet can help cleanse the liver.
Make sure to drink filtered water, as most tap and many bottled waters can contain trace amounts of hormonal medication. This can actually make your cyst worse. Also, soft plastic bottles contain BPA, which has been linked to undescended testicles in newborn boys. BPA mimics estrogen in your body, which may aggravate the ovaries. Try to drink from glass or metal containers, and avoid microwaving or freezing plastics.
Watch out for Complications
The two most common complications with ovarian cysts are ovarian torsion and ruptured cysts. Both require immediate medical treatment.
In ovarian torsion, the weight of the cyst causes the ovary to twist, which cuts off its blood supply. This will feel like debilitating pain in the side the cyst is located. If this happens, contact your doctor right away.
If you have a sudden increase in pain or a sharp intense pain in one side followed by a steady burning sensation, your cyst may have burst. This also may be accompanied by vaginal bleeding. If this happens, contact your doctor right away. You’ll need to be put on antibiotics to prevent infection and monitored to make sure you don’t have internal bleeding.
