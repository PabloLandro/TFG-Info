Fermented Ingredients
Used throughout history by cultures all the over the world, fermentation is a natural and age-old method for preserving food and bringing out flavour. But the benefits of fermenting go beyond the practical. Fermentation can make foods more digestible and nutritious, unlocking powerful health results such as:
Digestion and pre-digestion of complex foods
Antioxidant bio-availability
Mineral bio-accessibility
Probiotics and good bacteria
Alkalizing the body’s pH level
Decreasing phytic acid and lectins
Increased lysine in grains
Catalyzing metabolites
Chlorella, Black Garlic, Apple Cider Vinegar, Ginger, and Cumin – these are just some of the fermented ingredients that can add balance to your daily diet. From homemade kimchi to turmeric smoothies, this group will not only inject lively flavour to your meals but help build a strong foundation of gut-health, better digestion, and overall nutritional wellness.
The market for fermented ingredients is predicted to continue to grow at a strong and steady rate, with commercial interest and public awareness increasing across many sectors. The Korean stock market even has a ‘’Kimchi Index‘ that tracks the pricing of raw ingredients for this fermented staple.
