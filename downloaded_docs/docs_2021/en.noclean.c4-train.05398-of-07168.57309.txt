A stuffy nose will make for a miserable baby who has difficulty eating and sleeping. And since babies don’t know how sneeze or blow their nose, you’ll have to use other methods to clear the mucus from their nasal passages, such as saline drops, nasal aspirators, or humidity.
Steps
Method 1
Using Saline Drops or Spray
1
Choose your type of saline. Nasal saline drops and sprays have both been shown to be effective in clearing mucus, reducing congestion, and improving breathing.[1] The choice between drops or spray comes down to which your child tolerates better. The type of saline mixture that works best, on the other hand, depends on the nature of your baby’s stuffy nose:
Isotonic solutions have the same salt concentration as human blood and cells.[2] They are better for children suffering from colds or allergies.[3] You can purchase them, or to make your own, combine 1 cup of warm water with ½ a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of baking soda.[4]
Hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration of salt than the average human blood and cells.[5] They are better for children with chronic congestion.[6] You can purchase them, or to make your own, combine 1 cup of warm water with 1.25 teaspoons of salt and ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.[7]
Hypotonic solutions have a lower concentration of salt than human blood and cells. They usually aren't effective at reducing nasal symptoms.[8]
2
Wash your hands with soap and water. You will be touching both the saline and your child’s nose, and you don’t want to introduce any new germs.[9]
Wash your hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, or the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice.[10]
If you can't wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Hand-washing is always preferable, though.
3
Position your baby. You can cradle your baby in your arm or place him or her on a flat surface. You will need to keep your child in this position for 5 minutes after delivering the drops, so make sure you're both comfortable.[11]
4
Deliver the saline solution. Hold your baby’s head back gently but firmly, as you may get some resistance. Place the tip of the dropper or spray just into your baby’s nostril, without actually touching the nose. If you are using a spray, spray once or twice into each nostril; if you are using drops, insert 3 drops into each nostril.[12]
5
Keep your baby horizontal for 5 minutes. This allows the drops to flow into the nasal passage. If your baby starts to cough, help him or her to sit up.[13]
6
Wipe away mucus. After you use the spray or drops, your baby may sneeze, releasing mucus. Sometimes, instead, the mucus simply runs out on its own. Either way, wipe it away with a soft cloth.
7
Repeat if necessary. If nothing happens, repeat the process. The second application should produce some response and possible relief.
8
Clean the tip of the saline dropper or spray. Be sure to rinse the tip with warm tap water to remove any germs.[14]
9
Limit use of saline to 4 times a day. Using saline too much can irritate your child’s nasal passages.[15]

Method 1 Quiz
Which type of solution has a higher concentration of salt than the average human blood and cells?
Isotonic
Not quite. Isotonic solutions have the same concentration of salt as the average human blood and cells. They work better for children suffering from a cold or allergies instead of chronic conditions. You can easily make your own isotonic solution by mixing 1 cup (236.5 mL) of warm water with ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt and a pinch of baking soda. Try another answer...
Hypertonic
That’s right! Hypertonic solutions have a higher salt concentration than average human blood and cells. Hypertonic solutions work better for children with chronic problems as opposed to those with a cold or allergies. To make a hypertonic solution, combine 1 cup (236.5 mL) of warm water with 1.25 teaspoons (6.25 g) of salt and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of baking soda. Read on for another quiz question.
Hypotonic
Try again! Hypotonic solutions have a lower concentration of salt than average human blood and cells. Because they are mostly water, they are generally ineffective in reducing nasal symptoms. Click on another answer to find the right one...
Method 2
Sucking Snot with a Nasal Aspirator
1
Use an aspirator in conjunction with saline drops or spray. Using an aspirator with saline drops or spray has been shown to be more effective than saline solution or an aspirator alone.[16] The saline drops or spray thins and loosens the mucus in the nose, which the aspirator can then more easily suck out.
2
Choose your type of aspirator. All types of aspirators work, so choose the one that you feel most comfortable using and feel offers the best results.
Bulb aspirators, which are shaped like turnips, are frequently given to parents of newborns at the hospital and have been shown to be effective in improving breathing.[17]
The NoseFrida (Snotsucker) and BabyComfyNose both have filtered tubes through which the parent can suck snot from their baby's nose. Though studies of these devices are limited, they do create greater suction than a bulb aspirator and appear to be at least equally effective at reducing congestion.[18]
3
Use saline drops or spray to loosen the mucus. Using the method elsewhere in this article, apply saline drops or spray to your baby’s nostrils. This will soften and loosen the mucus.
4
Position your baby. You can hold your baby in your lap or put your baby down on a flat surface, facing up. Choose whichever position seems most comfortable.
5
Use the aspirator to remove mucus from your baby’s nostrils. The method will depend on the type of aspirator.
Bulb Aspirator – Squeeze the bulb, then insert the tip about ¼ inch into the baby’s nostril, angling the tip to the side. Release the bulb to suck the mucus out of the nose and into the aspirator. Remove it from your baby's nose and empty the contents onto a tissue by squeezing the bulb repeatedly. Repeat on the other nostril.[19]
NoseFrida or BabyComfy – Insert the tip of the device into the baby’s nostril and suck on the suction tube with steady pressure to remove snot. If using a BabyComfyNose, consider putting a tissue in the snot collection chamber to insure you do not suck up any snot. Remove the device from your baby’s and blow the contents onto a tissue. Repeat on the other nostril.
6
Repeat if necessary. Use saline drops or spray before each use if the mucus is very thick.
7
Clean your aspirator after use. Whether using a bulb aspirator, NoseFrida, or BabyComfy, be sure to clean it with hot, soapy water after use.
Bulb Aspirator – Put the tip in hot soapy water and squeeze to fill with soapy water. Shake, then squeeze the bulb to empty the syringe. Repeat this process with clean, hot water to clear out the soap.[20]
NoseFrida or BabyComfy – Remove the suction tube and clean the tip of the device with hot, soapy water. Rinse with hot water to remove the soap.

Method 2 Quiz
Which type of aspirator is generally given to new parents at the hospital?
Bulb aspirators
Yes! Bulb aspirators have been proven to be effective at improving breathing and are frequently given to parents of newborns. If you're using a bulb aspirator, make sure you clean it properly with hot, soapy water after each use! Read on for another quiz question.
NoseFrida
Try again! Although the NoseFrida is not generally given to new parents, if has been shown in limited studies to be just as effective as the aspirators that are regularly given out. It even has greater suction capabilities! Choose another answer!
BabyComfyNose
Nope! The BabyComfyNose is usually not given out at the hospital to parents of newborns. Like the NoseFrida, this aspirators works by the parents sucking thier child’s mucus out through a tube. In this way, parents can usually get better suction than with a bulb aspirator. Click on another answer to find the right one...
Method 3
Loosening Mucus with Humidity
1
Steam up the bathroom. Before putting your child to bed, run the shower to steam up your bathroom. Sit or stand with your baby in the steamy room for 5 minutes. The moist air will thin and loosen mucus, helping your child to breathe.[21] Do not take your child into the shower, as the hot water may burn him or her.
2
Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier. Always use a cool-mist humidifier. Hot or warm mist could cause burns.[22]
Place the humidifier near your baby, and aim the mist away from the crib to avoid wetting the bedding.[23]
Change the water daily and clean the unit with bleach or Lysol to prevent mold growth.[24]
3
Do not try steam inhalation from bowls of hot water. In the past, doctors sometimes recommended filling a bowl with hot water and letting your child inhale the steam, but studies show that this method leads to a high risk of burns. It is no longer recommended for children.[25]
4
Do not use a device that produces hot steam. Vaporizers are no longer recommended due to the danger of burns.[26] For warm, wet air, take your child into a steamed up bathroom.

0 / 0
Method 3 Quiz
How can you safely loosen mucus with humidity?
Have your baby inhale steam from a pot of hot water.
Nope! Although this method used to be recommended in the past, studies show that there is a high risk of burns to your baby. Instead of holding your baby over a pot of hot water, try steaming up the bathroom. Try another answer...
Use a vaporizer.
Try again! Vaporizers produce warm, wet air, which is what you want to help loosen mucus, but they also put your baby at risk of burns. For the same effect, try running a hot shower and steaming up the bathroom. Pick another answer!
Try a humidifier.
Correct! A humidifier will moisten the air in your baby’s room without risk of burns. Make sure that you use a cool mist humidifier, and not hot or warm mist humidifier. Another solution is to steam up your bathroom and bring your baby into the steamy room for 5 minutes. Remember, don’t bring your baby into the shower, as that could cause burns! Read on for another quiz question.
Method 4
Considering Other Methods: Sneezing, Raised Crib, and Vapor Rubs
1
Get your baby to sneeze. Tickle the tip of your baby’s stopped up nostril with a piece of soft material like a tissue or string, or blow gently into one nostril. Be sure to have a tissue ready in case you are successful.
2
Raise your child’s bed. Raising the head of your baby’s crib can help mucus to drain down their nasal passages. Place books or boards under the legs at the head of the crib to safely raise the bed. Never place a pillow in the crib with your child.[27]
3
Do not use vapor rubs for children under 2. The menthol, camphorated oil, and eucalyptus oil found in vapor rubs are all potentially life threatening for babies if swallowed,[28] inhaled,[29] or applied to the skin.[30][31]
Score
0 / 0
Method 4 Quiz
True or False: Eucalyptus oil and the other compounds found in vapor rubs are effective natural relief for infants.
True
Definitely not! Do not use vapor rubs on children under the age of 2. The ingredients have been shown to be potentially life threatening for infants. Instead, try tickling their nose with a feather or tilting their crib for natural remedies. Try again...
False
Correct! The ingredients in vapor rubs--including eucalyptus oil, menthol, and camphorated oil--have been proven to be potentially fatal to children under the age of 2. Do not use vapor rubs on infants. You could try other non-invasive remedies like tickling your infant’s nose or tilting their crib instead. Read on for another quiz question.
Method 5
Seeking Medical Treatment
1
Call your doctor. In babies over 3 months of age, call your doctor if your congested child has any of the following symptoms with a stuffy nose, which could indicate the presence of a cold or other infection:[32]
A temperature over 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C).
Reduced urine output
Ear pain or unusual irritability
Red eyes, or greenish or yellow eye discharge
Swelling of the forehead, eyes, side of the nose, or cheek
Persistent cough
Trouble breathing
White or yellow spots on his or her throat
Nasal discharge that had a foul smell or is a color other than white or yellow
A cough that produces mucus or lasts longer than 10 days
Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks
2
Call the doctor immediately if your baby is under 3 months of age. If your infant is under 3 months old, call your pediatrician as soon as you see signs of a cold. A cold in babies can quickly develop into something more serious, and it interferes with their ability to drink milk, leading to potential dehydration.[33]
3
Call emergency services if necessary. In some cases, a cold or other infection can turn worse rapidly. If you see any of the following symptoms, call emergency services or seek immediate medical attention:
Your baby coughs hard enough to make him vomit
You see changes in your baby's skin color
Your baby coughs up blood
Your baby has trouble breathing
Your baby turns blue around the lips and mouth

Method 5 Quiz
When should you call your doctor?
If symptoms last longer than 3 weeks.
Close! If your baby’s symptoms have lasted for 3 weeks and have not improved, you should certainly call your doctor. Additionally, if your child has a cough that produces mucus and has lasted for 10 days, you should call your doctor as well. Click on another answer to find the right one...
If your 2-month-old develops a cough.
Almost! Any time your infant under 3 months old develops a cough, you should contact your pediatrician immediately. Even a slight cough in an infant can quickly develop into something more serious and complicated. Always call your pediatrician if you are unsure. Guess again!
If your baby’s skin color changes.
Try again! If your baby’s skin color changes, it is probably a sign that something is wrong. You should contact emergency services immediately. Other emergency signs to watch for include coughing up blood or vomit and trouble breathing. Try another answer...
All of the above.
That’s right! If you notice any of these symptoms, you should contact a healthcare professional. If your child is less than 3 months old, it is especially important to contact a doctor at any signs of a cold. When in doubt about your baby’s health, always err on the side of caution and contact a doctor. Read on for another quiz question.
