Nursing implications
Nursing assessment
Assess pain location, intensity, duration, and associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting) during migraine attack.
Give initial subcut dose under observation to patients with potential for coronary artery disease including postmenopausal women, men >40 yr, patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, smoking, or family history. Monitor BP before and for 1 hr after initial injection. If angina occurs, monitor ECG for ischemic changes.
Monitor for serotonin syndrome in patients taking SSRIs or SNRIs concurrently with sumatriptan.
Potential Nursing Diagnoses
Acute pain (Indications)
Implementation
Do not confuse sumatriptan with sitagliptin or zolmitriptan.
Oral: Tablets should be swallowed whole; do not crush, break, or chew. Tablets are film-coated to prevent contact with tablet contents, which have an unpleasant taste and may cause nausea and vomiting.
Subcutaneous: Administer as a single injection just below the skin. Solution is clear and colorless or pale yellow; do not use if dark-colored or cloudy or if beyond expiration date.
Sumavel DosePro: The snap-off tip should sit firmly on the end of the clear medication chamber; do not use if tip tilted or broken off upon removal from packaging. Administer only in abdomen or thigh.
Intranasal: 10-mg dose may be administered as 2 sprays of 5 mg in 1 nostril or 1 spray in each nostril.
Transdermal: Apply to dry, non-irritated, intact skin of upper arm or thigh. Site must be relatively free of hair and without scars, tattoos, abrasions, eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, or contact dermatitis. After application, push activation button within 15 min and red light emitting diode (LED) will turn on. Secure patch with medical tape if needed. System stops operating when dosing complete; activation light turns off signaling system can be removed. System cannot be reactivated when completed. If light turns off before 4 hr, dosing has stopped and patch can be removed. Fold patch so adhesive sides stick together and discard away from children and pets; contains lithium­manganese dioxide batteries; dispose in accordance with state and local regulations.
If headache is not completely relieved, may retreat no sooner than 2 hr in a different site; use no more than 2 patches in 24 hr. Rotate sites; do not apply to a previous site until site is free from erythema for at least 3 days.
Patient/Family Teaching
Inform patient that sumatriptan should be used only during a migraine attack. It is meant to be used for relief of migraine attacks but not to prevent or reduce the number of attacks.
Instruct patient to administer sumatriptan as soon as symptoms of a migraine attack appear, but it may be administered at any time during an attack. If migraine symptoms return, a second injection may be used. Allow at least 1 hr between doses, and do not use more than 2 injections in any 24-hr period. Additional sumatriptan doses are not likely to be effective, and alternative medications may be used. If no relief from 1st dose, unlikely 2nd dose will provide relief. Advise patient to read Patient Information prior to using and with each Rx refill; new information may be available.
Advise patient that lying down in a darkened room after sumatriptan administration may further help relieve headache.
Advise patient that overuse (use more than 10 days/mo) may lead to exacerbation of headache (migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks). May require gradual withdrawal of sumatriptan and treatment of symptoms (transient worsening of headache).
Advise patient to notify health care professional before next dose of sumatriptan if pain or tightness in chest occurs during use. If pain is severe or does not subside, notify health care professional immediately. If wheezing; heart throbbing; swelling of eyelids, face, or lips; skin rash; skin lumps; or hives occur, notify health care professional immediately, and do not take more sumatriptan without approval of health care professional. If usual dose fails to relieve 3 consecutive headaches, or if frequency and/or severity increases, notify health care professional. If feelings of tingling, heat, flushing, heaviness, pressure, drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, or sickness develop, discuss with health care professional at next visit.
Sumatriptan may cause dizziness or drowsiness. Caution patient to avoid driving or other activities requiring alertness until response to medication is known.
Advise patient to avoid alcohol, which aggravates headaches, during sumatriptan use.
Instruct patient to notify health care professional of all Rx or OTC medications, vitamins, or herbal products being taken and consult health care professional before taking any new medications Patients concurrently taking SSRI or SNRI antidepressants should notify health care professional promptly if signs of serotonin syndrome (mental status changes: agitation, hallucinations, coma; autonomic instability: tachycardia, labile BP, hyperthermia; neuromuscular aberrations: hyper-reflexia, incoordination; and/or gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) occur.
Caution patient not to use sumatriptan if pregnant, suspects pregnancy, or plans to become pregnant. Adequate contraception should be used during therapy.
Subcutaneous: Instruct patient on the proper technique for loading, administering, and discarding the autoinjector or for using Sumavel DosePro. Patient information pamphlet is provided. Instructional video is available from the manufacturer.
Inform patient that pain or redness at the injection site usually lasts less than 1 hr.
Intranasal: Instruct patient in proper technique for intranasal administration. Usual dose is a single spray in 1 nostril. If headache returns, a 2nd dose may be administered in ≥2 hr. Do not administer 2nd dose if no relief was provided by 1st dose without consulting health care professional.
Transdermal: Instruct patient to read Patient Information and Instructions for Use before starting and with each Rx refill, in case of changes.
Advise patient not to bathe, shower, or swim while wearing patch.
Inform patient that skin redness under patch site that disappears within 24 hr is common. If signs and symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis (itching, redness, irritation, blistering or peeling, warmth or tenderness of skin, blisters that ooze, drain, or crust over) occur, stop using sumatriptan transdermal and notify health care professional.
Advise patient referred for MRI test to discuss patch with referring health care professional and MRI facility to determine if removal of patch is necessary prior to test and for directions for replacing patch.
Advise patient not to use more than 4 times/mo without consulting health care professional.

Patient discussion about Imitrex
Q. What can i do other than taking Imitrex for my reccuring migraine headaches?
A. I used to take excedrin migraine everyday too!! Eventually I went to the doctor and she told me it causes rebound headaches, aka you get another headache the next day. I finally switched to some prescription drug that starts with a Z, and I get about a migraine a month. Excedrin Migraine isn't the answer! Also agree with those who said to find your triggers.
