Achilles Tendon Rupture
Aka: Achilles Tendon Rupture
Definition
Spontaneous heel cord rupture
Epidemiology
More common in men aged 30 to 50 years
Sports commonly involved
Basketball
Football
Softball
Pathophysiology
Uncommon injury
Results from tendon degeneration or excessive force
Rupture site
Os calcis (2.5 - 5 cm from tendon insertion)
Symptoms
Injury from great stress on tendon (e.g. jumping)
Patient hears "pop" at heel with injury
Often with severe sudden acute pain
Pain may initially be mild
Signs
Patient walks Flatfooted
Most plantar flexion lost
Excessive passive dorsiflexion of foot
Unable to stand on ball of foot
Localized tenderness achilles tendon insertion
Localized Hemorrhage at rupture site
Sulcus palpable at rupture site
May be obscured by organizing clot
Thompson's Test abnormal (no plantar flexion)
Diagnosis
Exercise high level of suspicion
20-30% of Achilles Tendon Ruptures are initially missed
Differential Diagnosis
See Heel Pain
Partial Gastrocnemius Tear
Achilles Tendonitis
Plantaris Rupture
Tibial Stress Fracture
Deep Vein Thrombosis
Management
Orthopedic Consultation in all cases
Surgical repair for young athletes
Followed by immobilization for 6-8 weeks
Immobilization
Similar outcomes with faster recovery than surgery
Weber (2003) Am J Sports 31:685-91 [PubMed]
Indicated as only modality in older or less active
Short Leg Walking Cast or cam walker
Foot in mild equinus (plantar flexion)
Non-weight bearing (Crutches) for at least 2-3 weeks
Immobilize for 8-12 weeks
Physical therapy follows immobilization
Prognosis
Recurrent Achilles Tendon Rupture is common
Protect from excessive activity for 1 year
Competitive athletes should expect decreased function
Re-rupture rate
Immobilization only: 13.4%
Surgical repair: 1.4%
