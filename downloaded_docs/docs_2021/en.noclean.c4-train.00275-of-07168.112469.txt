Natural Mineral Bischofite Eliminates Migraines and Headaches
Magnesium deficiency is one of the primary reasons for the frequent headaches and migraines.
How Does Magnesium Deficiency Bring on Headaches And Migraines?
Hectic, stressful, and unhealthy lifestyles make people prone to headaches.
Medications can relieve headache and migraine symptoms, but they do their work on the symptoms and not their root cause. Fixing Magnesium deficiency prevents headaches and migraines before they set in. If a headache or a migraine has set in, massage your forehead with Magnesium oil for natural, organic relief.
How Magnesium Oil Relieves Headaches and Migraines

The Science Behind Magnesium alleviating Headaches and Migraines
Magnesium decreases the frequency of migraines and headaches. Research shows that Magnesium works on serotonin receptors, NMDA receptors, and nitric oxide synthesis/release. These chemicals and brain structures trigger headaches and migraines.
Studies have revealed that patients suffering from cluster headaches and migraines responded positively to additional intakes of Magnesium. In one double-blind study, the participants received 600 mg of Magnesium for twelve weeks. They reported a 40 percent reduction in migraines and headaches.
For this reason, it recommended people take around 400 to 500 mg of magnesium daily to reduce the occurrence of headaches and migraines. If you suffer from frequent headaches and migraines, you need to increase your intake of magnesium.
