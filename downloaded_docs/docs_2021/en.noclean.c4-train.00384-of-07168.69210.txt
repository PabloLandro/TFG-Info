Magnesium
~
Why is the calcium magnesium ratio so important?
Because magnesium is the most versatile mineral in your body and participates in over 300 hormone reactions!
~
This workhorse of a mineral plays many roles in your body, including:
~
~ Gives rigidity AND flexibility to your bones
~ Increases bio availability of calcium
~ Regulates and normalizes blood pressure
~ Prevents and reverses kidney stone formation
~ Promotes restful sleep
~ Helps prevent congestive heart failure
~ Eases muscle cramps and spasms
~ Lowers serum cholesterol levels and triglycerides
~ Decreases insulin resistance
~ Can prevent artherosclerosis and stroke
~ End cluster and migraine headaches
~ Enhances circulation
~ Relieves fibromyalgia and chronic pain
~ Treats asthma and emphysema
~ Helps make proteins
~ Encourages proper elimination
~ Prevents osteoporosis
~
Magnesium is a magnificent mineral and imperative for good health.
But a poor diet of processed foods and a stressful lifestyle can lead to mineral deficiencies, including magnesium. If you ARE deficient in magnesium, you may notice a wide range of symptoms.

Any of these common symptoms may indicate that you need more magnesium in your diet, but this simple mineral can help eliminate these symptoms and enhance your health.

Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms and Diagnosis
http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms-and-diagnosis
~ Green Med Info .. Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms and Diagnosis …
~ Magnesium deficiency is often misdiagnosed because it does not show up in blood tests – only 1% of the body’s magnesium is stored in the blood.
~ Most doctors and laboratories don’t even include magnesium status in routine blood tests.
~ Thus, most doctors don’t know when their patients are deficient in magnesium, even though studies show that the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium.
