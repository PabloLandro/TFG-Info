Copper Theory
Various forms of copper have been used for medicinal purposes throughout the history of mankind. The ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Persian, Hindu and Aztec writings record various consistent medicinal uses of copper.1 Today, as more information becomes available, alternative health care and home remedies are gaining popularity. Health publications include copper bracelets as a home remedy to possibly ease the pain from arthritis in some people who seem to get an insufficient amount of copper from their food. Helmar Dollwet, Ph.D., of the University of Akron, has studied this copper connection and thinks the dissolved copper from a copper bracelet entering the body through the skin may be the only way for them to get the copper they need.2 Another study found patients wearing copper bracelets absorbed an average of 13 milligrams of copper during a month. “This could bring many people into the recommended daily intake for copper (1.5 to 3 milligrams). Copper absorbed through the skin gets into circulation very efficiently – more so than most dietary copper.” Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) is one of the body’s own copper-dependent enzymes that reduces pain and inflammation. The body may use copper to make more of its own SOD.3
Copper Benefits
Copper plays many important roles in maintaining a healthy body and some of its benefits include:
Arthritis: The health benefits of copper relate to its anti-inflammatory actions that assist in reducing the symptoms of arthritis. The consumer market is also flooded with copper bracelets as well as other accessories for curing this condition. It can also work as a home remedy for arthritis; store water in a copper container overnight to accumulates copper traces. These are beneficial in strengthening the muscular system, so drink the water when you wake in the morning. You will feel energized and active for the day because your metabolism will have a good source of this element for its daily processes.
Proper Growth: Copper is essential for normal growth and health. Thus, it is very important to include this mineral in balanced levels in your regular diets. It is also helpful for the protection of the skeletal, nervous and cardiovascular systems. If you suffer from its deficiency, the normal and healthy growth of organs and tissues, as well as their proper oxygenation from an ample red blood cell concentration, would be impossible. Copper deficiencies are seen in many third world countries and is reflected in the number of birth and growth defects in children of those nations.
Pigmentation of Hair and Eyes: Copper is a vital component of the natural dark pigment, melanin, which imparts coloration to the skin, hair, and eyes. Melanin can be produced by melanocytes only in the presence of the cuproenzyme called tyrosinase, which is derived from it. Intake of its?supplements also helps in protecting against graying of the hair, so while it is often overlooked as an antioxidant mineral, it does protect the integrity of those cells and keeps you looking young! It also maintains the color of your eyes, and is essential, along with zinc, to keep your eyes beautifully colored into your old age.
