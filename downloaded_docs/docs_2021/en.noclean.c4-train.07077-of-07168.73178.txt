What Is Anemia?

Anemia (or anaemia) is a condition in which the RBC count or hemoglobin levels drop below normal levels.
RBCs help transport oxygen to all parts of your body (2). Hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein present in RBCs, imparts the red color to the blood cells. It also helps bind oxygen, fight infections, and prevent blood loss by inducing blood clotting. Anemia results in less oxygen reaching various parts of your body. As a result, you develop the following symptoms.

Let’s take a look at the causes of anemia.
Back To TOC
Causes Of Anemia
A dip in RBC count or hemoglobin can occur due to three main reasons:
Your body is not producing enough RBCs.
RBCs are getting destroyed by your body.
Blood loss due to menstruation, injury, or other causes of bleeding.
Depending on the cause, anemia can be classified into the following types:

Types Of Anemia

Iron Deficiency Anemia
Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. Iron is essential for human beings to produce hemoglobin. Blood loss, poor diet, and your body’s inability to absorb iron from food can lead to iron deficiency (3). As a result, your body fails to produce enough hemoglobin, which leads to anemia.
Aplastic Anemia
This type of anemia is caused when your body doesn’t produce enough red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are produced in the bone marrow every 120 days (4). When your bone marrow fails to produce RBCs, the blood count falls and leads to anemia.
Sickle Cell Anemia
Sickle cell disease, a serious blood disorder, causes sickle cell anemia. The red blood cells are flat disc-shaped or sickle-shaped in this type of anemia. The RBCs contain abnormal hemoglobin, known as the sickle cell hemoglobin, which imparts the abnormal shape to them. Sickle cells are sticky and can block blood flow (5).
Hemolytic Anemia
This type of anemia is caused when the red blood cells are destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. The bone marrow is unable to produce new RBCs fast enough to meet the body’s demand (6).
Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia
Like iron, vitamin B12 is also needed for the proper and adequate production of hemoglobin. Most animal products are rich in vitamin B12. But if you are vegetarian or vegan, you may have vitamin B12 deficiency. This can inhibit hemoglobin production in your body, resulting in anemia. This type of anemia is also known as pernicious anemia (7).
Thalassemia
Thalassemia is an inherited genetic disorder in which the body doesn’t create enough red blood cells. As a result, people with thalassemia can have mild to severe anemia (8).
Fanconi Anemia
Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic blood disorder that leads to bone marrow dysfunction. Fanconi anemia prevents the bone marrow from producing enough RBCs. It can also cause the bone marrow to produce abnormal RBCs. This can result in cancer and affect the organs and tissues of your body. Children who inherit Fanconi anemia have birth defects (9).
Blood Loss Anemia
Excessive bleeding during menstruation or bleeding caused by injury, surgery, cancer, or urinary tract or digestive tract dysfunction can lead to blood loss anemia (10).
So, what can happen to you when diagnosed with any of these types of anemia? Here are the risk factors you must know.
Back To TOC
Risk Factors Of Anemia
Women and children are more prone to developing anemia than men.
Anemia in pregnancy is common but should not be left untreated.
Candida infection can prevent your body from absorbing B vitamins, and vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia.
Digestive issues like Crohn’s disease, ulcers, and IBS can cause anemia.
Taking pain medications frequently can also be a risk factor for anemia.
People over 65 years of age can develop anemia.
Looking at the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of anemia, you may jump to the conclusion that you have anemia. That may not be true. Here’s how you can find out if you have anemia.

Diagnosis

Here are the steps that your doctor will take to confirm if you have anemia.
Family History
Since a few types of anemia are genetic, your doctor may want to know if anyone in your family has anemia.
Physical Exam
Listen to your heartbeat to know if there is any irregularity.
Listen to your lungs to check if your breathing is uneven.
Feel your abdomen to check the size of your spleen or liver.
Complete Blood Count
Complete blood count test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. It also checks RBCs, WBCs, platelet count, and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV).
Other Tests
Your doctor may ask you to get a reticulocyte test (number of young RBCs) done. They could also ask you to undergo a test to know the type of hemoglobin in your RBCs and check the iron levels in your body.
If your blood count or hemoglobin is low, don’t panic. You can reverse this situation and lead a healthy life. Here are the best home remedies to treat anemia.

Blackstrap molasses is a sweet by-product obtained from refining sugarcane. It is low in sugar but rich in vitamins and minerals like vitamin B6, magnesium, calcium, and selenium. Consuming blackstrap molasses can help increase the iron levels in your body, thereby improving your hemoglobin levels and RBC count (11).
Caution
Do not consume it in excess amounts as it may cause diarrhea and loose stools.

Vitamin C is mostly found in citrus fruits. Fruits like orange, apple, lime, lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, gooseberries, apple, and berries are loaded with vitamin C and other essential vitamins and minerals that help in the production of RBCs and hemoglobin. This drink is a good source of vitamin C and will help rev up your hemoglobin levels and iron absorption.
Caution
Avoid consuming too much vitamin C in a day to prevent acidity. Also, avoid consuming it after drinking milk or any milk-based products.

It is a well-known fact that probiotics help improve digestion and gut function. That’s because probiotic-rich foods contain good gut bacteria. Scientists have found that probiotics increase the levels of vitamin B12 and iron (12). Patients with anemia can improve their low RBC count and hemoglobin levels by consuming yogurt, a good source of probiotics. You can consume yogurt as it is or prepare buttermilk and drink it.
Caution
Avoid consuming probiotics in excess to prevent bloating and digestion issues.

Anemia Prevention And Treatment Tips
Say No To Beverages
Red Wine
Sorry to break the news to you, but red wine is a complete no-no for now. It prevents iron absorption and interferes with your medicines and dietary approach to treat anemia.
Black And Green Tea
Despite being good for weight loss and good health, both black and green teas prevent iron absorption. So, avoid these teas.
Coffee
If you are not a coffee addict, good for you! But if you are, I totally understand the pain of seeing your favorite beverage mentioned on this list. Coffee inhibits iron absorption. But the good news is, you can have it after 2 hours of having an iron-rich meal. Avoid drinking it an hour before or after having a meal.
Exercise
Yoga And Exercises
Doing yoga and exercises on alternate days can help improve blood circulation and prevent you from feeling fatigued and weak all the time. However, exercise when your condition has improved a bit and you feel stronger.
Other Tips
Take A Cold Bath
Step into a cold bath! A refreshing bath in cold water can help treat anemia. Shocked? Studies suggest that a cold water bath helps the body reach the ideal temperature needed for the proper flow of blood to all parts of the body.
Say No To Non-Fermented Soy
While fermented soy products like sauces can aid iron absorption, non-fermented ones prevent it. So, avoid non-fermented soy products until your RBC count and hemoglobin levels are back to normal.
To conclude, anemia is a common blood disorder. But it can be cured if you seek proper help, know what to eat and avoid, take supplements, and keep a close eye on your health. These simple home remedies are the best and have worked for many. So, go ahead and follow these tips and enjoy your life to the fullest. Take care!
