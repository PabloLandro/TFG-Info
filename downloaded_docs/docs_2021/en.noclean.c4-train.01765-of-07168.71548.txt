Health Tip: If Your Baby Has a Fever
Don't give him aspirin

(HealthDay News) -- According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, your child needs to see a doctor if he is less than 2 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 or higher. If your child is 6 months or older, he needs to see a doctor if he has a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit.
If a trip to the doctor isn't warranted, here are a few tips to keep your baby comfortable until his fever breaks:
If your baby is at least 6 months old, give him acetaminophen or ibuprofen in approved doses to bring the fever down. You should not give your baby aspirin.
Keep the room at a cool temperature, and keep the baby dressed in light, comfortable clothing.
Make sure he drinks plenty of fluids, including water, diluted juice or prepackaged children's drinks with electrolytes.
Do not sponge your baby in cold water or add alcohol to water in an attempt to bring the fever down faster.
You should take your child to the pediatrician if your child is less than 2 years old and has had a fever for more than 24 hours, or more than 72 hours if your child is age 2 or older, the academy says.
