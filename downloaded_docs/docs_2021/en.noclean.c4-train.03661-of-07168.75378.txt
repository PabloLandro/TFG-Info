Mycil athlete's foot spray (tolnaftate)

01/06/2007
What is it used for?
Treatment and prevention of athlete's foot (tinea pedis).
Fungal infection of the groin (dhobie itch or tinea cruris).
Prickly heat (miliaria).
How does it work?
Mycil athlete's foot spray contains the active ingredient tolnaftate, which is an antifungal medicine used to treat skin infections caused by fungi.
Antifungal medicines kill fungi by interfering with their cell membranes, causing holes to appear in the fungal cell membrane.
The cell membranes of fungi are vital for their survival. They keep unwanted substances from entering the cells and stop the contents of the cells from leaking out. As tolnaftate causes holes to appear in the cell membranes, essential constituents of the fungal cells can leak out. This kills the fungi and treats the infection.
Mycil athlete’s foot spray is used mainly to treat athlete’s foot, which is a fungal infection of the skin on the feet, especially between the toes. It can also be used to treat fungal infections of the groin (dhobie itch).
The spray should be used twice a day. Wash and dry the affected areas of skin first, then hold the can 15cm away from the skin and spray the affected areas liberally.
You should continue treatment with the spray for at least a week after the symptoms have cleared up to make sure the infection has been fully treated.
Routine use of the spray can help prevent re-infection.
