Efficient Hair Loss Treatment
Health
Guys all over the world experience hair loss, and it is probably the most common problem they are dealing with, as far as their appearance is concerned. The reasons for it are multiple, such as genetics, stress, different diseases, vitamin deficiency, and medication. The most common type of hair loss is called Pattern Hair Loss, scientifically called “androgenetic alopecia”, which is caused by genetics. There are many natural products that claim to regrow hair, but none of them has been clinically proven to be effective. The only clinically proven and FDA approved product to treat hair loss is minoxidil. Minoxidil was initially approved as a vasodilator drug. Patients treated with minoxidil were found to grow more hair. Now minoxidil has become the no. 1 hair loss product. It is formulated with varies concentration ranging from 2% minoxidil to 15% minoxidil. Studies have shown two thirds of men treated with minoxidil have received visible hair regrowth. 15% minoxidil has been clinically proven to be much for effective than 5% minoxidil.
The effective hair loss treatment options are limited. To choose the right hair loss treatment, firstly, it is important to identify the causes leading to your hair loss. Each person is different and has different lifestyle, so although you are tempted to blame your ancestors, they might not be guilty. The average person loses about 100 hairs a day, so a consistent loss of more than 150 hairs means there is definitely a problem regarding your lifestyle or health. You should not be worried though, because generally, the main reason for hair loss is pattern baldness – 95% of men whose hair is falling suffer from it. This condition can be inherited either from the mother or the father, and starts to appear between the ages of 20 and 30. By the age of 50, about 50% of men are likely to lose their hair, whether because of a hereditary gene or of natural causes. But when this starts happening at the age of 20, it is not a pleasant thing and may affect your self-confidence, which is why many people seek medical advice.
Many doctors will probably advise you to change your lifestyle together with hair loss treatment products. When your hair starts to fall, what actually happens is that the scalp follicles are shrinking, due to a combination between the genetic factor and the hormonal activity, and the growing cycle becomes shorter. 15% minoxidil solutions are the ultimate option for recovering your hair, due to the effective absorption and penetration of its ingredients into the scalp. Because of its high concentration, the product can be applied only once a day, and is very efficient - the results will appear only by using a small amount of it daily.
