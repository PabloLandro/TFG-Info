Twinning!
OK, not quite. But with two baby boys who are only 5 months apart it sure feels like we are twinning over here!
Remember how we had a second foster baby for three weeks and it was the hardest thing I'd ever done? I specifically remember turning to my husband about half way through and saying "Never...again." And I really meant it. Really, I did! At the time. Haha, but then they called last week and said that the same little pumpkin needed a long-term foster home...so he's with us again! And he's been much easier this time...soooorrrt of. :o)
Unfortunately they both have croup. And the rest of us are sick, too. And it's a little bit hard to wake up infinity times a night when you're sick! I can't wait until we are all well again and things are back to normal. It's so fun having two boys! I love watching them interact together, they are fascinated with each other! Baby "B" loves Ace and wants to grab his face every chance he gets.
I'm not going to lie, I am thoroughly exhausted right now. But pretty happy! I just wish there was a little more time/energy in the day. Not even coffee is saving me these days. :o)
Happy Thanksgiving week to my US readers! And happy regular ol' week to all of the rest of you dears. :O) I hope it's a good one for you.
Love you,
-Disney

I have an adopted son and biological daughter that we "twinned". It was and is one of the biggest blessings. They are each other's best friend. At two, she helped him learn English, at 3 she translated to others when he had some language delays, and now they are both on target and in the 3rd grade. Yes, it was exhausting. Yes, people were thoroughly confused when I would give birth dates. I would do it again in a heart beat. Praying you are able to persevere in your bout of illness as you minister to your family.

Gosh that sounds like a handful! When I had croup as a child my mum would run a really hot shower and sit with me in the steamy bathroom (not in the shower) and read or sing to me to keep me calm while the steam helped with the cough. I'm not sure if this is still common practice but my mum swears by it. Sending you lots of love and strength, for a speedy recovery. xx

So sorry you're all sick! For that croupy cough, if it's really bad and they're continually doing it (my son used to get broncospasms) open the freezer door and have them breath in the cold air. That helps believe it or not. Take care and you are awesome!

My goodness girly! You have a big load on your shoulders. If I was in your neighborhood, I would be running over to your house so I could hold those babies and you could get some rest! I'm sorry you guys are all sick! I hope that you ALL get feeling better soon.

I hope you guys get better soon. Kids being sick is bad enough but being sick when they are sick is hellish. :) You are doing one of the most important things in the world. Thanks for watching over the most vulnerable of God's children we need more like you. Lots of love, Leila

My best friend did this... fostered 2 boys 5 months apart. She got both of them straight out of the hospital too and now she has adopted both of them and they are 4, and the best of friends. But she did say it was hard and if she knew how hard it was back then, she might not have done it... but they are happy that they did, because those boys are so awesome!
I have one baby and I am exhausted - can't imagine adding another one right now! Hang in there!

I'm just a girl who loves your blog! But I had to tell you that I have twins, and I think that doing babies 5 months apart would be WAY harder than twins. Because at least with twins they are doing the same things at the same time. So props to you! You are awesome. And one selfish request - I hope your "twins" don't make it so you can't blog. I would be sad to not see all of your awesome ideas :-)
