What is Aleve?
Aleve is a totally effective medicine that can definitely deal with your body pains due to several medical conditions that include arthritis, sunburns and menstrual cramps. It definitely works better than taking other anti-inflammatory medicines or pain relievers.

Aleve has an active ingredient called Naproxen sodium which is commonly used to treat or reduce inflammation, fever, stiffness and pain. Some of the diseases that need a dose of Naproxen includes various kinds of arthritis, gout, migraine, kidney stones, bursitis and dysmenorrheal. Naproxen works by reducing the cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes.
It is available in different forms which include liquid gels, caplets, gelcaps and tablets. This drug is often compared to Aleve which can also help in body pain relief. However, many users are going with Aleve as Naproxen has been proven to be a better relief for pain than Ibuprofen like Aleve.
