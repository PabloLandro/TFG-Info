Thick, lustrous hair is certainly the desire of many women (and men!). However, is there really anything you can do to make hair thicker? Let's take a look at the available hair-thickening options and see how they work.
What does hair thickness mean?
There are actually two ways to think about hair thickness:
Thickening the individual hair fiber - This usually involves coating the hair strands to give the perception of hair feeling thicker. This is how all retail hair-thickening products work.
Increasing the amount of hair you have thus resulting in thicker hair - Products that claim to grow or increase the amount of hair you have are considered a drug and need to be approved by the FDA. If a product claims to grow your hair and is available without a prescription, then it either doesn't work or is being sold illegally.
How can I thicken individual hair fibers?
There is no permanent hair-thickening solution available (at least one that isn't damaging), but with the help of products you can temporarily get a thicker effect.
Thickening shampoos and conditioners use cationic polymers which "stick" to your hair making hair feel slightly thicker. Of course, this only lasts until your next shampoo.
Styling products like mousses, gels and creams also use polymers which help give hair hold (adding volume) and also coat your hair, adding thickness. Again, this only lasts until your next shampoo. Also, while styling products can make hair feel thicker, they can also weigh hair down, so be sure to use lightly and focus on the roots to lift hair away from the scalp, not the ends.
Coloring or relaxing your hair can also make your hair feel thicker. These processes damage the hair shaft, causing it to swell. This swelling makes hair feel and look thicker. The downside is that these processes damage hair.
Can I increase the amount of hair I have?
There are a two hair-growth ingredients available that are approved by the FDA to treat hair loss. They are:
Minoxidil (trade name Rogaine) is a topically-applied liquid that does work, but only in a limited number of cases (about 25%). It is applied to the scalp and used to stimulate hair growth in adult men and women with a certain type of baldness. If hair growth is going to occur with the use of minoxidil, it usually occurs after the medicine has been used for several months and lasts only as long as the medicine continues to be used. Hair loss will begin again within a few months after minoxidil treatment is stopped.
Propecia is an oral drug, originally designed to treat enlarged prostate glands and has been shown to have some efficacy against hair loss. However, this requires you to take a pill everyday to remain efficacious.
Are there any other options?
There are a few products that are called hair fibers (like Toppik) that can temporarily "fill in" areas of patchy baldness or fine, thin hair. The product is a fine powder made of just the right mix of keratin and silica to give you small, hair-like fibers that adhere to the real hair. This just means it works best when there's at least a few scalp hairs to cling to. If you just smear this on a totally bald scalp, it won't give the same effect. Again, this a temporary solution but can offer some benefit to those looking to create the illusion of having more hair without using a drug.
Bottom Line
Unfortunately, genetics play the biggest role in determining hair thickness and there is not much you can do to change it. However, styling products and conditioners can offer a slight thickening benefit and there are some drug options available for those with a more serious concern.
