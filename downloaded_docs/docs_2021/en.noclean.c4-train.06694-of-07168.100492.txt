How to Stop Hair Loss in Men & Women With These 15 Methods
Domen Hrovatin August 8, 2018 Hair Loss 1 Comment
To say that many and men and women will experience hair loss during their lifetime is an understatement. In the U.S. alone, nearly half of all men will show signs of baldness by the time they turn 40.
While the causes of balding are mostly out of our control, how to stop hair loss – or at least slow it down – is another matter. Methods and techniques for treating hair loss and promoting hair growth abound, and we’ll delve into those methods in this article.
We also think it’s important that any information on how to stop balding should also include its causes, which is how we’ll begin.

How you can stop hair loss using these 15 methods
An Overview – Why Do Men & Women Lose Their Hair?
A common question among men and women who experience hair loss is, “Why me?” It’s a valid question, and the answers cover a wide range of who we are – from our genetics to our lifestyle choices. Before we dig into our list of hair loss treatments for men and women, let’s look at some causes.
MPB
MPB (male pattern baldness) is a dreaded acronym for many men and is about as popular as chronic halitosis. Its scientific name is androgenetic alopecia, and it refers to the process by which men begin to lose their hair, and continue to lose it.
The most common causes of MPB are genetics, hormones, and age:
Genetics refers to the DNA that you’ve inherited from your parents and ancestors that, in many ways, represents the luck of the draw. If your father and grandfather lost their hair, chances are you’ll lose yours, too.
Regarding hormones, something called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) plays a major role in baldness. Men who are pre-disposed to MPB inherit hair follicles that are sensitive to DHT. When testosterone converts to DHT, hair follicles shrink, which results in thinner, finer hair until hair growth stops completely. Note: DHT doesn’t mean that you have more testosterone than other men (sorry, fellas). It just means that your hair follicles are more sensitive to hormones.
Meanwhile, there’s nothing mysterious about the role of age in hair loss, i.e., as men age their rate of hair growth decreases. Becoming older means experiencing hair loss, at least for the vast majority of men.
There are also some lifestyle factors that may contribute to hair loss, including smoking, stress, alcohol abuse, poor nutrition, and medications. The list of medications that may cause thinning hair includes antidepressants, cholesterol-lowering drugs, high blood pressure medication, weight loss drugs, and non-steroid anti-inflammatory medication.
Hair Loss in Women
Hair loss in women is similar to hair loss in men, including that women also experience loss due to DHT – a hormone some think is exclusive to men but which women produce at lower levels. That said, women also experience androgenetic alopecia or, in this case, female pattern baldness.
Women experiencing menopause have lower estrogen levels, which cause an imbalance of hormones that lead to excess production of DHT. However, additional factors may contribute to hair loss in women, including:
Stress
Pregnancy (which may result in temporary hair loss)
Anemia
An over-active immune system
Poor nutrition
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
It’s notable that hair loss is more common in men than in women. Indeed, men – in most cases – are 30% more likely to experience hair loss than women because they’re prone to androgenetic alopecia. Also, hair loss in men tends to be more noticeable because it starts at the temples and recedes. On the other hand, women tend to experience baldness near the top or crown of their head, which is less noticeable. But how to stop hair loss in women is of similar concern.
Now that we’ve covered some of the causes of hair loss, it’s time to take a look at ways to treat it.
How You Can Stop Hair Loss Using These 15 Methods
1. Regrow Your Hair With Minoxidil
No list of hair loss treatments is complete without mentioning Minoxidil. Also commonly known as Rogaine, Minoxidil has FDA approval and many men praise it as a method to stimulate hair growth while also treating hair loss.
Minoxidil was developed in the 1950s as a way to treat high blood pressure. An unexpected side effect was that it stimulated hair growth all over the body, and not just on the scalp. It works by allowing more oxygen, nutrients, and blood to reach hair follicles, which stimulates growth.
Or, that’s what they think is how Minoxidil works for treating hair loss because no one is 100% sure why it’s effective. In any case, it’s a legitimate treatment for male pattern baldness and thinning hair in women. And you’ll find plenty of studies to back it up.
It’s worth noting that Rogaine has the distinction of being the first hair growth drug approved by the FDA. You can buy it without a prescription, and it comes in extra strength for men and regular strength for men.
If you suffer from hair loss, some products worth checking out include Women’s Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Foam for Hair Thinning and Loss and Men’s Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Foam for Hair Loss and Hair Regrowth
2. Lipogaine: An Effective Way To Treat Hair Loss
Lipogaine is another treatment for men and women looking for a method to slow down the rate of their hair loss. It contains 5% minoxidil, a fairly standard but strong dose, and has the added benefit of blocking DHT. In turn, it helps support hair regrowth.
Here’s a look at a couple of products we like:
Lipogaine For Men
Lipogaine For Men includes 5% Minoxidil but also a blend of herbs and other ingredients that block DHT. Its ingredients include saw palmetto extract, biotin (a vitamin that supports healthy hair growth), niacin (which stimulates blood flow to the scalp), linolenic acid (a fatty acid used to support healthy hair growth), and vitamins B12 and B6 – which also help aid blood flow to the scalp.
One of Lipogaine’s many benefits is, as mentioned, is that it combines ingredients that fight hair loss while blocking DHT. Its list of ingredients includes many vitamins, which means you don’t have to buy hair loss supplements separately if you so choose.
Lipogaine For Women
Minoxidil is one of the most important solutions for women looking to treat hair loss because they can’t use Finasteride, which we’ll discuss shortly. That said, Lipogaine gets plenty of praise from customers because it has the Minoxidil component while also fighting androgenic alopecia, which is the equivalent of DHT hair loss in women.
Lipogaine For Women includes saw palmetto (which inhibits DHT) and ketoconazole, which also serves as a DHT blocker while fighting scalp fungus that may inhibit hair growth. It also includes oleic and linolenic acids.
3. Using Propecia to Block DHT While Promoting Hair Growth
Propecia, also known as Finasteride or Dutasteride, is another solution for how to stop hair loss in men. It works by inhibiting the process by which testosterone converts into DHT – as much as 70% according to some studies.
Propecia’s initial use was the treat prostate problems before being used to treat MPB. It’s a drug that has some notable side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and a loss of libido, but the chances of experiencing those issues are extremely low (as low as 1% according to many medical professionals).
An important note: Propecia is for use by men only. It can cause birth defects in women exposed to it during pregnancy.
4. Transplants For Creating a Fuller Head of Hair
Hair transplants have been around for quite a while now and represent another option – albeit an expensive one – for dealing with hair loss. The hair transplant process involves relocating plugs of skin from part of the scalp that contains active hair follicles to areas where hair growth has ceased.
Interestingly, the newly-transplanted hair often falls out within a few weeks of the transplant procedure but grows back from the relocated follicles over a span of several months. The two common methods of hair transplants are follicular unit transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). The FUE method consists of transplanting individual follicles for less scarring.
5. Caffeine For Hair Loss?
Most of us associate caffeine with the daily jolt of java that lifts the fog of sleep while also giving us a kick start out the door in the morning. But caffeine isn’t just a dose of much-needed energy – it’s also good for treating hair loss.
Here’s the thing: studies show that caffeine, when applied to the scalp, can increase the lifespan of hair follicles while encouraging healthy hair growth. OK, we’re not talking about caffeine in the same way as we talk about the stuff in your morning cup, but caffeine compounds that are applied topically and provide nutrients to the scalp.
One product we particularly like in the “caffeine for hair loss” market is the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss/Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo It’s effective for men and women and, besides caffeine, contains ketoconazole and saw palmetto – two other powerful ingredients used to treat thinning hair.
Ultrax Labs markets its shampoo as a complete “delivery” system that delivers the right ingredients to you your hair follicles while making sure that they remain there. You can use Hair Surge in addition to your regular shampoo or in place of it. In either case, the recommended usage is five times a week.
6. Nizoral A-D: An Anti-Dandruff Shampoo That Promotes Hair Growth
Many men and women suffer from dandruff, a condition that qualifies as aggravating and also a bit embarrassing (or a lot embarrassing, depending on how you feel about it).
Dandruff may have several causes, including irritated and oily skin, dry skin, not shampooing enough, and medical conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis. The good news, if there’s such a thing as “good” news regarding those pesky white flakes falling like snow on your clothes, is that dandruff – by itself – can’t lead to hair loss.
The other good news is that dandruff is very treatable and there’s no shortage of shampoos and other hair products available to help rid you of the problem. Among the shampoos is Nizoral’s A-D Anti-Dandruff Shampoo which not only fights dandruff but also contains ketoconazole that works to prevent hair loss while stimulating hair growth.
So, if you suffer from dandruff and thinning hair, Nizoral A-D packs a powerful one-two punch that addresses both issues. While it’s not intended for everyday use, you can use it a couple of times a week for two months and notice the results.
Lipogaine is a form of Minoxidil and an effective treatment in the fight against hair loss.
7. The Vitamin Solution to Hair Loss
Your hair is the same as every other part of your body in that it needs a variety of nutrients to thrive and survive. Many studies link vitamin deficiencies to poor hair growth and hair loss, which helps explain the wide variety of hair growth supplements available today.
HairAnew is one such product and one that we think effectively fights hair loss in men and women while promoting hair growth. It comes in capsule form and also is healthy for skin and nails. But its effect on hair loss and growth is what interests us.
Let’s take a closer look:
For starters, HairAnew is completely vegan and vegetarian and contains no collagen or animal products, and is free of gluten and soy.
HairAnew’s list of ingredients includes vitamins considered essential for hair growth. Biotin, a B complex vitamin also known as Vitamin H, provides a variety of health benefits, including regulating blood sugar and, as mentioned, and keeping hair healthy.
HairAnew contains 11 ingredients in all, including vitamins C, E, and B6, as well as zinc – which, among other benefits, keeps hormones in balance which helps promote healthy hair.
Its combination of ingredients helps address all of the nutritional deficiencies that we, A) may not be getting in our daily diet, and B) and that can lead to hair loss, thinning, and diminished hair regrowth.
Again, HairAnew is suitable for men and women. It also comes with a money-back guarantee if you have experienced positive results after 30 or 60 days. The recommended dosage is two capsules daily.
8. Using a Supplement to Block DHT
No article on male hair loss is complete without mentioning DHT, that three-letter acronym with a big scientific name. We touched on it earlier, but the effects of DHT on hair loss and growth are worth a little longer look.
For one, DHT is an essential characteristic of every male because it helps develop their essential male characteristics – from a deeper voice to increased muscle mass to body hair. DHT also plays a key role in the development of the testicles and penis in the male fetus.
But DHT is considered a key culprit in the development of male pattern baldness because it shrinks hair follicles which, in turn, leads to hair loss. Some estimates suggest that by age 50, over half of all men in the United States will experience DHT-related hair loss.
All of which leads us to the next product we find worthy in the fight against hair loss, the Advanced Trichology DHT Blocker With Immune Support Like HairAnew, it’s a dietary supplement in capsule form, but has a list of ingredients designed specifically to block DHT.
It also addresses issues beyond DHT that can negatively impact hair growth, including stress, poor nutrition, bacteria, fungus, and even the effects of medication on hair loss. And it’s not just for men – the DHT Blocker With Immune Support System is effective for women who experience hair loss after taking birth control or hormone therapy, and who have a family of history of hair loss (men or women).
Another benefit for women is that it supports improved metabolism, hormonal health, and decreases bloating.
The DHT Blocker With Immune Support vegan and gluten-free formula include saw palmetto, green tea leaf extract, pumpkin seed extract, grapefruit seed extract, zinc, and more. It also comes with a 100% money back guarantee; if you don’t find it useful after 120 days you’ll receive a full refund. The recommended dosage is two capsules twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.
9. Spironolactone: Another Product Used To Block DHT
Spironolactone, which comes in pill or topical form, also works to block DHT that can cause hair loss. It’s also used to treat female pattern baldness.
10. Laser Technology & Hair Growth
A more recent method for fighting hair loss is low-level laser hair therapy (LLLT) and its application methods include laser helmets and combs. One of our favorites – and one of the most effective for fighting hair loss – is the iRestore Laser Hair Growth System which consists of a plastic helmet with lasers and lights enclosed.
True, you’ll look like a stormtrooper, or like you own a one-of-a-kind bicycle helmet – but iRestore has the backing of many customers who report reduced hair loss and increased hair growth. It also has FDA clearance, which means it’s approved for safe use.
While the jury may still be out regarding the effectiveness of LLLT on hair growth, studies abound that give credence to the legitimacy of hair helmets and combs. It’s also said to work well in conjunction with other hair growth treatments, such as Minoxidil, Rogaine, etc., to enhance those treatments.
How does it work? IRestore’s Hair Growth System includes 51 medical-grade lasers and LED lights the radiate energy to hair follicles. The energy enhances cell metabolism rate while reactivating follicles to stimulate hair growth. Moreover, iRestore is safe to use and won’t burn the scalp, but users must take precaution to not look directly into the laser light.
One advantage that LLLT helmets have over laser combs is that they don’t require constant hand motions that can become tiring and inconvenient. They also allow you to do other things, such as read or watch television, while you’re having your laser helmet session (which, in the case of the iRestore System, last 25 minutes).
The folks at iRestore recommend using their Hair Growth System every other day. They also offer a 6-month money-back guarantee if users don’t experience noticeable results. You can use it alone or along with other products.
11. Derma Rollers: Another Approach to Fighting Hair Loss
What began as a tool for skin care became a method for fighting hair loss. That’s the story of the derma roller, which is a plastic roller with needles on it that you roll over your skin and scalp.
The needles make small incisions in the skin which don’t cause bleeding (and there’s minimal, if any, pain experienced during the process). The theory is that the minor skin damage caused by the derma roller will soon start to heal and regenerate, which leads to increased collagen production and increased nutrient absorption.
The same theory holds true for the skin on your scalp, or is expected to, at least. And the Derma Roller our pick of the litter in this category, is said to kick-start hair growth while cutting down on hair loss – particularly when used in conjunction to Minoxidil.
While many people say that derma rollers in general, and the Derma Roller specifically, produce excellent results for promoting hair growth, there’s also a lot of people who say it has no effect at all. In other words, the jury remains in the deliberation room and could be there a while.
12. Creating the Appearance of Hair Growth With Scalp Micropigmentation
Scalp Micropigmentation is a procedure that’s gaining popularity among men. It involves the use of microneedles to add pigment into the scalp – as you would with a tattoo on another part of your body – to create the appearance of tiny hair follicles.
A tiny wound is created in the skin when each dot is applied and a scab forms over the wound. When the scab falls away, it takes some of the implanted pigment with it and causes a gradual fading of the dots. In other words, the procedure doesn’t promote hair growth but
Most SMP treatments are split over three separate sessions but results may vary from person to person. There are few, if any, side effects to scalp micropigmentation.
13. Using an Essential Oil For Hair Growth
Essential oils have many uses, not the least of which is their positive impact on a person’s overall health. The list of essential oils includes rosemary oil, which is the most important ingredient in the 100% Pure Rosemary Essential Oil For Healthy Hair Growth by Maple Holistics
The 100% Pure Rosemary product addresses a wide range of wellness and beauty issues, including that it helps hair to become thicker while fighting hair loss and dandruff. It also serves as a DHT blocker.
Among its other benefits are that it promotes healthier skin, boost mental functions, while reducing stress. It’s also free of chemicals, parabens, preservatives, and additives.
14. Castor Oil Is Good For Your Overall Hair Health
To some folks, castor oil conjures up thoughts of being “stopped up” and having to – perhaps despite our many protests as children – taking it as a laxative. But castor oil does so much more and now has street cred as a way to facilitate hair growth.
Today, you’ll find a variety of castor oil products designed to fight hair loss, including the USDA Organic Cold-Pressed 100% Pure Hexane-Free Castor Oil The latter is our top choice for castor oil that has hair-healthy benefits, while it’s also ideal for nourishing and hydrating the skin.
Castor oil is rich in vitamins and fatty acids and replenishes the scalp’s natural oils while strengthening thin hair, preventing hair loss, and repairing split ends. It also improves blood flow in the scalp and has antibacterial properties that combat bacteria and fungus.
Castor oil’s recommended use for fighting hair loss is to massage it into your scalp and leaving it there 30 minutes before rinsing it out. You can heat it to help it penetrate the scalp faster and add a few drops of lavender oil that promotes hair growth. It’s also effective when left on overnight (make sure to cover your hair in some way, such as with a shower cap).
Another easy application involves adding a small amount (about 20%) of castor oil to your favorite conditioner.
15. Natural Methods For Hair Loss
Many people prefer using natural methods for dealing with issues such as hair loss. There are many such methods available, and we’ll touch on a few of him here:
Essential oils
You’ll find essential oils for use in a variety of products, including those which address hair loss and hair growth. One method involves combining essential oils with a scalp massage to promote blood flow to the hair follicles. Among the essential oils you can use are lavender, rosemary, thyme, peppermint, and cedarwood. While no scientific evidence backs up the claims of many who say the essential oil treatment stimulates hair growth, there’s nothing wrong with giving it a try.
Egg oil
Some experts say that egg oil is helpful in preventing hair loss, as well as for treating dandruff and moisturizing hair. Egg oil’s suggested use is to massage it into your scalp and leaving it on overnight. You’ll wash it off in the morning, preferably with a sulfate-free shampoo. Most people see results when they repeat the process two to three times a week.
Hot oil treatments
Hot oil applied to the hair can moisturize it and stimulate growth. Simply warm up the oil – no more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit – and massage it into your scalp. Put on a shower cap and let the oil sit for 30 minutes before washing it out with shampoo. Any kind of natural oil, such as olive oil, safflower oil, or canola oil, is suitable for this treatment.
Lifestyle changes
There are many positive changes you can make in your daily lives that, at the least, will slow the rate of hair loss – whether it’s reducing stress, exercising more, eating healthier, refraining from smoking and excessive alcohol use, getting the proper amount of rest, etc. Maintaining a meditation practice reduces stress and helps restore hormonal balance.
As you can see, there are many methods used currently to treat hair loss in men and women. It also seems likely that techniques and medication will continue to evolve. Choosing the right solution for you is a matter of personal preference, and it pays to do your research and weigh all of your options before making your choice.
We welcome your feedback and suggestions, as always. Do you use – or have tried – any of the hair loss treatments listed above? If so, what are your results? We’d love to hear from you!
