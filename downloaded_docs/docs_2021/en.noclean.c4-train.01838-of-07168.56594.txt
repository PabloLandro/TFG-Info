What is Brain Pill?
Brain Pill is the strongest concentration tablet that exists in the market with huge benefits and without any risk. The opinions of experts on this nootropic since its appearance have caused great astonishment due to the improvements it produces for brain functions.
Ingredients of Brain Pill
Vinpocetine - Vinpocetine is one of the most effective nootropic ingredients. It is derived from the vincamine found in the periwinkle plant. It has been used clinically in many places since it helps in the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders.
Vinpocetine increases blood to the brain by acting as a vasodilator. The increase in blood flow leads to increased oxygenation that gives it more focus and alertness. Vinpocetine is also known to have cerebral oxygenation and neuroprotective effects.
Brain Pill
Vitamins for memory - many concentration pills contain vitamins for the brain of group B, especially vitamin B5, B6 and B12.
B5 is an essential nutrient known as pantothenic acid. It works in the release of energy and the creation of neurotransmitters.
B6 is another vitamin for the brain that is key in the creation of neurotransmitters. It works on the synthesis of four of the most essential neurotransmitters: serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid.
B12 is considered an energy vitamin. B12 deficiency can be the cause of mental fog and a large percentage have B12 deficiency.
Bacopa - Bacopa is an herb that has been used traditionally for mental improvement. It has been shown to improve cognition by reducing anxiety. There are also some positive indications that Bacopa can admit memory.
Carnitine - Carnitine is very important for brain development and for the body, its function for both is the increase in energy production. It has also been shown to be compatible with memory of memories.
Caffeine - Caffeine is the most used cognitive stimulant in the world and for good reason. It has been shown to improve mental alertness and concentration. However, it is important to take an amount of caffeine that works best with people. Taking too much can cause nervousness and anxiety. Caffeine has also been shown to be synergistic with L-theanine.
L-theanine - Have you ever drank a cup of green tea and noticed the feeling of calm after the words? A possible reason for this is L-Theanine. By itself, L-theanine can relax someone, but when combined with caffeine, it improves the concentration and reduces some of the side effects related to the caffeine's anxiety.
Buying all these ingredients separately can not only be expensive because of their prices but also cumbersome. Can you imagine having to take 10 different individual ingredients? Brain Pill includes everything in one formula.

How Brain Pill affects the cognitive abilities
This research has provided new evidence for the mechanisms of action of Brain Pill in our body. According to the researchers, certain drugs in the plant have an inhibitory effect in the receptors 5HT2a and 5HT6. These are receptors of serotonin that are known to be involved in the functioning of the memory. In addition, the natural extract would have other effects that would positively influence the memory. The research has shown that the extract could inhibit enzymes such as atechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) and Prolyl endopeptidase (PEP). COMT is known to modulate our memory because it affects the metabolism of dopamine.
The inhibitory effect of the components of Brain Pill would thus improve memory. The second enzyme, PEP, is known to be active in the field of peptide cleavage in neurons, a process that is related to cognitive decline. The PEP enzyme splits neuropeptides such as arginine vaspressin, oxytocin, neurotensin and Substance P. All these molecules play a key role in the positive reinforcement, in social interactions, in emotions and in response to stress. By inhibiting the activity of PEP, Brain Pill extract would have a positive effect in the fight against cognitive decline and have a beneficial effect on cognitive abilities.
