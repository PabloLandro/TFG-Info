New Alternative to Formula 3 Antifungal Treatment Available Online

PediMD is a new, effective alternative to Formula 3 and is available for purchase online!
Formula 3 Antifungal Treatment is widely dispensed through doctors offices in the United States, with placement in over 6,000 doctors offices nationwide.
Formula 3 was the second antifugnal lacquer introduced into doctors offices after the unsuccessful launch of Penlac. Penlac only had an 8% success rate for fully treating toenail fungus. Formula 3, which is also an oil based lacquer, has had much better success at treating toenail fungus, but is not offered for sale online. The makers of Formula 3 antifungal treatment issue a warning not to purchase their products online.
In the last couple years there have been many advancements in the treatment of toenail fungus. With the introduction of the Anitfungal Laser, patients have a non-invasive, fairly expensive means of getting rid of toenail fungus.
There have also been advancements in the development and engineering of antifungal lacquers. These new innovations are paving the way for new products to overcome the monopolies that products such as Zetaclear, Zero Fungus, and Formula 3 currently have on doctors offices and online sales.
PediMD is new a Doctor-Formulated, 2-Step antifungal treatment system that has been engineered as a safe base coat under nail polish. PediMD Antifungal Nail Treatment System is much like Formula 3 in that it combines FDA approved medicine with natural oils and extracts. This allows the treatment to penetrate the nail and reach the source of the fungus in the nail matrix.
The PediMD approach to treating toenail fungus has proven very effective with 72% success rate. PediMD is available for purchase throughout doctors offices in Los Angeles, various nail salons, and online through PediMD Antifungal Treatment Store.

Stop Athlete's Foot Fungus From Returning

40 Million Americans suffer from Athlete's Foot Fungus every year and around half of them will successfully treat the fungal infection, only to have it return within a couple months. 25% of individuals who suffer from Athlete's Foot Fungus have a systematic condition. This means that they must continually protect their feet from fungus breakouts and from Athlete's Foot Fungus From Returning or they will perpetually suffer the effects of fungus such as: peeling skin under toes, itchy feet, and thick, cracking heels.
Preventing Athlete's Foot and Foot Fungus from returning is an on-going battle.
There are many treatments designed to eliminate Athlete's Foot. The most prominent ones are Anti-Fungal Creams and Sprays. Unlike the treatment of Toenail Fungus, Athlete's Foot Fungus treatments are actually highly effective at eliminating fungus on the skin.
Systematic foot fungus sufferers need to use an anti-fungal agent at least three times a week in order to stop the Athlete's Foot Fungus From returning. For people who suffer from a systematic condition or are worried about contracting another fungal infection widely distributed creams such as Lamisil and Lotromin can have some adverse side effects. Frequent use of creams such as Lamisil and Lotromin can dry out and even irritate the skin. It is essential that if one were to use these treatments on a regular basis in order to prevent future fungal infections that they pair them with another moisturizing foot cream.
It is also not recommended to use Lamisil and Lotromin anti-fungal cream's when one does not show any signs of fungus; even if one has had a fungal infection in the past and the feet are still susceptible to contracting another fungal condition. For this very reason PediMD engineered a Moisturizing Foot Cream that has anit-fungal properties and is designed for everyday use.

Clotrimazole 1% Anti fungal Cream with Natural Oils

Clotrimazole is one of the oldest FDA approved anti fungals for the treatment of toenail fungus, foot fungus, and jock itch. Clotrimazole 1% is approved as an over the counter treatment and many creams and ointments utilize the medicine as an effective means of treating fungus.
Generic Clotrimazole 1% Cream's are sold in pharmacies, grocery stores and supermarket's. These creams have no side effects and are solely effective in treating fungal infections. One of the major criticisims of generic anti fungal Clotrimazole Cream is that it can dry out the skin and leave it susceptible to cracking and peeling.
In order to combat this major issue with generic Clotrimazole 1% Creams, Dr. Bob Baravarian along with a team of podiatrists and dermatologists, engineered PediMD Anti fungal Moisturizing Cream. Unlike other products PediMD Cream combines Clotrimazole 1% with multiple natural oils and extracts that are designed to moisturize the skin, combat fungal odor and prevent cracking. PediMD Cream has been used to treat fungal infections on the feet, back, ears, toes, jock, anus and even toenails even though is says "Foot Cream" on the label!
PediMD is available for purchase online through Amazon Storefront and PediMD Online Store.

Anti Fungal Base Coat Under Nail Polish - Prevent Nail Salon Fungus
Posted by Sam Shoosh on Mon, Aug 01, 2011 @ 04:04 AM
Email Article

delicious
Using an anti fungal base under nail polish, even under anti fungal nail polish, has many benefits. First, look for a base coat that contains FDA approved anti fungal's; many products contain only natural oils that are known to be anti fungal, which are not as effective as an anti fungal medicine.
Keep in mind that you are actually trying to treat fungal nails and use nail polish at the same time. In order to achieve the former is it imperative that the anti fungal treatment successfully do two things. First, the anti fungal base coat must penetrate the nail under the nail polish in order to treat the infection at the source at the matrix of the nail. Second, the base coat must stay on the nail and continually treat the fungal infection on the toes even after nail polish has been applied.
The majority of nail salons recommend a cuticle oil to strengthen the nail and help protect it from getting infected. Again, the issue with using a cuticle oil is that it will not fight a fungal infection and gradually allow the condition to get worse.
PediMD Nail Treatment System is designed as a base coat under nail polish that combines FDA approved anti fungal medicine, Clotrimazole 1%, with multiple natural oils and extracts such as Tea Tree Oil, Jojoba Oil, Lemongrass and Fennel.
The base coat treatment is designed as a two step system. First step is an Anti-fungal lacquer that penetrates the nail and attacks the fungus lurking under. the nail plate. The second step is an anti fungal sealer that binds the lacquer to the nail and ensures that the treatment stays on the nail even after nail polish is applied.
The first question that many women have is, "Now am I going to have to wait for three coats of polish to dry before I can leave the nail salon?" The answer to the question is simply NO! Both the Step 1 Lacquer and the Step 2 Sealer dry in a matter of 10 seconds so the only inconvenience is having to apply them as a base coat under nail polish.
Other benefits of PediMD Nail Treatment System, other than the fact that it will successfully treat nail fungus even when applied under nail polish, is that the treatment will strengthen the nail, promote the growth of a new healthy nail, prevent the fungus from spreading, and protect the nail from contracting other infections commonly found in nail salons.
In conclusion, not being able to wear nail polish when trying to treat fungal infections is no longer an issue! PediMD Nail Treatment System is a doctor formulated over the counter treatment that combines FDA approved anti-fungal medicine with natural oils and extracts and is engineered as a safe, effective base coat under nail polish.

4 Tips to Treat Peeling, Cracking, Itchy, Smelly Skin on Heels & Feet

Are you experiencing any of the following symptoms?
Cracked Skin on Heels
Peeling Skin In-Between Toes
Itchy Skin on Feet
Redness on Skin
Skin Irritation (especially at night)
Smelly Feet
Dr. Bob Recommends the following Footcare Tips:
The skin on heels and feet is suseptable to a number of different conditions that can be avoided by following a few simple steps. The most common conditios people report are peeling, cracking, irritation, redness and even foul odor. It is normal for anyone to experience at least one of these conditions in their lifetime; the good news is that these symptoms are easily treated and their recurrence can be easily prevented.
Avoid Excess Dryness - Applying harsh chemicals or soaking your feet in acidic substances can dry out the skin and leave the foot susceptible to cracking and peeling. Simply washing your feet twice a day and thoroughly drying will help control foot odor and prevent further peeling and cracking of the heel.
Take a GOOD, HARD look at your feet - Inspect your entire foot. Look closely in between toes and check for any signs of fungus. Foot Fungus and Athlete's Foot are a major cause of itchy peeling skin in-between toes. Fungus can spread onto the heels and toenails, thus it is crucial to spot the fungus before it gets out of hand and continues to damage the skin.
Change your socks and shoes - NEVER reuse socks before washing them! Also, try not to wear shoes without socks. If your feet sweat it is imperative that you take steps to avoid sweat buildup in your shoes and socks. Apply gold bond foot powder directly onto the foot and sprinkle some into your shoes before dressing.
Treat Any Fungal Infections, Cuts, Abrasions and Warts on the heels and feet - Before you can achieve happy healthy feet you must first treat any underlying conditions that can cause future problems. Applying an Anti-Fungal moisturizing Foot Cream such as PediMD will eliminate fungus and prevent issues such as cracking heels, peeling skin and smelly feet.

ZetaClear vs PediMD: Over the Counter Toenail Fungus Treatment Review

ZetaClear vs. PediMD
Two Over the counter toenail fungus treatments that are available online are Zetaclear and PediMD. Zetaclear along with a couple other heavily marketed products (ZeroFungus, Funginix ect.) have an oligopoly over the online sales of toenail funugs treatment. It is commonplace to search a term regarding toenail fungus and end up on a fairly mediocre webpage with flashing Zetaclear banners scattered everywhere. Their reign of supremacy has diluted the information available online and even caused some more effective OTC Toenail Fungus Treatments, such as Formula 3, to fray away from pursuing sales online.
As a player in the market since the late 90's, Zetaclear and its partner products may be easier to get found on the internet, but are they actually effective over the counter toenail fungus treatments? In this article we compare ZetaClear to PediMD. PediMD is an over the counter toenail fungus and athlete's foot treatment that was developed by leading podiatrist, Dr. Bob Baravarian DPM, in 2009. PediMD is actually dispensed through doctors offices, has conducted successful clinical trials, and maintains one site with one blog. Our competition has thousands of similar different sites with half written information and material from the same company just presented in different fashions to make a product that has not been truly tested look better than it is.

Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets vs. Sporanox Tablets: Which one?
Posted by Sam Shoosh on Thu, Jul 07, 2011 @ 02:43 AM

The only two tablets approved by the FDA for the treatment of fungal infections on the skin and toes are Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets and Sporanox Tablets. Doctor's debate which one to prescribe to patients. As we will see later in this article, both Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets and Sporanox Tablets have advantages and disadvantages when compared to one-another.
Weather a simple foot spray or Terbinafine Tablets, Lamisil has established its' name worldwide as a leader in anti fungal treatment. One could argue that Lamisil's least successful product in terms of effectiveness in treating fungus is Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets. Clinical trials were conducted and Terbinafine tablets were deemed only 38% successful in clearing toenail fungus. This is fairly low for a treatment that can cost a few hundred dollars a month.
Sporanox Tablets are the other oral prescription anti fungal available today. Itraconazole, the generic name for Sporanox, is used to fight fungal infections of the lungs as well as toenails and skin. When clinically tested for the treatment of Onychomoshosis (Toenail Fungus), Sporanox Tablets recorded a 14% success rate. Dismal; even when compared to the 38% recorded by Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets.
The chart below outlines characteristics about Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets and Sporanox Tablets that should be considered when deciding which one (if any!) to take.

After reviewing the table it is obvious that there are a couple common disadvantages between Terbinafine Lamisil Tablets and Sporanox Tablets. First, the laundry list of side effects that accompany the treatments is astronomical. Additionally, it is required that patients do not drink or smoke when prescribed anti fungal tablets. Finally, the cost of both treatments is to high to have to pay out of pocket.
The other major treatments available for toenail fungus are Anti-Fungal Nail Lacquers and Anti-fungal Lasers. In the past Nail Lacquers have not been very effective, but there are new products emerging that have proven to be more successful. Anti-fungal Lasers are relatively new and only a handful have been FDA approved. It is becoming common practice to combine Laser treatment with a Lacquer but Laser Treatment cost about $1000 and is not covered by insurance.
Many doctors fray away from prescribing anti-fungal tablets for the treatment of toenail fungus because of the side effects and the high potential of the fungus returning.

Anti fungal Foot Bath: Vinegar vs. Listerine
Posted by Sam Shoosh on Tue, Jul 05, 2011 @ 12:46 AM

delicious
Vinegar and Listerine foot bath's are regularly used to treat fungus on the nails and feet. Apple Cider Vinegar, White Vinegar and Listerine have anti-fungal properties that allow them to break down the nail and fight fungus under the nail.
Vinegar is a strong acid. Fungus is eliminated when exposed to strong acids. Thus, acidic substances can be used to kill fungus and soften the nail. The issue with continuously using a vinegar foot bath for fungus is that the skin on the foot can get dried out and irritated. Soaking feet in Vinegar can also leave a strong odor..
Applying Listerine onto the nail or using it as an anti-fungal foot bath can be somewhat successful. Listerine is comprised of strong alcohols that are designed to fight bacteria and fungus (Candida) in the mouth. Listerine as a mouthwash is only used for 30 seconds, soaking feet in it for extended periods of time can irritate the skin around the nail and dehydrate the skin.

Comparing these two Home Remedies for fungus is pretty simple. Both Vinegar and Listerine Foot Bath's are ineffective treatments for fungus. Soaking your feet in harsh acidic or alcoholic substances has less than a 10% success rate and can be problematic to the skin around the nails and on the feet.

Nail Fungus Home Remdies: Vicks Vapo Rub vs. Tea Tree Oil

Two of the most widely used Home Remedies for Toenail Fungus are Vicks Vapo Rub and Tea Tree Oil. Vicks Vapo Rub is used as a remedy for nail fungus because the vapo rub application can actually help soften the nail and allow menthol, the active ingredient found in vicks vapo rub, to penetrate the nail and treat the fungus in the matrix. The issue with using Vicks for nail fungus is that it is very difficult to keep the treatment onto the nails. Using Vicks Vapo Rub to treat toenail fungus will be ineffective unless patients are willing to tape or band aide their toes everyday.
Tea Tree Oil is known for its healing and anti-fungal properties. Tea Tree Oil can treat Athlete's Foot, dandruff and nail fungus. The issue with using Tea Tree Oil for Nail Fungus is that the Tea Tree molecule is to large and cannot penetrate the nail and treat the fungus growing under the nail plate in the matrix of the nail.

Aditionally, using Vicks Vapo Rub has a couple negative side effects such as causing the nail to turn black or irritating the skin around the nail.
