Condition
Athlete’s Foot is a very common problem in Australia. Sometimes called tinea (in fact its correct name is tinea pedis), it is caused by a fungal infection of the skin. It most commonly occurs in between the toes but it can also be on the soles or sides of the feet.1
You certainly don’t need to be an athlete to get Athlete’s Foot. The fungus can be picked up from any damp or humid area where people walk barefooted, such as a bathroom, change room, yoga studio or around a swimming pool.1

Symptoms
Please consult a health professional for advice on the diagnosis and management of Athlete’s Foot.
One of the most common symptoms of Athlete’s Foot is itchiness. While everyone’s feet get itchy from time to time, if the itchiness persists it could be a sign of Athlete’s Foot. Many people will also have flaking or scaly skin, especially between the toes.1
There are other possible symptoms too – see the chart below:
Symptoms of Athlete’s Foot
Scaling, peeling, cracked skin between the toes
Redness, itching, blisters on the skin
Whitish and soft-looking appearance
A stinging or burning sensation
Peeling, cracking and scaling of feet
Inflamed Symptoms
On top of the itchiness, sometimes Athlete’s Foot causes persistent stinging and irritation, and painful blisters or ‘raw’ skin (ulcers) can appear. This can be very uncomfortable, and is often a result of inflammation caused by the infection.
A dual-acting treatment that fights the infection and soothes the inflammation may be needed.

Tips & Prevention
Tips to treat and help prevent Athlete’s Foot
If you’ve ever had Athlete’s Foot, you’ll know how irritating it can be. But there are effective ways to treat it and reduce the chances of it coming back.
Keeping your feet as healthy as possible is the first step to both managing and avoiding Athlete’s Foot. You can also use a proven treatment like SolvEasy once your health professional has confirmed that your symptoms are a result of Athlete’s Foot.
Things you should do to look after your feet
Follow these simple tips to help keep your feet healthy so you can manage Athlete’s Foot if you currently have it, and help prevent it if you don’t.
Wash your feet well every day
Dry your feet thoroughly after washing them – using a hairdryer can help, especially between the toes
Avoid sharing towels with others
Give your feet adequate time to dry before putting on footwear
Wear breathable shoes or sandals where possible
Avoid thick, tight footwear that squeezes your toes together
Wear a clean pair of socks every day, or even twice daily if your feet sweat a lot
Wear thongs or sandals in communal areas, such as showers, change rooms and around public swimming pools
If possible, allow damp shoes to air dry for at least 24 hours before putting them back on – alternating between pairs of shoes each day is a good idea
Wash with a soap-free cleanser, like QV Gentle Wash as soap may further irritate your skin
Treatment
SolvEasy Tinea Cream, Gel and Spray
SolvEasy works fast to get you back on your feet, minus the itch and irritation. In fact, you only need to use it for 7 days to treat tinea infections between the toes. (Other treatments can take up to 28 days.)

Resolve Plus
For inflamed Athlete’s Foot, ask your pharmacist about Resolve Plus. It contains an effective antifungal agent (miconazole nitrate 2%) as well as a calming anti-inflammatory agent, so it helps fight the infection and soothe the symptoms.
How to use Resolve Plus
Clean and dry the affected area thoroughly before applying Resolve Plus 1.0.
Gently apply the cream to the affected area and surrounding skin twice a day until the inflammation subsides.
To avoid the problem recurring, use another antifungal treatment after the symptoms have disappeared:
SolvEasy can be used for a further 7 days if the Athlete’s Foot is between the toes.
Resolve Tinea Cream can be used for a further 14 days if it’s on the soles or sides of the feet.
