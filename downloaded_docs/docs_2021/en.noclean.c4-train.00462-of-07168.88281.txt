What are migraines?
A migraine is a strong headache that is often felt as a throbbing pain, and can also cause sickness, nausea and sensitivity to light. They can last from 4 hours to 3 days and are a very common health complaint (more prevalent in women than in men).
Some people have migraines as frequently as several times a week, while some people may notice a pattern as to when their migraines occur. They affect each person differently and some people may experience a loss of appetite, dizziness, fatigue or an upset stomach alongside the other, more common, symptoms.
Migraines are not one-size-fits-all though, as there are several different types. Migraine with aura is the classic kind; this means that there are warning signs before the onset of the actual headache, such as flashing lights, blurred vision or blind spots. Migraine without aura is the more common type, where you don’t receive these warnings beforehand and the first sign of the migraine is the actual headache. There is also something known as a ‘silent migraine’, where you may get the other symptoms without the actual headache.
What causes migraines?
The specific cause of migraines is not currently known, but it’s been linked to changes of nerves, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain. For several years, it was thought to be caused by changes in blood flow in the brain, but now research is suggesting that it’s because of flaws in the brain that are inherited from your parents.
Migraine headaches begin when overactive nerve cells send signals to the nerve responsible for sensation in your head and face. This releases serotonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which causes blood vessels in the brain to swell and pain to be activated.
The reason that people are more susceptible to migraines has not been identified fully, but the triggers are well-known. Varying from person to person, migraines can begin due to stress, tiredness or starting your period. They can also be triggered by bright lights, changes in weather or changes to your sleeping pattern.
Food and drink can also play a role in causing your migraines with common culprits including skipping meals, consuming too much caffeine, or eating foods containing nitrates or monosodium glutamate (MSG).
How can I treat migraines?
If you are susceptible to developing migraines then you will likely struggle with this your whole life, as there is no cure. However, there are plenty of options available for treating the symptoms when a migraine occurs.
Painkillers are the most popular treatment as they dull the headache and allow sufferers to continue with daily life. Many painkiller medications have been specifically designed with migraines in mind, to make sure they are as effective as possible. You may also consider anti-emetics if you suffer particularly badly with nausea and vomiting as part of your migraine, or preventative medications if you notice migraines more than 4 times a month.
