Product Description
Honeysuckle Weave Magnetic Copper Bracelet for pain relief
This copper bracelet design was inspired by the playful pattern of native Cherokee baskets, where crooked honeysuckle vines were often included to add character into the weave. A copper bracelet using silver, brass and copper creates electrolysis between the 3 metals as well as between the skin generating a mild electrical current that negatively ionizes the body thus reducing inflammation and relieving pain. This copper bracelet has (2) 4000-5000 gauss magnets combining copper ionic therapy and magnetic therapy. Copper bracelets are the strongest treatment for hand (arthritis tendinitis), wrist (arthritis, tendinitis, carpal tunnel), elbow (arthritis, tendinitis) and shoulder (bursitis, tendonitus, frozen shoulder) on the arm they are worn. However they will often help neck, back and knees.

Super quick service and great looking bangle!
Posted by Unknown on 18th Feb 2017
Was very pleased at how quick your service was - I live on New Zealand and had your bangle within eight days of ordering. A beautifully crafted bracelet and with the bonus of not looking like your standard arthritis prevention copper bracelet! Love it and I've had some envious comments fits in very nicely with the silver and gold bangles I already wear. Have been wearing the bracelet for 10 days - early days yet but the pain into hands seems to have lessened hugely. Many thanks! :-)
