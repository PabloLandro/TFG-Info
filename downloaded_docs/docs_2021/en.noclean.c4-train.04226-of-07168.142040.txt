I Loved drawing the Pinky and the Brain cartoon. So, I had to draw ‘The Brain” again! In this Brainstorm cartoon, we play some music for “The Brain.”

The Power of Music To Reduce Stress – By Jane Collingwood
Listening to music can have a tremendously relaxing effect on our minds and bodies, especially slow, quiet classical music. This type of music can have a beneficial effect on our physiological functions, slowing the pulse and heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing the levels of stress hormones.
potential benefits of music…they have found:
Music’s form and structure can bring order and security to disabled and distressed children. It encourages coordination and communication, so improves their quality of life.
Listening to music on headphones reduces stress and anxiety in hospital patients before and after surgery.
Music can help reduce both the sensation and distress of both chronic pain and postoperative pain.
Listening to music can relieve depression and increase self-esteem ratings in elderly people.
Making music can reduce burnout and improve mood among nursing students.
Music therapy significantly reduces emotional distress and boosts quality of life among adult cancer patients.
