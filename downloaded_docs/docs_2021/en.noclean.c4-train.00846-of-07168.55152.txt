I actually don't think dermarolling will be the answer.
Follicum, which is using copper peptides, and another drug (the new one, used
to treat bones, but was found it might grow hair), sounds too good to be true, but
they recently received a patent from Europe.
I'm on the fence about pictures. I don't think dermarolling alone will do shit,
for anybody.
Are people interested in my current pictures? Again, please let me say for the record,
I believe early intervention with Finasteride and Minoxidil are the key.
I started fighting my hairloss agressively very late in life (used Minoxidil only, until
I was 43 years old).
Hereunder are my baseline pictures, when I started in June 2018.
If people want to see what my hair looks like now, let me know. I will post pictures.
But I believe early treatment is a much better option, than what I am currently
doing now.
Let's face it, most guys don't want to take topical Progesterone. I started a thread
on another site, and got a very negative responses. I'm not a transsexual, I am
a heterosexual male.

Minoxidil causing skin sides has been debunked many times now: viewtopic.php?f=4&t=9
One bozo saw that in-vitro collagen study back in the mid-2000's and it has since created a wave of paranoia accross hair loss forums.
It's always the same pattern: a newbie reads about the claim that minoxidil causes wrinkles and then thinks he sees wrinkles on his face.
It's never the other way around, unsurprisingly. I myself have been using minoxidil for nearly 10 years and have been applying it on my bears for now 6 months. I'm 29 and still, barely any signs of ageing on my face.
I believe every hair loss sufferer should use minoxidil. When it comes to this disease: you can't afford to snob any treatment that is safe for you in my opinion.
In theory minoxidil inhibits collagen but without any sufficient in-vivo studies it's all pretty inconclusive. There are a ton of anecdotes but that's the worst form of evidence, you literally have people saying they got erectile dysfunction from using minoxidil. I've linked all the studies I found on collagen inhibition sometime ago. If it does inhibit collagen that's not necessarily a bad thing either since the accumulation of collagen helps lead to fibrosis which is potentially a very significant event in the balding process as it leads to fibrotic tissue in the scalp which reduces blood and nutrient flow to the follicle which slowly starves it and puts it into the state of miniaturization. This is just mostly speculation but if this was the case minoxidil could be classed as a double edged sword. Currently in my regime I'm replacing minoxidil with scalp massages which might seem useless and silly to you but based on my personal research and others it's a good option for promoting hair growth although I doubt it's as effective as minoxidil but it's hard to say. There is only one legitimate study on it that found a positive effect and I imagine that all comes down to funding as no company is going to sponsor a study for scalp massages when it isn't marketable but the massages work quite well in theory but you probably shouldn't rely on it as your only treatment.
https://www.biomediclaser.com/biomedicl ... ilMech.pdf
It's at the bottom of page 190 ~ Collagen Synthesis.
Here is a more direct link about it though
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2826267
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8311472
"Fibroblasts treated with minoxidil, 3'-hydroxyminoxidil, or 4'-hydroxyminoxidil synthesized a collagen specifically deficient in hydroxylysine by approximately 70%"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15908192
Minoxidil exerts different inhibitory effects on gene expression of lysyl hydroxylase 1, 2, and 3: implications for collagen cross-linking and treatment of fibrosis.
"Pictured above is one step in the the body's formation of collagen. The highlighted chain consists of the amino acid Lysine that the body Hydroxylizes into the needed forms through oxidation, vitamin C and iron. This happens through enzymes called Lysyl Hydroxylases, namely PLOD1, PLOD2 and PLOD3. Together with a chain of proline (pictured underneath) this ultimately forms procollagen, a progenitor form of what we ultimately seek"
Here is a study done on animals not found no inhibitory effect on collagen
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985251/
"Despite use of high minoxidil doses and the least irritating formulations, inhibitory effects were not demonstrated."
"If tensile strength can be assumed to be directly related to collagen crosslinking, the inhibition of lysyl hydroxylase by minoxidil, as demonstrated to occur in-vitro, apparently did not occur in this in-vivo model."
"In conclusion, although topical minoxidil improved the process of wound healing, our results did not support the proposed idea of minoxidil usage as an anti-fibrotic agent, because it did not alter the collagen content or tensile strength of burned area of the skin. "

I would probably try this again, I only used 1 bottle for a month last time of Medroxyprogesterone with minoxidil. I believe there are different kinds though?
Do you buy some sort of compound from a pharmacy and is it definitely the progesterone doing most of the work?

It is pure topical Progesterone, mixed with Finasteride
And Minoxidal. Everything is topical.

Topical might be safer. I don't really know, because I only took
oral for a few days. Didn't have side effects from it, but I'm just
paranoid that I might.

That's something I used to take, when it was available on Amazon. 5% Minoxidil
mixed, am I right?
And it also comes in 0.25% (Liposome)? That's equal to 2.5 milligrams of Finasteride.

Something similar although i got a private prescription for this and i asked for 0.05% of finasteride with minoxidil it was formulated by a pharmacy in Italy.
It was mainly ball ache on the 4th day that put me off.

Thst is a high dose. I think .01% is one milligram?
Was that five milligrams or .5 milligram?

Only 0.05mg and I was applying around 2ml which is only 0.10mg.
Pretty sure 1ml at 1% is 1mg
