Product Description
Sumerian Queen Magnetic Copper Bracelet for pain caused by inflammation
This magnetic copper bracelet inspired by the Sumerian goddess Ishtar the first woman seen wearing bracelets. A copper bracelet using silver, brass and copper creates electrolysis between the metals as well as between the skin generating a mild electrical current that negatively ionizes the body thus reducing inflammation and relieving pain. This copper bracelet has (2) 4000-5000 gauss magnets combining copper ionic therapy and magnetic therapy. Copper bracelets are the strongest treatment for hand (arthritis tendinitis), wrist (arthritis, tendinitis, carpal tunnel), elbow (arthritis, tendinitis) and shoulder (bursitis, tendinitis, frozen shoulder) on the arm they are worn. However they will often help neck, back and knees.
