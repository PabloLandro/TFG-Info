A Quick Look at the Best ​Rogaine Shampoo
It’s best to start using Minoxidil at the first sign of thinning hair because it does not completely stop hair loss – what it does is to significantly boost hair growth and regrowth. This can halt your hair loss and for some even result in significant regrowth. Here is a list of some of our favorite Minoxidil products on the market.
Regenepure Minoxidil Spray
This spray helps energize hair follicles and increases blood flow to them, even to follicles that have already atrophied and have been dormant for a long time. New hair growth may be observed over bald areas when treated with Regenepure Minoxidil Spray. Existing hair also benefits from the treatment and become noticeably thicker and stronger.
Men's Rogaine Foam
This is one of the leading hair regrowth products on the market. Results are seen after 3-6 months of use, but keep in mind that it may initially cause increased shedding during the start of treatment. This is normal though since basically your hair follicles are restarting and will grow out again. Don’t worry and just keep on using Rogaine for at least 2-3 weeks more. If shedding persists for more than 2-3 weeks with daily use of the product, discontinue using it and look into other options for preventing ﻿﻿﻿thinning hair.
L'emarie Intensive Energizing Scalp and Hair Growth Treatment
This shampoo for thinning hair contains more than just minoxidil to promote renewed hair growth. It has a unique blend of DHT blockers, natural ingredients, niacin, biotin and other vitamins.
Equate - Hair Regrowth Treatment
This product contains clinical strength minoxidil and no other harsh chemicals that may cause scalp problems. Hair becomes noticeably longer and thicker within a few weeks of use.
Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength
The extra strength formulation is stronger at promoting renewed hair growth over balding areas.
Results are of varying degrees. The improvement in hair regrowth generally does not extend more than 48 weeks despite continuous treatment. However you usually keep the regrowth your received up until then.
Hairomega Serum 2% Minoxidil Foam
This serum contains 2 percent minoxidil as its main active ingredient which is a lower concentration than many other products. The lower concentration might be good if you are extra sensitive to Minoxidil and experience any side effects from it. It also contains DHT Blocking Saw Palmetto, Grape Seed Extract and Myricetin.
Nioxin Minoxidil 5% Hair Regrowth Treatment
This product claims to promote faster results with daily use. It has a higher concentration of minoxidil to deliver renewed growth of hair for fuller and thicker hair.
Fo﻿﻿lig﻿﻿en
The ingredients of this shampoo product play a number of benefits relating to hair loss, hair strengthening, hair repair, and stimulating growth.
Reviews Of The Best Minoxidil Shampoos
Regenepure Minoxidil Spray
The special spray nozzle delivers a fine mist that containing 5% minoxidil. The mist applicator delivers a targeted and clean amount of active ingredients to help with hair loss. This makes application easier without wetting the hair with excess product.
The fine mist allows for more accurate delivery of minoxidil-containing liquid to areas that need treatment.
We highly recommend Regenepure Minoxidil Spray as it's one of our favorites among hair loss products!
By using pregnenolone cream or pregnenolone supplements, the levels of the compound in the body increases, and this brings about various benefits such as fatigue relief, and delay of the aging process.
Things We Liked
Easy to dispense
Combine with Regenepure shampoo for even better results
Things We Didn't Like
Only contains Minoxidil
Purchase This Product on Amazon
Men's Rogaine Foam
Clinical testing demonstrated successful hair regrowth in 9 out of 10 male participants using Rogaine. Hair even became thicker with continued use.
This product is recommended as a long term treatment for men suffering from hereditary type of hair loss.
Recommended use is twice per day, every day. Results are typically evident in at least 2 months of continued use. When hair regrowth is seen, it is important to continue using Rogaine to maintain results. Stopping use might cause shedding of acquired regrowth.
The formulation works on shrunken hair follicles by increasing their size. This promotes normal hair growth of previously damaged or dormant hair follicles.
Results are typically seen between 2 to 4 months of daily use. If results are not seen within this period, stop use and and look into other options.
At the initiation of treatment, hair loss may seem to speed up. This is a sign that the hair follicles are starting to enter a new cycle of hair growth. It essentially sheds off unhealthy hair to make room for new, healthier and stronger hair. New hair appears as a peach fuzz of colorless soft hair.​

May take 4 months before hair regrowth is observed
Purchase This Product on Amazon
L'emarie Intensive Energizing Scalp and Hair Growth Treatmen﻿﻿t

Biotin in this shampoo for hair growth serves as a nourishing vitamin. It supports stronger and healthier hair growth.

Purchase This Product on Amazon
Equate - Hair Regrowth Treatment
This is recommended for those suffering from substantial hair loss or hair thinning. It has a clinically proven formulation for speeding up hair growth. It also helps keep hair healthier and stronger.
Avoid using more than the recommended dosage. Doing so won’t speed up hair growth more.​
Things We Liked
Faster results, in 6-8 weeks of use
May be used for various types of hair thinning, including receding frontal hairline
Things We Didn't Like
Need for continued use or else, hair loss will return
Purchase This Product on Amazon
Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength
This is one of the more popular standalone minoxidil products. The concentration of minoxidil is at 5%. This product comes with a dropper applicator for ease and convenience of product application. Hair growth can also be increased even more by using Minoxidil in combination with Carnitine.
Things We Liked
May work for those suffering from low to moderate levels of hair loss

Things We Didn't Like
Formulated to address thinning over the top of the scalp (vertex type of hair loss). Not as potent for receding frontal hair lines.
Purchase This Product on Amazon
Hairomega Serum 2% Minoxidil Foam
This product contains natural compounds that help in blocking DHT in the hair follicles. DHT is a more potent metabolite of the hormone testosterone. It has a higher affinity to the hair follicles.
When DHT accumulates in the hair follicles, it can block the supply of oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to poor hair health that may eventually lead to hair thinning, hair loss and baldness.
This product also nourishes the scalp by boosting blood circulation.
To use, apply 2 pumps of the serum over the thinning or balding areas two times each day. Massage the serum into the scalp.

Male Pattern Baldness and Minoxidil
Male pattern baldness is a condition characterized by pattern hair thinning. It eventually leads to baldness. This can affect both men and women although it appears to be more prevalent in men.
There are many products and treatments developed to attempt to reverse hair thinning and hair loss. Numerous products are available such as various types of shampoos.​ One of the leading treatment options for baldness, hair loss and hair thinning is minoxidil.
Minoxidil was originally developed as a drug treatment for high blood pressure. Some users developed excessive hair growth while on minoxidil pills. This was especially seen among women.
That incident made researchers realize the potential of this compound to help treat hair loss. Topical formulations were later developed and made available as hair loss treatments.
Today, minoxidil is used as shampoos, gels, serums and many other forms of topical application. Minoxidil can also be used in pill form but is not recommended since it would also directly affect your blood pressure which can cause side effects.
How to Use Minoxidil
Whether minoxidil comes in sprays, droppers or foam dispensers, the use is pretty much the same. A small amount of solution is dispensed and then massaged into problem areas.
Minoxidil solutions come either in 2% or 5% concentration. The stronger 5% concentration is more effective. It delivers faster and more robust hair regrowth without increased risk for side effects.​
How Minoxidil Works
This compound works by directly acting on the hair follicles. Minoxidil boosts blood flow which in turn enables delivery of more vital nutrients to the hair follicles. As a result, you can slow down the process of hair follicle death, which is one of the reasons behind thinning hair. This results in the growth of thicker hair strands and in some cases even regrowth.
Minoxidil prevents the shrinking of hair follicles, which in turn prolongs the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle. This causes hair to grow longer faster and also results in the growth of more hair strands.
The positive effects of minoxidil on hair regrowth can be further enhanced with the use of other hair growth promoting products such as laser combs.​
Conclusion
The most popular pick for beginners among all these hair growth products is Rogaine, which was one of the first Minoxidil products on the market. The higher concentration of minoxidil delivers faster and greater results. The formulation is easy to apply and gets absorbed into the scalp quickly.
The price is affordable, considering its effectiveness. It is good value for money. Do note that results vary according to many factors such as type and extent of hair thinning.
However, If you suffer from substantial hair loss, we recommend you try a product that contains many different ingredients. This will maximize your chances of regrowth rather than just relying on minoxidil. All above reviewed products that contain more ingredients than just minoxidil are good choices, which is why we gave them 5 stars. However, they are more expensive than Rogaine.
To further improve results, you may also use shampoos that address hair thinning issues.
If you’re still relatively young, there’s no reason to put up with hair loss. You can still enjoy many years of a full head of hair if you do something about it as soon as you can.
