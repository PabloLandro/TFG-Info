Effective UV Curing Requires the Right UV Lamp
Ultraviolet radiation is utilized in many industrial and commercial processes worldwide to instantly dry and cure polymers. When polymers such as epoxies, silicone and polyurethane are exposed to UV radiation, a photochemical reaction occurs which bonds and seals the polymer within seconds of exposure.
There are many advantages of using UV curing over other curing methods such as air drying or using chemicals. Air drying polymers leaves the coating susceptible to contaminants such as dust to affect the quality of the surface as well as evaporation which can leave an uneven surface and an inconsistent process. Using chemicals can pose a health risk to employees and requires purchasing, storing and disposing of chemicals properly.
UV curing delivers a quick and consistent process which results in enhanced product durability and strength without evaporation or contamination.

Reduce Psoriasis Symptoms with UV Lamps
People that suffer from psoriasis experience dry, itchy patches of skin in raised, hardened lesions ranging from mild to moderate symptoms. Conventional treatments such as topical ointments provide relief to some patients with mild to moderate symptoms but are not as effective to people with severe symptoms.
Phototherapy with Ultraviolet (UV) light is proven highly effective at controlling psoriasis symptoms, providing relief to patients suffering with this bothersome skin condition. Phototherapy imitates the sun’s natural healing effects when narrow-band UVB lamps are used for treatment along with lamps combining both UVA and UVB wavelengths.
UV Lamp for Psoriasis Treatment
UV lamp therapy for psoriasis treatment must be administered from a doctor’s office or a medical setting with the correct type of UV phototherapy lamp. Two types of UVB exposure may be prescribed with either narrow band or broad band wavelengths. The main difference between the two is that the narrow band UVB lamps provide a smaller range of UV exposure.
UVA wavelengths are also used to treat psoriasis although are typically used in combination with psoralen, a medication which increases the skin’s receptiveness to the UV wavelengths. This UV treatment with psoralen is called PUVA, which slows down the excessive growth of skins cells providing effective treatment. Consistency is key to seeing results which may be visible in a few weeks to months.

UV Solutions for Ballast Water Treatment Requirements
The Ballast Water Treatment Convention (BWTC) is a worldwide agreement enforced by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). The MEPC is a subsidiary of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and is enforcing new standards globally for the way that ships treat and manage their ballast water. Effective on September 8, 2017, new regulations went into effect that require all ships traveling in international waters to provide adequate treatment systems for their ballast water.
Ships use water in the ballast of their ships for balance when traveling through the seas. They will pick up water in one port after leaving cargo, and release in another port when picking up cargo. This transfer of ocean water from one area to another is wreaking havoc on marine life and the ecosystem in which foreign organisms are deposited into a port thousands of miles from their origination. These invading marine organisms can thrive without their natural predators. Invading jellyfish have shut down once thriving fishing ports, mussels have attached to structures and dams threating the health and safety of people on the shore.
Improper use and disposal of ballast water has been identified as one of the greatest threats to the sustainability of our planet’s oceans.
UV Treatment of Ballast Water Proven Safe and Effective
Ultraviolet (UV) technology is proven highly effective at sterilizing and purifying water, air and surfaces in a multitude of applications.
