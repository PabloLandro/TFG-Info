The saying goes that you should starve a fever, but this isn’t advisable. Just as with viral infections such as flu and cold, proper nutrition, and, even more important, proper hydration are crucial to recovering from sickness, as well as staying healthy, says Laura Vetter, RDN, CDE, CSO, CSP, outpatient nutritionist at Saint Peter’s University Hospital and author of the Ask Saint Peter’s nutritionist blog.
“Stay hydrated to help your body fight infections.” she says. When a fever or cold arises, drink plenty of water. Flavored water, decaffeinated tea and low-sodium broth are other good options to consume throughout the day.
Here are Saint Peter’s Better Health Library recipe ingredients for a different take on the standard feel-good meal many have when they are sick – chicken soup.
Multigrain Chicken Soup
Ingredients
1/2 cup raw brown rice
1/3 cup medium barley
1/3 cup red lentils
1/3 cup yellow split peas
2 large ribs celery, sliced
4 large carrots, sliced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon powdered ginger
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt, depending on taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
12 cups water
