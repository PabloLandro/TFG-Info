Can you tell me how to prevent an ovarian cyst?
Dr. John Berryman, University of Virginia School of Medicine Answered Jul. 20, 2014
52 years experience in Obstetrics & Gynecology
Ovarian cysts. The use of oral contraceptives offer protection from the majority of ovarian cysts, secondary to supression of hormonal activity in the pituitary gland, which makes the ovary not produce eggs, but essentially stops cyst formation as well. This should be discussed with your health care professional , as your history and family history may play a major role in the decision to use this therapy. .

Birth control pills. Small cysts develop every month during ovulation, and sometimes these normal cysts become excessively large or bleed, resulting in pain and possibly requiring surgery. Birth control pills prevent ovulation and so prevent this type of cyst. They may also help discourage new endometriomas. However, some cysts, like dermoids, do not depend on ovulation for recurrence.

Healthy diet. A healthy diet is likely to prevent ovarian systs, though there is little research to support it. Common advice is to avoid sugar and simple carbs, emphasize fruits & vegies, esp. Dark leafy greens, & minimize meats, dairy, &eggs, esp. If not organic (to avoid hormones & antibiotics in meats). Some advise an alkaline diet & foods rich in phytoestrogens.

A fluid collection. Most women of child bearing years have collections of fluid in the ovaries surrounded by a thin wall of tissue. This is an ovarian cyst and is common during each menstrual cycle. In most cases these are benign. Diet and exercise do not play a role as far as we know in reducing the risk of having a cyst. Speak with your gynecologist or primary care physician if you have further questions. Read more...
