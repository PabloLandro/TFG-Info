Most people may not know about the health benefits of music therapy which is now used in a holistic manner for many healthy concerns. In fact, music therapy may even sound absurd or a waste of time.
Let’s define music therapy. Music Therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.
At its hub, music is sound, and sound is entrenched in vibration. Led by Lee Bartel, PhD, a music professor at the University of Toronto, several researchers are exploring whether sound vibrations absorbed through the body can help ease the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, fibromyalgia and depression. Known as vibroacoustic therapy, the intervention involves using low frequency sound — similar to a low rumble — to produce vibrations that are applied directly to the body.
Music therapy has been effectively used to help with stress, cancer, speech impediments, high blood pressure, heart concerns, mental disorders as well as a number of health concerns. Music therapy is a holistic health approach in supporting the body’s natural healing abilities.
While there are many different ways to use music therapy, using music therapy for pain has shown good results. Music therapy is shown to lower stress levels associated with chronic pain, improve comfort and manage pain for people of all ages. Notably the ability of rhythm to reduce pain is observed among patients in cancer wards and nursing homes.

As a 20-year former private piano teacher and a 15+ year stage 3 cancer survivor, I can personally attest to the many health benefits of music therapy. I have witnessed the calming ability of music as well as the ability of music to lift one’s spirit and emotional situation. Music can literally soothe our innermost being as well as calm the constant chatter of the mind. And these benefits of music therapy have no age barrier – from tiny babies to senior adults – music therapy can indeed be very beneficial.
