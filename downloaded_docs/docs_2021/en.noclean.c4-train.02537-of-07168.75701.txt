Vitamin D supplementation was added to patients’ regular asthma treatment.
This article is part of MPR‘s coverage of the American Thoracic Society’s International Conference, taking place in San Diego, California. Our staff will report on medical research related to asthma and other respiratory conditions, conducted by experts in the field. Check back regularly for more news from ATS 2018.
SAN DIEGO – Vitamin D supplementation improves asthma control for individuals with asthma and vitamin deficiency, according to research presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference, held May 18-23, 2018, in San Diego, California.
These results come from a triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in Murcia, Spain. In total, 112 medically diagnosed adults with bronchial asthma and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency were recruited for the study. The participants were then randomly assigned into 2 groups, with 56 receiving a placebo in the control group and 56 receiving vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group. During the course of 6 months, participants in the intervention group were given 16,000 IU of alpha calcifediol per week and those in the control group were similarly presented with a placebo. These supplementations were added to their regular asthma treatment, which was reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
At the end of the 6-month period, participants were analyzed to determine their degree of asthma control. Results were tested by the internationally validated Asthma Control Test (ACT), which requires a difference of ≥3 points in order to be considered clinically significant. The control group had a final ACT score of 18.23±5.70 and the intervention group had a final ACT score of 20.49±4.13, deeming the results significant (P =.021). The difference between the initial ACT scores of both groups was not statistically significant (P =.133), but there was a statistically significant difference between the final ACT scores, (P <.001), with a mean difference of 3.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-5.43).
