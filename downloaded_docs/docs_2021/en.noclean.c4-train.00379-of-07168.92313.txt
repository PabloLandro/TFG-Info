Aloe Vera Ice Cubes
This is a quick and easy way to help soothe sunburns or any other burn. The Aloe gel pops right out of the tray and you can apply the frozen aloe cube to the burn. It will provide instant cool relief. My sister was the one who showed me how to do this, and now I always have a tray in the freezer.
What you will need
Ice cube tray
Aloe Vera Gel
Pour the Aloe Vera gel into the ice cube tray and pop into the freezer. Pop out a cube when needed and apply directly onto the burn for relief.

Easy. Fun. And family-approved.
I come from a long line of creative, crafty people. That’s why I wanted to share some of my family’s favorite (and really easy) DIY projects with you and yours—from crafts to recipes to gardening tips and more. It’ll be updated regularly, so please check back. I hope these projects give your home the same warmth they’ve given mine.
