&quot;512&quot;,&quot;This page will be expanded and refined over time. this is the current draft.
In 2006, we took a poll of the major burn treatment centers in the US, gave them a scenario of a desert raver ”(Specifically, the “desert raver” scenario involved someone out of cell range, and probably more than an hour away from emergency evac or hospitalization. Many hospitals, particularly those on the east coast had trouble believing such a situation could exist, however, this is an incredibly common situation in the Californian deserts and mountains.)”, and asked what should be done to treat various wounds. Some sources took a little convincing to get over the knee-jerk reaction of saying take them to an emergency ward but most came around once the situation was fully explained. That said, the following suggestions are not intended as an alternative to proper medical care, but rather a supplement when 1st world medicine may not be readily available.
