Imitrex Information:
Imitrex (Generic name: Sumatriptan Succinate) is an approved medication to treat migraine attacks, with or without aura (warning signs that occur prior to the onset of a migraine). Sumatriptan Succinate is a 5-hydroxytryptamine agonist (triptan). It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, which helps to relieve migraine symptoms including headache pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound. Sumatriptan should be used only to treat an acute, classic migraine attack or a cluster headache. Imitrex is NOT recommended for other types of headache or for headache prevention. Take Imitrex exactly as it was prescribed for you.
Imitrex Side Effects:
The most common Imitrex side effects are burning, pain, change in taste sensation, dizziness, drowsiness, flushing, light-headedness, muscle aches, nausea or vomiting. If you are experiencing any severe side effects such as seizures, irregular breathing, heart attack, loss of vision, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stoke symptoms and serious allergic reaction (e.g., rash, hives, difficult breathing, swelling of the lips, throat or tongue), please inform your doctor immediately.
Imitrex Precautions:
Do NOT take Imitrex oral if you are allergic to Sumatriptan or any of the ingredients in Imitrex medication. Before taking Imitrex, tell your doctor if you have had any medical conditions such as blood vessel disease, cheat pain, diabetes, heart disease, seizures, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, other types of headaches, reduced liver or kidney function. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications you use. They may interact with Imitrex drug, especially of: ergot-containing medications (e.g., dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, or methysergide), MAO inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine), 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists (triptans), SSRI-type antidepressants and sibutramine.
