Athletes Foot
Athletes foot is a common fungal infection of the areas around the toes. Athletes foot causes itchy sore feet and is very contagious. Luckily it is easy to treat and there are a number of options from once only treatments to long term treatments. Athletes foot is important to treat promptly. Not only to relieve the immediate symptoms but also to ensure that you don’t get complications like a fungal infection in your nails. Fungal infections in your nails can take years to resolve and often you need to take oral medicine for many months to recover.
