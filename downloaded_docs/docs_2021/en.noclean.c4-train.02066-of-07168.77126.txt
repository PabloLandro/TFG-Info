According to secondary sources, Epogam (40mg GLA and 10mg vitamin E) and Efamast (gamolenic acid) had their product licenses withdrawn October 7, 2002, following a review by the MCA/Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) of all the relevant information. It was determined that the information available did not support the standard of efficacy required for the authorization of these products as medicines for the treatment of eczema and mastalgia.
Combination product examples: Bronchicum? Tropfen (thyme and primrose), Bronchipret? TP FCT (thyme and primrose), Bronchicum? Elixir S (thyme and primrose).
Zestra? (borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, angelica root extract, and coleus extract)
The combination compound was called IOVE and was composed of 60mg isoflavones, 440mg primrose oil (consisting of 9-10% gamma linolenic acid (GLA)), and 10mg vitamin E.
Background
Native Americans traditionally considered the evening primrose plant's seeds, leaves, and roots to be a food. They also used the plant to treat bruises or wounds, hemorrhoids, stomach problems, and sore throats.
Oil extracted from evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) plant seeds consists of a high amount of unsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids include omega-6 fatty acids, linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). GLA has been licensed for treating breast pain and eczema in numerous countries.
Evening primrose oil (EPO) has been studied for several disorders, particularly those affected by metabolic products of essential fatty acids. There is good scientific evidence to support EPO for eczema treatment.

Interactions
Interactions with Drugs
Evening primrose oil may lower blood sugar levels. Caution is advised when using medications that may also lower blood sugar. People taking drugs for diabetes by mouth or insulin should be monitored closely by a qualified healthcare professional, including a pharmacist. Medication adjustments may be necessary.
Evening primrose oil may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with drugs that increase the risk of bleeding. Some examples include aspirin, anticoagulants ("blood thinners") such as warfarin (Coumadin?) or heparin, anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix?), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Motrin?, Advil?) or naproxen (Naprosyn?, Aleve?).
Evening primrose oil may interfere with the way the body processes certain drugs using the liver's "cytochrome P450" enzyme system. As a result, the levels of these drugs may be increased in the blood, and may cause increased effects or potentially serious adverse reactions. People using any medications should check the package insert, and speak with a qualified healthcare professional, including a pharmacist, about possible interactions.
Evening primrose oil may increase the amount of drowsiness caused by some drugs. Examples include benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (Ativan?) or diazepam (Valium?), barbiturates such as phenobarbital, narcotics such as codeine, some antidepressants, and alcohol. Caution is advised while driving or operating machinery.
Evening primrose oil may cause low blood pressure. Caution is advised in people taking drugs that lower blood pressure.
Evening primrose oil may also interact with agents for arthritis, cancer, or obesity; agents for the brain, skin, stomach, or intestines; agents that lower cholesterol; alcohol; aldose reductase inhibitors; anesthetics; antibiotics; anticonvulsants; antidepressant agents such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); anti-inflammatory agents; antipsychotics; antiviral agents; beta-blockers; celecoxib; CNS depressants or stimulants; corticosteroids; COX-2 inhibitors; Faslodex?; phenothiazines; seizure threshold-lowering agents; tamoxifen; or vincristine.
