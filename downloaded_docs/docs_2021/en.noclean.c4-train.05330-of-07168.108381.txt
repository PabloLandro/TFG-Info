3 natural methods to help treat asthma
Posted on March 24, 2019 by Admin
This chronic respiratory disease affects approximately three million Canadians, including 10 to 15% of children. The good news is that there are some ways to treat it naturally. Another best way to treat this disease is dulera inhaler. Dulera cost is low at Prescription Hope where you can buy it cheaply.
1. Yoga or meditation
Self-monitoring, medications and significant lifestyle changes allow most people to live healthy and active lives.
Stress and extreme emotions can trigger asthma, so it’s important to find ways to stay calm.
An interesting study has shown that yoga and meditation can improve the effectiveness of asthma medications.
A group of people with asthma, who continued to experience symptoms while taking preventive medications, experienced improvement after practicing Sahaja Yoga for four months.
This form of Indian meditation teaches practitioners the attainment of “mental silence,” a state of alertness without focused and specific thoughts.
Pulmonary tests showed that those who practice yoga are less sensitive to asthma triggers than those who practice other relaxation techniques.
The benefits disappeared two months after yoga was stopped.
2. Acupuncture and guided imagery
Acupuncture may help improve lung function in the short term, although the scientific evidence is less conclusive.
In a controlled study, almost 50% of patients with asthma performing guided imaging were able to decrease or discontinue their drug use compared to just 18% of the reference group.
3. The paradox of exercise
If you have asthma, exercise often helps. On the other hand, it can sometimes make things worse.
Up to 90% of people with asthma suffer from what is called exercise-induced asthma, say that intense activity can trigger an attack.
Some of these people (including the best international athletes) only have asthma induced by exercise and have no other symptoms unless they train.
Typically, with exercise-induced asthma, within five to 20 minutes of vigorous exercise, you may experience difficulty breathing, chest tightness, even chest pain, and coughing. Sometimes the symptoms do not even appear after the workout.
Should you exercise?
Does this mean that you should not exercise if you have asthma? Certainly not.
Doctors agree that exercise can be beneficial for people with asthma, as long as it is done substantially. Just ask your doctor first.
Here are some tips to follow during the exercise:
Choose the right activity. Swimming and aqua aerobics are excellent. Walking, hiking, biking and downhill skiing are also less likely to trigger exercise-induced asthma.
Warm up and recovery. If you are going to do vigorous activities, warm up properly and take the time to recover. This helps prevent sudden changes in temperature and humidity of the air you breathe. Especially in cold weather, breathing through your mouth sends cold, dry air into your lower airways, which can trigger an attack.
Care before exercise. Inhaling a spray of a short acting agonist bronchodilator beta-2 15 minutes before exercise can usually prevent attacks. Some may need to use long-acting anti-inflammatory medications.
Asthma can be a difficult condition to live every day. Adapting one’s lifestyle according to these tips should help relieve discomfort. As always, do not forget to consult a doctor if you think that these tips interfere with any part of his treatment.
