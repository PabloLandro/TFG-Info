Night Splints For Achilles Tendonitiss
Achilles tendonitis is caused by a problem called Achilles tendinopathy - microtears in the Achilles tendon. These microtears cause the pain that you feel with walking and running. While these tears can take weeks to months to heal, wearing a night splint for Achilles tendonitis can help. These splints can make sleeping at night less tender and help make your first step getting out of bed in the morning less painful.
Getting the Achilles tendonitis right splint is important to properly address the location of your injury. Not all splints labeled as “new”, especially those on Amazon, provide the same results.
If your problem is in the tendon itself then standard night splints for Achilles tendonitis will be appropriate. But if your injury is located down by your heel where the tendon attaches to the back of your foot then an adjustable dorsal night splint for insertional Achilles tendonitis will provide greater adjustability to help treat your injury more effectively.

10 Best Night Splints for Achilles Tendonitis:
#1 Thusane NOX Splint for Achilles Tendonitis
The Thuasne NOX Splint is designed for Achilles tendonitis sufferers. The splint has one of the easiest designs for ease of use compared to other high-end splints. The NOX (Greek word for "Night") has an adjustable strap in the front that you pull to increase the amount of stretch on your Achilles tendon. Our staff likes the indicator window in the front that shows the degree of stretch being applied to the tendon. The majority of reviews report the tendonitis splint does a good job relieving acute, as well as, long term pain. The material is breathable and the low-profile design allows for maximum airflow so you can sleep comfortably at night. The gripping strips on the bottom are a nice addition too. They provide a mild gripping surface that makes standing up at bedside and limited walking a safe undertaking. Our staff gives the NOX Splint a 97 Score based on customers' reviews.
PROS CONS
Lightweight, Low-profile design. Can feel uncomfortable and pull forward off the ankle during a maximum stretch.
Well padded throughout for comfort.
Adjustable for more or less stretch.
Non-skid tread on the sole for safety.

The brace can be worn on either foot which boosts its versatility and convenience. This adds value to its price making it worth every penny. Reviewer's Score: 92.3.
