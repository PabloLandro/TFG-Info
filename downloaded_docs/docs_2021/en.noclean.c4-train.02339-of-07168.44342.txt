Does Vitamin E Work for Skin Conditions?
It seems like common knowledge that vitamin E can help numerous skin problems. However, research suggests that it probably doesn't reduce scarring (at least after surgeries). There is a little evidence that shows that vitamin E (either taken orally or applied to the skin) could help prevent sun damage, but more research is necessary to confirm these findings.
Final Thoughts on Vitamin E Effectiveness
Vitamin E may be effective for several uses, but more research is needed before it can be recommended for most uses. Before you use vitamin E (especially high-dose vitamin E) for uses other than general supplementation, it is a good idea to check with your healthcare provider first. Some research has shown that high-dose vitamin E may actually do more harm than good, perhaps even increasing the risk of death in general.
