Ticks spreading malaria-like disease called babesiosis in New Jersey
Updated Jul 8, 2011 ; Posted Jul 8, 2011

Special to The News/NOAATicks can transmit babesiosis from mice, deer or other animals to humans or pets.
MILLVILLE
— Those enjoying summer in New Jersey and other states in the Northeast have a newly prevalent reason to fear ticks: a malaria-like disease called babesiosis.
Babesiosis is caused by infection with the parasite
Babesia microti
, which can be spread from animals to humans or pets by ticks and infects red blood cells. Confirmed cases of babesiosis infection in New Jersey increased threefold from 2008 to 2009, with seven deaths reported between 2006 and 2009.
However, this increase brings the statewide case count to only 152, in contrast to 4,598 confirmed cases of Lyme disease in New Jersey in 2009, and though neighboring Atlantic County ranked most affected from 2006-2009 along with Hunterdon and Burlington counties, Cumberland County does not appear to be under red alert.
“We have not really seen many babesiosis cases at all,” said Betsy Cubbage, Public Health Nursing Supervisor with the Cumberland County Department of Health. “If there’s a statewide trend, we’re not following that.”
Cubbage reported county data shows two cases of babesiosis in 2009, two last year and just one case reported in Cumberland County since Jan. 1, 2011.
“They were all outpatient; none required hospitalization, so that tells us they were mild cases,” said Cubbage, though statewide data from 2006 to 2009 shows 45 percent of reported babesiosis cases were hospitalized, with 10 percent admitted to an intensive care unit.
Cubbage said “many, many more” cases of Lyme disease have been recorded in Cumberland County — 176 in 2009, 86 in 2010 and 22 so far in 2011 — and the existence of any reports of either tick-borne disease in the area is reason to take precautions, particularly if elderly, with a weak immune system or if the spleen has been removed. These populations are most vulnerable to babesiosis infection; 66 percent of confirmed and probable cases in NJ between 2006 and 2009 were in patients over 60 years of age.
“People need to stay out of tall, grassy areas, and it’s best to wear light-colored or white clothing where if you do get a tick, you’ll be able to see it easily,” Cubbage said.
“If you’re going to hike in the woods, wear long pants and socks, and it’s recommended that the socks be pulled up on top of the pants so pant cuffs are tucked in there. There are some insect repellents that contain DEET, which is useful in preventing ticks from adhering to an area that’s sprayed.”
The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services also suggests generally avoiding wooded areas with dense shrubs and leaf litter, keeping lawns mowed and trees trimmed and, after being in potentially tick-infested areas, checking for ticks frequently on the body, especially on the scalp, behind the ears, under the arms, on the ankles and in the groin area.
If a tick is found on skin, it should be removed with fine-tipped tweezers, making sure its entire head is removed with the tick’s body, Cubbage said.
“Grab the tick close to the skin, and do not twist or jerk the tick, as that may cause its mouth parts to break off and remain in the skin. If you burn it or smother it in Vaseline while the tick is still embedded in your system, it will eject its serum, which causes the infection.”
The affected skin and tweezers should be disinfected with alcohol, hands should be washed with soap and warm water after the tick is removed and the tick should be placed in a small plastic bag or sealed container, not flushed down the toilet, since ticks can survive the water.
In addition, all clothing worn in tick-infested areas should be washed in hot water, then dried in high heat to kill the pests.
Babesiosis can also be spread by blood transfusion; nine confirmed cases of the disease in NJ between 2006 and 2009 were potentially transfusion-associated. The Food and Drug Administration is reportedly developing a screening test, but there is currently no widely accepted screening method available, making its spread a threat to the blood supply.
If a person or pet is infected with babesiosis, symptoms can occur anywhere from one to several weeks after being bitten by an infected tick. The most common early symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, general ill feeling and low red blood cell count, with fever, drenching sweats, muscle aches and headache potentially exhibited as infection continues.
Physicians can diagnose babesiosis by blood test, and a combination of parasite-killing drugs can treat the disease.
For more information on babesiosis, contact a local health care provider or
