Description
Anemia is a disease of the Red Blood Cells.
The deficiency of the Red Blood Cells in the blood is called Anemia.
Red Blood cells (RBC) carry oxygen to various parts of the body.
Hemoglobin is a red protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood.
The ability of the RBCs to carry oxygen may be impaired. Hemoglobin problem.
The number of RBCs may have decreased. Low RBC count.
In either case, the body organs are starved of oxygen and become diseased.
Normal parameters for an adult are as follows:
RBC Count 4 to 5.5 Million per Milliliter
Hemoglobin 12 to 16.5 Grams per Deciliter
Anemia will appear as paleness on your face.
Anemia may be genetic.
Women during pregnancy are particularly affected from iron-deficiency anemia due to the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood demands in the later stages of pregnancy.
One of the primary causes of Anemia is the lack of iron.
This deficiency is not due to less than normal intake of iron but probably due to the lack of assimilation.
Treatment should focus on correcting the metabolism rather than increasing the iron intake.
If the Anemia is caused due to abnormal breakdown of the RBCs, we call it Hemolytic Anemia.
Types of Anemia
More than 400 types of Anemia exist. Few common types are :
Iron deficiency Anemia : It is caused by shortage of iron in the body. Iron is needed for making hemoglobin.
Vitamin deficiency Anemia : A lack of folate and B12 vitamin in diet may cause Vitamin deficiency anemia. These nutrients are needed for making red blood cells.
Anemia of chronic disease : Cancer, Rheumatoid Arthritis, HIV/AIDS may affect the production of red blood cells. It may result into chronic anemia.
Aplastic Anemia : It is a rare form of anemia. The Bone Marrow fails to produce healthy red blood cells. It may be caused by an infection, drug and autoimmune disorder.
Sickle cell Anemia : It is a serious condition. A defective hemoglobin produces abnormal shaped red blood cells. These RBC's die prematurely and result into a chronic condition.
Causes of Anemia
Poor Diet
Pregnancy
Hemophilia
Hemorrhoids
Loss of Blood
Hormonal Imbalance
Deficiency of Iron
Less production of the Red Blood Cells
Differential Diagnosis
Anemia : is the decrease in the Red Blood Cells. The Hemoglobin in the Blood goes down.
Haemophilia : is the inability of the body to clot or coagulate the Blood. Normally when the body is cut the Blood clots or coagulates and the bleeding stops. If a Blood Vessel breaks, the Blood will automatically clot or coagulate and bleeding will stop. Haemophilia is generally hereditary and passed down from the mother to son.
Sickle Cell Anemia : When the normal shape of the Red Blood Cells becomes abnormal it is Sickle Cell Anemia.

Dear Kezia Buy Ceanothus Americanus mother tincture from a Homeopathy shop and have 10 drops in a glass of water 2 times in a day.
Soak a few Raisins in a bowl of water and have it every morning on empty stomach. Drink that water too in which they are soaked.
