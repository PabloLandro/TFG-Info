Arthritic Implant Cartiva eases Toe Pain
By [email protected]
January 30, 2015
Category: Foot Care
Tags: Untagged
Arthritis of the big toe affects nearly half a million of Great Britain’s population. Cartiva, an innovative new implant, has been purported to help ease the pain and stiffness from arthritis through surgery. To alleviate pain and keep them from rubbing together, the implant is surgically inserted between the bones of the toe. Cartiva’s flexibility and putty-like consistency allow it to act as a shock absorber, similar to cartilage. Val Cornwall, a sixty-seven-year-old resident of Hillingdon, Middlesex underwent surgery for the procedure in February 2011 and is now as active as ever. Cornwall was able to leave the hospital the next morning after a forty-minute operation under general anesthetic.
If left untreated, arthritis of the feet—especially the big toe—can be very painful. If painful arthritis has been troubling you, consult with podiatrist Dr. Mayer Salama, D.P.M. of Salama Foot Care. Dr. Salama can provide you with quality foot and ankle treatment and alleviate your joint pain.
Arthritic Foot Care
In an average lifetime, we walk approximately 75,000 miles. This can put a great deal of stress on the 26 bones and 30 joints that we have in our feet. As we get older, our feet lose flexibility and elasticity. Our shock absorbers weaken, and if arthritis comes into play, the joints become inflamed and distorted. Arthritic foot care and treatment would become imperative at this point.
It is best to take care of your feet by wearing well-fitted shoes. Certain conditions may develop when you wear shoes that don’t fit properly, for example hammertoes, neuroma, and bunions. Wearing shoes that have a lower heel and extra room in the shoe can help your feet be comfortable. In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the arch in your foot may become problematic. Buying shoes with arch support will help; it is also a good idea to buy shoes that contour to your foot.
Alleviating Arthritic Pain
-Specific exercises may help; stretching the Achilles tendon can prevent further pain and injury. Stretching can also increase your mobility.

How to Keep Your Feet Healthy while on the Job 2
By [email protected]
January 22, 2015
Category: Foot Care
Tags: Untagged
If you are a massage therapist or have another occupation where you are always on your feet, you are probably very familiar with having sore and painful feet. Endurance can easily be maintained by considering several important tips. Shoes should be checked to ensure that they offer support, as ill-fitting shoes can contribute to pain and fatigue. When standing, the feet should be planted firmly on the ground with your weight distributed evenly between the two. Take the time to stretch the feet if possible; stretches such as toe curls, toe raises, and toe flexion and extension can help flexibility and reduce stress.
Constantly working on your feet can become stressful and debilitating for your foot health. If you are experiencing foot problems due to working on your feet, consult with podiatrist Dr. Mayer Salama, D.P.M. of Salama Foot Care. Dr. Salama can provide you with quality foot and ankle treatment.
Proper Foot Care Leads to Better Health
Long periods of standing often times lead to pain and discomfort around the feet. Every day the body undergoes a series of stresses, especially during work. To minimize these stresses on your feet, better shoe choices and proper posture will significantly help.
Better Choices
A Negative Heel
This is where the heel is slightly lower than the ball of the foot.
Going Barefoot
Having your feet crammed into shoes for long periods of time increases pressure. Giving your feet some exposure to air and walking barefoot helps tremendously.
Exercise Your Feet
A foot workout helps correct movements and stimulates the blood flow and muscles of the feet. Implementing yoga exercises to your daily routine is a good example of this.
Foot Care
Spending a majority of the time on your feet will most likely trigger pain; even more so if you suffer from poor circulation. Proper footwear and appropriate stretching will alleviate pain and prevent further issues. When your feet hurt, it is best to take care of them right away.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact one of our offices located in Farmington Hills, Dearborn, Clarkston, and Trenton, MI. We offer all the latest in diagnostic and treatment technologies to meet your needs.

Change Socks regularly to help prevent Athleteâ€™s Foot
By [email protected]
January 15, 2015
Category: Foot Care
Tags: Untagged
Regularly changing your socks can help prevent the occurrence of fungal infections in the foot, particularly tinea pedis or Athlete’s foot. At any given time, fifteen to twenty-five percent of people have it. While one method to avoid Athlete’s foot is to wear sandals, the colder months make wearing sandals much more difficult. Changing socks will also reduce unpleasant foot odor. A statement from the U.K.’s National Health Service suggests that you should wear a clean pair of socks at least once a day to avoid smells. Bacteria are also more likely to sit on the surface of polyester and other synthetic fabric in comparison to materials such as cotton.
Having Athlete’s foot warrants a visit to your physician for proper treatment. If you have any questions regarding Athlete’s foot and how to manage the condition, speak to Dr. Mayer Salama, D.P.M. of Salama Foot Care. Dr. Salama will attend to all of your foot and ankle needs.
Athlete’s Foot
Athlete’s foot is a very contagious form of fungus, which can infect persons usually resulting in itching, burning, dry, and flaking feet. Treatment is often difficult, because of its contagious and reoccurring nature. Tinea pedis is the fungus which causes athletes foot, and is found to survive in moist humid areas.
Common places found:
-shower floors -public changing areas -locker rooms
-Gyms -bathrooms -public swimming pools
-socks and shoes -dormitory style houses
What is Tinea Pedi?
Is the same fungus which causes ringworm, and is known to be spread by direct contact of the infected body part. Or infection can spread by touching other objects and body parts which have been exposed to the fungus. Tinea Pedi is mostly found on the feet, because it is the ideal place for it to thrive on.
Treatment & Prevention
Because of its reoccurring nature of tinea fungus and athletes foot, the best way to treat this condition is with prevention. By taking the necessary precautions such as:
-Wear flips-flops or sandals in locker rooms and public showers.
-Use powders to keep your feet dry
-Keep your feet exposed to light and cool air
-treating athletes foot with special creams/sprays

FPH links Gout to Poverty and Wage Growth in Britain
By [email protected]
January 07, 2015
Category: Foot Care
Tags: Untagged
Gout’s return—along with other Victorian-age diseases—to Britain has been caused by a combination of poor wage growth and increased food prices, reports the Faculty of Public Health (FPH), which represents doctors and health workers in Britain. Food poverty and the rise of these diseases have been linked together by the FPH. “It is a condition we believed should have died out,” said John Middleton of the FPH. “It’s getting worse because people can’t afford good quality food.” Since the global financial crisis, poverty in Britain has been a topic of great debate. Wages have been consistently below the rate of inflation since 2008. Gout is a kind of arthritis that can be caused by obesity and a diet rich in chemical compounds called purines, found in foods like sardine and liver.
Healthy diet and lifestyle choices are pertinent in the prevention and treatment of gout. If you are suffering from the effects of gout, see Dr. Mayer Salama, D.P.M. of Salama Foot Care. Dr. Salama will provide you with quality foot and ankle treatment.
What is Gout?
Gout is a type of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid in the bloodstream. It often develops in the foot, especially the big toe area, although it can manifest in other parts of the body as well. Gout can make walking and standing very painful and is especially common in diabetics and the obese.
People typically get gout because of a poor diet. Foods rich in purines like turkey, red meats, and liver can affect the body’s ability to excrete uric acid, which in turn leads to hyperuricema, the blood condition that causes gout to develop. Genetic predisposition is also a factor. The children of parents who have had gout frequently have as much as a one in five chance of developing it themselves.
Gout can easily be identified by redness and inflammation of the big toe and the surrounding areas of the foot. Other symptoms include extreme fatigue, joint pain, and running high fevers. Sometimes corticosteroid drugs can be prescribed to treat gout, but the best way to combat this disease is to get more exercise and eat a better diet.

With intense sports such as running, gymnastics and dancing, the Achilles tendon is often at risk for injury. After sustaining injury, the body will usually heal the tendon to make it stronger, but sometimes it does not heal properly—causing abnormal healing. This abnormal healing causes further damage and often weakens the tendon, making it susceptible to further damage later on. Tendinopathy is when the tendon becomes degenerative with damage from abnormal healing. Treatment of tendon injuries involves trying to disrupt and alter the abnormal healing pattern through special heavy slow resistance and eccentric exercises.
Achilles tendon injuries can be difficult to overcome. If you are suffering from an Achilles tendon injury, consult with Dr. Mayer Salama, D.P.M. of Salama Foot Care. Dr. Salama will attend to all of your foot and ankle needs and provide you with quality treatment.
The Achilles Tendon
The key that connects the lower leg muscles and calf to the foot’s heel, the Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body. This tendon is an integral part of the body as it is responsible for allowing movement in the foot and heel. Any injuries to the Achilles tendon may cause severe difficulties and pain when it comes to movement, and should be observed by a specialist immediately.
