Sumatriptan – What is it?
Sumatriptan is a medicine used to treat an acute migraine attack. The drug helps with migraine headaches with or without aura, cluster headaches and the accompanying symptoms typical of migraine such as nausea and sensitivity to light, are reliably and quickly relieved. The active ingredient in sumatriptan belongs to the group of triptans, and has been approved in Germany for more than 25 years. Triptans are medicines that act as selective serotonin agonists that selectively stimulate the serotonin receptors in the brain, and have been specifically developed for the treatment of migraine. This medicine may be taken in the form of tablets, suppositories, nasal sprays, or syringes for self-treatment of acute migraine attacks.
Sumatriptan Effect
During a migraine attack, certain blood vessels in the brain are dilated, inflamed and increasingly supplied with blood, which leads to throbbing and one-sided headaches. Through further neurological mechanisms, a person affected by a migraine attack usually suffers additionally from nausea and hypersensitivity of some of the senses. The triptans in the medication stimulate the serotonin receptors in the brain, the muscle fibres around the blood vessels relax, the blood vessels contract again and the headaches and accompanying complaints are quickly alleviated. Sumatriptan is only effective in those areas of the head where the pain exists. The substance is very quickly degraded in the body and therefore the risk of a possible overdose or accumulation of the substance in the body is very low.
How to Take Sumatriptan Properly
Sumatriptan should always be taken as soon as possible after the onset of a migraine attack, but it can also be taken at any time during a migraine attack, without any loss of effect. The tablets are swallowed whole, with water or another liquid. The usual dosage is between 50 and 100 milligrams and should be according to the doctor's instructions. If taken in excess of 100 milligrams, no improvement in efficacy is to be expected. Sumatriptan should only be used if there is a clear migraine attack. If symptoms improve after the first dose, no additional doses of the medication should be used. The medication must not be used as a preventive measure, but only in the case of a clear migraine.
Are there side effects?
As with all medications, the intake of Sumatriptan can cause side effects in rare cases. However, it is unclear whether the side effects are associated with the migraine attack itself or with the active ingredient.
The most common undesirable side effects are as follows
Disorders of the nervous system such as dizziness,
Sleepiness
Sense disturbances
Sensation disorders
Nausea
Vomiting
High blood pressure
Respiratory disorders
Feeling of heaviness
Weakness
Shortness of breath
In even rarer cases, side effects such as
Visual disorders
Pressure and anxiety feelings in the chest may occur
If any of the above or other side effects occur, tell your doctor immediately. Read the leaflet for detailed information on the side effects, contraindications and drug interactions.
Sumatriptan Contra-indications and Interactions
Sumatriptan should not be administered at the same time as other medicines.
Be careful not to take this medicine in combination with
Ergotamine and ergotamine derivatives (medicines for migraine or circulatory problems) as there is a risk of coronary artery cramping.
In addition, sumatriptan should not be taken with another medicine from the group of triptans. The simultaneous intake of additional Triptan and ergotamine preparations can increase the mutual effect, which can have a negative effect on other mechanisms in the body.
This medicine should also not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or other specific medicines for depression or Parkinson's disease.
The doctor should always be informed if other medicines (including non-prescription medicines) are being used or if there are untreated illnesses or complaints, so that any contra-indications and interactions can be ruled out
