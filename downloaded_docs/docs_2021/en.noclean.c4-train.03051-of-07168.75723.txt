Revitol Scar Removal Cream
Revitol Scar Removal Cream won't fix your scars immediately, and some people had no change at all. However, if your skin is sensitive or acne-prone, Revitol Scar Removal Cream is a good place to start as it will not irritate existing skin conditions or cause new flare-ups.
Product and Treatment Explanation
Revitol Scar Removal Cream is a general purpose skin repair cream. It's all natural and is comprised of Vitamins A and E as well as aloe leaf extract.
For those who struggle with acne and scars from such breakouts, this product may help in two ways: It will calm the skin under the scars, or at least lessen the risk of additional breakouts, and it may lessen the look of old acne scars.
Like many natural products, Revitol Scar Removal Cream is not a quick fix. You may need to use this product for an extended period of time to see results. Working it into your daily routine of skin care seems the best use of this product. Due to the expense of Revitol Scar Removal Cream, building it into your daily routine for the long term may be cost-prohibitive.
How does Revitol Scar Removal Cream reduce your scars? Scars are the result of a poorly healed wound that leaves bulky connective tissue behind. Acne scars may appear as pits in the skin, or can manifest as bumps across the nose, cheeks and forehead.
With consistent application of a calming lubricant like Revitol Scar Removal Cream, you will moisturize the bulky connective tissue at the scar site and calm the skin under and around the scar, lessening the look of the scar and smoothing the skin around it. Unfortunately, Revitol contains no silicone so can't be used to fill pitted scars, such as acne scars.

Pricing and Value of Product
No scar cream is a good investment if it doesn't work. However, if you find a product that works, boosts your confidence and lessens your anxiety about the visibility and impact of your scars, the right product may actually be priceless.
However, Revitol Scar Removal Cream will cost approximately $40 per ounce. As an experiment to see if it will make a difference on your scars, that is a large investment for many of us.
If your skin is extremely sensitive and you need to use only natural products, then purchasing one container of Revitol Scar Removal Cream may help you to find other products to search for that can help you condition. Be aware that most users who had successful results with this product used it for several weeks before they saw results.

Science Behind the Product
As noted above, scars are caused by a build-up of connective tissues at the injury site. These tissues form either to create a bump or hypertrophic scar, or draw down into a void, creating a pit or atrophic scar.
The ingredients in Revitol Scar Removal Cream are aloe, Vitamin E and Vitamin A. Each of these products has a different impact on scar tissue.
Aloe both prevents scars and improves the look of existing scars by
promoting the growth of healthy skin cells
acting as an astringent on oily skin
moisturizing and soothing the existing scar tissue
reduces the tightness of skin in an atrophic scar
reduces the intensity of dark or red pigment in scar tissue
Vitamin E can help as a topical by reducing the risk of keloid scars, or the extra, bumpy tissue that grows over a healed wound. While the direct application of pure Vitamin E extract can cause skin irritation for some users, the blended products in Revitol greatly reduce that risk. The formulation would be more effective against keloid scars if the product contained a natural exfoliant.
Vitamin A works under the skin to reduce the scarring that can occur in blood vessels after a wound is made in the skin. Once the immune system is aware of a break in the skin, blood flow to the area is increased by the body to promote the healing process, but excess blood flow can block and scar blood vessels, leading to greater discoloration. With regular applications of Vitamin A as a topical, the scarred tissue under the skin can be softened, reducing the discoloration of the scar.
