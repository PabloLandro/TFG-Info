Other recent studies have shown a link between exercise and reduced depression. A of 11 previous studies, for example, found that exercise appeared to be a significant help to those with depression and suggested doctors begin incorporating it into treatment plans.
This was a moderate sized study, and one study by itself doesn’t prove much – any more than From personal experience I think there’s a good chance strenuous aerobic exercise can boost mood… but this is a reminder that the picture on exercise and depression is not quite as clear as the recent enthusiasm for it suggests…
My experiences with exercise and depression are sort of the reverse of Paul's — when I became depressed, I had already been in the habit of exercising every day for many years, and for a couple years had ramped up my activity level even more, since I was in college and could work out *whenever I wanted*, rather than having to wait for gym classes or school-sponsored activities. I enjoyed exercise, which is why I did so much of it. (I also enjoyed the of exercise, but I don't think I could've kept up such a strenuous regimen if I didn't also enjoy the activity itself). But I still ended up with severe depression, which after a while would keep me out of the gym for weeks at a time. So, for me, there's kind of a bitter edge to all the hype around exercise as preventative and cure-all for depression: it functioned as neither for me, even though I'd been a serious exerciser before my depression and continued to be one for at least a year and a half after it, and saw no benefit. (I still liked to exercise, but it didn't make me feel better overall, and sometimes I just felt so overwhelmed that I couldn't even move, let alone run or lift weights like the maniac I used to be. Some days maybe I'd *try* to get into the gym, but find I'd just sit down on a bench and cry rather than get any lifting done. So that sucked).

Exercise and Depression: May Workout Become a Remedy?
The evidence comes from experimental studies as well. Blumenthal has explored the mood-exercise connection through a series of randomized controlled trials. In one such study, he and his colleagues assigned sedentary adults with major depressive disorder to one of four groups: supervised exercise, home-based exercise, antidepressant therapy or a placebo pill. After four months of treatment, Blumenthal found, patients in the exercise and antidepressant groups had higher rates of remission than did the patients on the placebo. Exercise, he concluded, was generally comparable to antidepressants for patients with major depressive disorder (Psychosomatic Medicine, 2007).
■ Results:
● After 16 weeks 65% of people in all 3 groups no longer had major depression
● Exercise and antidepressant results were essentially the same Carmine Pariante, Professor of Biological Psychiatry at Kings College London said the finding was ‘very important’ to the understanding of exercise and depression.
