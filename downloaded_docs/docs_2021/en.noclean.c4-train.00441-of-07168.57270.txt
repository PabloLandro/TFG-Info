Hypertrophic Scar Treatment
Hypertrophic scars are raised, very firm and red. They often have an “overgrown” appearance that is similar to keloids, but unlike keloids they do not extend beyond the initial boundaries of the skin injury.
Traditional treatments for hypertrophic scars include silicone sheeting, compression dressings and steroid injections. Studies show that silicone gel, a key ingredient in InviCible, is as effective as silicone sheeting as a hypertrophic scar treatment.
Silicone gel is also much more user-friendly and less cumbersome than silicone sheeting. It is simply massaged-in. Since there are no sheets to deal with, sun block, make-up, or any other skin regimen is easily applied on top.
While scientific studies clearly show the benefits of silicone in terms of scar care, it is important to choose the safest form of silicone. InviCible contains only Dimethicone silicone gel that is certified as safe. It does not contain D4 or D5 forms of silicone that have raised safety concerns in Europe and Canada.
InviCible also contains two forms of vitamin C that help normalize collagen production and essential fatty acids (EFAs) that help regulate lipid production – these lipids are essential in maintaining normal skin elasticity.
