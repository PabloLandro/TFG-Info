Deanna Minich, PhD, CNS, IFMCP explains how essential nutrients can both help or hinder each other and our health. Reprinted with permission. Originally posted on Jan 2, 2018 at deannaminich.com. See her bio below.
The essential vitamins and minerals share a delicate dance in the body. For many body processes to function optimally, you must have the right balance of the nutrients. Many nutrients work synergistically, so a deficiency in one might appear as or exacerbate a deficiency in another and vice versa.
Other nutrients are antagonists, so care must be taken when supplementing with one so it does not negatively impact the absorption, uptake, or metabolism of the other. For some nutrient pairs, the balance is delicate, with the pairs in certain situations enhancing the work of the other, and in other situations, they antagonize one another.
The following is a brief overview of the relationships and interactions between the essential nutrients. As you will see, some vitamins and minerals have a relationship with several other essential nutrients, while some have few if any known synergistic or antagonistic interactions.
VITAMINS
​Vitamin A
​Synergistic Nutrients:
Vitamin E
Vitamin E enhances vitamin A intestinal absorption at medium to high concentrations, up to 40 percent.
Vitamin A and E together lead to increased antioxidant capabilities, protect against some forms of cancer, and support a healthier gut.
They work synergistically to prevent or support obesity, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, immune response, brain health, hearing loss.
Iodine
Retinoic acid is involved in iodine uptake.
Severe vitamin A deficiency decreases the uptake of iodine and impacts thyroid metabolism.
Iodine deficiency and vitamin A deficiency leads to a more severe case of primary hypothyroidism compared to iodine deficiency alone.
Iron
Iron is required for converting beta-carotene into retinol.
Vitamin A increases iron absorption, especially non-heme iron.
Iron increases the bioavailability of pro-vitamin A carotenoids, including alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin.
Supplementing with vitamin A might help reverse iron deficiency anemia in children, and vitamin A deficiency might contribute to anemia.
Zinc
Zinc is required for vitamin A transport.
Supplementing with vitamin A and zinc in children led to a reduced risk of infection and increased linear growth.
Zinc along with vitamin A helps maintain eye health.
Antagonistic Nutrients:
Vitamin E
High levels of beta carotene might decrease serum levels of vitamin E.
Vitamin K
Vitamin A toxicity inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K2 by intestinal bacteria and interferes with hepatic actions of vitamin K.
Vitamin A interferes with absorption of vitamin K.
Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)
Synergistic Nutrients
Magnesium
Magnesium is required to convert thiamin to its biologically active form and is also required for certain thiamin-dependent enzymes.
Overcoming thiamin deficiency might not occur if magnesium deficiency is not co-treated.
Antagonistic Nutrients
Vitamin B6
Vitamin B6 can inhibit the biosynthesis of thiamin.
Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)
Antagonistic Nutrients:
Calcium
Calcium might form a chelate with riboflavin, decreasing riboflavin absorption.
Vitamin B3 (Niacin)
Synergistic Nutrients:
Zinc
Supplementing with nicotinic acid might provide a dose-dependent improvement in hepatic zinc levels and better antioxidant markers, including less lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione levels.

Deficiency or insufficiency can increase homocysteine levels, which are connected to a higher risk of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and cardiovascular disease.
Deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia.
Zinc
Supplementation with folic acid, especially in a state of zinc deficiency, might reduce absorption of zinc through forming a chelate, but there are mixed results.
Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)
Antagonistic Nutrients
Vitamin C
In aqueous solution, vitamin C might degrade B12 especially when B1 and copper are also present.
Vitamin B9
Supplementing with B9 increases the need for B12 and vice versa because both play key roles in the methylation cycle.
Deficiency or insufficiency can increase homocysteine levels, which are connected to a higher risk of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and cardiovascular disease.
Deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia.

Vitamin D
Synergistic Nutrients
Vitamin K
Optimal levels of vitamin K prevents some of the problems of excess vitamin D and leads to better outcomes.
Sufficient levels of vitamins D and K lead to reduced risk of hip fractures and an increase in BMD and other markers of bone health.
Sufficient vitamin K and D also improves insulin levels and blood pressure while reducing the risk of arthrosclerosis.
Calcium
Vitamin D increases calcium absorption.

Iron
Non-heme iron and zinc compete for absorption.
Supplementing with calcium and iron greatly reduced serum levels of zinc.
Magnesium
Supplements of high levels (i.e. 142 mg/day) of zinc might reduce magnesium absorption.
As you can see, many of the minerals compete with one another for absorption, making it important to ensure proper balance so that one does not overpower the others, contributing to a deficiency.
​SPECIAL GROUP INTERACTIONS
Antioxidant Network
Zinc, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E
Balanced and sufficient quantities keep antioxidant enzymes and other antioxidant defenses high to mitigate oxidative stress, which is connected to numerous diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer, and metabolic syndrome.
Along with magnesium, antioxidant vitamins can also help to protect against hearing loss and reduce inflammation.
B-vitamins
The B-vitamins often work together, especially vitamins B2, B6, B9, B12.
In addition to the above one-on-one interactions, the B vitamins work together and play key role as cofactors and enzymes in one-carbon metabolism, which is involved in amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and DNA methylation, as well as production of SAM, which is a methyl donor used in various reactions including neurotransmitter production. These cofactors and enzymes are also involved in energy metabolism.
A balance of B vitamins supports brain health, including neural development and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cardiovascular health.
As always, check with your healthcare practitioner to see which vitamins and minerals you may need and how best to take them.
