About L-Theanine Powder
Supplements healthy respiratory and cognitive functioning*
Benefits sleep and sense of relaxation*
Comes in re-sealable bag to maintain freshness
What is L-Theanine?
This supplement is what gives tea its calming effects. It promotes relaxation without being sedative, meaning it will not induce drowsiness, yet will result in a calm, focused state of mind.* This amino acid is one of the few supplements that is able to pass the blood-brain barrier, which enables its powerful effects.
L-Theanine Benefits
Relaxation
Theanine helps promote relaxation on a cerebral level by helping the brain relax . It does so by promoting healthy cortisol levels.Theanine helpsÂ enhance your sense of well-being as well.
L-Theanine for Sleep
This powerful amino acid may be helpful for those struggling with sleep quality. L-theanine does not cause sleepiness and fatigue because it is not sedative in nature; however, research suggests that supplementation can promote sleep quality. Studies point to a decrease in sleep activity, such as tossing and turning, when supplementing with Theanine. Users have reported feeling as if they have slept more than they actually have if supplementation preceded sleep.
Cognitive Benefits
L-Theanine promotes healthy memory function and focus. It does so by supplementing Alpha-1 brain activity. Elevated Alpha brain wave activity benefits focus, cognitive performance, learning abilities, and even promotes creativity. L-theanine supplements memory storage as well as it promotes healthy neurons, a process known as neurogenesis
Caffeine and Theanine
Caffeine is known for promoting alertness and combating fatigue, and research shows that it also benefits reaction time as well as the ability to process information.* However, it can leave one feeling jittery or scatterbrained. L-Theanine helps to eliminate these downfalls while actually augmenting the positive effects of caffeine.*
A study observing the cognitive benefits of caffeine vs. caffeine + theanine indicates that combining the two supplements results in enhanced mental performance in speed and accuracy tests while reducing susceptibility to distractions . In addition, the L-Theanine and Caffeine combination benefitsÂ individual's performance when attempting to surmount a cognitively demanding task, while caffeine without l-theanine can decrease performance.*
Exercise Performance
Healthy blood flow is one of the benefits that usually come with supplementing with L-theanine. The ability to benefit focus and alertness makes caffeine + theanine a solid alternative to traditional pre-workout formulas.*
Dosage
The recommended l-theanine dosage is 100mg one to two times daily.
Charge Products is UKs Leading Supplier oof Theanine with same day dispatch up to 3.30pm Monday to Friday.
