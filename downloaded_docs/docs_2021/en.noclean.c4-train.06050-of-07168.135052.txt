What will we do next?
With each piece of data you share, you’re helping PatientsLikeMe and our medical research partners understand:
How do people experience each condition differently, and why?
What improves health and life for different people, and why?
How can we measure that improvement faster and more effectively, and accelerate clinical trials?
Join now to donate your data
…for you, for others, for good.
You have already helped us learn:
Lithium carbonate wasn't helping ALS patients, and we learned it faster than the clinical trials did. Read about it in Nature.
Insomnia is more common—in fact worse—for people with chronic conditions. Read about it on the blog.
Interacting with other PatientsLikeMe members improves your health. Read it on healthaffairs.org.
The severity of Parkinson's Disease symptoms changes faster than researchers thought, so clinical trials should be designed differently. Read about it on JMIR.
