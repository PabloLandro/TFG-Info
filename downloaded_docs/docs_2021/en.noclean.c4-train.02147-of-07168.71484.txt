Ergot Alkaloids
Overview:
Ergot alkaloids -- produced by Claviceps purpurea, a grain (rye, especially) fungus
This fungus synthesizes many biologically active agents including:
acetylcholine
histamine
tyramine and
many unique ergot alkaloids -- which effect:
alpha-adrenergic receptors
dopamine receptors
serotonin receptors
Ergot poisoning (ergotism, St. Anthony's fire)-- symptoms:
dementia
florid hallucinations
persistent vasospasm (gangrene may develop)
uterine muscle stimulation (may cause abortion in pregnancy)
Ergot poisoning specific manifestations depend on the alkaloids mixture
Chemistry and pharmacokinetics:
Two Major Families:
Tetracyclic Ergoline Nucleus: Examples --
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
ergonovine
methysergide (Sansert)
6-methylergoline
lysergic acid
Peptide alkaloids: Examples --
ergotamine
alpha-ergocryptine
bromocriptine (Parlodel)
Ergot alkaloids -variably absorbed from the GI tract
Absorption following oral administration: improved by caffeine
Bromocriptine (Parlodel): well absorbed from the GI tract
Metabolism:
extensively metabolized
Pharmacodynamics:
Mechanism of Action:
Targets: several receptor types
agonist effects
partial agonist effects
antagonist effects
Pre- and post-synaptic sites

Organ Systems:
CNS:
hallucinogenic-- LSD:
peripheral (5 HT2) serotonin receptor peripheral antagonist
behavioral effects: agonist presynaptic or postsynaptic 5 HT2 effects.
Dopamine Receptor Interactions:
Extrapyramidal system
Prolactin release regulation:
bromocriptine (Parlodel) and pergolide (Permax)}specificity for pituitary dopamine receptors
suppression of pituitary prolactin secretion: by activating regulatory dopamine receptors
Bromocriptine (Parlodel) and pergolide (Permax) are competitive with dopamine and other dopamine agonists (apomorphine) before the these binding sites
Vascular Smooth Muscle:
Ergotamine (unrelated compounds) are mainly vasoconstricting.
Vasoconstriction: partially blocked by alpha adrenergic receptor blocking drugs--
suggesting vasoconstriction by ergot alkaloids may be due to partial agonist effects at alpha adrenergic receptors
Vasoconstriction: long-lasting--
alpha adrenergic receptor effects
5 HT receptor-mediated effects
Vasoconstriction: differential vascular sensitivity to ergot alkaloids
most sensitive: cerebral arteriovenous anastomotic vessels to:
ergotamine
dihydroergotamine
sumatriptan (Imitrex)
Antimigraine specificity: mediated by neuronal or vascular serotonin receptors
Most-common drugs used for migraine treatment:
ergotamine
ergonovine
methysergide (Sansert)
Overdosage (ergotamine and related agents)
Severe, long-lasting vasospasm --
not reversible by alpha-antagonists
not reversible by serotonin antagonists
Uterine Smooth Muscle
Stimulant action: involves serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic, and other effects
Uterine sensitivity changes during pregnancy (possibly due to progressively increasing numbers of alpha1 receptors
Small doses: rhythmic uterine contraction and relaxation
Larger doses: substantial, prolonged contractions
Ergonovine: more uterine selective (agent of choice for obstetric uses)
Other Smooth Muscle:
Bronchiolar smooth muscle: no effect
Gastrointestinal smooth muscle: variable sensitivity {nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting -- occurs with variability in required dosage probation impatient}
Mechanism of Action:
activation of gastrointestinal serotonin receptors
CNS emetic centers
Ergot Alkaloids: Clinical Pharmacology
Migraine
Clinical Presentations:
Often accompanied by brief aura (visual scotomas, hemianopia, beach abnormalities
Severe, throbbing, usually unilateral headache (few hours to a few days in duration)
Familial disease:
more common in women
onset: early adolescence; less common in older patients
Migraine associated with stress
Headache frequency: Range -- to or more per week to once a year
Migraine Pathophysiology:
Vasomotor mechanism -- inferred from:
increased temporal artery pulsation magnitude
pain relief (by ergotamine) occurs with decreased artery pulsations
Migraine attack associated with (based on histological studies):
sterile neurogenic perivascular edema
inflammation (clinically effective antimigraine medication reduce perivascular inflammation)
Serotonin involvement (evidence for):
Throbbing headache: associated with decreased serum and platelet serotonin
Presence of serotonergic nerve terminals at meningeal blood vessels
Antimigraine drugs influence serotonergic neurotransmitter
Some migraine chemical triggers may work through serotonin pathways, i.e. decreasing estrogen (associated with the menstrual cycle) and increased prostaglandin E1.
Drug Treatment (migraine):
Ergotamine: best results when drug administered prior to the attack (prodromal phase) -- less effective as attack progresses
Ergotamine may be combined with caffeine; caffeine promotes ergot alkaloid absorption
Vasoconstriction associated with excessive ergotamine use may be long-lasting and potentially severe.
Ergotamine: availableby oral, IV,or intramuscular routes of administration
Dihydroergotamine (IV administration mainly): may be appropriate for intractable migraine (nasal or oral formulations dihydroergotamine are being assessed)
Sumatriptan (Imitrex): alternative to ergotamine for acute migraine treatment; not recommended for patients with coronary vascular disease risk.
formulations: subcutaneous injection, oral, nasal spray
selective serotonin-receptor agonist (short duration of action)
probably more effective than ergotamine for management of acute migraine attacks (relief: 10 to 15 minutes following nasal spray)
subcutaneous injection: relief within two hours for 70% -- 80% of patients
New Triptans:
Zolmitriptan--more rapid onset than oral sumatriptan (Imitrex)
Naratriptan--
slower onset; longer half-life
Rizatriptan-- more rapid onset than oral sumatriptan
Analgesics:-- may be sufficient for model/moderate migraine
Aspirin
Aspirin combination (Fiorinal --aspirin + caffeine + butalbital)
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen combinations (Midrin-- acetaminophen + isometheptene + dichloralphenazone)
Excedrin Migraine: acetaminophen + aspirin +caffeine
Oral opioids: usual systemic opioid adverse effects
Butorphanol nasal spray --opioid agonist-antagonist
effective for moderate/severe migraine; psychiatric reactions/drug abuse have been reported
Drug-Drug interactions:
A triptan should not be used within one-day following another triptan or any ergotamine-containing drug (vasoconstriction may be additive)
Ergot derivatives should not be taken or until 24 hours or more following a triptan
"Serotonin Syndrome": weakness, hyperreflexia, incoordination following use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) with a triptan
All triptans except naratriptan are contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (or within two weeks of discontinuation of MAO inhibitors)
Migraine Prophylaxis:
Ergonovine
Methysergide (Sansert)
effective in about 60% of patients
40%: frequency of toxicity
NOT effective in treating an active migraine attack or even preventing an impending attack.
Methysergide toxicity:
retroperitoneal fibroplasia
subendocardial fibrosis
The side effects are the basis of recommending a 3-4 week drug holiday every six months
Propranolol (Inderal) -- prophylaxis- Most common for continuous prophylaxis
propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren) FDA approval for this indication
note all beta-blockers: contraindicated in asthmatics
best established drug for migraine attack prevention.
Amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep) -- prophylaxis-- most frequently used among the tricyclic antidepressants
Valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote) --effective in decreasing migraine frequency; FDA approval for this indication;
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) -- naproxen sodium; flurbiprofen -- used for attack prevention and aborting acute attack
Hyperprolactinemia:(amenorrhea, infertility inwomen, galactorrhea)
may be caused by:
prolactin-secreting anterior pituitary tumors
centrally-acting anti-dopaminergic drugs (antipsychotic drugs)
Drug treatment: hyperprolactinemia
Bromocriptine (Parlodel) -- very effective
occasional postpartum cardiotoxicity
Pergolide (Permax): lactation suppression
Postpartum Hemorrhage:
Ergot Derivatives: used to control late uterine bleeding (NEVER given before delivery, given before delivery an increase in internal and fetal mortality occur)
Ergot alkaloids cause uterine contractions (prolonged, powerful spasms, unlike natural labor)
Ergot Toxicity:
Most common:
gastrointestinal -- diarrhea, vomiting, nausea
Mechanism of Action:
medullary vomiting center stimulation
activation of gastrointestinal serotonergic receptors
Use of methysergide (Sansert) (prophylactic migraine agent) any limited by GI toxicities
Other toxicities:
Vasospasm -- overdosage with drugs such as: ergotamine and ergonovine
Dangerous toxic effect
gangrene, possible amputation
most vasospastic reactions involves the extremities
Bowel infarction (secondary to mesenteric artery vasospasm) may also occur
Serious vasospastic reactions may be reversible by high-dose nitroprusside or nitroglycerin
Chronic toxicities:
Methysergide (Sansert): -- retroperitoneal fibroplasia, subendocardial fibrosis, fibroplastic changes in the pleural cavity.
Slowly developing
Presenting symptoms:
hydronephrosis (ureter obstruction)
cardiac murmur (valve deformation)
Methysergide (Sansert) CNS effects {stimulation/loose nations}
Contraindications for Ergot Alkaloids Use:
Presence of vascular or collagen disease
