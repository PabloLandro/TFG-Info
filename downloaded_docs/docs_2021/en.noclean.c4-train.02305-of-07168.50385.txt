Achilles Tendon Rupture
(Rupture, Achilles Tendon; Severely Torn Achilles Tendon)
Pronounced: ah-KILL-ees TEN-dun RUP-choor
by ]]>Mary Cresse]]>
]]>
Definition
The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. A rupture, or tear, can occur when the tendon is overstretched. This injury is very painful. You may hear a popping or snapping noise when the tendon is torn.

Causes
Achilles tendon rupture can be caused by:
Too much stress placed on the tendon, common during:
Running, especially on hills, stairs, and hard surfaces
Lunging, jumping, twisting (eg, basketball, football, rugby)
Weakened tendon that has not fully healed from previous injury, use of medication, or disease
Overworking an inflamed tendon
Having an accident where the tendon is cut or mangled (less common)
Risk Factors
These factors increase your chance of developing Achilles tendon rupture:
Having weak or inflexible calf muscles
Being overweight
Wearing improper footwear
Having flat feet]]>
Not warming up properly before exercising, and not cooling down properly afterwards
Not ]]>stretching]]> properly
Participating in certain activities, such as basketball, football, and rugby
Using tendon-relaxing medications, which may lessen the pain and cause you to overuse the tendon
Previously rupturing the Achilles tendon
Current use of quinolone antibiotics or corticosteroids, which can weaken tendons
Collagen vascular disease (eg, ]]>rheumatoid arthritis]]> , ]]>lupus]]> , ]]>scleroderma]]> )
]]>Smoking]]>
Tell your doctor if you have any of these risk factors.

Symptoms
If you have any of these symptom, do not assume it is due to Achilles tendon rupture. These symptoms may be caused by other conditions. Tell your doctor if you have any of these:
Popping or snapping noise when injury occurs
Sudden, extreme pain at back of heel
Swelling near your heel (severe with full rupture)
Inability to push off from ball of foot
Inability to walk on affected leg
Diagnosis
Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You will also have a physical exam. Tests may include:
MRI scan]]> —a test that uses magnetic waves to make pictures of structures in the body; useful in viewing tendons and joints
Ultrasound—a test that uses sound waves to exam the tendon; may not be able to show the difference between a complete tear and a partial tear
Thompson test—a method to test the tendon by squeezing the calf muscle
]]>X-ray]]> —a test that uses radiation to take a picture of structures inside the body, especially bones
]]>
Treatment
Talk with your doctor about the best treatment plan for you. Upon injury, stop the activity. You may need to see a doctor right way. Treatment options include the following:
First Aid
For first aid after the injury, remember the acronym “RICE”:
Rest—Get off foot right away.
Ice—Place a cold pack on the area.
Compress—Lightly wrap foot with compression bandage.
Elevate—To limit pain and swelling, elevate your foot.
Medication
To relieve pain and reduce swelling, you may want to take:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), such as:
Acetaminophen]]>
]]>Ibuprofen]]>
Surgery
Surgery is the most common treatment for this condition. The doctor makes an incision in the lower leg. Then, she sews the tendon back together. A cast , splint, walking boot, or brace is worn for 6-8 weeks. One of the benefits of surgery is that it lowers the risk of re-rupturing the tendon. Surgery may also be a better option if you are very athletic.
Non-Surgical Care
The other option is to allow your tendon to heal without surgery. In this case, you also need to wear a cast, splint, walking boot, or brace for 6-8 weeks. A heel lift decreases force on the tendon. It may take longer to heal, though. You also may have different exercises to do. If you are less active or have a chronic illness that prevents surgery, this option may be better for you.
Rehabilitation
During rehabilitation, you will:
Begin with range-of-motion exercise . Often these will focus on the body as a whole.
Progress to weight-bearing exercises, using support devices (eg, walker or crutches).
Most people can return to normal activity in 4-6 months.

Prevention
To help reduce your chance of getting Achilles tendon rupture, take the following steps:
Do warm-up exercises before an activity. Cool down with ice to the area.
Wear proper footwear. Consider heel lifts.
Stretch before exercising.
Maintain a healthy weight]]> .
Rest if you feel pain during an activity. Avoid activities that cause pain.
Change your routine. Switch between high-impact activities (eg, ]]>running]]> ) and low-impact activities (eg, ]]>walking]]> ).
Do exercises that strengthen your calf muscle.
These steps can also reduce your chance of repeat injury.
