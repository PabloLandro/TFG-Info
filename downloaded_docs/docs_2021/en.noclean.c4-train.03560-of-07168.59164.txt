Which Triptan Should I Choose for Migraine Relief?
by Carissa Andrews - January 21, 2019
For most people who suffer from migraines, finding the right medications to get them under control is key. Triptans (serotonin receptor agonists) are compounds that activate a person’s serotonin receptors, in the same way serotonin does. This reaction works to quiet the pain response and most patients find their migraines are diminished within 30-minutes to 2 hours of taking one. They help not only with subduing the headache pain itself, but also sensitivity to light and sound, as well as reducing nausea and the vomiting that can come from the intensity of a migraine.
It’s important to note that triptan medications are not preventative medications, however. They can only treat a headache once it starts, so be sure to talk to your doctor about your triggers, as well as preventative medications that may help manage your headaches. Some of the preventative medications for migraines include:
•	Anticonvulsants such as Topiramate (Topamax) -- most commonly for teens and young adults
•	Anti-nausea medications such as Metoclopramide (Reglan)
•	Beta Blockers such as Propranolol (Inderal)
•	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) drugs such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or Cambia, new powdered formulation of diclofenac potassium
•	Tricyclic antidepressants such as or Amitriptyline (Elavil), or Nortriptyline (Aventyl)
Now, for those of you wondering which triptan will work best for your migraine, you may be surprised to learn there are seven different triptans available.

There are also four different formulations you can find them in:
•	Tablets
•	Orally disintegrating (or dissolving) tablets - ODT
•	Injections
•	Nasal sprays
The delivery system you’re prescribed will typically depend on how you feel when you have a migraine. For example, if you get sick to your stomach, it’s likely you’ll be prescribed an injectable or nasal spray to give you a better chance at relief. It’s best to keep track of how the medication you’re prescribed is working for you because if one doesn’t help, it’s still worthwhile to try another variation.
For the sake of ease, let’s break down the triptans into two main categories: Fast-acting and Long-Lasting. Let’s take a closer look.
Fast-Acting Triptans
If you’re a person whose migraines tend to come on rapidly, a fast-acting triptan may be the right one for you. There are five triptans who fit the bill, with Imitrex being the most prescribed. Let’s take a closer look.
Imitrex/Sumatriptan
If you have slow or quick onset migraines, Imitrex will likely be the place where your doctor will start. The injectable format is considered the “gold standard” in migraine triptan care, so if all other triptans have failed, it is typically the go-to medicine your doctor will prescribe. The injectable Imitrex has a 70% response rate in just under an hour and is the only ultra-fast triptan available at this time.
But an injection isn’t the only way to get Imitrex. It’s also available in tablet and nasal spray for easier use. If a migraine feels as though it has a slow onset, you can take one of these slower-acting variations and follow it up with an injection if the migraine doesn’t respond to the medication or worsens. (Special Note: you can only do this if you are using the same triptan medication, but in a different form.)

Axert/Almotriptan
Axert has a fast 30-minute response time for most people. If you have heart problems of any kind, your doctor may prescribe this triptan. The side effects with Axert are lower than with other triptans—particularly incidences of non-cardiac chest pain after use.

Maxalt/Rizatriptan
You can use Maxalt and Maxalt MLT if you need a fast-acting medication and don’t want to take an injectable. Just like with Axert, some people even report relief as quickly as 30 minutes.

Maxalt MLT
The difference between the two Maxalt mediations has to do with the type of tablet. Maxalt is an orally consumed tablet, where Maxalt MLT is an orally dissolvable one. There is not a big difference between the two, however. The dissolvable medication is just an easier medication to take if you are nauseated or don’t have access to a glass of water to take it with.
We carry brand name Maxalt MLT manufactured by GSK comes from in Canada. Generic Rizatriptan Orally Disintegrating (ODT) is supplied by a variety of manufacturers in Canada including Jamp, Marcan, Pharma Science, Sandoz, and Mylan. This product is available in the following dosage forms.

Relpax/Eletriptan
Relpax is very similar to Axert and Maxalt, in that its onset response is very fast. Trials have shown it works better than Imitrex’s 100mg tablet at a much lower dose of just 40mg. However, it does come with more side effects and more interactions than Imitrex. If you are taking antibiotics and antifungals, for example, you should not take Relpax.
If you are looking to buy Relpax online, we carry both the brand name medication, as well as the generic equivalent, Eletriptan. Relpax is manufactured by Pfizer comes from United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The generic Relpax is manufactured by Teva in Canada.

Zomig/Zolmitriptan
Zomig is a fast-acting medication and comes in a diversified product array that is only matched by Imitrex. While it does not have an injectable, Zomig does come in three different delivery systems: Tablet, Rapimelt (orally disintegrating or dispersible tablet, ODT), and Nasal Spray.

Long-Lasting Triptans
Not everyone suffers from quick-onset migraines. If you’re someone who has a headache for a number of hours before it gets worse or has a tendency to reoccur for a couple of days, these two triptans may suit you better.
Amerge/Naratriptan
Amerge has a 12-hour duration and works very well if you have a tendency to wake up with migraines. While not technically a preventative medication, it can be taken one the night before to ward them off. It can also be taken every twelve hours for 3-4 days if you get menstrual migraines. If you happen to get advance warnings your migraine is coming (prodrome), Amerge is also an effective triptan to consider.
You can buy Amerge online in a 2.5 mg tablet, or the generic equivalent Naratriptan in a 1 mg or 2.5 mg dosage. Amerge is manufactured by GSK comes from Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. The generic equivalent of Amerge is manufactured by Teva in Canada.

Frova/Frovatriptan
Frova is a long-lasting medication that will stay in the body for a while (approximately 24 hours). The initial response does take some time to kick in—roughly 3 hours, as opposed to 30 minutes to 2 hours for most of the other triptans. Frova’s greatest benefit is its low risk of recurrence when taking it, likely due to its long life. If you tend to get migraines in clusters or are unsure if a headache will worsen into one—this may be the triptan for you.
You can currently buy Frova online in the brand name and generic medication at the 2.5mg dosage. Frova is manufactured by Endo Pharma (distributed by Paladin) comes from Canada and Turkey. The generic Frova also comes from Canada and it is on backorder.
•	Frova tablets: 2.5 mg, also known as Migrex. Lowest price starts $5.42 per pill
