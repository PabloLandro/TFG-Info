On average adults get between two to four colds a year. Children usually get more, because their immune systems are not fully developed. There is no known cure for a cold, but there is plenty you can do to help treat the symptoms. With so many different OTC medicines to choose from, it can be confusing to know which one is right for your symptoms. The symptoms of a cold generally last 5-10 days and include:
· A sore throat
· Headache
· Sneezing
· Runny and/or blocked nose
· Cough
· Normal or slightly raised temperature
The right medicine to use will depend on your symptoms – here are a few products that could help you feel better when you have a cold:

1 Steam Inhalation with eucalyptus oil

Use a few drops of eucalyptus oil on a tissue or straight on to your pillow to help while you are sleeping. Eucalyptus oil can also be added to hot water for steam inhalation.
Steam inhalation is one of the best ways to help relieve the symptoms of a stuffy nose. Steam helps to loosen up mucus in the nostril, so it is easier to clear away when blowing your nose.
Try:
Olbas oil

Olbas oil contains a blend of pure plants oils, including eucalyptus oil. These oils have a mild decongestant property and can relieve a blocked nose, as well as having a cooling and soothing effect on the irritated lining of the nose.
2 Decongestant nasal spray or drops
Boots.com
When you have a cold the lining of the nose becomes inflamed and irritated. This causes an increased flow of blood, which stimulates excess mucus production in the nose, causing a runny nose. The inflammation of the nose lining restricts the size of the nasal passages, which causes the stuffy, blocked nose feeling.
Using a nasal spray/drops containing a decongestant such as oxymetazoline, phenylephrine or xylometazoline will help to constrict the blood vessels in the nose and reduce swelling and inflammation. This allows the excess mucus to drain away more easily.

Otrivine nasal spray (xylometazoline)

Sudafed Blocked nose spray (xylometazoline)

Vicks Sinex spray (oxymetazoline)

3 Saline nasal sprays or drops
Boots.com
Saline nasal sprays and drops help to break up the congestion in the nose, as well as helping to remove bacteria and viruses that may be causing the infection. Saline nasal sprays and drops are safe to use for children too.

4 Oral decongestants
Boots.com
Pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine and ephedrine are all available as tablets or liquid and are often combined with other medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.
Medicines containing pseudoephedrine are only available from the pharmacy counter and only recommended for short term use. Using nasal decongestants for long periods of time can cause rebound congestion – this means that a blocked nose returns when you stop using them. For this reason, decongestants should not be used for longer than 5-7 days.
Try:
Sudafed sinus pain relief tablets
SHOP NOW
Lemsip cold and flu sachets

Ask your pharmacist about using Sudafed tablets if your blocked nose persists.
