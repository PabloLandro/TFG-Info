Chickenpox scars can develop if a person scratches at the rash. The scars may be bothersome for some people, most especially if they are located on visible parts of the body, such as the face.
Some home remedies and medical treatments may help in reducing the appearance of chickenpox scars.
There are natural skin products for chickenpox scar removal. While most of these products may be beneficial for your overall skin health, it is common for manufacturers to make bold claims regarding their effectiveness.
It is better to consult a doctor, before using a natural product for scar removal.
Natural products that you can try using to remove chickenpox scars include:
Natural Home Remedies for Chickenpox Removal:
1. Aloe Vera
Aloe Vera plant contains one of the most effective natural remedies in removing black spots caused by chickenpox. Aloe vera can efficiently nourish your skin, and enhance the regenerative properties of your skin.
To use, just apply Aloe Vera gel on your skin.
2. Cocoa Butter
Cocoa butter is a cream-colored vegetable fat that is derived from the cocoa bean. Its velvety, smooth texture and its ability to melt upon application to the skin make it a common ingredient in moisturizers. Though it contains antioxidants, which can effectively moisturize skin, it is unlikely to reduce the appearance of scars.
A large clinical trial reported that cocoa butter was no better than a placebo cream in reducing stretchmarks in pregnant women.
3. Hydration
Drinking enough fluids or about 10 to 12 8 oz. glasses will make your body properly hydrated. This will enhance the functions of the cells in your body.
4. Rosehip Oil
Research from 2015 reported that the daily application of a particular brand of rosehip oil to scars that are 12 weeks improved their appearance, reducing discoloration and redness.
The study was small, therefore, more research is needed to determine whether it is an effective treatment.
People should dilute any essential oils in a carrier oil, before applying them to their skin, in order to avoid causing an adverse reaction.
Rosehip oil is available online and in some health stores.
5. Vitamin E
In a 2016 review of studies on vitamin E for treatment for scars, noted their mixed results. While some studies showed that vitamin E leads to a significant improvement in the appearance of scars, others have not reported any benefits.
Also, some studies found that vitamin E causes additional adverse effects, such as a itching and rash.
People who are planning to try using a vitamin E cream, should consult a dermatologist first. Vitamin E creams are available online and in pharmacies.
