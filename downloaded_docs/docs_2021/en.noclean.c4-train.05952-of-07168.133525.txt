L-theanine is one of the best amino acids for good health. It is a 100% natural product and has several benefits on humans. It is found in caffeine and can have a direct effect on the brain for a better state of health. The positive l theanine depression effect is possible because the amino acid can cross the blood-brain barrier in the brain.
Once in the brain, it will bind to certain targets and regulate chemicals in the brain that are responsible for attention, pleasure, anxiety, stress, and feeling of arousal. These series of effects make it a reliable supplement for managing depression. L-theanine can increase the rate of secretion of norepinephrine, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin.
In this write-up, you will learn more about the various benefits of using l-theanine supplements
Effect on stress and anxiety
One of the many benefits of taking an l-theanine supplement is its positive effect on stress and anxiety. Anyone having a high level of anxiety will find the supplement to be helpful since it is a proven anxiolytic agent. A five-trial study carried out in this regard on 104 participants showed a decrease in the level of anxiety and stress. The supplement can improve relaxation. Some of the participants have schizoaffective and schizophrenic disorders and they recorded improvement after the use of the supplement. The quantity used in managing schizophrenia is also the caffeine dosage for ADHD.
Cancer and tumor treatment
A study carried out in 2011 showed that l-theanine can improve how effective chemotherapy drugs are. The product can also reduce all the symptoms associated with chemotherapy. Additionally, the supplement can fight against cancer cells.
Some unconfirmed reports have it that you can reduce the risk of developing cancer by drinking tea regularly. Drinking at least one cup of green tea can help women with ovarian cancer to live longer, according to a research report from China.
Brain function
One other benefit of using l-theanine is its effect on the brain. It can protect the neurons in the brain from damage by preventing excess production of brain cells. L-theanine can equally regulate the amount of oxygen supplied to the brain. As a result, the brain can function in its best condition with the right supply of oxygen.
Immunity improvement
Aside from the positive l theanine depression effect, this amino acid can equally improve your immunity. It can protect the upper respiratory tract from harmful infections, according to a study published in Beverages Journal. There are several other benefits of this unique amino acid apart from the ones mentioned above.
