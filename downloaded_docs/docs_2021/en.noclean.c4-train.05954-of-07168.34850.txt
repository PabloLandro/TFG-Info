The word "Aromatherapy" can be divided into two words, "aroma" meaning fragrance and "therapy" meaning treatment. Flowers, plants, and their essences have been used for relaxation, healing, and energy since ancient times.
Aromatherapy is reputed to be at least 6000 years old and was used by the ancient civilizations of India, Egypt, and China. The Egyptians used the method of infusion to extract the oils from aromatic plants that were used for medicinal, cosmetic, and embalming purposes.
It is believed that the Chinese were also using some form of aromatics, at about the same time as the Egyptians. The oldest surviving medical book that dates back to 2700 B.C. contains information on about 300 plants. The Chinese burned aromatic wood and incense to show respect to God. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian field of medicine, that has been practiced for more than 3000 years, incorporates aromatic massage as one of its main aspects.
