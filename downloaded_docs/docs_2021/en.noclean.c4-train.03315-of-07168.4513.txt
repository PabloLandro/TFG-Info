Haggis, the national dish of Scotland, is a savory pudding of heart, liver, lungs, and oatmeal, traditionally stuffed inside of a stomach. And when that stomach goes into our own stomach, our digestive enzymes and stomach acid have no problem digesting it away. But, how come our body digests the stomach lining of a sheep on our plate, without digesting our own stomach lining? It’s meat; we’re meat; why don’t we digest our own stomach, every time we eat?
In part, because we have an enzyme called cyclooxygenase that protects the lining of our stomach. There are two types: COX-1 and COX-2. Cyclooxygenase 1 is thought to be the primary protector of our stomach, whereas COX-2 is an enzyme responsible for pain and inflammation. In fact, that’s how anti-inflammatory drugs (like ibuprofen and naproxen) work—by inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme. But, these are nonselective drugs. They inhibit both COX-2 and COX-1, which is trying to protect our stomach lining. That’s why, though drugs like ibuprofen are great at relieving pain and inflammation, they kill thousands every year, due to ulcerations through the stomach wall, resulting in life-threatening bleeding and perforation.
What are the risks, on an individual level? On average, about one in about 1,200 people who take this class of drugs “for at least two months will die as a result. To put this into perspective, we can compare the death rate from [anti-inflammatory drug side effects] to the risks associated with some well-known events. For example, it may be safer to go bungee jumping a few hundred times.
So, what we need is some sort of selective COX-2 inhibitor, inhibiting the pain and inflammation of COX-2 without inhibiting the stomach protection of COX-1.
And, that’s what we got—anti-inflammatory drugs easier on the stomach. Like Vioxx; blockbuster drug, bought in billions in profits—before it started killing tens of thousands of people. Internal emails show how the drug manufacturer responded to the revelation they were killing people. They drew up a list of doctors who were trying to warn people, and tried to “neutralize” them. If that didn’t work, “discredit” them.
So, is that what we’re left with? Death from internal bleeding from one type of drug, or death from side effects from another type of drug? If only there was some sort of natural COX-2 inhibitor. There is—cherries, which, unlike ibuprofen, suppress COX-2 more than COX-1.
In videos I did on insomnia and reducing muscle soreness, I talked about the benefits of sour cherries—the types of cherries used in baking. But, this was for the sweet cherries you eat fresh. Tart cherries had less of an effect.
“[S]weet [regular red Bing] cherries were shown to have a greater anti-inflammatory activity than …tart cherries”—which makes sense, since we think it may be the anthocyanin phytonutrients in cherries. And, there’s lots more in sweet red cherries than in tart, and nearly none in the yellow Rainier cherries.
“Because fresh cherries have limited availability,” what about other cherry products? Fresh is best, but frozen would appear to be the second-best choice.

Here are my videos I mentioned about tart pie cherries: Tart Cherries for Insomnia and Reducing Muscle Soreness with Berries.
Here are two ways I incorporate cherries into my diet:
Pink Juice with Green Foam
Healthy Chocolate Milkshakes
Other studies in which anti-inflammatory drugs were compared with natural dietary remedies include: Turmeric Curcumin & Osteoarthritis and Turmeric Curcumin & Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Anti-inflammatory activity in a test tube is one thing, but can cherries actually be used clinically to treat inflammatory diseases? Stay tuned for Gout Treatment with a Cherry on Top!

This is good info. Thanks.
As far as cherries and their inclusion on the FODMAP list, how do you feel about FODMAP-free diets? I’ve read that FODMAP issues could be responsible for bacteria in guts either depleting and or preventing absorption of B12. Any thoughts? And it supposedly does wonders for those seeking relief from IBS issues. Lots of people claiming to have great turns in health after going on low FODMAP diets.

Remember that B12 is essential & can only be found in meat sources, mainly red meat. You cannot derive it from plant sources. If you are not eating red meat & are experiencing a decrease in energy, you must supplement B12. Cyanocobalamin variety must filter thru your liver before your body uses it. Best to use methylcobalamin B12 (raw) as it’s instantly absorbed in your stomach & intestines. You will certainly notice the difference immediately! Your body also stores it for later use, so don’t overdo it! One capsule (usually in powder form, just pull capsule apart & add to your juice or water, best taken on an empty stomach before your morning meal) will last your body probably 4-7 days. It’s economical & a real kickstarter!

You wrote….”Your body also stores it methyl B12) for later use, so don’t overdo it!” Does the science show conclusively that our bodies can store B12 from supplements for later use….I am wondering how long it stores it for? Also, if B12 is water soluble vitamin, and water soluble vitamins get urinated out after the body grabs what it needs, how could we being storing B12 supplements? Maybe I’m just confused about something here, but logic seems to raise this question.
Thank you.

Hi Nevo, good questions.
Water-soluble vitamins, are stored in the body for only a brief period of time and are then excreted by the kidneys. The one exception to this is vitamin B12, which is stored in the liver for 2-3 yrs.
You may be interested to view several of Dr. Greger’s B12 videos (link below) and to see the research be sure to click on Sources Cited under the video.

Fodmap foods, for those who are adversely effected by them, are thought to create a bacterial environment in body that makes absorbing and retaining B12 (from supplements or food) difficult. Just theories. But the list of Fodmap success stories (vegans as well as non-vegans) is long and seems to be growing.

Dr. Greger’s recommendation:
http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/which-type-of-b12-is-best/
“We don’t have as much data (in terms of proper dosing and efficacy) on preventing/reversing B12 deficiency in vegans with any other form that cyanocobalamin. Until there is I’m less comfortable recommending it.”

In a study meat was shown to have a negative impact on b12 ballance. Milk was best, supplements were second.
And, there is little reasearch but, people not consuming treated water and processed food have show no or little signs of b12 deficiency (yet to be reasearched), looks like diet itself isnt the major factor. “Cleaning” the water and food very well might be.

Before we all started drinking chlorinated water, humans got B12 from drinking natural river or stream water. B12 is a bacteria. Now our diets are so sterilized, we are B12 deficient. The majority of people are B12 deficient, regardless of whether they eat meat or not.

To elaborate on your comment, B12 is found in microorganisms in the soil and raw water, no animal produces B12. The reasons animals in the wild have it is because they get it from the soil and water. The reason the animals hacked up in the grocery store have it, is because they’re supplemented with it. So really, when people get B12 from eating animal parts, they’re not only getting a supplement, but they’re getting a SECOND HAND supplement. It seems to me that since we cannot safely drink raw water and eat dirt, we should all be supplementing B12 once a week or daily even people who eat animals. Another reason why taking the supplement first hand is better, is because B12 may not be absorbed properly in people with digestive issues which most people in the US and other parts of the world on a westernized diet have. So even though they’d be getting B12 supplement second hand via slaughtered animals, they may not be absorbing it right.

My 1st day of 2 cups of frozen bing cherries didn’t go too well. Within 2 hours of ingesting a migraine started building up big time. Was it all that sugar, 36 gms or what.
This video like so many on this web site gives some information but not enough to know how to put it to practical use. And many of us couldn’t afford it anyway.
Of that 1 in 1200 that have bleeding problems what made them at risk and not others?

Since it’s not practical for most of us to eat two cups of cherries everyday for almost a month, even if it’s frozen cherries, how about cherry juice concentrate?

Dr. HemoDynamic: Oh, it’s you who let us know about the 2 cups! I mis-remembered. Thank you for this information!
I also messed up in terms of reading your post very carefully. I didn’t notice the “per day for 28 days” part. So, on Tuesday morning, I felt a headache coming on. I said to myself, “I have a bag that is just about 2 cups of sweet cherries. Let’s try it.” By 10:00, I was in too much pain and had to take a pill. (The cherries didn’t make my pain any worse, unlike what another poster said. It just didn’t stop the headache coming on.)
Now that I see that it is a cumulative effect that must be taken every day for 4 weeks, I’ll have to think this through some more. I don’t mind spending money on my health. But: a) there is a physical space issue in my freezer. b) And then there is the issue of physically getting 2 cups of fruit into my tummy each day like that. I was pretty darn sick of eating cherries by the time I got to the bottom of the two cups last Tuesday. I thought I loved cherries, but it turns out I don’t like them all *that* much. c) And finally, there is the issue of whether or not I think it will really do all that much good for my particular case. I find that I need the migraine medicine more than I need the straight ibuprofen. If the point of the cherries is just anti-inflamatory effects, I don’t know how much it would really help me. I still might give it a 28 day try. I just have to think about it.
I’m just sharing my experience. Without your nice post, I would not know what I would need to do in order to try to replicate the results in myself. Thanks!

I’m not crazy about the sugar load with 2 cups of cherries plus the $60+ per month, plus the need for freezer space I don’t have. And I’d be sick of them before the month half gone.
Even if the last 3 problems would work out the 1st one of 36gms of sugar per 2 cups cherries is a deal breaker. I will just continue with cayenne and other gut healing herbs.

Jean: I don’t share your concern with “sugar”. Based on the research I have done, I’m very confident that table sugar and whole fruit are completely different “animals.” (ha, ha) Also, I believe that two cups of cherries translates into 4 servings of fruit – well within established guidelines for healthy eating.
As for the cost, it is a serious bummer, but I would rather spend even $100 per month or more even than die… So, it’s a concern and a bummer, but I would still do it if it worked.
Since I buy groceries once a week, this solution would mean finding room in my freezer for 7 bags of frozen cherries. I can do it. It would just require some creative shuffling and maybe not freezing some things that I would normally freeze. I also will have to eat some things to clean out the freezer. It’s a hassle, but may be worth the effort. If the cherries work, then I could get an extra freezer to put in the garage.
Then again, I have found that frozen fruits and veggies do just fine in the regular refrigerate for at least a few days. So, I wouldn’t have to find room for all 7 bags in the freezer.
The biggest concern I have, and one that I share with you, is just getting sick of eating that much cherries. I had trouble getting through one day’s worth. So, spooning 2 cups day in and day out for a month, let alone the rest of my life (or at least until menopause) is something I have doubts about. But I do really, really, really want to get off the pills… I think I maybe just talked myself into giving it a try.
Thanks for sharing. We may not share the exact the same concerns, but it was interesting to see what factors are important to someone else and that I’m not the only person who maybe likes cherries, but not that many.

You are fortunate if it is really just the monthly migraine. Mine were monthly in pre-menopause but steadily worsened after menopause. Have to drive 25 miles to a city to buy frozen cherries and an extra freeezer would be prohibitive. I will stay tuned to see if the experiment works for you.

Excellent information, Dr. Greger! Glad to read about the skullduggery involving pharmaceutical companies and how they neutralize those who know the facts, which most folks are not aware of, but ought to be. That type of information is part of being an informed healthcare consumer, I contend. Furthermore, consumers should have available via the media more candid and open discussion(s) regarding Big Pharma’s ‘turf’ protection activities.
Thank you for what you do.

This video is hugely relevant to my own situation since I take a lot of NSAIDS – either straight ibuprophen or as part of over-the-counter migraine medication. Without the drugs, I get in so much pain, I can’t function. So, it is a risk I feel I have to take or risk loosing my job, social activities, etc. However, maybe the next time I get a headache I will try to eat a couple cups (thanks for the dosage Darryl!) of cherries instead. It seems worth a try.

If you have not already done so, please consider 6 months completely free of all beans and grains. (Stay vegan, though)
Eliminate all nightshades as well.
So much of what you already know might prevent you from being open to this – but this path has worked for so many people, not just vegans. Start slowly, then 100%. There is really no way of explaining the shift in how the body feels until one experiences bean and grain free for a significant amount of time. Changes lives.

guest: I understand that you are trying to be helpful. I appreciate that. But as you say, so much of what I already know prevents me from being open to this idea. I’ve done a fair amount of research on the topic. There is so much overwhelming and compelling evidence concerning the health benefits of whole grains and beans. Just look at the videos on this site alone. Plus, I do not find the evidence against whole grains and beans (found on other sites) to be compelling at all. Thus, for my own diet, it would be foolish of me to stop eating those healthy foods.
I understand that other people feel that they get a benefit from eliminating these 2 out of the 5 main food groups. If you are such a person, I hope your diet does benefit you long term and wish you well.

Just remember, your situation involves a lot of NSAIDS, and this is not the case for the majority of the population. And most people can eat beans and grains without problems (debatable), but for now, please consider that you might be the exception, and that the conventional and well established benefits of beans and grains just might not apply to your situation. This just might be your chance at freedom. It just takes accepting some irony and paradoxical thought. Such is life. Best of luck to you.

Sounds like you need 4000mg omega3 every 4-6 hours with lots of magnesium ascorbate and some salt bathes for detox. Two tablespoons of ground flax seeds provides 4000mg omega3. I’d like Dr Greger to return to the subject of too much flax is goitrogenic.

I have migraines also managed with NSAIDs. Can not find a food link and have tried for a long time. Did change to a whole foods plant based starchivore diet 3+ years ago. Was discouraged because just seemed to get worse. But my last acute attack was 7 months ago. Since then they are silent to mild migraines but things change and who knows what tomorrow will bring. At least the rest of me is healthy. I would rather use NSAIDs than be sick, dehydrated, unable to eat or drink and non-functional. Trying some cherries seems an easy experiment.

“There is so much overwhelming and compelling evidence concerning the health benefits of whole grains and beans.”
You are right. I have been eating different types of beans with every meal, generally either red kidney beans, black beans, black kabuli chickpeans, immature soybeans or tofu. I had to increase my protein intake as a result of a lot more exercise. I can’t see any harm in eating beans, and migraines are not a common symptom of eating grains (even if you have celiac). On the other hand, I have heard of naturopaths curing people of things like psoriasis by eliminating common categories of foods (such as dairy, soy, gluten, etc).

I used to get migraines…usually just the shimmering lights, little pain. Anyway, I’ve been drinking/eating black currant/beet juice or the whole foods for about a year and the frequency has gone way down. I have made other changes too but somehow the daily dose of anthos seems to be the best preventative for me. Best wishes!

Coacervate: That’s fascinating. I collect stories about what helps other people with their headaches and usually end up trying them at some point.
One of the reasons I said your post is fascinating: The black currant idea. I have a family member who is carefully taking black currants every day to help with glaucoma / trying to stop vision loss. She started doing this after seeing Dr. Greger’s video on the subject. It’s still early to tell, but an initial test at the doctor’s shows positive/good results!
I found some “black jumbo raisins” at Trader Joes. I like them and have been eating them. I wonder if they have the same stuff that the black currents have in them. Also, I found some black beluga lentils at the grocery store. They are the first lentil that I like. And I wonder if they have the anthos… stuff in them too. If so, maybe I could try eating those foods more consistently. I’m not a fan of the black currant juice. (yuck on my taste buds) But I think I would enjoy the black lentils and black jumbo raisins–especially if I could figure out the dosage. Just thinking about the possibilities.
Thanks again for sharing your experience. Most intriguing.

DGH: I first got interested in the black beluga lentils 1) because of their color and 2) because I was working on the following recipe:
http://mouthwateringvegan.com/2013/04/07/my-vegan-burger-king/
The recipe calls for the fat green french lentils. I thought that these black babies would work just as well.
I cooked them just like I would any dried bean – except that I didn’t soak them first. It’s been long enough that I don’t remember how long I cooked them, but I think you could use the same directions you would use for the green french lentils (for which I am thinking directions can be found on the internet).
So, I’ve only made the black beluga lentils twice. I want to make them more part of my regular diet. Which means that I would use them in other recipes than just the one I listed above. What I particularly like about the black ones is the texture. More like little baby beans than the mushy stuff that traditional flat lentils usually end up being. So, I’m thinking you could use these black ones just like you would any other little bean…

You’re on to it. Keep trying till it works for you. Here is my recipe: 1 shot of single strength unsweetened black currant juice (aarrghh!), 1 shot of single strength red beet juice (i freeze and press a few kg every week, freeze then thaw to get heaps of sweet juice), 1/2 shot of ginger extract (I make this by boiling grated root, filter). mix and top up with selzer water to taste. The flavours balance out nicely. Wish I could send you some to try.

Coacervate: Thanks for posting your actual recipe! I’m definitely interested in trying it.
One thing I’m impressed with is that you make the beet juice and ginger extract yourself. I think I know what to do for the ginger extract, but I’m not sure about the beet juice. Do you freeze raw beets and then squeeze them by hand? Or do you have a juicer? Do you cook first?
The inclusion of ginger was especially interesting to me because there was another poster on this site who said she uses ginger to help with her migraines. I gave it a shot and it did not work. But then again, I didn’t follow the instructions very well. I didn’t take nearly as much as the poster did. I don’t think I could do that. Instead, I made a home-made ginger tea. That is not a fair test because I didn’t get any whole ginger in me, let alone the concentration the poster is doing.
Thanks again for providing more details. I am even more intrigued.

First, my opinion is that you need to establish a certain baseline level of “goodies” to minimize the frequency and severity of migrates. So I would try a daily dose rather than reactively drinking a single treatment.
Beet juice is easy: Wash and then freeze whole beetroot. Thaw, slice and then squeeze. We use one of these: http://store.nexternal.com/homebrew/fruit-press-ferrari-mini-p870.aspx
Mix with black currant…it has a low pH that stabilizes the PPO browning that runs rampant in neutral pH beet juice.
It is so good we just got into a habit and now we always have some fresh beet juice or pull em out of our garden and boil in vinegar. I’m addicted to them because they are so sweet and they make me feel great.
I like to mix beet (betalain) pigment with currant (anthocyanin) to encourage synergy that may exist witht he two…add some ginger and it is amazing.
one last thing…all of my SAD eating friends just love the fizzy curannt/beet/ginger drink. it is very “more-ish”. Cheers!

A foundation of cherries and dose up from there :)
As 4 beans as a non allergic person towards foods in general,
I do bump into limits especially with lentils which I had to give up.
Other beans are ok till about 250 grams a day.
Any more and things go wrong in a dose dependant way.
Dose and observe the effects would be my advice.
I personally go the cut oats, quinoa and sweet potatoe combo as carb staple. Cooked in white tea and lemon water. Spiced up with spices (ceylon cinnamon, cloves 0.1g, coconut), berries and a wee bit of extra protein powder. Cook a batch every 2 days to last 6 servings. very tasty and none of the stomach upset.

Dear honored doctor,
How many fresh sweet bing cherries would it take
to equal 1 dose of ibuprofen? Let’s say, 200mg of ibuprofen to Xg of
bing cherries?
If a bing cherry is 8g, how many cherries would = 200mg of ibuprofen?
Ahh… please tell me if this calculation is correct dear, kind, good doctor:
100g of bing cherries = 86.6mg of anthocyanin (fresh flesh+skin)
1g of bing = .866mg anthocyanin
0.866mg*X = 200mg (X = grams of bing)
200/0.866 = X
230.947 = X
~231 grams of bing cherries = 200mg of anthocyanin
Since,
1 bing = 8g, 8g*X = 231g => => ~29 cherries = 200mg of anthocyanin
Therefore,
Eating
29 fresh bing cherries should produce an equivalent pain relief as a
normal does of ibuprofen pill BUT without letting our body digest its
own stomach and intestines.
What do you think?
P.S.
8g of 1
bing might include mass of pit, which in normal cases will not be
consumed and therefore changes the # of bing to equal 200mg anthocyanin.
If so, a new calculation would be necessary, but I don’t think the pit is more than 15% of the cherry weight, so,
29 bing is accurate to a +15% rate of error (dependent on pit mass data)
29 might be good, but 34 will certainly give 200mg of anthocyanin to your blood cells.
Please let me know what you think about the calculation. Thank you for all that you do.

I really want to try this for my boyfriend. He takes Aleve on a very regular basis which worries me. I had to stop taking NSAIDS because they trigger heart palpitations for me. Then again, I have a negative reaction from most of the medications I have ever tried. My primary care physician tried to tell me that isn’t possible because NSAIDS are good for the heart. Yes, I am looking for a new PCP.
I’m thinking maybe I can make a smoothie with a good portion of sweet cherries and other anti-inflammatory fruits or spices. I have to come up with an easy, yet tasty, way to convince him to try it. He does drink cranberry juice on occasion, which he claims to get good results from.

At least one person expressed interest in hearing back from me if I gave this a try. So, for anyone interested: I tried to see if I could get this idea of cherries=”some migraine help” to work for me. Today marks the end of a two month trial period. What happened? Bottom Line: I don’t think all those cherries did much for me. Or if it did, the effect was not enough to make it worth my effort to continue the experiment. Next stop: I’m going to try Coacervate’s idea, if I can work out a few technical difficulties.
Before you decide my experience is in any way meaningful, you might want to read some important details:
• Except for two days when I ate fresh cherries, I ate frozen cherries. As the video says, frozen is not as effective as fresh. (though it is second best).
• I ate two cups a day – but two cups as measured when frozen. When they thawed out, it was more like a cup and half a day.
• I haven’t read the original study. I have absolutely no idea how close I came to replicating it. Maybe I fell far short?
• Out of the two months, I know of only two days where I did not eat any cherries that day. On the other hand, the two days when I ate fresh cherries – I ate far more than two cups.
• I went for convenience over cost. One of my local grocery stores sells convenient two cup bags of frozen cherries. Every day was very easy: I just grabbed a bag from the freezer. No measuring necessary. I could take it to eat anywhere, including throughout the day at work. However, these bags cost almost $6/bag. For some people like myself, that’s quite spendy if you are buying 7 bags a week. It would be worth it if there was a dramatic effect, but not so worth it for the effect, if any, that I got.
• I bought organic, sweet cherries.
• I didn’t take this seriously in that I did not quantify symptoms before or during experiment. In other words, in order to do a fair self-test, I should have done the following: I should have spent 3 months leading up to the test documenting every day that I experienced migraines, rating them on intensity and marking how many and which kind of pills I took. And then I should have continued that important documentation during the two month trial period. Then I could have some data that I could have used to see if there really was any effect or not. Without that data and with so many migraines and pills during the trial period, all I can say is: I did feel during part of the trial period that while I was still getting migraines, the pain was not quite as intense and I was able to take fewer pills. Maybe. Since I didn’t do the proper documentation and since the effect was minor enough that I couldn’t say for sure, I’m just going by gut feeling and that gut feeling could be based more on me wanting the experiment to work than it actually working.
• My initial concern about finding space in my freezer for all those cherries was very much misplaced. Those nice convenient two cup bags of cherries easily fit into nooks and crannies in my freezer.
• Another concern that was misplaced was my fear that I would not enjoy the experiment. I found that once again, Dr. Barnard was correct: You like what you eat. The more I ate the cherries, the more I enjoyed the experience and looked forward to eating them. Even after two months of eating two cups a day, I am not sick of cherries. I found my enjoyment of the cherries increased for a while as the days passed. Then it plateau-ed into a steady enjoyable level without hitting an addictive enjoyment. Also on the taste topic: This was a great experiment to do in the summer. There were many a hot days when I really enjoyed sucking on partially frozen cherries. It was a nice summer treat.
• On the negative side of enjoyment: It seems that most experts feel that 3 to 4 servings of fruit a day is about right or perhaps the maximum. At two cups a day, I was eating 4 servings. So, I felt that eating other fruit may not be all that healthy. And I found that I missed the variety that I am used to having each day, including, often, an apple, which is also very healthy to eat every day.
Note that even studies with great results don’t often work for everyone. So, just because this didn’t work for me, doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you. No way to know unless you try.

After watching this video I’ve been eating cherries daily for several days. (The frozen ones are the only ones available now, but they make a great shake, so I use two cups.) All the hip pain is gone. GONE. That’s crazy. How is it working that well, that quickly? One question — the video says cherries have LESS of a COX-1 inhibiting effect. As I looked at the bar graphs, it seemed they still had that effect in pretty good amounts. Are cherries also dangerous at certain levels of usage?

This is an interesting article that explains the mechanism by which NSAIDs cause heart disease. http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/news_releases/2012/05/risk/
Importantly, it says that COX2 is responsible for producing a type of prostaglandin called prostacyclin which plays a role in relaxing blood vessels. In light of that, I would be curious to know why cherries, as a COX 2 inhibitor, presumably do NOT cause heart disease. Any ideas?

I take cherries and cherry extract and find it works well with gout. It even allows me to have beer over a hot summer without pain. I do have to post this on the latest medication prescribed for me which, after reading the below comments I offered my friends $500 if they’d take it for a week.
===========================================================================
“My husband, 62, was prescribed Uloric for gout. He was the correct weight, fit, watched his diet. Low blood pressure, his only medical problem apart from the gout was low thyroxine levels which were well under control. He was given Uloric for two weeks and died of a heart attack in his sleep. On reading the small print I discovered that heart attacks are a side effect of this drug – it maybe a rare side effect and I cannot prove the drug was to blame, but nothing in his background, family or health issues suggested heart problems. I am sure he would rather had carried on using the pain killers than this. This is a no star rating.
Took the medication for two weeks. Passed out at a school graduation and had to be transported to the hospital in an ambulance. At first they could not find a pulse. when they finally did they could not find a vein for an IV. My blood was not fluid enough to flow. They ran test for two days too find nothing out of the ordinary wrong. It was the Uloric that did it. After three days in the hospital and $3,000.00 out of my pocket I went home and reused to take the Uloric and got better. The FDA needs to evaluate the medications far longer and do more studies before they put them on the market as safe.
My mother has been taking this drug for the treatment of gouty arthritis for 3 days when she began to have flu-like symptoms, i.e. hacking productive cough and slight temperature elevation (99.2 oral). also, she complained of itching on her back and stomach. She had 3 (2 on her back and 1 on her stomach)large, red, raised, itchy hive-like whelps. She decided to discontinue using the medication until she could inform the physician.
It made for to sudden a drop in Uric acid levels. From 12.8 to 6.4 in under two months. This caused massive kidney problems, stones and infections. A week in the hospital.
I’m back….it’s been 14 months on this drug and I just had my uric acid level checked. It came back 4.1!!! That’s great but my dr. informed me it could take a year to get all of the crystals out of my system. If I had to do it all over again I would rethink taking this. I have had 14 months of pain!
I had a severe reaction to this drug. My GI tract was completely affected. I experience lightheadedness,GERD, constapation, and even affected my prostate where I could not void.
Began in July 09-went from 40 mg to 80 mg within 30 days and while it has dropped my uric acid level from 9 to 5; it has triggered gout attacks the entire time. I keep hoping it will stop as I approach the 7th month. Additional medication is needed to deal with the attacks. Most of the attacks are hitting the lower body i.e. ankle or knee. Is there light at the end of the tunnel?
I’ve been taking one .6mill colchicine for years and haven’t had a flare up for 3 years. Uric acid high so my doctor suggested I sample Uloric. Got a pretty severe attack just days later and still have it today. Colchicine is my miracle drug. I’m quitting Uloric.
I have been on uloric for 6 months. Gout is worse than ever and seems endless. I think uloric is worthless
24 months/2 years on Uloric(80 mg) I just saw the dr. and uric acid level is 4.2 and I am still having gout flares. Right now I have it in my right middle finger and my left ankle at the same time and taking 20 mg prednisone for pain. Overall opinion is not good. Having constant gout has really started to wear me down.
Very bad nausea and vomiting. Sick for 20 hrs after taking this med. dizziness. Contacted my Dr. Said to D/C
Joint pain and loss of hair
I have only taken 4 pills as of today and I started getting heart palpitations this afternoon. I only have had these symptoms when a pill is not the right pill for me. There is no other reason for me to get heart palpitations.
Weakness, unable to sleep, dizziness”

Very interesting video
Are cherries any better against inflammation than other anthocyanin sources such as choke*erries, eggplant, blueberries, raspberries, acai, plums, grapes, ..?
(2’45): how many grams of cherries were compared to NSAIDS: Is that one cherry to an aspirin pill or a kg to a mg?
(3’40): “Fresh is best but frozen is”… less than 20% effective.

Frozen cherries are helpful for toothaches in TWO ways. First, the fruit inhibits the COX2, and second, you can hold the bag they come in against your jaw as a nerve-calming cold compress!

I take aleve twice a day because of upper back pain. I have a hard time functioning or even sleeping if I don’t take it, but this worries me. How many cherries would I have to take daily and when should I take them in order to achieve the equivalent effects of twice a day aleve? Thank you so much for the advice!

Hi Heather, I am one of the site moderators. Although it is difficult to give an equivalency since cherries do not have a standardized amount of anti-inflammatory capacity one would have to experiment with various amounts and formats to find something that works for you but getting off a large or chronic dose of aleve might be worth the experimentation. I’ll admit that the articles do create some confusion as many of them cite experimentation with tart cherries whereas Dr. Greger in this video states that the sweet cherries appear to have more anti-inflammatory activity than the tart. Here are the three articles cited in the couple of videos he has done on cherries and their anti-inflammatory properties. Experimenting with juice as well as whole cherries not only sounds delicious but may be the easiest way to ingest the amount required to make a difference in you back pain. Here are the links: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16790484. http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/716/art%253A10.1186%252F1550-2783-7-17.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fjissn.biomedcentral.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2F1550-2783-7-17&token2=exp=1494457295~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F716%2Fart%25253A10.1186%25252F1550-2783-7-17.pdf*~hmac=3635900a9a7ef53413dc1568b246e0d2e9b0c600e74c41efd3f47e360f1aa7d0, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16549461 Good luck and I hope this works for you.

This question isn’t directly linked to the video, but I can’t find a better video to post it under. Does anyone have information on epiploic appendagitis? My boyfriend has it; he started with severe abdominal pain, we went to an urgent care then were sent to the ER for a CT scan. After lots of tests, they say he has epiploic appendagitis. The doctor says there’s no cause of it and there’s no treatment for it (other than pain pills to treat the symptoms). Does anyone know if there’s research that says differently?

Here is an article that may help which confirms your boyfriend’s condition is indeed usually treated conservatively (symptom treatment only) and fortunately the condition is self limiting.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2579618/ titled “Acute appendagitis: emergency presentation and computed tomographic appearances”
I don’t know how your boyfriend eats, but this may be a good opportunity to promote healthier nutrition if is not limiting his fat intake, because while twisting (torsion) is the usual cause of the problem, fat appears to also play a part: “Epiploic appendixes are small (0.5–5.0 cm long) pouches of peritoneum filled with fat and small vessels that protrude from the serosal surface of the colon.”

If you need heavier medication for e.g., arthritis, there has been available, for at least 5 years, TOPICAL diclofenac. Living in Portland, OR I was able to correspond via email to an OHSU researcher who confirmed the efficacy.
Diclofenac is a much more effective NSAID that ibuprofen, and has no analgesic property, so a decrease in pain is due solely from the reduction in inflammation.
It is problematic, and therefore restricted mainly to prescription in the US, because it is much harder on the kidneys than other NSAIDs. That is the motivation to have created a topical formulation. It (is claimed on the label in and in the research to) penetrate skin and goes directly to an affected joint, creating a much higher concentration at that point than can be safely induced by oral administration; while keeping the blood concentration very low. The limitation is that it does not penetrate thick flesh and muscle, such as the shoulder. Hands and knees benefit greatly.
It is obscenely expensive OTC in the US. BUT, if you search eBay, you will find people selling it from eastern Europe for very low cost. Further, they have access to 5% concentration, instead of 1% here.
Caveat: don’t be stupid and over-use it.

What about purple plant foods for their anthocyanin content? Plums, grapes, carrots, sweet potatoes. etc.

Hi, my name is Tom and I have a question on gout. I am on a vegan diet for the past 2 years and have not drank any alcoholic beverage for 6 years. Even though the change in diet, as above, I have just experienced my first gout attack in at least 6 years (since stopping drinking alcohol). I have only one kidney, due to kidney cancer, and am concerned about uric acid. The only other food item I can think of that may be a problem is that, I eat a lot of peanuts and occasionally potato chips and French fries. Other than those crutches, I eat all fruits a vegetables, so my question is: why am I still getting gout, and can I still treat it with diet? Thanks so much for your free videos

Hi, Tom! It just so happens I wrote a paper on gout in graduate school, and have a good friend who is afflicted. Unlike you, my friend has been unwilling to change his diet and stop drinking. Cutting down on the peanuts, and eliminating the potato chips and French fries may help. Cherries, especially tart ones, can help with gout. Eating plenty of greens, and foods high in vitamin C should also be beneficial. It is a good idea to avoid sodas, even diet sodas, and sugar-sweetened beverages.

Hi, Marina! There are many foods that have anti-inflammatory properties. Some notable ones include other berries, such as blueberries (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/reducing-muscle-soreness-with-berries/), mushrooms (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/), nuts (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell/), purple potatoes (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-effects-of-purple-potatoes/), turmeric (see here: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-osteoarthritis/ and here: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/turmeric-curcumin-and-rheumatoid-arthritis/), and other spices such as cloves, ginger, and rosemary (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/which-spices-fight-inflammation/).
Generally speaking, whole plant foods are anti-inflammatory, while animal products tend to be pro-inflammatory (see here: https://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/, here: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/chicken-eggs-and-inflammation/, and here: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-inflammatory-meat-molecule-neu5gc/). Whereas all whole plant foods may have anti-inflammatory effects, some plants are better than others. High-antioxidant fruits and vegetables, such as berries and greens, have been found to douse systemic inflammation significantly better than the same number of servings of more common low-antioxidant fruits and veggies, such as bananas and lettuce (see here: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/anti-inflammatory-antioxidants/ and here: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/aspirin-levels-in-plant-foods/).

Awesome video, so informative! Btw, everyone should know that Vioxx PASSED animal tests… doesn’t matter that they’re pointless at best and deadly at worst (at worst in regards to the public, not even taking into account the animals), they continue to sadistically torture enslaved animals anyway… All for liability. No scientist could possibly think vivisection is relevant at all… if they claim to, they should be embarrassed.
