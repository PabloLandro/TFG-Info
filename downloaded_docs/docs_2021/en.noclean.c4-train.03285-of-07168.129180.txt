The ovarian cyst has become a common gynaecological problem. However, this condition is very traumatic for women who have to undergo conventional medical treatment for getting relief from this chronic disease. The conventional medicine approach to ovarian cysts is the most common method, which is used when treating this disease. However, the limited treatment options and the resulting stress can also be too much for a woman to handle. Therefore, more and more women are turning towards alternative forms of treatments for curing ovarian cysts.
Understanding conventional medicinal approach:
Conventional medicine approach to ovarian cysts is very simple and straightforward. There are three stages involved in the conventional treatment of ovarian cysts.
Understanding the symptoms: There are certain textbook symptoms of ovarian cysts condition, which include irregular menstruation, pelvic pain, infertility, and more. The patients are asked to keep a tab on these symptoms so that the condition can be diagnosed as soon as possible. However, sometimes, ovarian cysts do not give rise to any symptom. Hence, they can be discovered accidentally during the routine gynaecological examination.
Diagnosing ovarian cysts:
There are different ways of diagnosing ovarian cysts. Besides understanding the symptoms of the condition, the practitioner will also make use of Endovaginal ultrasound, CT scanning, blood test, Laparoscopy and many other forms of tests to conform his suspicions. Like the treatment, the diagnosis stage of the treatment can be equally traumatic.
Treatment:
The treatment for ovarian cysts will depend upon the type of the cyst and its nature. If the cyst is benign, little or no treatment is required. However, in the case of critical condition, conventional medicine will recommend the following forms of treatment
Birth control pills:
Birth control pills stop ovulation. They, therefore, repress ovarian cysts. They can also reduce the size of the follicles and help in reducing the size of the existing cysts.
Surgery:
If the cysts are cancerous or if there are any other complications, then surgery is recommended. Surgery will again depend upon the type of cyst and the resulting complications. Sometimes, only the cyst is removed. However, it is not very uncommon to remove the ovaries to get rid of the cyst.
Besides the above, pain relievers are also given to provide relief from the pain caused by the cysts.
Disadvantage and side effects of treatment:
There are many disadvantages and side effects of conventional medicine approach to ovarian cysts. Birth control pills can cause prolonged infertility, even when the treatment is discarded. Also, the conventional treatment does not fully cure ovarian cysts, and the surgery may also increase the chances of ovarian cysts in the long run. Hence, conventional medication is not considered to be an appropriate form of treatment for ovarian cysts. As the disease is very complex, a multidimensional approach is required to deal with the disease. This is provided only by the holistic approach. Unlike conventional medicine, holistic approach targets the root causes of illness and not the symptoms. Hence, holistic approach can cure ovarian cysts completely and can provide long-term relief, a task at which conventional wisdom shows its limitations. Therefore, when it comes to curing ovarian cysts, holistic approach is the best form of treatment.
