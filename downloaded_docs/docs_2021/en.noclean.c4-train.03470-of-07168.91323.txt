The most common known form of nutritional disorder in the world, iron deficiency results in anemia because iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, key molecule in red blood cells responsible for the transport of oxygen. In iron deficiency anemia, the red cells appear abnormal and are unusually small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic). The pallor of the red cells reflects their low hemoglobin content.

Anemia that occurs after the body has been low in iron or lost a lot of blood (such as in women who have heavy menstrual periods). Iron deficiency is often related to an inadequate diet. Iron is found in meat and poultry, egg yolks, and, to a lesser extent, green leafy vegetables; dried fruits, beans, and peas; and whole grain and enriched cereals and breads. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Foods rich in vitamin C, are citrus fruits, strawberries, mustard greens, cauliflower, and green peppers.
