Benefits:
0.9% normal saline, an isotonic solution, delivered intravenously to replenish fluid levels in dehydrated patients.

Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)- Effective for migraine prevention, aids mitochondrial energy metabolism.
Niacin (Vitamin B3) – Dilates blood vessels; Increases serotonin.
L-Carnitine – Implicated in migraine pathophysiology due to its role in mitochondrial energy metabolism.
