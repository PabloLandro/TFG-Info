Alternative Health Care for Arthritis 2
Author: Dr. Larita
11/29/2017
Rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammation of the joints, can occur at any age. It affects connective tissues and may be brought on when the autoimmune system turns on itself and then attacks healthy cells. When this happens, joints can become useless and muscle starts wasting away. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include acute or chronic pain, headaches, and tender swollen lymph nodes.
Nutrition is important in the treatment of arthritis. Limit or cut out completely dairy and wheat products, red meat, salt, sugar, acidic fruits, and soft drinks. Eat vegetarian foods, white fish and poultry, plus lots of salads with raw vegetables and any form of cooked or uncooked cabbage. Drink lots of water and add carrot juice to your diet. Increase your vitami,mn and mineral supplements; especially take calcium, zinc, and vitamins C, B, and D.
Use any of these essential oils in your bath and massage oil: eucalyptus, peppermint, chamomile, geranium, rosemary, lemon, thyme, and lavender. Before beginning your essential oil bath or massage therapy, you must draw the toxins out of your body with a clay poultice. Make the clay poultice from green clay which you can get from any health food store. Make a stiff paste by adding water to 1 tablespoon to dry clay. Then add 2 drops eucalyptus, 1 drop peppermint, 3 drops chamomile, and 1 drop lavender essential oils to the clay paste and mix well. Smear the paste over the sore joints and painful areas and cover with muslin (which you can buy by the yard) and rest for at least 15 minutes; longer if possible. Follow this course of action twice a day.

Alternative Health for Arthritis I

Arthritis is a chronic inflammation of the joints and if you have any form of this disease, you will want to read this blog. Today I’m going to discuss aromatherapy and essential oils for rheumatoid arthritis.

Skin Moisturizer Is Keeping My Skin Beautiful This Fall
Author: Dr. Larita
11/27/2017
I am someone who really needs to have some good lotion to ensure that I am keeping my skin healthy and glowing day after day. My skin used to get really dry and it would get so dry that it would crack and I would have bleeding and cracked skin that just looked gross and I would feel like I had to hide my skin. This would happen especially on my hands.
My hands go through a lot with all of the washing dishes and cleaning that I do. I have noticed that not drying my hands thoroughly after they are wet leads to dry skin. The fall and winter cold and my runs that I do outside in the cold don’t help either. Finding some great lotion for my skin has really been a lifesaver for me so that my skin can heal and can stay moisturized.
The skin moisturizer that I have been using has been working really well for me and I love the results that I get with it. I can use it to give me some great aromatherapy and to keep my skin looking its best day after day. I love the scent of the lotion and that it works really well. I can use it at night and during the day and in the morning when getting ready for work.

Arthritis Treatment
Author: Dr. Larita
11/27/2017
The Australian Center for Complimentary Medicine and Research studied the effects of shea butter on arthritis and found that it really does work. I could have told them that. I’ve been using shea butter on my knees for over 10 years and it has helped me tremendously. I recently started going to Zumba classes and it is really hard on my knees. When it’s over, I go straight home, take a shower and then massage my knees with shea butter cream. It definitely helps ease the stiffness.
The way to use shea butter to ease joint pain is to put a dab of this amazing cream on the effected joints and rub it in clockwise circles. The friction heats up the butter and it soaks into your skin. It seems to lubricate and actually put some “juice” back in the joints. To make it work even better, add 1 drop of peppermint essential oil to the shea butter. The peppermint oil is anti-inflammatory and is often used to treat arthritis and rheumatism. This is how I treat my arthritis naturally. My knees still tell me when it’s going to rain but I would much rather use natural medicines than prescriptions that often have many side effects that you don’t know about until it’s too late.

Lavender Essential Oil
Lavender essential oil is the most basic oil to have in your home because of its various health benefits. It is a natural antibiotic, antiseptic, antidepressant, sedative, and detoxifier. Lavender oil promotes healing, prevents scarring, stimulates the immune system, and factors in the healing process by stimulating the cells of an injury to rejuvenate more quickly.
Peppermint Essential Oil
Peppermint has been used by many cultures (Egyptians, Chinese, and American Indians) for thousands of years because of its healthful properties. It is a superb digestive, it helps the respiratory system and promotes circulation, it is an anti-inflammatory and it is an antiseptic.

Peppermint Essential Oil
Author: Dr. Larita
11/22/2017
Peppermint essential oil helps support normal digestion and has often been used to promote healthy respiratory function and ease tension headaches. Its fresh minty fragrance combats physical and mental fatigue. Peppermint essential oil is very robust and should not be used topically without a carrier oil to dilute it so it will not harm your skin.
Topical Uses
rub one drop of peppermint essential oil (diluted in a small amount of almond, grapeseed or jojoba oil) on the temples, forehead, over the sinuses, (avoiding contact with the eyes) and on the back of the neck to help soothe head and headache pressure
apply peppermint oil to the back of the neck and shoulders repeatedly throughout the workday to keep your energy levels up
Inhalation Uses
diffuse for energy and mental clarity
inhale peppermint oil before and/or during a workout to help boost your mood and prevent fatigue
Internal Uses
add a drop to herbal tea to enhance the flavor and help aid digestion
add a drop to a cup of hot water with a teaspoon of honey and a pinch of baking soda to sooth an upset stomach due to overeating

Aromatherapy for Flu
Author: Dr. Larita
11/21/2017
This is the time of year that everyone gets a flu shot and hopes they can skip getting the flu. I haven’t had a flu shot in years and I haven’t had the flu since the last time I took the flu shot either. The flu is a viral attack on your body that involves fever, tiredness, coughs, colds, muscle aches and exhaustion. How can one flu shot attempt to prevent so many different viruses that could be the cause of your flu? The best treatment for flu needs to be quick and aimed at fighting the virus as well as raising your immunity levels.
If you start to feel achy, shivery and cold, take a warm bath and add 5 drops of tea tree oil, 2 drops of lavender , and 2 drops of thyme. Next massage your whole body with 2 drops of tea tree and 3 drops of eucalyptus diluted in 1 teaspoon of jojoba oil. Then you should get in bed and rest.
You can spray your bedroom with thyme and lavender or put those oils in a diffuser. Drink plenty of liquids. You can make a special drink for your flu by combining 1 drop of clove and 2 drops of lavender. Use 1 drop of this blend in a teaspoon of honey stirred into a cup of warm water and sip slowly. You will feel better than if you took a flu shot and your arm won’t hurt either!

Use Aromatherapy for Cold Relief
Author: Dr. Larita
11/20/2017
Common colds and the flu are prevalent everywhere but especially in close quarters. Too often, people use antibiotics to treat colds and flu but I believe antibiotics may do more harm than good. Why use a synthetic medicine when you can use pure organic essential oils that are natural and have antibacterial and antiviral properties to treat your illness? To treat a common cold you can use the following oils in a hot bath. Just relax in the tub and inhale deeply.
2 drops – Thyme
2 drops – Tea tree
1 drop – Eucalyptus
3 drops – Lemon
If you would rather use the steam inhalation method, you can use one drop each of thyme, tea tree, lavender and clove in a bowl of steaming hot water. Put a towel over your head above the steaming blend and breath deeply for 5 to 10 minutes, taking a break whenever needed.
If you are away from home and can’t perform the steam inhalation method, you can add one drop each of peppermint, eucalyptus, and clove to a tissue. Inhale this aroma deeply whenever possible. You will love your portable inhalation method. It works very well in the office.
Before going to bed, massage the chest, neck and sinus area with the following essential oils diluted in 1 teaspoon of shea oil or another cosmetic grade vegetable oil of your choice:
1 drop – Lemon
2 drops – Eucalyptus
3 drops – Rosemary
Keep your risk of catching the common cold at a minimum by washing your hands frequently.

Natural Skin Care for Men
Author: Dr. Larita
11/17/2017
We women constantly talk about how to care for our skin because we love to look beautiful but most men aren’t concerned with their skin until there is a problem that needs solving. Your face is the first thing people notice about you. Here are a few tips to ensure that your skin stays healthy and you look good.
Cleanse by washing your face daily with a natural soap that not only cleanses but also exfoliates so that you get a deep cleansing, your pores stay clear and your face looks healthy.
Tone your skin with a natural astringent containing 1 ounce witch hazel, 3 ounces distilled water, 1 teaspoon cider vinegar and the following essential oils: 2 drops juniper berry, 1 drop lime and 1 drop grapefruit. This mixture must be shaken each time you use it.
Moisturize your face daily with a natural moisturizer that contains no alcohol or fragrances.
Protect your skin by: avoiding overexposure to the sun, eating healthy, staying in shape with exercise, and steering clear of alcohol, smoking, fatigue and stress.

Natural Shaving Cream for Men
Author: Dr. Larita
11/16/2017
Previously we discussed a natural shaving cream for women. Actually, anyone can use it but the geranium essential oil in the recipe smells so pretty, I’m sure it seems more feminine. Today, I’m saying this 100% natural shaving cream is for men because of the aroma of the essential oil used but, again, anyone can use it. If you like the scent of an essential oil, you can use it for yourself, whether you’re male or female. Also, you can substitute any essential oil you would rather use for the ones in the recipe.
Many men like the scent of sandalwood but if you would rather have something citrus like, try lime essential oil instead of the sandalwood.
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/3 cup shea butter
1 tablespoon unscented castile soap
10 to 15 drops sandalwood essential oil
Place the shea butter and coconut oil in a large mixing bowl.
Whip with a mixer until well combined and it has fluffed up to almost triple it’s original amount (usually takes 3 to 5 minutes).
Add the castile soap and essential oil. Whip again for 1 to 2 minutes or until well blended.
Place shaving cream in a glass jar. Store covered. Use as desired.
