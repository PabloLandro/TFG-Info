Often not contained, or not enough in your prenatal vitamin

Selenium is a trace mineral that has antioxidant properties that help the body prevent cellular damage from free radicals. Selenium also helps support a strong immune system, regulates thyroid function, and may help reduce the risk of cancer. Selenium helps protect against birth defects and miscarriage. It is important for egg production. Selenium deficiency has been linked to male infertility and supplements in men have improved pregnancy rates (read more below.)
Brazil nuts are a big source of selenium, one nut provides about 200 mcg. In fact NIH says they should be eaten "only occasionally" because of their unusually high selenium levels.
