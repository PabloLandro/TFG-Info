Your insurance probably will not cover the medicine, and the medicines can be costly.

FAQs
What medicines are available to treat inherited hair loss?
Medicines to treat hair loss caused by heredity include:
Minoxidil. Minoxidil (Rogaine) is available without a prescription. You spray or rub it into your scalp 2 times a day. It can be used by both men and women.
Finasteride. Finasteride (Propecia) is available by prescription. It's a pill that you take once a day. Finasteride is not effective in postmenopausal women. footnote 1 Finasteride should never be taken or handled by women who are or may become pregnant, because it can cause birth defects.
Medicine for treating inherited hair loss slows thinning of the hair and increases coverage of the scalp by growing new hair. It also thickens the shafts of your existing hair so that it grows in thicker.
With these medicines, hair coverage tends to improve on the top of the head but not on the forehead area.
How effective are these medicines in treating inherited hair loss?
How well finasteride or minoxidil works depends on your age and the location of the hair loss. These medicines don't work for everyone, and you should not expect to regrow a full head of hair.
Both medicines must be used daily. It may take 6 months of treatment before you see results.
These medicines slow thinning of the hair and increase coverage of the scalp by growing new hair. They also thicken the shafts of your existing hair so that it grows in thicker. If you stop using the medicine, any hair that has grown in will gradually be lost. Within 6 to 12 months after you stop using the medicine, your scalp will most likely look the same as it did before treatment.
Minoxidil
Minoxidil slows hair loss and grows new hair. In men, the 5% solution appears to be more effective than the 2% solution, but it costs more and may have more side effects.
Minoxidil seems to work best on people younger than 30 years of age who have been losing hair for less than 5 years. footnote 2
Finasteride
Finasteride is recognized as a successful therapy for inherited hair loss for men. Research reports that it slows hair loss on the scalp and helps regrow hair. footnote 2 But bald spots may not be completely covered, and it may take from a few months to a year before you see results.
What are the side effects of these medicines?
Side effects of minoxidil include skin irritation, dandruff, and an itchy scalp. In women, minoxidil may cause facial hair growth, especially on the forehead and cheeks. If you have heart problems, ask your doctor before you use this medicine.
Finasteride should not be taken or handled by women who are or may become pregnant, because it can cause birth defects. Possible side effects in men include sexual problems, such as trouble getting an erection.
What are the disadvantages of using these medicines?
The disadvantages of using these medicines for hair loss include the following:
The medicines may not work. You should not expect to regrow a full head of hair. It may take from a few months to a year before you see results.
You must take the medicine every day. If you stop, any regrown hair will fall out, and you will end up with the same amount of hair you had when you started treatment.
The medicines are costly and usually aren't covered by insurance.
What are the risks of not using these medicines?
There are no risks to your health if you decide not to use medicine for hair loss. But some people may be bothered by hair loss that they feel has affected their appearance.
If you don't use medicine, your hair loss will probably continue. But medicine doesn't always work, and hair loss may continue despite treatment with medicine.

Personal stories about treating hair loss with medicine
These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions.
My father and grandfather are both bald. I decided to use Rogaine to see if it would slow down my hair loss. I don't want to look like my dad just yet!
Johan, age 28
My hair began to thin when I was 28 years old. Now I am 44 and the top of my head is bald. Recently, I considered using medicine to treat my hair loss and see if any hair would regrow. After reading the literature and talking to my doctor, I decided not to take medicine because it is unlikely to make a huge difference in my hair-and I don't want to take medicine forever!
Bob, age 44
My hair is very important to me and my appearance. I noticed that my hair was starting to thin. And because baldness runs in our family, I decided to take an aggressive approach to reduce my chances for more hair loss. I am willing to take a pill every day, and to pay for it.
Marc, age 32
I have noticed some thinning throughout my scalp. Although this is disturbing to me, I have decided not to take medicine for the hair loss. It seems that medicine works best for young males. So now I'm checking out hair transplant surgery. I think that in the long run, I may be happier with the results.
Stella, age 38
