How to get rid of a wart in the early stages
Alexandra Bee Updated April 17, 2017
Having warts develop might be difficult and stressful to deal with, especially if you have multiple warts to control and heal. If you begin properly treating and handling the wart in its early stages, it may heal much quicker and be less noticeable overall. You can heal your wart with common items from your medicine cabinet, and prevent the further spread of any warts with proper cleaning and coverage with band aids.

Care for and treat the warts that you may have with salicylic acid, also known to help remove pimples and blemishes around the body. The salicylic acid affects the surroundings of the wart, helping to completely remove it from your skin. Generally, wipe the salicylic acid around the wart, covering it with a band aid. Alternatively, keep a moist aspirin tablet in place with a band aid.
Place a piece of duct tape over the wart(s) for six full days to help remove and reduce its appearance on your skin. After the six days is complete, remove the band aid and soak the area with the wart in warm water. Scrub the wart and the area surrounding with a pumice stone, which will help remove the excess material around the wart itself.
Pick a dandelion flower from your garden or a surrounding area in your location if the season is right. Squeeze the dandelion’s milk into a container to collect it. Spread the dandelion milk over your wart(s) once or twice daily for a few days to help remove the warts completely.
Wash your wart(s) several times a day to help keep the surrounding areas clean, preventing the spread of the papilloma virus of warts. Keep the warts covered with a band aid at all times and always be sure to keep your hands and body clean after touching or cleaning the wart area.
Use a few drops of castor oil on the warts and the surrounding skin areas on your body each night. Rub and massage the oil into the surrounding skin and over the area with the wart(s) itself. Do this for a few nights, and only a few drops each night. Using too much castor oil over the skin may cause irritation instead of healing.
