For Cancer

Thyroid Health
Best Dosage
Research on various selenium uses is ongoing. Selenium is a trace element (Se) that is necessary for maintaining health and is involved in a number of important metabolic pathways in the body.
It demonstrates antioxidant properties which help to protect cells from free radical damage as well as anti-inflammatory properties which reduce systemic swelling.
Selenium supplements also support thyroid function and help to ensure adequate production of T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) hormones for people with a deficiency.
Selenium has been studied for various therapeutic uses, but results have not been conclusive for most medical applications. Currently, a lot of research is focused on selenium’s potentials to treat or prevent cancer, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease and cognitive decline in aging people.

What is selenium used for?
The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database states various uses for selenium. Taken orally, selenium has been studies for the treatment of:
Cardiovascular disease;
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis;
Hypothyroidism;
Diabetes;
Cancer;
Stroke;
There are various other uses for selenium as well. Some of these include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and HIV/AIDS.
Other selenium uses include treatment for critical illness, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), viral infections, arsenic poisoning, mood disorders and chemotherapy toxicity.
While research is ongoing for many of these conditions, the FDA has not approved the use of selenium as a medication for the treatment or prevention of any specific diseases or illnesses.
It has been approved as a treatment for selenium deficiency.
What does Selenium do in the Human Body?
Selenium is an important antioxidant compound. It is a constituent of an important enzyme called glutathione peroxidase.
Glutathione peroxidase is used to protect cellular lipids (fats) from oxidative damage that can cause disease and DNA mutations.
By reducing cellular damage from free radicals, selenium helps the immune system to stay strong. Boosting immunity helps to combat the aging process.
The proimmunity antioxidant effects of selenium are enhanced when combined with those of other antioxidants, like vitamin E, for instance.
Selenium Uses for Cancer
Some people use selenium to boost their natural anticancer protection. Selenium is very important for those with weakened immune system function, or a family history of cancer.
Multiple epidemiological studies have shown that selenium can reduce the incidence of cancer, the severity of cancer and mortality caused by cancer. This is especially true concerning lung, liver, prostate and colorectal cancer. [1]
Note that these studies are based on finding a correlation between selenium intake and reduced cancer diagnosis in a specific population. Correlation is not the same as causation and these studies do not serve as definitive evidence that selenium can reduce the occurrence of cancer.
According to the Dr. Josh Axe website, selenium “goes into the nucleus of cell where the DNA and genome are stored and finds damage. It attaches to protective antioxidants like glutathione and then works to reduce and repair damage done to DNA, which left uncontrolled could lead to cancerous cell mutation and tumor growth.”
Some data suggests that selenium not only reduces the risk of developing cancer, but also can impede tumor growth and cancer progression. Large human trials are underway to determine the efficacy of selenium for preventing or treating cancer in humans.
Studies show that selenium is required for proper immune system function. Selenium has been studied for its effects in the treatment of avian flu, swine flu and other viral infctions.
It plays a key role in inhibiting the progression of viruses including AIDS. There is research demonstrating that selenium is able to slow down the progression of HIV into AIDS, but more studies are needed to validate this finding. [2]
Selenium Uses for Cardiovascular Health
Researchers believe that getting adequate selenium in the diet is beneficial for heart health. This is because selenium has been shown to reduce inflammation, decrease damage from oxidative stress and increase blood flow.
Selenium deficiency is associated with increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Increasing intake of selenium rich food sources, or taking a supplement might help to prevent risk factors associated with atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).
In observational studies, selenium levels are inversely related to CAD. However, because observational studies only demonstrate correlation and not causation, these findings are still considered inconclusive.
More research is required to be able to determine if selenium should be recommended for patients with heart disease – or cardiovascular dysfunction of any type. [3]
Selenium Uses for Thyroid Health
Multiple studies have shown that selenium is involved in proper thyroid and metabolic function. Selenium is a catalyst for the biosynthesis of active thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland is considered the body’s master regulator of metabolism.
In conjunction with the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland modulates basic body functions like sleep, energy production, weight, temperature and appetite. When chronic thyroid dysfunction occurs, numerous health conditions and diseases may result.
Using selenium to promote thyroid function might help to avoid or improve symptoms like irritability, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, weight gain, sleeping problems, muscle weakness and more. [4]
Aside from those listed above, selenium is also used for dozens of other conditions. Some of these include asthma, infertility, cataracts, dyslipidemia, abnormal pap smears, miscarriage prevention and graying hair.
Again, reliable clinical proof for almost all of these uses is currently lacking.
Best Selenium Dosage to Use
To promote overall health and well-being, Selenium is needed only in small amounts. Deficiency in this trace element is rare in the United States as soil levels of this mineral tend to be high in North America.
However, some researchers believe that even patients who do not have a selenium deficiency may benefit from using a supplement to increase blood levels to a more desirable selenium status.
The recommended daily value for selenium is 70 micrograms (mcg) for those over 4 years old. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 55 mcg for those over 14 years. Children 13 and under need less, and pregnant/nursing women need more.
The importance of selenium for health is well established. Maintaining adequate selenium levels throughout life is essential for defending health and promoting longevity.
Taking too much of this supplement may be equally dangerous and could cause a condition known as Selenium Toxicity. Acute overdose can be fatal in some instances.
Too much or too little selenium in the diet can cause adverse side effects. Selenium may also interact with certain diseases, drugs, herbal supplements and lab tests. You should discuss selenium uses, benefits and side effects with your doctor before attempting to raise your levels.
