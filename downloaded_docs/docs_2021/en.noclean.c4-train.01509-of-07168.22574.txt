Effective natural treatments for ovarian cysts
Last updated on May 23, 2016 by Alisa 44 Comments [addtoany]
In this post I‚Äôll be discussing functional ovarian cysts, as opposed to the ovarian cysts associated with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) or the ovarian cysts associated with endometriosis. Functional ovarian cysts are fluid filled sacs the size of almonds that grow and develop on the ovaries, often cyclically as related to your monthly hormonal shifts. Ovarian cysts like this can come and go, get larger and smaller, and are very responsive to natural treatments.
Your body is designed to deal with ovarian cysts, if it is working at an optimal level of health. However, if you are experiencing hormonal imbalance this can prevent ovarian cysts from shrinking, cause them to grow larger, and then potentially rupture with a lot of pain and complication involved. In order to ensure you avoid returning ovarian cysts, the symptoms of ovarian cysts and a ruptured cyst you need to take on a natural treatment protocol.
I have seen many clients of the Flo Living program shrink, eliminate, and prevent ovarian cysts from returning.
The symptoms of functional ovarian cysts
Many women don‚Äôt realize they have ovarian cysts until they start experiencing symptoms. Once you have symptoms like those detailed below you may want to ask your OB/GYN for an ultrasound exam to confirm that ovarian cysts are the cause. The common signs of ovarian cysts are:
Lower abdominal pain
Pain during sex
Pressure on the bladder/need to urinate more frequently
Bloating
Indigestion
Irregular cycles and anovulatory cycles (when ovulation does not occur)
A ruptured ovarian cyst will cause you high fever and pain. Often women who experience this will go to the ER and will often be checked for appendicitis first. It‚Äôs best to be aware that a ruptured ovarian cyst could also be the cause of such pain, if you have experienced the above symptoms prior to this happening.
Types of ovarian cysts
There are several kinds of ovarian cysts, but functional cysts, as described above, are the most common. There are just two kinds of functional ovarian cysts ‚Äì follicle cysts and corpus luteum cysts. Follicle cysts happen when the ovary follicle does not open to release an egg and instead stays closed, filled with liquid. Corpus luteum cysts is when the follicle does release an egg, but does not then seal and close off afterwards.
Other kinds of ovarian cysts include:
Endometriomas ‚Äì tissue that normally would grow and develop inside the uterus can migrate outside the uterus and attach to the ovaries. These cysts are associated with an Endometriosis diagnosis. They can grow large and rupture just like functional cysts.
PCOS ‚Äì with a diagnosis of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome a woman has multiple cysts on her ovary or ovaries (sometimes said to look like ‚Äúa string of pearls‚Äù). PCOS can cause infertility by producing extremely long, irregular cycles without ovulation. This lack of ovulation, the hormonal imbalance, and the enlarged cyst-covered ovary has it‚Äôs own set of symptoms that vary from woman to woman, but can include weight gain, acne, hair overgrowth and hair loss, anxiety, and depression.
Dermoid cysts ‚Äì these cysts grow on the ovaries and contain hair, teeth and other substances.
Treatment for ovarian cysts
Most commonly women are offered the birth control pill to ‚Äútreat‚Äù ovarian cysts. The Pill replaces your natural hormonal changes and cycle with a synthetic hormone stasis. Considering the side effects while using the Pill, and the fact that once you come off you will find the ovarian cysts probably return and may be worse as a result, I never recommend this as a method for combatting cysts. The birth control pill can make the root causes of ovarian cysts much, much worse. The Pill is a band-aid for all women‚Äôs health issues and in the case of ovarian cysts when natural treatment can be very effective it is completely unnecessary. Natural treatment alone can shrink, and resolve cysts as well as prevent their return relatively quickly.
If you find you have a proclivity for cysts I recommend following my natural treatment protocol and then returning to your doctor every 6 months to monitor them.
The cause of ovarian cysts
The central cause of ovarian cysts is estrogen dominance. This means your body holds too much estrogen and not enough progesterone to create balance. The estrogen your body is creating is not being processed and eliminated correctly. Plus you are taking in excess estrogens from outside of your body via synthetic estrogen-filled shampoos, cosmetics, nail polishes, household cleaners, femcare products, plastics and pesticides. This creates an estrogen overload situation. If your body is not functioning optimally then it won‚Äôt be able to get rid of the excess estrogen as it needs to, efficiently and quickly. The Flo Living protocol is designed to reverse and prevent estrogen dominance and all of the symptoms that come with this hormonal imbalance.
The best natural treatment for ovarian cysts
Cycle-syncing (‚Ñ¢) your diet is the best way to manage ovarian cysts. Eating the right foods for the right phase of your hormonal cycle will keep your hormones in check and prevent excess estrogen or low progesterone. There are also certain foods you can frontload in your daily diet to make this protocol even more effective for shrinking, managing, and preventing ovarian cysts long term.
Cruciferous vegetables and DIM ‚Äì vegetables like brussel sprouts, kale, collards, broccoli, cabbage contain DIM (Di-Indolyl Methane) which is very effective at helping the body process and eliminate excess estrogen. Increase your intake of these veggies and supplement with DIM itself in pill form daily.
Fermented foods ‚Äì sauerkraut and kimchi and pickles will help your body deal with and manage estrogen. A certain set of gut bacteria, and more specifically certain bacterial genes, called the estrobolome, produce an essential enzyme that helps metabolize estrogen. Your gut is part of the elimination system that is vital in ushering hormones out of the body. Fermented foods are wonderful for gut health.
Fiber-filled foods ‚Äì fiber helps your liver and digestive system to move and eliminate excess estrogen from your body. The best fiber-filled foods for preventing estrogen dominance are pears and flax seeds. Flax seeds contain lignan which prevents the body from absorbing excess estrogen.
A Flo Living success story: ovarian cysts
Flo Living graduate Heidi Braun came to me with functional ovarian cysts. Within two months of following the Flo Living protocol she saw her cysts disappear from her ovaries.
‚ÄúMid-April and time to go back for another sonogram. Alisa and I spoke prior to my visit and she told me not to expect any changes‚Ä¶that it was too soon. I was fine with that. I knew I was doing all I could and they were great things for my health nonetheless. So as I lay on the table, with no expectations, the technician tells me, ‚ÄúThe cyst on the left ovary is gone‚Äù and then ‚ÄúOh! The one on the right is gone, too!‚Äù I‚Äôm in shock. I‚Äôm elated. And as a tear rolls down my cheek, I‚Äôm in awe of the power‚Ä¶the power this body has to heal itself. How amazing is that! If I treat it right (if I treat ME right), then amazing things will happen.‚Äù
Always remember, that once you have the right information about how your body really works, you can start making health choices that finally start to work for you! You can do this ‚Äì the science of your body is on your side!
to your FLO,
Alisa

Hi Alissa, I love your mission! I‚Äôve been trying to eliminate excess estrogen for years (although I still have some bad habits) due to uterine polyps. I had two surgeries to remove them in my 20s (after several doctors telling me that nothing was wrong with me) and went on the pill for 5 years. Now I am off of them but paranoid that they will return. Would you use the same protocol for cysts, for polyps? The treatments seem similar.

Hi Slee, Yes! The protocol will help with polyps, as these are hormone sensitive.

Hi Alisa,
I am 58 years old and suffered my entire life with the scenario you described above. (And I am struggling in menopause as I write this) I was never diagnosed with POCS even though I was convinced I had it for years. I wish that you would of been around in my early years. üôÇ
Fortunately, I was able to conceive and have two wonderful daughters. My oldest 31 and my youngest now 27. They have both have had hormones issues their entire life, and are both very lean (which I just read does not mean they do not have POCS). My oldest has had many ruptured cysts and visits to the hospital ER, like her Mother. One visit 4 days before her Wedding day, in extreme pain, and it took a few days for her hormones to settle down :(.
The great news is that they both have adopted a gluten, dairy and very low sugar diet. I think my oldest tries to stay away from grains as well. Her GYN has diagnosed her with endometriosis (based on symptoms). She has tried to put her on Birth control more than once and she doesn‚Äôt (thankfully tolerate). The diet that they discovered thanks to resources like yours has helped somewhat. If they stick to their diet, they feel so much better. So really, diet does make a difference for sure. They are trying to convince me to go dairy free since they have found so much relief from cutting this food group out of their diet. It‚Äôs been hard for them though. Learning to eat differently has been a challenge although they have become excellent cooks!!!
I bought the girls a copy of your book (a couple of months ago) to share and I know that my oldest as read part of it, as I write this. There is only so much a Mom can do :). It has to be their choice. I forward every single one of your emails to my oldest, who is most symptomatic. Both of my girls have not tried to have children yet. I want them to see that there is hope for a life without painful cysts, painful periods and hopefully I will be a Grandma someday!!! üôÇ
The best part about your book is that it confirms a similar lifestyle and diet to what they had to discover themselves. Some essential oils have helped as well. Perhaps you are aware of this option?
I am continuing to pray for them that they will find hope in your book. Thanks for providing such a great resource for them, and sharing your story. I wish they could afford your program, but at least they have your book!!! Thanks for all your wonderful articles!!! I know you are helping to bring answers and quality of life to so many young women. Blessings!!
Thank you, thank you.

I was diagnosed in 2011 with PCOS. I had taken the pill for almost 11 years prior to this, and it had masked my symptoms, I didn‚Äôt know there was any problem. It was only after getting married and coming off the pill that I tried to conceive and couldn‚Äôt. I have always suffered with my weight, so this didn‚Äôt prompt me. Once diagnosed I was told to lose weight before being given clomid. In 2012 I got to my goal weight (upper end acceptable BMI) and was prescribed clomid. Clomid worked after one cycle, and I fell pregnant.
years on from giving birth to my beautiful daughter we are ready for another. My weight is again holding me back. For the past year I have tried dieting and exercise. Having only lost 1 stone I am no where near consideration for any treatment.
I then came across Floliving. I would love some advice on how best to support/treat my condition and place me in a better position to conceive again. I have found so many articles, yet no good sound advice that is achievable
Thanks

Hi Julie, I‚Äôm right there with you (maybe), with very low estrogen, slightly lowered testosterone, and very high FSH/LH levels leading to cysts. I‚Äôd love to see more articles pertaining to this too, but I know it‚Äôs not common and therefore a lot less relevant to most.

Dear Alisa,
Thanks for a great post! Is there a particular brand of DIM that you recommend?
Also, is it safe to take DIM and Calcium D-Glucarate at the same time? My understanding is that Calcium D-Glucarate also facilitates the elimination of excess estrogen. I want to make sure that I don‚Äôt accidentally rid my body of the estrogen it does need if I take both at the same time.
Thanks!

I do have PCOS after going on the pill for irregular periods in 9th grade, now I‚Äôm 30 and just recently gone off the pill. Low and behold the symptoms came back but I am determined to solve the issues (i.e.: pain, irregular periods, low energy and sex drive‚Ä¶)the natural way. I have recently started taking maca powder pills‚Ä¶ But I am interested in the DIM supplements. I have read other research that says one should NOT take DIM if you have a hormone sensitive issue as they act to produce MORE estrogen. Would like your feedback to that research. I love your site and the advice you give. Thank you!

Hi Alisa!
Thank you so much for this info. I have searched for years and have had little success finding hope for remedying my cysts. I have a long history with ovarian cysts. 10 and a half years ago, at 22, I was diagnosed with large dermoid cysts on both my ovaries. They were discovered after a trip to the ER in severe pain. They were removed, but recurred several years later, and I also experienced a painful functional cyst rupture at that time. At that time, the dermoids were so small, that my new dr and I did a ‚Äúwatch and wait‚Äù plan. In 2013, my husband and I began trying to conceive, with a lot of planning and talks with my dr. The cysts weren‚Äôt causing me problems, I was ovulating, and after a year, I became pregnant! During my pregnancy, the cysts grew larger (10 cm and 7 cm). I delivered a healthy baby girl in May 2015! Then, 4 months postpartum, I had severe pancreatitis and many gall stones, and had my gall bladder removed. 2 months later, after experiencing horrible pelvic pain and believing I had ovarian torsion, I had surgery to remove the dermoids from my ovaries, with the understanding that I may also lose an ovarian. And that‚Äôs what happened; my dr removed my left ovary and excised the cyst from my right ovary (that ovary was twisted 6 times!) Since these surgeries, I have struggled to get back into healthy eating (after eating mostly clean and plant based for about 6 years).
Thank you for reading my story. I‚Äôm so overwhelmed with where to start healing myself. I have been told my my dr‚Äôs that dermoids are not preventable, and that is so discouraging. Im feeling so powerless and at times depressed, so I‚Äôll eat too much junk, which just makes me feel worse. Am I destined to have surgery every 10 years? Can you offer some suggestions about where to go from here? I will be 33 later this year and would like to have another child ‚Äì I‚Äôm ready to get serious about getting my one ovary in optimum shape. Thanks!

Hi, I had my daughter 8 weeks ago by cesarean along with a tubal ligation. I have been experiencing a dull pain on my right side since surgery. I had a sonogram yesterday and was informed I have a cyst on my right ovary. Could this be hormonal due to post partum and tubal ligation? I‚Äôve never had a cyst before now.

Borderline Ovarian tumors are different, as they are semimalignant. Taking care of your health, eating well and supporting pathways of elimination could certainly help support your body, but this is a different topic all together.

Hi Alisa,
I have stage 4 Endometriosis. 2 years ago they found an endometrioma the size of a grapefruit on my left ovary. I had a surgery to remove it, but after that my health got worse. I ended up with a bad infection from that surgery and now have gastroparesis which doesn‚Äôt allow me to eat much and I have constant constipation. The other issue is my endometrioma keeps coming back. I‚Äôm on birth control and my OBGYN says I can‚Äôt go off it or the Endometrioma will get so big and I‚Äôll need another surgery. What can I do, the pill makes my gastroparesis much worse and I want to stop, but my cysts grow back so fast and big. The one I have now grew to the size of an orange in only 3 months. I am desperate. I‚Äôm also taking DIM, but wanted to ask you advice on which is the best brand of DIM to get? Any help would be so appreciated. Thank you!!

I had a 9cm follicular cyst removed about 3 months ago. I found out this morning that I have another 6.5 cm cyst on the same ovary. My dr wants me to start on birth control but birth control causes me to have annoying symptoms such as nausea and indigestion. I have been taking a 200 mg DIM supplement along with a liver supplement for the past 2 weeks along with some probiotics and digestive enzymes. Since taking these supplements i have had absolutely no acne which is awesome, but I‚Äôm not sure if the supplements are going to help with the cyst. Would you suggest I continue with this regimen? Do you have any other suggestions about anything else I could do to help the cyst go away? I would really like to avoid another surgery and get my hormone health back on track! Thanks so much!

Hi,
I‚Äôm 40 yrs old and am BRCA1 gene mutation positive. I get scans every year for both breast and ovaries which is usually grand with no issues. However because of changes in my cycle over the last 12-18 months as in extremely painful cycles and then periods just not coming I went for further tests.. the result has been a slightly higher than normal CA125 and a CT Scan stating I‚Äôve 4cm cyst on the left ovary and a 2cm on the right.
They can‚Äôt safely state what the larger cyst is type wise and have urged me to go for a laparoscopy to see if they can remove it and a general ‚Äúfat finding‚Äù mission. I‚Äôm still on the fence as to which way to go with this decision as once you go down the surgery route it‚Äôs starting the risk of further complications from medical intervention as well which I‚Äôve tried to avoid.
I guess what I want to understand is can cysts cause hot flushes as well as the missed periods? I‚Äôve tried researching this myself but haven‚Äôt been able to confirm if it‚Äôs excess or low oestrogen that can cause hot flushes.
I‚Äôve changed my diet and lifestyle dramatically for about a month or so removing meat and dairy altogether and upped the intake of supplements as well as juicing.
Still feel the weird throbbing on the left side though on and off so really I want to see if your protocol could possibly help shrink it in time to avoid surgery in 2 and a half weeks?
I‚Äôm still awaiting the 4 day detox email to come through hence why I‚Äôm writing this message to ask your guidance whilst I wait.

Just wanted to respond to you, as I am BRCA2+, and many times have asked questions (while divulging my gene mutation), only to be ignored. Not a great feeling.
I-too am going through a year of cysts recurring on my ovaries, mainly left‚Ä¶ The surgery decision is very-very hard‚Ä¶ I had breast cancer. It destroyed the past decade, far longer than it should have, as did the conventional medical community leaving me more frightened‚Ä¶ I hope you found some way to avoid it for now.

Hi Bee and Taz.
I am a BRCA2 carrier as well. I feel like I know what you are going through. Having this mutation is so isolating..
I had DCIS stage breast cancer and lost both breasts due to this mutation. Now my ovaries are the source of fear and I really want to hold on to them as long as I can. I am 42. I tend to have physiologic cysts on my ovaries and they have not been of a great concern. I also had complex hemorrhagic cysts on couple of occasions and they have resolved.
I did have my second child after mastectomy and now I am going through really painful cramps every month which start 5 days before my period. They are the very uncomfortable burning type but they tend to get a lot better a day or two before my period. My whole body also gets really achy, especially my feet and hands for five days before my period. I don‚Äôt know what these symptoms are all about. I guess it could be PMS but I never heard of PMS cramps starting that far from menses. I am very nervous to go for my next scan as I am fearing the worst. The knowledge of this mutation makes my life close to unbearable sometimes. I feel like if I have to get my ovaries removed I will not be able to take HRT because of prior breast cancer and what will happen to my whole body then? Just thinking out loud. Please respond if you have any thoughts.

Hi Alisa,
I am wondering if you have encountered women with functional ovarian cysts who experience nausea as well. I regularly go to my OB/GYN with functional ovarian cysts that are typically quite large and I tend to be nauseous when I exercise or walk for long periods of time. Could this be due to the cysts or an imbalance in my cycle? It makes traveling very difficult and I am trying to find a natural way to eliminate my problem. I am a young adult and certainly should not be feeling the way that I do.

Thank you for your post. I just had an ultrasound today that revealed a 3.5 cm complex cyst. Is the root cause of a complex cyst the same as a simple cyst? Following up in 6 weeks and hoping to make some big changes and see it decrease in size (or going away would be great!). Is the protocol you outlined likely to effect complex cysts or are they more stubborn?

Dear readers..
I have read all these stories and natural cures and it actually scares me. I‚Äôve been suffering this constant ‚Äúovary pain‚Äù and 3 weeks I actually went for a papsmeer, terrified that I might have had cervical cancer. Test showed negative (Thank God). Had a sonar done and found one cyst of 2.19cm on my left ovary. I‚Äôm allergic to all kinds of contraceptives. Dr has AGAIN put me on Zoely, didn‚Äôt work as I got horrible cramps, then Qlara, same thing. I have now been bleeding for more than a month, NON STOP! I immediately stopped taking those pills too. So I‚Äôve been reading about natural ways to get rid of it. I‚Äôm getting married in May and hubby and I wanna have kids (haven‚Äôt been sexually intimate yet, waiting for wedding day) (old school).. I don‚Äôt wanna risk taking medications that might risk my chances of falling pregnant. I‚Äôve been told that omega 3 oil tablets, and even Cayennes pepper and lemon pips will shrink it fast.
If you guys have any fast effective advice for me.. please help.
Warmest Regards
Ren√©e
