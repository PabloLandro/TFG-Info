Living on Advil?
May 14, 2014
by KLD
I can't tell you how many times people tell me they have 3-7 migraines per week and are "living on" OTC meds like Advil, Aleve, Excedrin Migraine and other painkillers typically used for headaches. Well, I have some difficult news for you: that OTC stuff may actually be giving you a migraine! But therein lies the opportunity for you to get better.
Let me explain:
Medication Overuse Headache (a.k.a. rebound headache) or MOH occurs when analgesics are taken too frequently. What often happens is someone who has episodic headaches (occasional) begins treating them with OTC meds to abort them. That's fine. But a certain percentage of these episodic migraineurs transform over time into chronic migraineurs, primarily from having to take more and more of the meds over time to stay functional and migraine free. The meds they took to abort the migraines actually now creates the migraines. Eventually we end up having 15-30 migraines per month, and most of us never know that these analgesics have become the culprits.
Doctors suggest taking analgesics no more than twice a week (this includes triptans, ergotamines and opiods which will be covered in a future blog). But here is the rub: what are you to do if you take analgesics on day one, and then the migraine comes back on day two and you take them again? You have reached your allotment for the week, but hey, here comes day three and you have nothing to use. What do you do?
Locate a great headache specialist and together search for a preventative medication to stop the migraines from happening in the first place.
Your objection #1: But I don't want to take long term medications! I'd rather just take Advil.
Answer: Advil is medicine, and has many of the same issues other medicines do. Just because it is OTC doesn't mean it is "safe" with no side effects. A lot of these medicines can wreak havoc with your stomach if you take too much for too long, as well as create other fallout to other parts of your body. They may work occasionally for a migraine, but they are definitely not meant to treat chronic migraine (again, 15-30 headaches per months).
Many of you know by now that I had over 9000 migraines over 25 years until I was finally able to eliminate them almost a year ago. Although precisely what specifically stopped them is unclear since I tried a variety things at the same time, it is clear to me and my doctors that calming my system down, finally finding a preventative that worked, and getting off the meds causing the rebound was the largest part of it. In fact after many, many years of taking too many abortive drugs, going off of them was a very, very strange and incredible experience for me, and one I hadn't expected. Here is a video of my story.
How do you get off the medications causing the MOH? Not many years ago people would just go off cold turkey. I don't have to tell any of you how hard that was! These days doctors believe that you can take another drug to blunt the pain as you slowly go off the abortives. Eventually the abortives will all be out of your system.
But then the question is: what happens when your migraines come back eventually, given that you still have the underlying headache disorder? That brings me to the most important part of all: you must do everything you can to find a preventative drug/treatment that works and stop the madness of using abortives long-term like Aleve, Advile, Excedrin, triptans, etc. Once you find a preventative that works, you will occasionally have a breakthrough migraine. That is when you use the abortives. That's what they are for.
I explain how episodic migraines evolve into chronic ones on The Daily Migraine website. I implore you to start working on getting off of the abortives. I strongly suggest a headache specialist rather than a general neurologist whose practice is much broader. You can use this Physician Finder to locate someone near you.
I wish you good luck. Hang in there: you can do it!
