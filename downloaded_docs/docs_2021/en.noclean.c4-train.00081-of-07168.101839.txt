Comments Off on How Does Lipogaine Work?
Hair loss and male pattern baldness are common issues that affect millions of men of all ages all over the world. While hair loss gets more and more common as we get older, male pattern baldness can begin to develop at any age and can cause problems – often very serious – with confidence and self-esteem.
In the most severe cases, hair loss can lead to depression, anxiety and other serious mental health or emotional problems. Because of the prevalence of male pattern baldness and hair loss, and the negative effects it can have on the individual, there is a now a huge market aimed at addressing hair loss.
There are many products on the market that aim to address hair loss, some more effective than others. Lipogaine is one such product that claims to help prevent hair loss and stimulate hair growth. But does it really work?
The short answer to the question “Does It work?” is yes. While it will not work for everyone who tries it, and it will have differing results for those it does work for, Lipogaine has been clinically proven in multiple trials to help prevent hair loss and stimulate hair growth in men.
Lipogaine is carefully manufactured from a blend of powerful ingredients that have been proven in trials to address the issues of hair loss and hair growth. Lipogaine is specially formulated to be easy to use yet to offer the best possible results to users.
The unique selling point is that it offers a holistic and comprehensive approach to those suffering from hair loss. Rather than focus on just one specific ingredient, Lipogaine contains a number of powerful and proven ingredients to deliver the best possible results.
How Does It Work?
Lipogaine contains a powerful blend of some of the most important ingredients that promote hair growth, including minoxidil and biotin. Minoxidil is the top-selling hair growth product in the U.S. and is becoming increasingly popular in the U.K., too. It has been repeatedly proven to be effective in the treatment of baldness in controlled clinical trials. Biotin is considered by many to be one of the most important ingredients to help prevent hair loss.
Loved by medical professionals and beauticians alike, biotin is a powerful ingredient that can help keep hair strong and healthy. Lipogaine also contains a herbal blend DHT blocker, created using a mixture of fatty acids, beta-sitosterol and saw palmetto.
The product works on the entire scalp, making it perfect for those suffering from male pattern baldness. It works on receding hairlines, helping to prevent the hairline creeping ever further back.
How to Apply
Lipogaine is supplied in a bottle with a handy dropper, making it easy to apply the correct amount each and every time. Use the dropper to measure out 1 ml of Lipogaine and apply it to the affected area of the scalp twice each day.
The product is designed to be used by men only, and addresses male pattern baldness and hair loss.
