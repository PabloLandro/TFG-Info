The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon located in the back of the leg that inserts into the heel. It lets you point your toes toward the floor and raise up on your tiptoes. You use this tendon to jump, walk, run, and stand on the balls of your feet. Continuous, intense physical activity, such as running and jumping, can cause painful inflammation of the Achilles tendon, known as Achilles tendonitis (or tendinitis).
Discomfort or swelling in the back of your heel
Tight calf muscles
Limited range of motion when flexing your foot
Skin on your heel overly warm to the touch
Over-pronation or under-pronation in the walking process
Exercising without a proper warm-up
Straining the calf muscles during repeated exercise or physical activity
Playing sports, such as tennis, that require quick stops and changes of direction
Sudden increase in physical activity without allowing your body to adjust to increased training
Wearing old or poorly fitting shoes
Wearing high heels daily or for prolonged durations
Having bone spurs in the back of your heels
Being older, as the Achilles tendon weakens with age
A short achilles tendon
Direct trauma (injury) to the tendon
Heel bone deformity
I.C.E therapy – resting the tendon by not putting weight on it for a couple of days, icing the area after exercise or when in pain, wrap a bandage or athletic tape around your tendon to compress the injury and elevate your foot to decrease any swelling
Reducing your physical activity or switching to a different, less strenuous sport
Physical therapy – very gently stretching and later strengthening your calf muscles, Kineseotaping, soft tissue release
Orthotics, brace & footwear
Wearing a brace or walking boot to prevent heel movement
Athletes should use an orthotic device, heel cup, or heel cradle for extra support to take tension off your Achilles tendon by correcting the alignment or using a temporary heel raise.

Dr Chaitanya Shah is precise with his analysis of the cause of the problem and it’s appropriate solution. I found that everyone at his clinic gives due attention at ease… they’re never hurried and there’s enough and more time between two appointments. It’s been two years since I have been consulting him and I feel a big improvement in my gait, posture and core strength.
