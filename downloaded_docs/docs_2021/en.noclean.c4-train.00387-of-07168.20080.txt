Subject:
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis; acetic acid; caseinates; enzyme inhibition; ingredients; lactic acid; peptidyl-dipeptidase A; probiotics; proteolysis; starter cultures; viability; whey protein concentrate; yogurt
Abstract:
... This study investigated the effect of fortification with sodium–calcium caseinate (SCaCN), whey protein concentrate (WPC) or a blend of those ingredients on some properties of probiotic yoghurt. At the beginning of the storage, the highest angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitory activity (ACEI %) was obtained from yoghurts with SCaCN. However, the levels of proteolytic and ACEI activities were hi ...

Abstract:
... Copper imparts better organoleptic properties to cheese, while cheese acts as a vehicle for probiotic cultures. These studies revealed that copper stress changed key probiotic properties like acid and bile salt tolerance of a model organism Lactobacillus helveticus CD6. After growing the culture in copper stress, the acid tolerance at pH 2 was lost along with a decrease in bile salt tolerance by 1 ...
