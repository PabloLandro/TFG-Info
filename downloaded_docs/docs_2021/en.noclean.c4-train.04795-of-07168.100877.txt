Croup in babies usually clears up on its own, but it can cause distressing symptoms; here we explain what croup is and how it should be treated.
What is croup?
Croup is a viral infection of your baby’s upper airways. The infection causes inflammation and swelling of the baby’s larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe) which leads to a characteristic croup cough.
The infection usually affects children between six months and three years, but babies as young as three months can have it too. Croup is spread from person to person by droplets from an infected person sneezing or coughing. It is most common in the autumn and winter months.
Recognise the symptoms of croup
Croup in children starts off with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sore throat, high temperature (fever) and cough. After a few days, the croup symptoms appear. These are:
A harsh barking cough (sounding like a seal)
A hoarse cry
·Noisy breathing (when breathing in)
Croup is usually diagnosed from its characteristic cough, which tends to be worse at night or when your baby is agitated or active. Your baby may have trouble sleeping at night and settling in the day. If you are concerned by your baby’s symptoms, contact your GP.
How is croup treated?
Croup can be a worry, as the symptoms can seem alarming, but most babies don’t require any medical treatment and can be looked after at home. Here are a few things to keep in mind...
Keep your baby as calm and comfortable as possible, as crying can make the symptoms worse.
Check on your baby regularly, especially at night.
Sit your baby upright on your lap if they’re finding it difficult to breathe or their breathing is very noisy.
Make sure your baby is drinking plenty of cool drinks, or continues to breastfeed, to prevent dehydration.
If your baby has a fever, give them baby paracetamol suitable for their age group.
Don’t try steam inhalation (e.g. in your bathroom) as there’s no evidence that this works for croup and it could scald your baby.
If your baby isn’t getting better seek advice from your GP. If necessary a steroid medicine may be prescribed to help reduce the swelling of the airways. Antibiotics are not usually given as croup is caused by a virus.
When to seek urgent medical attention
Your baby will need to be seen urgently by a doctor if they are struggling to breathe normally. Take your baby to hospital for croup treatment if they are:
Very pale or their lips appear blue
Unusually sleepy or not responding to you
Having trouble breathing (rapid breathing or taking more effort to breathe)
Very restless or agitated
Drooling and unable to swallow.
If your baby has severe croup this may need to be treated in hospital
How long does it take for a baby to recover?
Croup usually lasts for about three to seven days, though a mild, irritating cough can last for up to two weeks. Croup complications are generally very rare, but can include pneumonia or a middle ear infection.
