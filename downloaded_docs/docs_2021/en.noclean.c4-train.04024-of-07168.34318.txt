Vitamin E In Cosmetics
by Gio March 30, 2011
Vitamin A is for antiaging.
Vitamin C is for brightening.
Vitamin K is for dark circles.
Vitamin E‚Ä¶
What the heck does vitamin E do? Ok, it‚Äôs an antioxidant, but does it have any special superpowers? Yes, quite a few:
What The Heck Is Vitamin E?
Vitamin E isn‚Äôt just one ingredient. It‚Äôs a group of ingredients. The most common are:
alpha-topcoherol
alpha-tocotrienols
beta-tocopherol
beta-tocotrienols
gamma-tocopherol
gamma-tocotrienols
Basically, if you see ‚Äútocopherol‚Äù or ‚Äútocotrienols‚Äù somewhere on the packaging, that‚Äôs vitamin E in disguise.
This fat-soluble group of vitamins is present in a lot of foods, too. My faves are avocado and nuts, but you can also find it in green and yellow vegetables, meat, corn and some diary products.
By the way, if you see the ‚Äúd‚Äù prefix (such as d-alpha-tocopherol), it means it comes from a natural source. If you see the ‚Äúdl‚Äù prefix (such as dl-alpha-tocopherol), it‚Äôs made in a lab.
They both work well, but the natural kind seems to do the job a little bit better.
Superpower #1: Vitamin E Has Antioxidant Properties
Let‚Äôs start with the obvious: vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant. It constantly patrols your body, looking for free radicals. When it finds one, it quickly destroys it.
Problem is, the vitamin E your body naturally makes depletes with age and sun exposure. Yep, the more time you spend in the sun without sun protection, the sooner your body goes through its supply of vitamin E.
That‚Äôs why you want to add some back through your skincare ‚Äì you‚Äôll replenish the stock and kill even more free radicals. Take that, wrinkles!
Superpower #2: Vitamin E Has Photoprotective Properties
Vitamin E gives you some protection from the sun, too.
Before you get too excited, no, it‚Äôs NOT a substitute for your sunscreen. Vitamin E can help boost its protection, but it won‚Äôt replace it.
Studies show vitamin E reduces the severity of your sunburn and improves the effectiveness of the UV filters in your sunscreen. Isn‚Äôt it awesome?
While it‚Äôs capable of doing this alone, Vitamin E provides better photo protection when used with its BFFs, vitamin C and ferulic acid.
Superpower #3: Vitamin E Has Moisturising Properties
Vitamin E (especially the a-tocopherol acetate form) is a great moisturiser, too.
Here‚Äôs how it works: vitamin E strengthens the skin‚Äôs natural barrier, reducing water loss. Now that moisture‚Äôs locked into your skin, it softens and plumps it up.
Superpower #4: Vitamin E Is A Preservative
It‚Äôs not over. Vitamin E has one more trick up its sleeve. It helps your skincare products last longer.
Vitamin E isn‚Äôt your usual antioxidant. It doesn‚Äôt kill bacteria and germs that find their way into your precious lotions and potions.
Instead, it prevents the light from oxidising (i.e. making ineffective) the active ingredients in your products. Without its help, they wouldn‚Äôt last you as long.
Can Vitamin E Heal Scars, Too?
You‚Äôve probably noticed I haven‚Äôt included scar healing as a superpower. Turns out, this is a job vitamin E CAN‚ÄôT do.
Studies shows that vitamin E can‚Äôt help scars heal. If anything, it can make things worse. In 90% of cases, topical vitamin E either had no effect on, or actually worsened, the cosmetic appearance of scars.
What can I say? Nothing‚Äôs perfect.

Does Vitamin E Has Any Side Effects?
Vitamin E is pretty innocuous. But, it can cause allergies or irritations in some people. It‚Äôs rare, but it can happen.
What Are The Best Skincare Products With Vitamin E?
Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum ($80.00): available at Cult Beauty, Sephora and SpaceNK
Paula‚Äôs Choice Resist C15 Booster ($490.000): available at Dermstore and Skinstore
Skinceuticals CE Ferulic ($165.00): available at Dermstore and Skinstore

The Bottom Line
Vitamin E doesn‚Äôt often get the recognition it deserves, but it can do wonders for your skin. It prevents wrinkles, protects you from the sun, moisturises your skin and even helps your skincare products last longer. But it won‚Äôt heal your scars.

Jojoba, I love Vitamin E products too. It‚Äôs a wonderful ingredients with lots of benefits. But I wouldn‚Äôt really use it on scars though as it sadly doesn‚Äôt do anything for them.

La vitamina E √® l‚Äôantiossidante naturale pi√π usato anche nella conservazione dei prodotti ecobiologici. Non l‚Äôho mai usata pura.

LaDamaBianca, si come conservante √® molto usato e previene l‚Äôossidazione del prodotto. Io preferisco usare la vitamina e nelle creme e sieri, per√≤ anche da sola funziona molto bene.

I love my vitamin e serum but I‚Äôm shocked to see that it doesn‚Äôt help with scars as my serum works beautifully. Pimple scars that would normally take weeks to go away can be gotten rid of in a few days with nightly applications. Skin also appears to be more radiant in the morning

Isabel, is your serum pure Vitamin e or does it contain other ingredients? Cos it could be something else in the formula that makes it work for pimple scars. In any case, I√¨m glad the serum works well for you. üôÇ

Vitamin E irritated my surgical scar, so it wasn‚Äôt healing. My doc told me to stop using it. It healed much faster after that, and beautifully. I‚Äôve had trouble finding skincare products that don‚Äôt fill my pores and cause irritation. I realized everything had E in it, so I stopped using everything but Ivory soap. My skin is getting better now. I also have an intolerance to coconut, so maybe using it on my skin is just as bad for me as eating it. Most products contain that too.

Diane, I don‚Äôt really know why Vitamin E acquired a reputation for healing scars when very often it has the opposite effect. I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt use neither that nor coconut. There are so many products that use them and trying to find some that don‚Äôt must be very frustrating.

I would very much like to know how to compare the vitamin E content in a creams from % to IU, ie what is the conversion factor between IU and % w/w (g/100g or the like) vitamin E in a cream? How much vitamin E is considered an effective amount to be added to a face cream?
Reply
Gio August 11, 2015 - 8:37 pm
Em, all I know is that Vitamin E must be present in at least 1% concentrations, and used with ingredients that help stabilize it. Hope this helps.
