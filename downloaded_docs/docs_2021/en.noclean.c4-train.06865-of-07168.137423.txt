Burn and scald symptoms
1-minute read
Listen
Burns cause:
pain
a burning feeling
redness of the skin
swelling
blistering or whiteness of the skin (in more serious burns).
If the burn is severe or if it involves the airway, call triple zero (000) for an ambulance.
Seek medical help for all burns larger than the size of a 20 cent piece, or that are deep.
First aid for all burns includes holding the burn under cool running water for at least 20 minutes, as soon as possible. Then cover with a light, loose, non-stick dressing (that is clean, dry and not fluffy, such as plastic cling film).
Do not touch the burn or put on lotions, ointments, fat or ice. Do not try to remove anything that is sticking to the burn.
Not sure what to do next?
If you are still concerned about your burn or scald, why not use healthdirect’s online Symptom Checker to get advice on when to seek medical attention.
The Symptom Checker guides you to the next appropriate healthcare steps, whether it’s self care, talking to a health professional, going to a hospital or calling triple zero (000).

Interventions for treating phosphorus burns | Cochrane
Phosphorus is a chemical element sometimes used in a military or industrial context. Phosphorus burns resulting from military or industrial injuries are chemical burns that can be fatal. Although rare, these burns are serious, often very deep and painful, and can be associated with lengthy periods of time in hospital for patients.

Insufficient evidence so far to support the community approach to burns and scalds prevention | Cochrane
Multi-strategy, community-based interventions are widely promoted for reducing injury rates. The efficacy of this approach is difficult to assess and there have been few research studies of good quality. The current review sought to review studies evaluating the success of community-based programmes specifically intended to reduce burn and scald injury in children. Only four studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and two of these found a reduction in rates of burns and scalding. More high-quality research studies are needed in this area, therefore, to support the continued use of the community approach.

Topical treatment for facial burns | Cochrane
Burn injuries are an important health problem. Burns frequently occur on the head or neck. These areas are central to a person's identity and play a vital role in communication. Other basic abilities such as hearing, smelling and breathing may become affected as a direct result of a facial burn. The authors of this Cochrane review wanted to assess the effects of topical (surface) treatments for wound healing in facial burns. Examples of topical treatments are antimicrobial creams and ointments and biological, or bioengineered (artificial), skin substitutes.

Dressings for treating superficial and partial thickness burns | Cochrane
Superficial burns are those which involve the epidermal skin layer and partial thickness burns involve deeper damage to structures such as blood vessels and nerves. There are many dressing materials available to treat these burns but none has strong evidence to support their use. Evidence from poor quality, small trials, suggests that superficial and partial thickness burns heal more quickly with silicon-coated nylon, silver containing dressings and biosynthetic dressings than with silver sulphadiazine cream. Burns treated with hydrogel dressings healed more quickly than those treated with usual care.

Immunonutrition as an adjuvant therapy for burns | Cochrane
With burn injuries involving a large total body surface area, damage and breakdown of tissues can result in a condition similar to that seen with severe malnourishment. In addition, destruction of the effective skin barrier leads to body temperature dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infection and fluid loss. Previous studies have investigated specific naturally occurring additives to nutritional support, which may lead to an increase in immune system function and therefore a reduction in infection, hospital length of stay and chance of death. These additives are termed immunonutrients and include glutamine, arginine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil). The authors of this review searched for randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of immunonutrients in patients with severe burn injury.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treating partial-thickness burns | Cochrane
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is the application of negative pressure (a vacuum) across a wound with the aim of managing the wounds and promoting healing. Alternative names for NPWT include topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and sealed surface wound suction. In the case of burns, NPWT is used to help the drainage of excess fluid and increase localised blood flow. It has been suggested that the action of NPWT may result in the burn being supplied with increased oxygen and nutrition which could promote healing.We could identify only one clinical trial that tried to address whether NPWT is effective in treating partial-thickness burns, and its results have not yet been published in full. Consequently, there is a lack of trial evidence available, and we could not determine whether NPWT is effective in treating partial-thickness burns. Much more research needs to be done in this area to find out whether NPWT is helpful.

Lidocaine for pain relief in people with burns | Cochrane
Burns are very common and sometimes fatal, and the pain associated with such injury is one of the most difficult types to relieve. The use of high-dose opioid medications like morphine is common, but side effects are encountered. Alternative agents such as lidocaine, an anaesthetic, have been proposed. This is an update of the review of the same name first published in 2007.

Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns | Cochrane
Ocular surface burns vary in severity from mild and self-limiting to devastating injuries characterised by failure of regeneration of the ocular surface, leading to blindness and disfigurement. The historical use of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) to treat eye burns during the acute phase has re-emerged in recent years, although its precise effects on the healing process have not been proven by randomised controlled trials (RCTs). One RCT conducted in India included a subset of patients who fulfilled the criteria for analysis in this review. The participants included 68 men and women of all ages with chemical or thermal burns to the ocular surface, who were randomised to treatment with conventional medical therapy alone or to medical therapy and AMT in the first seven days after injury. Conventional medical therapy included topical steroids, antibiotics, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, tear substitutes and cycloplegic drops, and oral vitamin C. Pressure-lowering drops and/or oral acetazolamide were prescribed if required. Data from the RCT were analysed to compare corneal wound closure rates by the 21st day after the injury and visual outcomes at final follow-up. The burns were classified as moderate or severe. In the moderate category, the AMT group had a higher proportion of eyes with complete epithelial closure by day 21 (not statistically significant) and significantly better visual acuity at final follow-up. There was a high risk of bias resulting from the uneven characteristics of the control and treatment eyes at presentation and from the failure to mask personnel and outcome assessors involved in the study. This reduced confidence in the study findings.
