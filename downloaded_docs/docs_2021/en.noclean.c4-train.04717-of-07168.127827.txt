Now that you have the best stretch mark removers, perhaps we might need some more information and knowledge regarding the stretch mark.
Causes Of Stretch Marks
Stretch marks are known to appear when the skin rapidly grows at a faster rate compared to what the body can keep up with. According to research, stretch marks can also be caused by high levels of cortisol hormone in the body.
Cortisol hormone is produced by adrenal glands that sit on top of each kidney. Under optimum level, this hormone helps the body to respond to danger, increase glucose metabolism and reduce high blood pressure. However, when the level of the hormone is high in the blood stream, it reduces skin elasticity making it resistant to the increasing body size.
Rapid weight gain or loss is found to be another cause of stretch marks. Weight gain causes overstretching of the skin while rapid weight loss renders some skin loose
Who are at a higher risk of getting stretch marks?
Expectant women
As the unborn babies continue to grow, the more the maternal skin is stretched in order to provide room. This causes the skin to over stretch making it lose elasticity hence stretch mark formation.
Adolescents
This stage is associated with rapid growth. The rapid growth means that the skin has to grow at a faster rate than it can force the formation of stretch marks.
How can you prevent stretch marks?
Although some stretch marks occur naturally hence unable to avoid, some can be prevented. Stretch marks caused by rapid weight gain/ loss can be avoided by taking healthy foods and doing exercises so as to maintain your weight. For pregnant women, it is advisable to consult a doctor so as to know the right weight for you. Manufacturers have also come up with creams and oils that prevent stretch marks.
To Sum Up
Stretch marks may be one of the hardest things to do away with whether old or new. Regardless of the nature of the stretch marks, it may take some time to do away with them. However, depending on the type of cream, the time may vary. That is why it is highly recommended to use on of the above Stretch Mark Removers so that you can save your time and increase the effectiveness of usage.

Dermalmd scar serum actually moisturizes your skin as it soften’s the scars you can use on facial scars, and all over body scars. I am using on 8 week old scars and 20 year old scars and after only a week I see them softening up. I can’t wait to see the end of the bottle result. I should have taken before pictures.
