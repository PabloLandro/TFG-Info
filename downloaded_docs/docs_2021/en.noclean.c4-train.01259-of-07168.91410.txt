Can music therapy fight depression?
22/10/2014
Music therapy could help to fight depression in young people, according to a new study.
Working with the Northern Ireland Music Therapy Trust, researchers at Queen's University in Belfast set out to explore how the mental health of children and teenagers could potentially be altered through music therapy.
Typically, this form of treatment allows people to communicate their feelings by writing music, singing or playing an instrument. For example, this could enable them to have a creative outlet for an emotion such as frustration.
Thanks to financial support from the Big Lottery Fund, scientists have been able to examine the effects of music therapy on 251 individuals, who were monitored between March 2011 and May 2014. This is the largest ever investigation to be carried out into the effects of musical treatment on mental health.
Each of the participants required treatment for an emotional, developmental or behavioural problem. Doctors divided them into two groups, with 128 being given a traditional treatment for their mental health condition, while the other 123 had music therapy.
It was found that those given a musical outlet for their feelings had significantly improved self-esteem following their treatment, as well as reduced symptoms relating to depression in comparison to those who had received more traditional forms of medication.
Chief executive of the Northern Ireland Music Therapy Trust Ciara Reilly commented: 'The findings are dramatic and underscore the need for music therapy to be made available as a mainstream treatment option.
'For a long time, we have relied on anecdotal evidence and small-scale research findings about how well music therapy works. Now, we have robust clinical evidence to show its beneficial effects.'
The findings of this study are set to be presented today (Thursday October 23rd) at a conference at the university's Riddel Hall, but further research is already being planned, looking into how cost-effective music therapy is compared to other mental health treatments.
