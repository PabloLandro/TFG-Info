How to Get Rid of White Patches on Skin, Vitiligo

In medical terms, white patches on the skin are known as vitiligo. This can appear on different body parts including the hands, feet, arms, legs, face, lips, and around the eyes and mouth.
The exact cause of this skin condition is still unknown. Experts believe that it could be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system itself attacks the melanocytes or melanin-producing cells.

Other causes that can contribute to this problem are a genetic predisposition, overexposure to sunrays, excessive stress, and vitamin B12 deficiency.
White patches on skin can also be caused by superficial fungal infections like tinea versicolor, eczema, psoriasis, or other skin conditions.
Irrespective of the cause, the problem tends to be embarrassing and could be killing your self confidence. But don’t lose heart as there are some natural remedies that you can try at home to deal with this problem. Moreover, at times it tends to resolve on its own.
Here are the top 10 ways to get rid of white patches on the skin. Also, consult your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.
Contents
1. Babchi
2. Ginkgo Biloba
3. Coconut Oil
4. Ginger
5. Copper
6. Red Clay
7. Radish Seeds
8. Apple Cider Vinegar
9. Turmeric
10. Neem
1. Babchi
Babchi or Psoralea corylifolia is considered an effective Ayurvedic remedy for hypopigmentation. Its active components help reduce white patches on skin. It also has antipsoriatic properties that help treat psoriasis.

Soak babchi (also known as bakuchi) seeds in ginger juice for three day. Make sure to replace the ginger juice every day. Then, remove the husks by rubbing the seeds between your hands, dry them in the sun and grind them to a fine powder. Consume one gram or about one-fifth of a teaspoon of this powder with a glass of milk daily for 40 days. You can also apply this power topically.
Another option is to apply babchi oil on the affected skin areas and expose to sunlight for about 15 minutes (start with a short duration of sun exposure to check if the response is favorable). You can also use a combination of black seed oil and babchi oil.
2. Ginkgo Biloba
Research indicates that ginkgo biloba can help treat vitiligo because of its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. It can help reduce the progression of the disease and also induce repigmentation.
The general dosage is 40 to 80 mg of ginkgo biloba, three times a day. To help determine the proper dosage and suitability of this herb for you, consult your doctor.
3. Coconut Oil
Coconut oil soothes the skin and heals chronic inflammation. It helps in the treatment of vitiligo because it promotes repigmentation of the skin. Plus, it has antifungal and antibacterial benefits.
Simply apply extra-virgin coconut oil on the white patches two to three times a day at least for a few weeks.
4. Ginger
According to Chinese herbalism, ginger can be used as an excellent natural remedy for vitiligo. It improves blood circulation and helps with melanin production.

Place a freshly cut slice of ginger root on the affected area. Leave it on until the ginger dries. Do this once or twice daily for a few weeks or until you see improvement.
You can also extract the juice from one large ginger root and a handful of fresh mint leaves. Drink it daily for a few weeks.
5. Copper
Copper is believed to help aid in the production of melanin. It is believed that copper is required by the enzyme tyrosinase which in turn is required for the synthesis of melanin pigment from tyrosine.
Pour drinking water in a copper pot or a copper vessel and let it sit overnight at room temperature. (Do not put this water in a refrigerator as it can destroy its properties and make it less effective.)
In the morning, the water will be infused with copper ions that aid the production of melanin.
Drink this water on an empty stomach every morning.
6. Red Clay
Red clay, too, has high copper content that can help restore skin pigment and get rid of white patches.
Mix equal amounts of red clay and ginger juice.
Apply this paste on the affected areas
Leave it on until it dries completely and then wash it off.
Repeat daily for a few months.
7. Radish Seeds
Applying a paste of ground radish seeds and vinegar is popular Ayurvedic remedy for white patches on skin caused by vitiligo or leukoderma.
Grind about 25 grams of radish seeds into a coarse powder.
Mix it with two teaspoons of vinegar to make a paste.
Apply this paste on the affected area for 30 minutes, and then rinse it off with lukewarm water.
Do this daily for a few months.
8. Apple Cider Vinegar

The antimicrobial properties of apple cider vinegar can destroy the fungi that could be causing white patches on your skin. It is also believed to help with low stomach acid associated with vitiligo.
Mix equal parts of apple cider vinegar and water. Use this mixture to wash the affected skin twice a day. Do this daily for about a month. The white spots will start changing color and the problem will disappear soon.
Also, drink a glass of water mixed with one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar daily before meals.
9. Turmeric
Turmeric is another ingredient that can be used to get rid of white skin patches. A mixture of turmeric and mustard oil is considered particularly beneficial in this regard.
Mix five teaspoons of turmeric powder with 250 milliliters or about one cup of mustard oil. Apply this mixture to discolored areas of your skin. Follow this remedy twice daily for about a year for the most effective outcome.
Another option is to make a paste of turmeric and neem leaves. Apply it on the affected area. The antiseptic property of this mixture makes this a good option if the problem is caused by some kind of infection.
10. Neem
Neem is excellent for treating skin problems. It is also believed to help restore skin pigmentation. When taken internally, it also works as a good blood purifier and immune booster.
Mix some crushed neem leaves and enough buttermilk to make a paste. Apply it on your white patches and leave it on until it dries completely. Finally, wash it off. Do this daily at least for a few weeks.
Another option is to daily apply neem oil on your skin after diluting it. So, you can mix a few drops of neem oil in one teaspoon of coconut oil or any other carrier oil and then apply.
You can also drink neem juice or take this herb in supplement form daily for a few months. Another option is to eat four neem leaves three times a day, preferably before meals.
In addition to these remedies, pay attention to your diet. For instance, those suffering from vitiligo are suggested to avoid fruits like berries because they contain hydroquinone which works as a a natural depigmenting agent.
As vitiligo is often associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, you can include cabbage, spinach, dried beans, dried figs, walnuts, chickpeas, and other foods rich in vitamin B12, folic acid, and zinc. However, avoid non-vegetarian foods, especially red meat and seafood.

There’s a place in Delhi they give the medicine for free. Kindly them and get the medicine for vitiligo. It really works no jokes. It’s like mud you got to soak it overnight and drink that water in the morning and apply the residue.

I’m only 12 years old and I have vitiligo on my thys, legs, arms, hips, armpit, back, hands, and worst of all I have it all over my eyes and I hate it when people stare at me like I am a crazy person. I hate it, I hate it, and I hate it. I got it when I was 5 and I got pretty good at coping with people staring and stuff I just say oh it’s 2 different colors of skin if they ask of course. Over the time from 5 to 12 I figured out that it’s not the outside that counts and that I need to love me for who I am so I don’t care anymore I can get all over my face and not just my eyes and I would not care one bit sure people would stare bit I will just smile at them and say hi because I don’t care anymore!

i have been taking treatment for vitiligo for more than 23 years , mostly doctors prescribe methylprednisolone tab and should be taken until further spreading stops , while taking this you will increase your weight ….. when further spreading stops you can stop this methylprednisolone tab…………since last 2.5 years i’m not taking methylprednisolone tab but when further spreading starts doctor will prescribe this …….my opinion is you people concentrate on your career or job , this disease will not disappear suddenly or permanently , when you think i had recovered , it will starts appearing again , so concentrate on your job or studies etc whatever it is…………..

i had these tiny white spots which first appeared on my chin. then they grew visibly large about the size of a dime. then i consulted a dermatologist who prescribed meds and topical solutions and the discoloration disappeared. then it appeared on my elbows and later on my foot and now i see some appearing on my back too.. having read a lot about home remedies i am following the below mentioned easy remedies and something among them seems to be working.
1) mix turmeric powder with coconut oil and store in a small container. apply every night. it will stain clothes but sacrificing a nightsuit is a small price to pay. if you have to apply on face use an old pillow case or put some towels on your pillow. for faster results apply twice daily. once in the morning for 15 minutes before shower.
2) get a copper glass or jug and put water in it overnight. drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. you will also feel a fresh surge of energy within a few days of doing this.
3) boil 5-6 Tulsi (holy Basil) leaves in a cup of water and consume any time of day. you may take this more than once if convenient.
4) take ginger juice. You may boil a small piece of ginger with your tea or use crushed ginger with your meals (in soup, in daal, in curries) or just grate some ginger and add a spoonful of honey to it and consume. this will increase your immunity and give you a wonderful skin too.
i hope the way these remedies have helped me, they will help you too and you’d get rid of those white patches soon. good luck!

I woke up on the morning of 24th May 2004 after a long time of stress and a final very stressful happening. To cut a long story short, the stress I had been subjected to .. made mesay to myself constantly ” why bother?”. Anything I wanted to do the voice inside mje said ” why bother”. I I believe I passed that message to mjy body. So after joing the worldwide viliigo organisation , after so any doctorsrelling me there was no cure …. I thought about it and decided to reverse things, to give a different message to my body. So evry single day I would lie down and closing my eyes imagine I was bring a ray of white healing light down from the Universe and slowly imagine it pass over every part of my body curing it. Not trying to hide away or hide the patches. Believe I looked good. And with patience it worked. I now just have some shadows on my neck. The mind is powerful. So is faith.

OK . Noted. Things like Ginger, coconut oil, drinking water from the copper vessel are needed to remove the dark spots.
Turmeric is also essential element for the skin care.
The sunlight also required for the skin. Contains Vitamin D.

Manish.
