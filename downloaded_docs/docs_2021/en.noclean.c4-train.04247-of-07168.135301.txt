Warning
Hepatotoxicity
Acute liver failure, sometimes resulting in liver transplantation and death, can occur.300 Liver injury usually is associated with doses that exceed the maximum recommended daily dosage and often involves use of more than one acetaminophen-containing preparation.300
Medication Errors with IV Acetaminophen
Use caution when prescribing, preparing, and administering IV acetaminophen to avoid dosing errors that could result in accidental overdosage and death.300
Ensure that the dose (in mg) and the volume (in mL) are not confused, the dose for patients weighing <50 kg is based on body weight, the infusion pump is programmed correctly, and the total daily dosage of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended daily dosage.300
Introduction
Synthetic nonopiate derivative of p-aminophenol; produces analgesia and antipyresis.198 207 222
Uses for Acetaminophen
Pain
Symptomatic relief of mild to moderate pain.198 207 222 300
Recommended by many experts as initial analgesic for many patients;197 199 200 201 263 however, consider risk of inadvertent overdosage and resultant acute liver failure.246 262 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 (See Hepatic Effects and also see Pediatric Use under Cautions.)
Self-medication in children ≥6 years of age and adults for the temporary relief of minor aches and pain associated with headache, muscular aches, backache, minor arthritis pain, common cold, toothache, and menstrual cramps.222 Self-medication in infants and children for the temporary relief of minor aches and pain associated with the common cold, flu, headache, sore throat, immunizations, toothache, muscle aches, sprains, and overexertion.207 235
Self-medication in fixed combination with aspirin and caffeine for the temporary relief of mild to moderate pain associated with migraine headache.212 213 214 This combination also can be used for the treatment of severe migraine headache if previous attacks have responded to similar nonopiate analgesics or NSAIAs.231
Symptomatic treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis; considered an initial drug of choice for pain management in osteoarthritis patients.197 199 200 201
Used in fixed combination with other agents (e.g., chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, guaifenesin, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine) for short-term relief of minor aches and pain, headache, fever, and/or other symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhea, sneezing, lacrimation, itching eyes, oronasopharyngeal itching, nasal congestion, cough) associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (e.g., hay fever), other upper respiratory allergies, or the common cold.253 254 255 256 257 258 259
Treatment of pain in various combinations with aspirin, caffeine, opiates, and/or other agents.a Oral use in combination with an opiate (e.g., codeine, oxycodone) produces greater analgesic effect than that produced by either acetaminophen or higher doses of the opiate alone.a
IV use in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain reduces pain intensity and rescue opiate requirements compared with placebo, but clinical benefits of the lower opiate dosages (e.g., reduction in opiate-related adverse effects) not established.295 296 297 298 300
Fever
Reduction of fever.300 a
Self-medication to reduce fever in infants, children, and adults.207 222 235
Acetaminophen Dosage and Administration
Administration
Usually administered orally; may be administered rectally as suppositories in patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy.207 222 226 227 228 Also may be administered IV.300
Oral Administration
Swallow extended-release tablets whole; do not crush, chew, or dissolve in liquid.222
Because combinations and dosage strengths vary for fixed-combination preparations, consult manufacturer’s product labeling for appropriate dosage of the specific preparation.
Pediatric Administration
For liquid preparations (e.g., solution, suspension), use the calibrated dosing device provided by the manufacturer for measurement of the dose.207 281
80-mg orally disintegrating tablets may be used in children ≥2 years of age.207 235
160-mg orally disintegrating tablets or 325-mg conventional tablets commonly used in children ≥6 years of age.207 222 235
Orally disintegrating tablets (e.g., Tylenol Meltaways) should be allowed to dissolve in the mouth or should be chewed before swallowing.237 Use caution to ensure that the correct number of tablets required for the intended dose is removed from the blister package.236 237
Rectal Administration
Dividing suppositories in an attempt to administer lower dosages may not provide a predictable dose.226
Some experts state that rectal acetaminophen preparations should not be used for self-medication in children unless such use is specifically discussed with a clinician and parents or caregivers are instructed to adhere to dosage and administration recommendations.226 227 228
IV Administration
For solution and drug compatibility information, see Compatibility under Stability.
Administer by IV infusion.300
Monitor the end of the infusion to prevent possibility of air embolism, especially when acetaminophen solution is the primary infusion.300
Commercially available 10-mg/mL injection may be administered without further dilution.300 Each vial (1 g/100 mL) is for single use only; discard any unused portions.300
Dose of 1 g: Administer by inserting a vented IV set through the septum of the 100-mL vial.300
Dose of <1 g: Dose must be withdrawn from vial and placed in a separate container for IV infusion to avoid inadvertent administration of the total volume of the vial.300 Aseptically withdraw the appropriate dose from an intact sealed vial and transfer to an empty sterile container (e.g., glass bottle, plastic container, syringe); draw small-volume (up to 60 mL) pediatric doses into a syringe and administer via syringe pump.300
Administer within 6 hours after penetration of the vacuum seal of the vial or transfer of vial contents to another container.300
Do not admix with any other drugs.300
Rate of Administration
Administer by IV infusion over 15 minutes.300
Dosage
To minimize risk of inadvertent overdosage, FDA recommends that health care providers stop prescribing and dispensing prescription combination preparations containing >325 mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit;286 287 doses consisting of either 1 or 2 dosage units (i.e., 325 or 650 mg of acetaminophen per dose) may be prescribed as clinically appropriate for the patient and in consideration of the strengths of each component (generally acetaminophen and an opiate analgesic) of the fixed combination.286 (See Preparations.)
FDA recommends that pharmacists receiving prescriptions for fixed-combination preparations containing >325 mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit contact the prescriber to discuss use of a preparation containing ≤325 mg of the drug per dosage unit.286 287
Take care to avoid dosing errors when prescribing, preparing, and administering IV acetaminophen.300 (See Boxed Warning.)
Pediatric Patients
Dosage in children should be guided by body weight.207 237 (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.)

Renal Impairment
Longer dosing intervals and reduced total daily dosage may be warranted in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr ≤30 mL/minute).300
Cautions for Acetaminophen
Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or any ingredient in the formulation.207 222 300
Severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease.300
Warnings/Precautions
Warnings
Hepatic Effects
Ingestion of a single toxic dose or multiple excessive doses can result in hepatotoxicity.222 223 (See Boxed Warning.) About 50% of cases of acute liver failure in the US result from inadvertent overdosage.262 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 (See Advice to Patients.) Following suspected overdosage, evaluate necessity of antidote (acetylcysteine) therapy.222 223 225 229
Increased serum ALT concentrations reported in healthy individuals receiving oral acetaminophen 4 g daily for 14 days in 1 study.239 Increased AST or hepatic enzyme concentrations reported in patients receiving IV acetaminophen in clinical studies.300
Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, active liver disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., resulting from dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (Clcr ≤30 mL/minute).300 Contraindicated in those with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease.300
Sensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Sensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria, rash, pruritus, respiratory distress, swelling of the face, mouth, or throat) reported rarely.222 300 If such reactions occur, immediately discontinue the drug.207 222 300
Sulfite Sensitivity
Some formulations contain sulfites, which may cause allergic-type reactions (including anaphylaxis and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes) in certain susceptible individuals.a
Other Warnings/Precautions
Dermatologic Reactions
Serious, potentially fatal dermatologic reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) reported rarely.282 283 284 285 May occur at any time during therapy.282 Although NSAIAs may cause similar reactions, cross-sensitivity with acetaminophen does not appear to occur.282
Discontinue at the first appearance of rash or any other manifestation of hypersensitivity.300
Use of Multiple Acetaminophen-containing Preparations
Do not use multiple acetaminophen-containing preparations concomitantly.207 222 235 (See Boxed Warning.)
Use of Fixed Combinations
When used in fixed combination with other agents (e.g., aspirin, caffeine, chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, guaifenesin, opiate agonists, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), consider the cautions, precautions, and contraindications associated with the concomitant agent(s).212 253 254 255 256 257 258 259
Because many OTC and prescription preparations contain acetaminophen,238 264 265 266 267 270 271 272 273 concomitant use of more than one acetaminophen-containing preparation can result in adverse consequences (e.g., acetaminophen overdosage).238 240 262 264 265 266 267 268 269 271 273 Avoid such concomitant use.238 262 264 265 266 267 268 269 271 273 (See Advice to Patients.)
When used in fixed combination with an opiate analgesic, an increase in dosage of the fixed combination (because of tolerance to the opiate) may increase risk of inadvertent acetaminophen overdosage.265 271 To minimize such risk, FDA has requested manufacturers to reformulate prescription combination preparations to limit the amount of acetaminophen to 325 mg per dosage unit.268 FDA recommends that health care providers stop prescribing and dispensing prescription combination preparations containing >325 mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit.286 287 (See Preparations and also see Dosage under Dosage and Administration.)
Masking of Fever
Antipyretic effects may mask the presence of fever.300
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Epidemiologic data regarding oral acetaminophen use in pregnant women have shown no increased risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed in utero.300
Commonly used during all stages of pregnancy for analgesia and antipyresis.293 299 Although thought not to be associated with risk in offspring, some recent reports have questioned this assessment, especially with frequent maternal use or in cases involving genetic variability.293 299 FDA reviewed data on a possible association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and risk of ADHD in children and announced in January 2015 that the data were inclusive.299 Some experts state that as with all drug use during pregnancy, avoid routine acetaminophen use.293
Manufacturer states IV acetaminophen should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed; IV acetaminophen not studied in pregnant women or in animal reproduction studies.300
Use IV acetaminophen during labor and delivery only after careful assessment of potential benefits and risks; IV acetaminophen not studied in this setting.300
Lactation
Distributed into milk in small quantities after oral administration;293 300 data suggest approximately 1–2% of maternal daily dosage is ingested by nursing infant.300
Maculopapular rash reported in a breast-fed infant; rash resolved when mother discontinued acetaminophen use and recurred when she resumed such use.293 300
AAP and other experts state acetaminophen is an acceptable choice for use in nursing women.293 294 Manufacturer states IV acetaminophen should be used with caution in nursing women.300
Pediatric Use
Severe hepatotoxicity and death reported in children who apparently received acetaminophen dosages exceeding those recommended202 203 204 205 206 (10–15 mg/kg per dose with a maximum of 5 doses per day) for children.202 204 Contributing factors include improper interpretation of dosing information or failure to read such information, use of adult-strength preparations, use of excessive dosing because of the perception that desired therapeutic effects had not been achieved, and lack of knowledge about the potential toxicity of acetaminophen in excessive dosage.203 204 205 206
Inadvertent overdosage, possibly resulting in hepatic failure and death, reported following confusion over different concentrations of acetaminophen (e.g., 80 mg/0.8 mL, 80 mg/mL, 160 mg/5 mL) contained in various pediatric preparations.275 276 277 To minimize dosing confusion, FDA recommended that only one concentration of liquid acetaminophen be available for OTC use in all pediatric patients.275 Some manufacturers voluntarily changed the concentration of the infants' formulation to be the same as that of the children's formulation (i.e., from 80 mg/0.8 mL or 80 mg/mL to 160 mg/5 mL).275 276 277 However, older, more-concentrated infants' preparations (80 mg/0.8 mL or 80 mg/mL) may remain available.275 276 To avoid confusion and potential for dosing errors, advise patients to carefully read the product labeling to identify the concentration of acetaminophen (in mg/mL), dosage, and directions for use.275 (See Advice to Patients.)
Risk of overdosage and toxicity (including death) in children <2 years of age receiving preparations containing antihistamines, cough suppressants, expectorants, and nasal decongestants alone or in combination for relief of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.247 248 Limited evidence of efficacy for these cold and cough preparations in this age group; appropriate dosages not established.247 FDA recommends that parents and caregivers adhere to dosage instructions and warnings on the product labeling that accompanies the preparation and consult a clinician about any concerns.
Use of IV acetaminophen for analgesia or antipyresis in pediatric patients ≥2 years of age supported by controlled studies in adults and additional safety and pharmacokinetic data from 355 pediatric patients (age range: premature neonates to adolescents).300 Efficacy of IV acetaminophen for analgesia and antipyresis not established in children <2 years of age.300
Geriatric Use
In studies of IV acetaminophen, no substantial differences in safety or efficacy relative to younger patients, but increased sensitivity cannot be ruled out.300
Hepatic Impairment
Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease; dosage reduction may be warranted.300 (See Hepatic Impairment under Dosage and Administration.) Contraindicated in those with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease.300
Renal Impairment
Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr ≤30 mL/minute); dosage reduction may be warranted.300 (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.)
Interactions for Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen Pharmacokinetics
Absorption
Bioavailability
Well absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentration attained within 10–60 minutes (immediate-release preparations) or 60–120 minutes (extended-release preparations).a
Poor or variable absorption following rectal administration; considerable variation in peak plasma concentrations attained; time to reach peak plasma concentration is substantially longer than after oral administration.226 227 228
Pharmacokinetics of IV acetaminophen are dose proportional at doses of 0.5–1 g.300
Systemic exposure is similar following IV or oral administration, but peak plasma concentration at end of 15-minute IV infusion is up to 70% higher than peak concentration following oral administration of same dose.300
Following single-dose IV administration in pediatric patients (15-mg/kg dose) or adults (1-g dose), systemic exposure in children and adolescents is similar to that in adults, but exposure is higher in neonates and infants.300 Simulations suggest that dose reductions of 33% in infants 1 month to <2 years of age and 50% in neonates up to 28 days of age, with a minimum dosing interval of 6 hours, would result in systemic exposures similar to those observed in children ≥2 years of age.300
Food
Food may delay absorption following administration as extended-release tablets.148
Distribution
Extent
Rapidly distributed to most body tissues except fat.300 a Crosses placenta198 293 and is distributed into breast milk in small quantities.198 293 300
Plasma Protein Binding
10–25%.300 a
Elimination
Metabolism
Metabolized principally by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation; 226 small amounts (5–10%) oxidized by CYP-dependent pathways (mainly CYP2E1) to a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI).226 300 NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione and eliminated; any remaining toxic metabolite may bind to hepatocytes and cause cellular necrosis.121 226
Elimination Route
Mainly excreted in urine as conjugates.300 a
Half-life
Reportedly 1.25–3 hours.a
Following IV administration, 2.4 hours in adults, 2.9–3 hours in children and adolescents, 4.2 hours in infants, and 7 hours in neonates.300
Special Populations
Following toxic doses or in patients with liver damage, plasma half-life may be prolonged.a
In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, acetaminophen conjugates may accumulate.a

Actions
Exhibits analgesic and antipyretic activity.207 222 300
Weak, reversible, isoform-nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor at dosages of 1 g daily.144 Inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase-1 is limited; does not inhibit platelet function.144
Advice to Patients
Risk of severe hepatic damage with use of excessive dosages, with concomitant use of multiple acetaminophen-containing preparations, and in those consuming substantial amounts of alcohol (e.g., ≥3 alcohol-containing drinks per day) concomitantly.245 246
When used for self-medication, importance of reading the product labeling.222 Importance of not exceeding the recommended daily dosage204 205 206 207 235 238 245 246 and of not using other acetaminophen-containing products (e.g., some cold and cough products) concomitantly.204 207 235 238 245 246 262 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273
When used for self-medication in pediatric patients, importance of basing the dose on the child’s weight;205 207 importance of not exceeding the recommended daily dosage.204 205 206 207 235
Importance of advising parents and caregivers about the appropriate dose, frequency, duration of therapy, and specific strength and formulation for an individual pediatric patient.226 275 Advise of the danger of substituting alternative dosage forms, particularly adult for pediatric formulations.226
Importance of informing parents and caregivers that multiple concentrations of liquid acetaminophen may be available and of advising them to carefully read the product labeling to identify the concentration of acetaminophen (in mg/mL), dosage, and directions for use.275
Importance of ensuring that the correct amount of medication required for the intended dose is administered (e.g., importance of using only the calibrated measuring device provided with the particular formulation for measuring the dose, importance of ensuring that the strength and number of dosage units correspond to the intended dose).205 207 226 236 275 Importance of contacting a clinician if use of measuring device seems confusing or if there is any uncertainty in the proper use of the device.275
Importance of discontinuing therapy and seeking immediate medical attention if rash or other manifestations of dermatologic or hypersensitivity reactions occur.282 Advise individuals with a history of such reactions not to take any acetaminophen-containing preparations.282
Importance of seeking quick medical attention if ingested dosage exceeds recommended dosage.207 222 235
Importance of limiting alcohol intake.128 129 147 222
Advise patients that paracetamol and APAP are other names for acetaminophen.260 261
Importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs (e.g., cough/cold preparations) as well as any concomitant illnesses.
Importance of informing patients of other important precautionary information. (See Cautions.)
Preparations
Excipients in commercially available drug preparations may have clinically important effects in some individuals; consult specific product labeling for details.
Please refer to the ASHP Drug Shortages Resource Center for information on shortages of one or more of these preparations.
To minimize the risk of inadvertent acetaminophen overdosage in pediatric patients, FDA has recommended that only one concentration of liquid acetaminophen be available for OTC use in all pediatric patients.275 Some manufacturers have voluntarily changed the concentration of the infants' formulation to be the same as that of the children's formulation.275 276 277 (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) However, older, more-concentrated infants' preparations may remain available.275 276
To minimize the risk of inadvertent acetaminophen overdosage, FDA has requested manufacturers to reformulate prescription combination preparations containing the drug to limit the acetaminophen amount to ≤325 mg per dosage unit.268 FDA no longer considers prescription combination preparations containing >325 mg of acetaminophen to be safe.287 As of March 26, 2014, all manufacturers of such preparations had discontinued marketing of the preparations, but some had not withdrawn the drug applications.288 FDA intends to withdraw approval of those applications if they are not voluntarily withdrawn.288 Therefore, availability of combination preparations with higher concentrations of acetaminophen per dose will diminish over time. Some prescription combination preparations that previously contained >325 mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit may have been reformulated to contain smaller amount of acetaminophen.289 Pharmacists are encouraged to return any prescription combination preparations containing >325 mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit to the wholesaler or manufacturer.287 FDA intends to address OTC acetaminophen-containing preparations in a separate regulatory action.286
