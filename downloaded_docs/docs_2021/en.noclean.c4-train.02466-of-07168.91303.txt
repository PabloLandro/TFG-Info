Ovarian Cysts
The ovaries are small almond shaped organs on each side of the uterus that release the eggs every month during a woman’s childbearing years. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets that develop either in an ovary or on its surface.
Ovarian cysts are extremely common – and most of the time they disappear on their own without treatment within a few months. But some ovarian cysts – especially if they rupture – can be quite painful and can create potentially serious health problems.
Most ovarian cysts are a normal function of a woman’s menstrual cycle. However, certain cysts – such as dermoid cysts (teratomas), cystadenomas & endometriomas – have other causes.
The treatment recommended for ovarian cysts will depend upon the patient’s age, the type and size of the cyst, and the symptoms – as well as the degree of pain.
If you suspect ovarian cysts are the cause of your pelvic pain schedule an appointment with our caring gynecologists. Early intervention can prevent complications such as a dangerous rupture or “ovarian torsion” (twisted ovaries).

Ovarian Cystectomy
Hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, can keep ovarian cysts from recurring but they don’t shrink an existing cyst. If a cyst is large, painful, growing, or continues through a few menstrual cycles, your gynecologist may recommend surgery to remove the cyst.
Surgery that removes a cyst from a woman’s ovary is called an “ovarian cystectomy”. At Obstetric & Gynecology Associates, our skilled gynecologic surgeons offer minimally-invasive, laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy.
This state-of-the-art surgery technique requires only few very small incisions in the lower abdomen. The procedure is guided by a slender camera inserted through the incision, enabling the surgeon to remove the cyst while leaving the ovaries intact in most cases.
General anesthesia is given to put the woman to sleep during the procedure. Recovery time is much shorter after laparoscopic surgery than traditional cystectomy because of the small incisions that are used. Most women are back to work and their normal activities within a week.
