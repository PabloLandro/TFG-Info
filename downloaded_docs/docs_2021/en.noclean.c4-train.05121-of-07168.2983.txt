It is said that around 30 per cent of all people suffer from sinusitis or sinus infection at least once each year. Sinuses are little air pockets inside the skull bones. They are located to either side of the nose, behind and in between the eyes, in the forehead, and behind the head. Sinuses contain mucus that drains into the nasal passageways through pin holes in the sinuses.
Recent research has found that a new group of sugars called glyconutrients could represent the next frontier in building a robust immune system. Eight of these essential sugars have already been discovered. They play a major role in the some of the body's most fundamental chemical processes, and also have a role in keeping the human immune system in perfect order.
Consuming glyconutrients through natural dietary supplements could go a long way in regulating histamine-induced disorders and allergies, and in preventing sinus infections.
Allergy, repeated attacks of acute sinusitis or inadequate treatment of acute sinusitis combined with nasal obstruction cause a chronic sinusitis (long-standing). Acute (short-lived) sinusitis is caused by nasal infection in which the sinuses become blocked by the common cold or by any feverish respiratory illness such as influenza. Other than that, acute sinusitis may also be caused by a dental abscess, a fracture of bone in the face or sudden pressure change.
Good immunity is the basic way to fight against sinusitis, and lessen the allergy and virus that contribute to it. Consider taking zinc supplement containing vitamin C as they are useful to boost or strengthen immune system. The recommended daily dosage for the zinc is 15mg. Echinachea is known to enhance body's immune system by stimulating the body's natural defence mechanisms by stimulating the production of macrophages, the white blood cells that eat foreign particles. It also has anti-viral and natural antibiotic properties.
Preventive Remedies to Avoid Sinus ??	Vitamin A rich diet This includes mango tomato, papaya, whole milk and egg yolk. All these type of foods create healthy mucous membrane.
Horseradish and Garlic are also encouraged supplements for those having chronic sinusitis. They are effective in treating throat and upper respiratory tract infections. Horseradish produces volatile oil that works as nasal and bronchial dilator. Simultaneously, it helps to clear stuffy nose or sinuses. Turmeric is also a strong anti-inflammatory agent that is useful for treating nasal congestion problems.
??	Humidification This involves inhaling thru a hot steam bowl or vaporizer for 2-3 times a day. Adding up eucalyptus oil is advisable with steam inhalation. One can also undergo hot shower bath. Cold mist machines can also be used inside the bedroom to moisture the place.
??	External applications Hot and cold compresses can be applied to pain areas of the body. Another way is to apply paste of basil/cinnamon/ ginger with water or milk in the forehead. The abovementioned ways are more effective if sore nostrils are being pressed or rubbed.
Diet-wise, you should avoid common food allergens such as milk, eggs, corn, and peanut butter, caffeinated and sugared drink. Ensure that your place is dust-free and clean. Adhere to a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, eight glasses of water daily and adequate rest. Include lots of fresh fruits and vegetables in the daily diet.

When the sinus infection refuses to respond to medication, Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is the most efficient treatment. Prevention is always better than cure. Stop smoking, because smoking is one of the chief stimulants of sinusitis (sinus infection). Take an oral decongestant or a short course of nasal spray decongestant, especially before air travel. Drink plenty of fluids, so the nasal discharge remains thin, and use antihistamines for controlling allergy attacks. Allergy testing can also increase tolerance towards allergy inducing substances. An allergic reaction is an unnecessary, and even dangerous, immune response that should be prevented. Antihistamines counteract these immunological inconsistencies. One of the factors that cause our immune system to go awry is the increasing presence of toxins in the environment. These toxins also touch off allergy attacks in the body.

The body produces histamines during allergic reactions. Histamines are neuro-transmitter chemicals. Though histamines are always present in our body, an allergy attack causes more histamines to be released at the site of the allergy attack. When a mosquito bites, for example, histamines are released at the area of the bite making the skin there turn red and itchy. When histamines are released, they cause inflammation and constriction of the muscles. The symptoms of a sinus infection begin with headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, fever, green or yellow discharge, a heavy face feeling, etc. The infection usually lasts for three weeks or more.
Structural problems such as deviated septum, nasal polyps, etc. are conducive to a sinus infection. The cure for sinusitis is steam inhalation, nasal irrigation, hot fluids such as tea or chicken soup, and plenty of rest. Aspirin or paracetamol tablets and decongestants are some of the medicines commonly prescribed for sinus infections. If the symptoms continue for more than 48 hours, the pateint should be started on antibiotics or nasal steroids. If you don't treat the sinus infection pretty early, it could even cause bronchitis and pneumonia and damage the sinuses and cheekbones. You would then have to go for nasal surgery to repair the damage.
