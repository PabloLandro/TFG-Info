Symptoms of Fever
In fever, important changes occur in the functioning of the organism. Tachycardia or increased heart rate takes place in the beginning which increases the body’s temperature by 1°c. During fever, the frequency of breathing increases. Blood pressure also increases with increase in body temperature.
Chills may accompany any fever. It may be brought on by antipyretics that cause a sudden decrease in body temperature.
Diffuse sweating occurs when the fever ends. It is the natural reaction to the process of fever.
Spasms occur in children up to five years of age.
Treatment for Fever
As a first line of treatment, it is important to control the rise in body temperature. If the fever is mild, it is advisable to:
Drink plenty of water and fruit juices to prevent dehydration. Fluids act as internal coolants and replenish electrolytes which may be lost in vomiting or diarrhea.
Eat light foods that are easy to digest.
Get plenty of rest. Sleep slows down body functions, thereby lowering the core body temperature.
Antipyretic drugs can be given together with tepid sponge baths. If your child has a febrile seizure, call your doctor immediately.
