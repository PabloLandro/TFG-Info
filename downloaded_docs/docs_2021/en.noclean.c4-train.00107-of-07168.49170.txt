Selenium plays an important role in maintaining the health of the reproductive organs, regulation of thyroid hormone and DNA synthesis.
New research, published in the International Journal of Cancer, found that increased intake of selenium may help prevent colon cancer.

Scientists have found that it plays an important role in maintaining the health of the reproductive organs, regulation of thyroid hormone and DNA synthesis.
Too low selenium intake is associated with increased risk of cognitive problems, premature death and weakened immunity.
Scientists from the United Kingdom conducted a study in which they followed the connection between selenium intake and the amount of risk for colon cancer. The study included more than 520,000 people from 10 different countries of Western Europe.
The results showed that participants who had a lack of selenium in the body, have a higher risk of developing colon cancer, compared to participants whose level of selenium in the body was satisfactory.
Experts point out that for most people the recommended daily dose of 14-55 micrograms of selenium daily. You will enter a sufficient amount of selenium if your diet is balanced and healthy. But if you’re not sure whether to enter or not enough selenium, be sure to consult a physician.
