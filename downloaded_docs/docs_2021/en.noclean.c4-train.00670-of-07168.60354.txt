Topical creams for ringworm infection
First of all, a ringworm infection has nothing to do with worms! Ringworm in fact is a fungal infection, very easily transmitted from person to person via touching, sharing towel, bed sheets and so on. It mostly comes from animals anyway, so those in contact with stray or farm animals, or sometimes even pet, are more at risk.

A ringworm infection appears as a rash on the skin: a round, red or silvery patch, sometimes scaly, normally itching. The characteristic of this infection is that this ring-shaped rush keeps extending outwards, with the centre normally healing, going back to its normal skin colour.
To treat ringworm your GP may prescribe you a cure in tablets. For topical treatment, there are also antifungal cream that can be bought from your pharmacist. Normally a combination of the two works best.
Popular antifungal creams like Canesten Cream are normally effective in treating a ringworm infection on the body. These creams normally contain powerful antifungal agents such as clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, tioconazole, terbinafine, nystatin, amorolfine and griseofulvin. These active ingredients, on their own or in combination, are able to discourage the fungus from spreading, thus allowing theskin to start healing itself, and soon returning to a healthy state normally within weeks.
An effective antifungal cream for ringworm treatment is a topical cream containing Clotrimazole 1% w/w, also used for treatment of other fungal infections such as athlete's foot and fungal nappy rash. A 50g tube of Canesten Cream is available behind the counter at the chemist for around £10.
Other antifungal cream able to treat ringworm come under different brand names, for instance Boots produces and sells its own antifungal cream: a 20g tube costs £4.59. Also, available at Pharmacy2u is Clotrimazole Cream 1%, 20g at £3.39
Please note that this guide is not intended as a substitute to the opinion of a health professional: if you think you are affected by ringworm or another fungal or skin infection, please contact your GP immediately.
