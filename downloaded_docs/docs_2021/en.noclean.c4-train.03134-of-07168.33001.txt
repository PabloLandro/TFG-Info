Latin Name: Oenothera biennis
Description: Like borage oil, evening primrose oil is highly unsaturated (the seed contains up to 25% of an oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids) and is therefore more reactive and less stable than most other oils. It is yellow in colour and oxidizes on exposure to air and light, a process which is accelerated in the presence of heavy metals. It must be remembered that GLA is very fragile and can be rapidly destroyed by light, heat, humidity and the oxygen in the air. For this reason air should be excluded and the oil stored in a cool, dark place.
Method of Extraction: Evening primrose oil is expressed from the seeds.
Therapeutic Properties- External Use: Evening primrose oil is claimed to be useful in treating degenerative disease and is said to reduce blood pressure, inhibit thrombosis, control arthritis, treat atopic eczema, decrease hyperactivity in children and help in dealing with alcoholism, PMT and schizophrenia (the Schizophrenia Association recommend evening primrose oil, vitamins B3, B6, and C, and zinc on a daily basis). It is now thought by some that evening primrose oil is of no real benefit in small doses usually prescribed, although diabetics have used it to lessen the need for insulin; trials have shown that the oil has significantly improved sensory function in diabetics. Atopic eczema treatment using evening primrose oil is contested.
Workers in India have reported that evening primrose oil kills tumour cells in association with a marked increase in free radical generation. The oil is recommended for premenstrual syndrome, but there is contradictory evidence.
