Many people are occasionally bothered by headaches and wonder how to get rid of a headache quickly. The way to end a headache quickly depends on what brought it on in the first place.
Is it a tension, cluster, or migraine headache?
Have you had similar headaches in the past?
What helped relieve the last headache attack?
For many people causes of headaches or triggers are related to
dehydration,
high blood pressure,
tight muscles in the neck and shoulders due to physical or emotional stress, or
a reaction to foods, additives, medications, or chemicals that trigger inflammatory reactions in the blood vessels.
To resolve a headache, the correct cause must be addressed. See your health-care professional for evaluation and diagnosis.
These home remedies may help soothe and relieve some headaches.

Yoga
One research study has shown that yoga can be effective for headaches. The yoga practice included breathing techniques (pranayama) and yoga postures (asana).3 Simple stretching can also be helpful for headaches. Try doing some gentle neck rolls, stretching the jaw, and stretching each ear toward the shoulder.
Meditation or resting
Lying down in a dark room for 15 minutes can often stop a headache or migraine.
Meditation, a more purposeful relaxation practice, has been shown to reduce several types of headache in several research studies. Spiritual meditation, as compared to mindfulness or other types of mediation, was most effective at reducing migraines.1
Self-massage
Self-massage around the temples, shoulders and back of the head can help tension headaches. Massage, either self-massage or working with a massage therapist, can resolve chronic neck and shoulder tension that can cause headaches.
Acupuncture
Acupuncture can be effective for certain headaches, like chronic headaches and migraines.2 The acupuncturist will assess the type of headache with a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis, and treat the headache with needles in certain places along the energy meridians.
Biofeedback
Biofeedback, especially neurofeedback, is a technique that can be used to re-train the mind. It is helpful for migraines, cluster headaches, and tension headaches
Exercise
Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise like walking, running, or swimming, can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. Stay well hydrated after exercising!

Essential oils, herbs, and vitamins that soothe and get rid of a headache
Share Your Story
Headaches sometimes can be cured naturally. Herbal medicines can help people who get headaches often or suffer from migraines.
Lavender essential oil
Lavender essential oil can be applied to the temples or misted into the air to promote relaxation and relieve some cases of headache. Lavender or rosemary essential oils also can relax the mind and blood vessels in the head. Inhaling the scents of essential oils (try eucalyptus) can be especially helpful for sinus headaches, since this opens up the sinus passages.
Butterbur
Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) has been researched to prevent and reduce migraines in adults and children. Butterbur is an herb that can be taken as a capsule or tincture. It is taken preventively to reduce recurrent headaches rather than taking it when the headache begins.
Magnesium
Magnesium relaxes blood vessels and can reduce headaches. It can be given intravenously to abort a migraine or bad tension headache in minutes. Taking a magnesium citrate oral supplement can prevent headaches. It is best taken before bed.
Ginkgo biloba and feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium)
Ginkgo biloba and feverfew also have been studied to reduce migraines.4 These herbs are pain relieving and may reduce a migraine that has already begun.
Vitamin B
Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is effective in preventing some headaches. Research also has found that some people, especially those with MTHFR genetic variations, get headache relief with vitamin B12, B6 and folate acid.6
CoQ10
The nutrient CoQ10 has also been found beneficial for headaches. It helps with several types of recurrent headaches. These natural treatments help get rid of headaches without painkillers.

Hot or cold compress
Applying a hot compress to the back of the neck or forehead can relax tension and ease vasoconstriction. For some people, a cold compress may feel better. A combination of heating creams (Bengay or similar) and self-massage into the sore muscles of the neck or upper back can help relax the muscles.
Alternate hot and cold compresses and soaks
A classic naturopathic remedy for a headache is to place a hot compress on your head and put your feet in a tub of cold water. This hydrotherapy approach is shocking but works! A milder version of this hydrotherapy is to alternate a hot compress on the head for 5 minutes with an icy cold one for 2 minutes. Always end with cold.
Hydrate
The first thing to try to get rid of a headache without drugs is to drink water or an electrolyte beverage. This helps because, as dehydration is a common cause of a headache. This is especially useful to get rid of a headache that results from drinking alcoholic beverages (a hangover headache). Ideally, choose an electrolyte beverage without artificial colors and sweeteners as these can add to a headache. Packets of powdered drink mixes, such as those mixed with vitamin C, are good options. If you have diabetes it is important to look carefully at the sugar content of the drink.
Coconut and mineral water
Mineral water and coconut water are natural cures for dehydration and relieve headaches related to dehydration. They are natural sources of electrolytes, without the added sugar or artificial sweeteners that are found in many commercial electrolyte beverages.
Caffeine
Many headaches respond to caffeine – a cup of caffeinated tea or coffee can often resolve a headache. Cluster headaches and migraines are most responsive to caffeine.
Natural home remedies for headaches during pregnancy
Many of the natural remedies work safely in pregnancy, but any treatment decision must be discussed with the woman's obstetrician or midwife.
Non-medication strategies help pregnant women get relief while avoiding both over-the-counter (OTC) medications and herbs that may not be safe.
Hydration is critical. Dehydration is common in pregnancy. A large glass of mineral water or electrolyte-replacement beverage can resolve dehydration.
Blood pressure is often high in pregnancy, and can be a cause of headache. High blood pressure requires treatment.
Relaxation, magnesium, and avoiding salt all help with headaches related to high blood pressure.
Hydrotherapy, the therapeutic use of hot and cold, is helpful and safe in pregnancy. Apply a hot pack to the head and the back of the neck. This can be paired with a short application of an ice pack to maximize the relief.
What foods trigger headaches?

Foods that cause histamine release and vasospasm
Headaches in some people can be triggered by certain foods that cause histamine release and vasospasm. This is often the cause of cluster headaches. Foods that trigger histamine release can include:
Preserved or highly processed foods
Canned beans and meats
Fermented and aged food
Alcohol
Shellfish
Smoked fish and meat
Nuts
Beans
Chocolate
Tyramine-rich foods
Another category of foods that can trigger headaches are tyramine-rich foods. Some people have a deficiency of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that breaks down tyramine and other amines. In this situation, too many tyramine-rich foods overwhelm the enzyme and cause headaches. Tyramine-rich foods include:
Aged cheeses
Aged meats such as air-dried beef
Aged sausage and salami
Beer, especially on tap
Red wine
Fermented or aged foods like sauerkraut
Soy sauce
Miso soup
Salt
Salt also can cause headaches because it leads to fluid retention and high blood pressure. Salt is added to most packaged and processed foods so it is best to avoid those. Check labels and keep sodium less than 1500mg per day. Hidden sources of salt in the diet include
Cottage cheese and cheese
Pickles
Olives
Deli meat and sausages
Snacks foods like pretzels and chips
Sauces and salad dressings
Which types of specialists treat headache naturally?
Many practitioners may have useful advice about treating headaches without medication. That advice will depend on the precise diagnosis for that particular individual.
Make your health-care professional aware that you are interested in natural therapies. That will allow and open and educated discussion. Your healthcare provider should be able to help you make the right decisions and help diagnose the underlying cause of your headaches.
Sometimes natural remedies may be suggested. You may consider discussing natural treatments for headaches witha qualified, licensed natural health practitioner. Natural health experts for headache include licensed naturopathic doctors (ND or NMD), licensed acupuncturists (LAc or DAOM), massage therapists (LMP or LMT), and certified Reiki or healing touch practitioners (often licensed as nurses or one of the professions listed above).

Migraine vs Headache Whats the Difference
Headaches are the most common reason why a person goes to the doctor or other healthcare professional for treatment. There are different types of headaches, for example, migraine, tension, and cluster headaches. The most common type of headache is tension headache. Migraine is much less common. There are few similarities between migraine and other headaches, for example, the severity of the pain can be the same, mild, moderate, or severe; and they can occur on one side or both sides of the head. However, there are many differences between migraine and other types of headaches. Migraine headaches also have different names, for example, migraine with aura and menstrual migraine.
Symptoms of migraine that usually aren't experienced by a person with another type of headache are:
Nausea
Vomiting
Worsens with mild exercise
Debilitating pain
Eye pain
Throbbing head pain
Migraine trigger (examples)
Light
Sound
Mild exercise
Strong smells
Certain foods like red wine, aged cheese, smoked meats, artificial sweeteners, chocolate, alcohol, and dairy products.
Menstrual period
Stress
Oversleeping
Changes in barometric pressure
Untreated migraine attacks usually last from 4 to 72 hours, but may last for weeks. Most headaches resolve within 24-48 hours. Doctors don't know exactly what causes migraine headaches; however, other headaches like tension headaches have more specific triggers and causes. Additional tests usually are required to diagnose migraine from other types of headaches, diseases, or other medical problems. Most headaches can be treated and cured with home remedies like essential oils, massage, and over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn) or ibuprofen (Advil, Midol, Motrin). Most headaches resolve with OTC and home remedy treatment, while your doctor may need to prescribe medication to treat your migraines.If you have the "worst headache of your life," seek medical care immediately.
Occipital Neuralgia
Occipital neuralgia is a type of headache that involves inflammation or irritation of occipital nerves. Signs and symptoms include a stabbing and throbbing head pain, and an aching pain in the upper back of the head and neck.
Potential causes include infection, irritation, or trauma of the occipital nerves. This type of headache is diagnosed by physical examination findings and imaging tests. Treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes massage, rest, physical therapy, heat, muscle relaxants, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Invasive procedures and even surgery may be considered if first-line treatments fail to bring relief from the chronic pain of this type of headache.
Pain Management
Pain management and treatment can be simple or complex, according to its cause. There are two basic types of pain, nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Some causes of neuropathic pain include:
complex regional pain syndrome,
interstitial cystitis,
and irritable bowel syndrome.
There are a variety of methods to treat chronic pain, which are dependant on the type of pain experienced.
Sinus Headache
Sinus headache is caused by a sinus infection or inflammation of the sinus cavities. Symptoms of a sinus headache include pain, runny or stuffy nose, and chronic cough. There are many causes of sinus headaches including sinusitis or sinus infection, allergies, smoke, infections, or colds. Treatment for sinus headache depends on the cause. Some home remedies may relieve sinus headache pain symptoms.
Stress
Stress occurs when forces from the outside world impinge on the individual. Stress is a normal part of life. However, over-stress, can be harmful. There is now speculation, as well as some evidence, that points to the abnormal stress responses as being involved in causing various diseases or conditions.
Stress Quiz
Stress creeps into everyone's life at one time or another, while some people will suffer from poorly managed chronic stress. If you're suffering, there are things you can do. Take the Stress Quiz to learn what you can do to beat the long-term effects of chronic stress.
Tension Headache
A tension headache s one of the most common types of headaches, and the exact cause is not known. Factors that may contribute to tension or stress headaches are lack of sleep, increased stress (referred to as a stress headache), skipping meals, dehydration, medical diseases or conditions, anxiety, or changes at home, work, or school. Treatment of tension headaches include prescription and OTC medications, stress management, and treating any underlying illness or condition.
