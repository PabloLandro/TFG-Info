Minoxidil, Stopping Hair Loss
Hair Loss Products: Hair Medics.com
Hair is found nearly everywhere on the human body, except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Wherever it is found, the structure and growth cycle of all human hair is the same.
The medical word for hair loss is 'alopecia'. The most common type of hair loss is alopecia androgenetica (hereditary hair loss) or male pattern baldness. In hereditary hair loss, the male hormone testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which shrinks the hair follicle causing thinning hair and hair loss.

Stopping thinning hair and hair loss has always been a problem, but thanks to two medical hair loss treatments, namely Minoxidil and Finasteride, baldness may be delayed considerably. Generic minoxidil, which is available in various strengths, may also be produced with additives such as progesterone, nicotinate, tretinoin, finasteride and azelaic acid. If such hair loss products do not give the required result, then one may opt for the latest type of hair transplant/hair root replacement, a surgical procedure using healthy hair taken from the back of the scalp and transplanting it to the afflicted areas. Hair root replacement (Integrated Hair) must not be confused with best-avoided synthetic implants. Custom-made hair pieces, toupees or wigs, if worn well and cared for can also be completely undetectable.
