1. Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)
3. Bridge Pose (Sethu Bandhasana)
4. Half Lord Of The Fishes Pose (Ardha Matsyendrasana)Â
5. Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)
6. Skull Shining Breath (Kapal Bhati)
Increasing numbers of people are trying out yoga for asthma treatment at home with much success. A more gentle form of exercise, yoga is an excellent tool for asthma management in many ways. It helps improve respiratory health, boosts blood circulation, and also improves immune function. Moreover, yoga reduces stress and thus helps manage all illnesses more easily.
We highly recommend learning these techniques from a yoga expert rather than on your own – especially in cases of severe asthma.
Yoga For Asthma Treatment At Home
1. Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)
How to treat asthma? Chest-opening asanas such as Cobra Pose are extremely helpful. This pose stretches the chest muscles and clears up the airways. By stretching the spine, it also improves posture, which is important for proper breathing. Moreover, Cobra post reduces stress and boosts energy levels.
2. Corpse Pose (Savasana)
Too much stress over time can worsen asthma and increase reactivity to its triggers. Corpse Pose soothes the nervous system and help relax every inch of the body. It silences the mind and you wake up feeling refreshed and calm. Here are some more benefits of Corpse Pose.
3. Bridge Pose (Sethu Bandhasana)
Bridge Pose is another good pose to learn to manage asthma. It stretches and strengthens the neck, chest, and abdomen, thus improving the functioning of all the organs in these areas. Brige Pose opens up the lungs and allows more oxygen to enter the body.
4. Half Lord Of The Fishes Pose (Ardha Matsyendrasana)
Half Lord Of The Fishes Pose is helpful for asthma management. It’s a very good chest-opener that improves breathing capacity and sends oxygen flowing to the lungs. When practised daily, it also corrects posture and supports better breathing.
5. Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)
Alternate Nostril Breathing is an excellent breathing technque for asthma. It cleanses and clears the airways. It helps you breathe in a steady, calm, and rhythmic manner. And it has a powerful de-stressing effect on the body and mind. It’s also good for blood circulation. Practise it every day for better respiratory health.
6. Skull Shining Breath (Kapal Bhati)
Skull Shining Breath is called so because of its immense health benefits that make the face glow. It has a clarifying effect on the body, helping expel toxins thus boosting immunity. It improves respiratory health and it also increases energy levels due to better blood circulation.
7. Full Yogic Breath
Another imporant breathing technique you can practice in yoga for asthma treatment at home. Most of us don’t use our lungs to their full capacity and this leads to less-than-optimal health. Full Yogic Breath teaches you use all the areas of your respiratory system while breathing – from the abdomen right up to the neck. It significantly improves lung health.
