Music therapy may reduce symptoms of depression
31/07/2011
Music therapy may help to relieve depression when administered alongside standard therapies such as medication and counselling, new research suggests.
Finnish scientists found that people who attended regular music therapy sessions tended to have fewer depressive symptoms than those who did not.
The findings, which are published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, suggest that music therapy may be a useful addition to the therapies offered to patients with depression.
Co-lead researcher Professor Christian Gold, from the University of Jyvaskyla, said: 'Our trial has shown that music therapy, when added to standard care including medication, psychotherapy and counselling, helps people to improve their levels of depression and anxiety.'
Professor Jaakko Erkkila, who was also involved in the research, added that further studies are now needed to confirm the findings and determine the therapy's cost-effectiveness.
Angela Harrison, chair of the British Society for Music Therapists, told the Independent that music therapy is both safe and cost-effective for a number of common psychological and neurological conditions.
She revealed: 'Music therapy can provide the key to unlock a person's potential within whatever constraints they have. This research is a huge step forward which shows it should be considered as a first-line treatment.'
