Abstract
Introduction: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in which medication is the most common treatment. Concerning the side effects and the high expense of these treatments, developing the non-pharmaceutics treatments seem to be a necessity. The current study investigated the effectiveness of aerobic exercise on depression, automatic thought, dysfunctional assumption, and the early maladaptive schemas of depressed students.
Methods: In this randomized clinical trial study, the subjects were 48 students who were met depression criteria by structured clinical interview (DSM-IV-TR). The obtained data was analysed through conducting descriptive statistics (frequency and mean of standard deviation) and the inferential statistics (ANCOVA) via SPSS 16.
Results: There was a significant difference between the mean of subjects’ scores in depression female (P= 0.009), and male (p=0.021). Although there was decreased between the mean of subjects’ scores in Automatic Thought and Dysfunctional assumption, but this difference was not significant. There was a significant difference between the mean of subjects’ scores in vulnerability to harm or illness (P<0.05) and self-sacrifice (P<0.05).
Conclusion: : Totally, the results indicated that aerobic exercise can be effective as a treatment or an additional psychological and medication treatment for depression.
