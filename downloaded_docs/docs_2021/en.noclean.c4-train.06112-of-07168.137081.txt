How To Choose Stretch Mark Removal Cream
There is a wide variety of the best stretch mark removal cream products available on the market today, and while some of them may totally remove your stretch marks, there are some that will only fade them over time (though often dramatically) with regular, continued use. Each formula is different, as is everyone’s skin, so it is a case of finding what suits you best. Some of these creams may have a lightening agent in the ingredients that help to lighten the appearance of stretch marks, and many consumers have found that they are effective at making them nearly invisible to the naked eye. Others encourage your skin to heal, meaning that marks are less noticeable.
So, what do you look for in the best stretch mark removal cream? The best stretch mark removal cream products will have some sort of healing agent such as hyaluronic acid, that will help to heal stretch marks from the inside out. Other essential ingredients to look for includes moisturizing and hydrating ingredients, such as shea or cocoa butter, and vitamins A and E. With this combination, you can almost guarantee the effectiveness of the cream. Some common ingredients which produce great results are:
Aloe Vera – This is a great plant species which can help hydrate and soften your skin without blocking pores and is commonly found in after sun and moisturizers.
Oils – Using essential oils such as coconut, primrose and lavender not only give the cream a delightful scent, they also provide moisture deep into your skin.
Collagen – Lotions which promote collagen production increase the skin’s elasticity and strength, it is the most abundant protein in our body but decreases as we age.
Elastin – Elastin-enhancers help to replenish elastin fibers in the skin which may have been lost or damaged, this is especially important during rapid skin stretching.
These are just some of the ingredients that can help. There are many other vitamins and antioxidants which also have benefits and the products we have reviewed all contain ingredients which will help reduce stretch marks and scars and have various purposes and benefits. Now that we have covered most of the bases when it comes to finding an effective stretch mark cream, we will take a look at some of the best stretch mark removal cream products that can be found on the market. Here are 10 stretch mark treatments that we would highly recommend. Check out these stretch mark removal cream reviews and see which one may be the right one for you.

100% Natural & Organic Vitamin E Oil
EDITOR’S CHOICE (Oil): This Organic Vitamin E oil feeds your skin with powerful antioxidants that give you skin resilience against damage and aging. It is blended with organic avocado and other nutrients so it is not sticky on your skin. The powerful, professional-grade formula, which is 100% natural, can give you results twice as fast as synthetic vitamin E!
Vitamin E is one of the best antioxidants you can provide for your skin. It prevents damage, encourages the growth of new cells, promotes collagen and elastin, reduces and prevents fine lines and wrinkles, and lightens dark spots among many other benefits. This blend of vitamin E oil, which is infused with avocado, jojoba and rice bran oils can smooth your lines, fade your dark spots and repair your skin.
But how does this vitamin E oil actually work? Vitamin E prevents your cells from damage from free radicals, which are formed when your body converts food into energy. The vitamin E strengthens your immune system, widens blood vessels to improve circulation and smooths your skin.
Ingredients
As the name suggests, this vitamin E oil is packed full with only natural ingredients. It includes jojoba oil, avocado oil, rice bran oil, all of which prevent it from feeling sticky on your skin.
It is aromatheraputic, although you can also buy an unscented version, and contains lavender and palmarosa oils. And they are not just natural, all of the ingredients are also organic. It has no harmful chemicals and is produced by hand, and in small batches, in San Diego.
The formula has twice the vitamin strength of synthetic vitamin E, meaning it can give you results twice as fast!
How To Use It
To use this oil, simply cleanse and tone your skin and then massage a few drops into the affected areas – ideally twice a day. It spreads well, needing only 4-5 drops for your face, neck and chest. For the best results, you can use it as part of a regimen of 100% natural vitamin E cleanser and toner, as well as using the 100% Natural Vitamin E exfoliating scrub 2 to 3 times a week.
This oil can be used by men and women, however, if you are pregnant, consult your physician before use as this is a high strength formula of vitamin E.
Final Thoughts
This is a great solution if you are looking for a luxurious-feeling, effective oil for your stretch marks. Its professional-grade formula will encourage skin healing, give your skin a greater resilience against future stretch marks and nourish it to improve elasticity. However, there is conflicting advice on whether high-strength vitamin E is safe to use during pregnancy. If you are concerned about this, there are plenty of other products we have reviewed that may be more suitable for you.
