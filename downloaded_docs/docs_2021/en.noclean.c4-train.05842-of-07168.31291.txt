Treatment of Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis cannot be cured. It will most likely get worse over time. However, your osteoarthritis symptoms can be controlled. You can have surgery, but other treatments can improve your pain and make your life much better. Although these treatments cannot make the arthritis go away, they can often delay surgery.
Medications Proven to Help with Osteoarthritis Symptoms
Over-the-counter pain relievers, which you can buy without a prescription, can help with osteoarthritis symptoms. Most doctors recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol) first, because it has fewer side effects than other drugs. If your pain continues, your doctor may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Types of NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.
Other medications or supplements that you may use include:
Corticosteroids injected right into the joint to reduce swelling and pain
Over-the-counter remedies such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate
Capsaicin (Zostrix) skin cream to relieve pain
Artificial joint fluid (Synvisc, Hyalgan) can be injected into the knee to relieve pain for 3 – 6 months (Explore ICPR’s Knee Arthritis Program)
Lifestyle Changes Can Help Control Osteoarthritis Pain
Staying active and getting exercise helps maintain joint and overall movement. Ask your health care provider to recommend an appropriate home exercise routine. Water exercises, such as swimming, are especially helpful.
Other lifestyle recommendations include:
Applying heat and cold
Eating a healthy, balanced diet
Getting rest
Losing weight if you are overweight
Protecting the joints
As the pain from your osteoarthritis becomes worse, keeping up with everyday activities may become more difficult or painful.
Sometimes making changes around the home will take some stress off your joints, and relieve some of the pain.
If your work is causing stress in certain joints, you may need to adjust your work area or change work tasks.
Physical Therapy Exercises Can Help Improve Strength and Motion
Physical therapy can help improve muscle strength and the motion of stiff joints, as well as your sense of balance. Therapists have many techniques for treating osteoarthritis. If therapy does not make you feel better after 6 – 8 weeks, then it likely will not work at all.
Massage therapy may also help provide short-term pain relief. Make sure you work with an experienced massage therapist who understands how to work with sensitive joint areas.
