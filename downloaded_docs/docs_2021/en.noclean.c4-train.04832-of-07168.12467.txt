No! Don't go to this extreme! Try one of our weird home remedies first!
Nontraditional, Weird Home Remedies for What Ails You
Some people call them folk remedies or home remedies, but let's face it - some of these tried-and-true cures (many natural) for what ails us seem downright weird! The treatments we're going to talk about aren't quite as weird or extreme as the picture suggests (in fact, nowhere near that weird), but they may seem unusual. Thing is, they work. At least they work for some people and who's to say they won't work for you.
Reports of success with alternative uses of products such as Preparation H and duct tape are anecdotal, but we think they may be worth a try. In fact, we've tried some of these ourselves and have been surprisingly pleased with the results.
So, read on and maybe you'll find a rather nontraditional, if not weird, "cure" for something that ails you. If so, or if you know of other weird remedies, I hope you'll leave us a message in our guestbook near the bottom of the page.

Does Preparation H really get rid of under-eye puffiness?
Rid Yourself of Those Puffy Circles Below Your Eyes
. . . with Preparation H
Okay, we'll get this one over with first.
You've probably heard the commercials, "Shrinks swelling of inflamed tissue." Well, apparently the tissue doesn't have to be located in the hind quarters for this product to work its magic. When used sparingly on puffy skin below the eyes, Preparation H Cream quickly reduces the swelling and puffiness. Beauty pageant contestants reportedly swear by it.
Other suggested uses of Preparation H include fresh tattoo aftercare. You might find the ointment version, rather than the cream, to be more effective. The ingredients in the ointment help constrict blood vessels, which helps reduce the amount of bleeding from the new tattoo. Apparently some plastic surgeons recommend the product to relieve itching on skin as it heals after surgery. We suggest you check with your doctor - or your tattoo artist - before you utilize the product in these ways.
Note that the Canadian version of Preparation H contains a yeast extract. Apparently many people prefer this version to use as a wrinkle remover and to help heal dry, chapped skin. We don't know; we've grown rather fond of our wrinkles as they are.
Hemorrhoid Cream for Reducing Undereye Puffiness: Here's How it Works
Use Preparation H For Wrinkles, Just Use It Carefully
Order Preparation H Online, Privately
(So your neighbors don't see you buying it at your local store.)
I've read that Preparation H is one of the most shoplifted items in the country. Don't you just love the anonymity of ordering online?
So, tell us . . . - Have you tried Preparation H for puffy, baggy circles under you eyes?
Have you tried the Preparation H treatment for the skin below your eyes?
Yes, and it really works!
Yes, but I can't say it helped much.
No, haven't tried it, but I think I might.
No, ugh, gross! I'd never put butt cream on my face!

Duct (Duck) tape is an amazing product, but who would have thought it actually works to remove warts! | Source
Wart Removal - A Sticky Situation
Especially when you use this rather weird remedy - that works!
Ever have one of those nasty little warts pop up on your hand? How about on the bottom of your foot? If not on you, how about on your kids?
Warts spring from viruses and are very common in children but can affect anyone of any age. Until now, wart removal has been a lengthy and sometimes painful process, and freezing, burning, acid, cutting and paring are often just temporary solutions, if they work at all. In fact, if your doctor is honest, he will tell you that the wart he just froze will likely be back in a couple of weeks, so plan on coming back for more treatments until the virus just finally goes away.
Yuck! What's a person to do? Well, you likely have the solution in your kitchen or workshop already. It's duct (or Duck) tape, that gray roll of sticky stuff (now available in colors - hooray!) that is a staple for anyone who has ever needed to repair, pack, or anchor something so that it stays. I'm not sure who tried it first, but the duct tape wart removal cure is becoming well known and widespread - and that's because it works.
Many doctors now recognize the simplicity and effectiveness of using duct tape for warts, and the Duct Tape Guys, who you will hear more from below, also tout their favorite product as an effective wart remover. The procedure goes something like this: Cut a piece of duct tape just bigger than the wart. Apply tape to wart. Wait six days. (If the tape comes off, replace it.) Remove tape. Use an emery board or pumice stone to gently (and painlessly, kids) rub down the spot. Repeat the process. Often the next time the tape is removed, the wart will come off with it. If not, repeat again. While it's not guaranteed, reports of success are staggering.
The benefits of the duct tape treatment are obvious. First, it's non-painful, an important point for all of us but especially for kids. Second, it's cheap, even free if you have a roll of the tape on hand. Third, it does tend to work better than conventional treatments and without expensive trips to the doctor's office, and without side effects or scarring.
I just wish I would have known about this treatment years ago when I was a child and had pesky warts on my hands and even more recently when my son had warts on his hand (which he has now apparently outgrown).
Oh, and there's one more advantage. It's fun! Use colorful Duck tape cut into star or moon shapes and your kids won't even be embarrassed and hide their hands while they're being treated. Try it! You'll like it! (And let us know in a comment in our guest book if it worked for you.)
Here's a link to the Duct Tape Guys' page about wart removal.
Duct (or is it Duck?) Tape for Wart Removal and Everything Else - If you don't have any on hand (no pun intended), you can find it here.
Duck Brand 392875 Black Color Duct Tape, 1.88-Inch by 20 Yards, Single Roll
This is the Duck version of duct tape. This one is black, but it comes in red, blue, neon pink, purple, camo, and other colors. Great for decorating skin while healing warts, or for repairing anything and everything.

Does WD-40 Really Help Arthritis?
Who do you think you are, the tin man?
While some have reported that the lubricant WD-40 has helped their arthritis, we don't recommend it. This article points out that the petroleum distillates in WD-40 may dry out or even harm your skin.
WD-40 does, however, have a lot of other uses around the house and this book, in true Hank Hill style, will provide you with uses for WD-40 that you've probably never thought about.
Wd-40 for the Soul: The Guide to Fixing Everything
WD-40 does, however, have a lot of other uses around the house. Who better to talk about than Hank Hill. Yes, King of the Hill's own Hank Hill you know and love has a book that will provide you with more uses for WD-40 than you probably thought possible.
Perhaps if you lubricate the hinges on your doors, your joints won't have to work as hard and, as a result, WD-40 will help your arthritis!

Weird Remedies Really Work!
(Say it five times fast.)
Tuck a bar of soap under the sheets to help cure leg cramps and cramping feet. | Source
At Last! Relief from Leg Cramps!
The cure is in the soap.
No, you don't wash with the soap. Instead, you unwrap a bar of soap and place it beneath the bottom sheet on your bed, in the area where your legs rest. Then go to sleep as usual. But, this time perhaps you won't wake up during the night with those awful, horrible leg cramps!
Now, this is a subject I know something about. I used to have a big problem with leg cramps, having to get up and hobble around, rubbing my calf, thigh, or even toes trying to get rid of the cramp. My husband first told me about the soap "cure" when he read about it in Dr. Gott's column in the newspaper, then my mother shared the same cure with me. It worked for her and for many of Dr. Gott's readers, so why not for me?
I tried the Ivory and, whadya know, it worked. On rare occasions I'll still get a cramp, but it's far less frequent than before. When I went through a few nights in a row recently of having cramps again, I moved the bar of soap from the bed to the bathtub and opened a fresh bar for the bed and I've been cramp-free since then.
No one seems to know why it works. My personal theory is that my brain subconsconciously knows the soap is there, keeping me from doing a big stretch that might trigger a cramp. That might be right, might be wrong, but I don't really care as long as the soap cure keeps on working for me.
Another treatment for leg cramps, one that used to be prescribed by doctors, is quinine. Since quinine is no longer available, I sometimes drink tonic water, which contains a small amount of quinine. Add a twist of lime to the tonic water and you have a nice, refreshing, cooling drink. Add a splash of tonic and drink a few and you might just sleep through the cramps, but you might wake up with a hangover, too, or a damaged liver, so I don't recommend that. Since you probably won't drink a glass of tonic water every night and the bar of soap will always be there, I vote for the soap.
The Soap Cure (and more) for Leg Cramps - Hey, don't knock it 'til you've tried it.
Here's Joe Graedon of The People's Pharmacy talking about treatments for leg cramps, including our particular favorite natural cure, the ol' bar of soap under the sheets trick. Many people swear it really works!
Bar Soap Under the Sheets for Relief of Leg Cramps - Try it!
Yardley London Moisturizing Bar English Lavender with Essential Oils 4.25 oz (Pack of 3)
All you need is a bar of soap, and while you're at it, might as well make the sheets smell pretty. The lovely fragrance of Yardley Lavender bar soap should do the trick.

So, tell us . . . - Have you tried the bar soap cure for leg cramps?
Have you tried putting a bar of soap under your sheets for leg cramp relief?
Yes! It works for me!
Yes, but it hasn't seemed to help.
No, but I can't wait to try it. If it works for you, it might work for me.
Uh, no. I take my soap the usual way, in the shower.

Embarrassing Toenail Fungus
Weird treatments for weird-looking nails.
I was going to put a picture here of nails with fungus but, let's face it, nail fungus is pretty ugly. Unfortunately, traditional cures can be pretty ugly, too, when you look at the bill and the potential side effects.
The standard treatment for nail fungus is an oral medication such as Sporanox or Lamisil. Those medications must be taken for several weeks and can have potentially serious side effects. Specifically, they can damage the liver, so monitoring of liver functions by blood test is required when those drugs are prescribed. This is a case where the treatment may be worse than the disease!
This is where nontraditional treatments come in, topical treatments that should be safe for just about anyone. One such treatment, now recommended often even by medical doctors, is Vicks VapoRub applied liberally to the nails. If Vicks can be applied to a child's chest when he has a cold or stuffy nose, chances are it's going to be just fine on an adult's toes or fingers.
Another treatment that I happen to know is effective, or it was for me, is grapefruit seed extract. I woke up one night with a horrible pain in my big toe and a nail that was black with fungus. After suffering through a few sleepless nights and doing some research, I found GSE and started using it. I just diluted the GSE as indicated in the instructions, applied regularly with a cotton ball, and in no time I was back to normal. I did lose the damaged nail, but below it the new, healthy nail grew in quickly and I haven't had a problem since then.
My case may not be typical, but even for thickened, yellowed nails, I would recommend trying GSE, applying it regularly to saturate the nail as much as possible, in order to kill the fungus. If you prefer, try the Vicks treatment. All it costs is a few dollars and some time as, of course, it takes time for a complete new nail to grow.
There are other suggested alternative treatments, including those recommended on the video below (tea tree oil, oregano oil, vinegar, Listerine, and cornmeal). Have you suffered with nail fungus? Have you been treated with oral medication or tried alternatives? Let us know in our guestbook below what worked for you.
Fixing Fungus - Curious cures from the People's Pharmacy guy, Joe Graedon.
Vicks VapoRub is one of several treatments/cures for nail fungus mentioned on this short, informative video.
It's not the same video as the one above on leg cramps - this one is about nail fungus. You just get to see Joe's handsome face again!
Grapefruit Seed Extract for Treating Nail Fungus - Comes with my personal recommendation.
This is the identical product that I used and it worked quickly and worked well for my nail fungus. It is potent, so follow the directions, dilute as indicated when using on the nails or skin and, as with all medicinal products, keep out of the reach of children.
Nutribiotic Gse Liquid Concentrate, 4 Fluid Ounce
This is the identical product that I used and it worked quickly and worked well for my nail fungus. It is potent, so follow the directions, dilute as indicated when using on the nails or skin and, as with all medicinal products, keep out of the reach of children.

Or, Try the Vicks - Doctor recommended.
Not only does Vicks VapoRub work for nail fungus, try it for jock itch or other fungal rashes on the body. Much cheaper, not to mention safer, than Lamisil or other anti-fungal creams.
Vicks VapoRub Ointment, 1.76 Ounces
I know doctors who actually recommend Vicks VapoRub to their patients who have nail fungus. Just apply liberally and often - and don't worry about your liver, just watch your toenails return to normal as they grow out.

So, tell us . . . - Have you had to treat nail fungus?
Have you ever used an alternative treatment for nail fungus?
Yes, I used Vicks Vapo-Rub and it worked well!
Yes, I used grapefruit seed extract and it did the job!
No, I haven't used either but I need to try an aternative treatment for my nail fungus.
No, but I have used traditional treatments.
No, thank goodness, and I hope I never get nail fungus!

Barb, if you don't see relief from the Vicks, do try the GSE. It worked for me, amazingly well. (I hadn't heard of using Vicks at that time.) Sorry your husband needed the laser treatments. That really does sound serious and, of course, sometimes it comes to that. Hope you've caught yours before it gets any worse!

I think the Vicks is worth a try. It didn't work for my husband, but his nails were terrible and needed laser treatments. Mine aren't quite that bad and I may be able to prevent the fungus from getting worse.

Hi Barbie. Since Prep-H shrinks tissue, it might have a slight effect on a double chin. I doubt it would do a particularly good job, but I'd love if you'd try it then report back! And if anyone out there has a non-traditional approach for improving a double chin, something that really does work, I'd love to know about it!

This was a timely find, Susan. I'm gonna ditch the Lamisil and use my trusty Vick's VapoRub instead. Also... Preparation H was the ONLY thing that stopped the itching during my first summer in Florida when I had sun poisoning. Never had to use it on my tush, but applied it generously all up and down my arms and legs. Cool article!

Great read, super informative! The comedy was great too!
For foot issues all round, I strongly recommend using 1part water and 1 part listerine in a foot soak for 25 mins at least once a month. This leaves your feet super fresh, smooth and removes excess build up of bacteria :-)
When is comes to Vicks, it has so many great uses, one I learnt when one of my children were just a baby is to mix 1part Vicks with 2 parts Vaseline (petroleum jelly) for 0-3 month olds- rub on chest, back AND feet in the winter months, this helps keep all the essentials of bub warmer. If bub is 3months+ 1:1 ratio is fine, after 2 years, regular Vicks is suitable- my kids never get the sniffles :-)
I really enjoyed this lens!

Leg cramp are easily treated. I have taught hundreds the trick after working in a Labor and Delivery room for many years. When the spasm starts Do NOT point your toe or foot. It's a natural reaction but increases the pain. Instead bring your foot up in the direction of your head. Not your leg but your foot. Stretch the muscles toward you or have someone push on the bottom of your foot up. It breaks the spasm almost immediatly and if the spasm doesn't break it is instant pain relief until the spasm stops.

bananas, &amp; keep hydrated. Lots of water as not only are charlie horses from when the muscle goes from being relaxed to contracts but it can also be from you muscles not being hydrated or properly stretched out

First off, I love how you write. I appreciated the little jokes here and there :-P I'm one of those people who does turn to natural home remedies before putting chemical in my body or having painful procedures, so thumbs up to this lens!

Interesting weird remedies, Susan. I'm sure that lobotomy works wonders...

Interesting ideas. I'm all for an alternative option if I can avoid taking a prescription.

I usually avoid the doctor, so these remedies will definitely be helpful!

I haven't tried any of the weird (but interesting) things talked about here but I do swear by getting rid of a stye by rubbing a gold ring directly on it. It really works!

Very interesting. Remember hearing about the duct tape and warts. WD-40 for arthritis? If it works will they have to rename it WD-41? Weird and unique at the same time. Nice job.

@chezchazz: Thanks for those additional remedies, Chazz! Since my dog likes to each the soap that I put under the sheets, I've been getting leg cramps again and, indeed, our cold tile floor really does get rid of them quickly!

Very interesting. A few others I know work - at least some of the time: dip a cotton ball in household ammonia and apply to ease pain and swelling from bee stings. A hot (as warm as you can take it without getting burned) teabag applied to styes feels good and does get rid of them. An ice pack, cold soda can, or bag of frozen veggies applied to the back of the neck behind the ears can prevent or minimize a migraine headache. Another cure for leg cramps (in case you forget the bar of soap) is to stand in your bare feet on a cold floor. Also heard that sucking a peppermint lifesaver or a candy cane can prevent car sickness. Haven't had to try that one yet. Bookmarked this to check back if a problem arises.

I guess using "weird" home remedies is not a bad idea, but probably easier and more effective are homeopathic remedies. One of the best things here surely is that both have no side effects.

If you have garlic at home, you can make an easy Hemroids home remedy. Simply poke the garlic with a knife to release the smell and essence of the garlic and then rub it on the area where your hemorrhoids are. It will hurt for a second but it will really help decrease their size. This may sound weird but it really works!

I recently read about baby shampoo and scalpicin for rosacea, and I have to admit it does take away most of the redness. Scalpicin is hydrocortisone in a liquid, not a cream ... so it makes sense that it works. What I found ironic was that it was less than 10 dollars for a bottle of each, while the cream the dermatologist prescribed is $180 for one tube and doesn't reduce the redness nearly as much.
I had never heard about the wd-40 for arthritis, but my husband's youngest son just sprayed both of his knees and now swears by it. I still think it's not healthy, but he won't listen to me.
Very interesting lens, by the way!

Vick's also works for hemorrhoids. Instant relief apparently.

For leg cramp, charlie horse, my family uses an icepack in the small of the back. Plus tonic water if we have any.

I think natural remedies work the best, no matter how weird looks to us. Nature has it ways, and we should consider ourselves lucky that others discovered these great ways to fix our problems.
I have a similar lens, but the main focus is on warts and moles, go check it out.
Great lens! Liked and favorited, too.

I think if it works, who cares what is was made for. If I have a problem and someone can give me a remedy to fix it, I will try it. Great lens.

Great idea for a lens! I haven't tried any of these yet, but our pediatrician actually told us about the duct tape for warts cure! I might try the soap under the sheet for my son, too. You never know 'til you try!
