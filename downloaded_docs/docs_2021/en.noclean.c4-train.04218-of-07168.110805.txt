Treatments
Individuals with progressive hair loss have a number of options available to them. Our dermatologic surgeons specializing are uniquely qualified to diagnose the cause of hair loss and recommend a treatment.
Because each case of hereditary baldness differs in severity and the position of the natural hairline, dermatologic surgeons have refined the range of anti-balding techniques in order to tailor treatment to suit the individual.
Techniques used in the treatment of balding vary depending on the severity of loss and the position of the natural hairline:
Follicular Transplants - A strip of hair-bearing scalp is transplanted in the form of mini- or micrografts (follicular units) from the back of the head onto the balding area.
Scalp Reduction - The area of baldness is reduced by sequential surgical excisions of the bald area.
Minoxidil (Rogaine®) - This anti-balding drug is applied directly to the scalp twice daily. Although not a cure for baldness, Minoxidil has been scientifically shown to slow hair loss for some individuals and to stimulate new hair growth in a minority of patients.
Finasteride (Propecia®) - This medication is taken once daily. It is also not a cure for baldness, but has been shown to stabilize hair loss and to regrow hair in some men.
