Have you heard of topical minoxidil for hair loss? The vast majority of men and half of all women will suffer from pattern baldness in their lifetime. If you are considering using a topical product that contains minoxidil, we may have some crucial information for you before you use the medicine. Read on to learn more about the benefits, mechanisms, and drawbacks of topical minoxidil.
What is Minoxidil?
Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medication. It widens blood vessels allowing its use as a treatment for hypertension [R].
Surprisingly, a study from 1972 showed that a major side effect of oral minoxidil was unexpected hair growth [R].
Due to the discovery of this side effect, topical minoxidil was developed and approved by the FDA and Health Canada as a treatment for hair loss in both men and women [R, R].
Minoxidil Mechanisms of Action
While the exact mechanism of how minoxidil stimulates hair growth is not fully understood, some of its molecular effects are [R]:
Minoxidil widens blood vessels (vasodilator) in the area where it’s applied. However, topical minoxidil doesn’t affect blood vessels throughout the body, diminishing its side effects [R, R].
Minoxidil relaxes the muscle of the blood vessels through the action of its sulfated metabolite (minoxidil sulfate) by opening potassium channels [R].
By opening potassium channels and dilating blood vessels, minoxidil allows more blood, nutrients, and oxygen to reach the follicle, which promotes hair growth [R].
Minoxidil increases keratin-associated proteins, which is associated with a positive response to the treatment [R, R].
Minoxidil decreases the expression (into proteins) of the epidermal differentiation complex and inflammatory genes, and other genes like matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) and LOC100506422, among others [R, R]. Interestingly, the expression of many of these genes differs between the vertex and frontal scalp [R].
Minoxidil also increases the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is involved in hair growth [R].
There’s a sulfotransferase enzyme test that you can take (in plucked hair follicles) to predict if you’ll have a good response to topical minoxidil treatment [R].
Benefits Of Topical Minoxidil
Minoxidil has been successfully used to promote hair growth for more than 30 years [R].
Topical minoxidil is used to treat male and female pattern baldness, often used as a liquid or a foam [R].
Minoxidil is the active component of Rogaine, a hair-loss remedy which is sold over the counter [R].
1) Improves Hair Growth
Minoxidil is much less effective when there are large areas of hair loss. The vertex of the scalp is the area most likely to respond to treatment [R].
Defying a popular myth, a study showed that minoxidil was more effective than placebo in facilitating hair growth [R].
Topical minoxidil is limited by the fact that hair growth does not occur immediately after beginning treatment [R].
The growth also lasts only as long as treatment continues. Hair loss will begin again within months after stopping the use of minoxidil [R].
Topical minoxidil has proven to be slightly less effective in women, only re-growing hair in 40% of female users [R].
However, women who didn’t respond were treated with a novel 15% topical minoxidil solution and showed 60% improvement after 12 weeks without significant side effects [R].
2) Treats Male and Female Pattern Baldness (Androgenetic Alopecia)
Androgenetic alopecia, often referred to as male or female pattern baldness, affects up to 80% of men and 50% of women in the course of their life [R].
In women, it produces diffuse thinning of the crown region with the maintenance of the frontal hairline and can be a sign of increased male sex hormones. The male pattern is characterized by a bitemporal recession of the frontal hairline, followed by diffuse thinning at the vertex [R].
5% topical minoxidil treats androgenetic alopecia, with hair growth after 3-6 months. About 40% of patients experience hair regrowth [R].
3) Treats Alopecia Areata
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that can cause hair loss in children and adults [R].
Studies have shown that minoxidil can be used, often concurrently with or sequentially after another medicine, to treat this form of baldness [R].
A study found that 48 patients treated with 1% minoxidil foam showed a 38% improvement, while 47 patients treated with 5% minoxidil showed an 81% improvement [R].
Minoxidil can be used as a mono-therapeutic treatment, but also combines well with other treatments for patients suffering from alopecia areata [R].
4) Helps Hair Regrowth In Chemotherapy Patients
Chemotherapy-induced baldness can be treated with topical minoxidil, which accelerates the already occurring hair regrowth [R].
5) Accelerates Nail Growth
A pilot study had 32 women use 5% topical minoxidil on one finger each. The nails that were treated with minoxidil grew faster than those without [R].
Topical Minoxidil Dosage
Topical minoxidil works better in larger concentrations. A study (DB-RCT) of 393 men showed that those who used 5% minoxidil experienced 45% more hair regrowth than those using 2% minoxidil or placebo. Those who used 5% minoxidil also had an earlier response to the medication [R].
Topical Minoxidil Side Effects
Minoxidil may cause an allergic reaction that can lead to itching, hives, swelling, and/or difficulty breathing [R].
Other possible side effects include chest pain, dizziness or fainting, irregular heartbeat, severe itching, burning, or redness of scalp, sudden and unexpected weight gain, and swelling of the face, hands, or feet [R].
Less serious side effects may include a change in hair color or texture, dry, flaking, or red skin, and increased hair loss [R].
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or fluid retention, or have open wounds or irritation on your scalp, talk to your doctor before using minoxidil [R].
Minoxidil Combined With Other Drugs/Treatments
1) Finasteride
A study of 45 patients showed that hair density can be maintained with 5% topical minoxidil fortified with 0.1% finasteride after initial treatment with 5% topical minoxidil and oral finasteride for 2 years.
Therefore, topical finasteride is useful for hair density maintenance after initial treatment with oral finasteride, avoiding its chronic use [R].
2) Estradiol
A study of 34 women found that topical minoxidil can be combined with 17α-Estradiol to improve female pattern hair loss treatment [R].
3) Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
In a study (DB-RCT) of 25 patients, minoxidil in combination with PRP showed a greater improvement than PRP with finasteride after 6 months of treatment [R].
4) Low-Level Light Therapy
A study (RCT) of 45 women with hair loss found that low-level light therapy had comparable results to 5% minoxidil in the treatment. However, combined therapy had significantly better results [R].
5) UV Light
A study found that supplementing minoxidil treatment with UV light didn’t have a significant positive nor adverse effect on hair growth [R].
6) Tretinoin
In an animal study, minoxidil 5% combined with tretinoin 0.1% was more effective than minoxidil alone in increasing hair growth and thickness [R].
Minoxidil Compared To Other Treatments For Hair Loss
1) Finasteride
Topical minoxidil and finasteride are the only treatments that have been FDA approved for the treatment of female pattern hair loss and androgenetic alopecia [R].
However, finasteride has been associated with side effects like decreased libido and gynecomastia [R].
A study of 450 patients concluded oral finasteride was superior to 5% topical minoxidil, while the combined treatment of the two was the most effective [R].
2) Cetirizine
Topical cetirizine is another treatment for male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) [R].
A study found that, like minoxidil, cetirizine increased hair density when tested against a placebo [R].
Cetirizine does not appear to show any notable side effects, whereas minoxidil has several known possible side effects [R].
3) 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors
Finasteride and dutasteride, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, are first-line treatments for male pattern baldness [R].
However, as they are administered orally, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have side effects like decreased libido, decreased ejaculate, sexual dysfunction, and gynecomastia [R, R].
Moreover, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are not approved for use in women, whereas minoxidil is approved for both men and women [R, R].
Also, topical minoxidil can be precisely applied to a desired area of the scalp.
4) Hair Transplants
Hair transplantation is another treatment option for baldness. It is a surgical procedure that is much more invasive and expensive than a topical application of minoxidil [R].
Modern hair transplants have been able to create natural-looking hair by using follicular units [R].
There is a slight risk of lichen planopilaris, a type of primary scarring alopecia, after hair transplantation [R].
On the other hand, hair transplants are a one-time procedure, unlike minoxidil which must be continuously applied to maintain hair growth.
5) Caffeine
Cell-based studies have shown that caffeine can stimulate human hair growth [R, R].
Caffeine was also shown to penetrate the follicles in two minutes when used in a shampoo formulation in humans [R].
Unlike minoxidil, further studies need to be done to establish the role of caffeine in androgenetic alopecia [R].
6) Adenosine
A study (DB-RCT) with 30 female participants found that adenosine was useful for treating hair loss in women [R].
While adenosine showed no side effects, minoxidil (and not adenosine) is approved by the FDA for female pattern hair loss [R, R].
7) Low-Level Laser Therapy
Red light (655 nm) laser therapy improves hair density in men with androgenetic alopecia [R].
A study (DB-RCT) of 41 participants showed that laser therapy induced hair growth (without side effects) compared to placebo [R].
Laser therapy is more expensive and invasive than minoxidil foam.
8) Amla
Amla (Phyllanthus emblica L) is a traditional Thai herb that has been used for hundreds of years to treat hair loss in human, much longer than topical minoxidil has existed [R].
Animal studies have shown that amla is a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor that stimulates hair growth [R, R]. However, no clinical studies have been done so far.
9) Apigenin
While a cell-based study showed that apigenin could stimulate hair growth, it wasn’t tested in humans [R].
10) Biotin
Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that reversed hair loss due to valproic acid treatment in three patients [R].
These results suggest that valproic acid therapy may cause hair loss, which may be reversed by biotin. Therefore, biotin is only useful for this type of alopecia, conversely to minoxidil [R].
Individual Experiences With Minoxidil
Minoxidil in Men: “I am getting incredible results at months 5-6. I use the foam in the thin can. My hair looks great! Just like it did in my mid-40s, and it’s been getting thicker every day lately”.
Minoxidil in Women: “I used it as instructed for a full year. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me so I stopped. Absolutely no results on my scalp but increased facial hair. Also, I experienced nausea”.
A survey questioned dermatologists that are members of the American Academy of Dermatology. More than 70% of the dermatologists said that they have prescribed topical minoxidil for hair loss [R].
Less than 2% of the dermatologists said that they had seen any side effects aside from local irritation as a result of treatment with topical minoxidil [R].
However, some users had bad experiences with topical minoxidil. “I’ve been on minoxidil for a little over a month now. I’ve noticed that this product is somehow making my skin feel dull and lifeless around the hairline”.

HI Linda,
After believing I had hypothyroidism for 5 years, I learned that I had low iodine and hormone levels. Though low hormones could be due to no sun and low iodine. I am working internally to correct these things.
Despite this, I am thinning on my temples and it’s very noticeable. Can I ask which ayurvedic herbs you shampoo with? Also, do you make a custom shampoo or do you use ayurvedic shampoo?
Thank you
Barbara Dyjak July 31, 2017at 7:17 pm
May I ask which shampoo you use, Linda? I’m afraid of the side effects of Minoxidil, and have tried shampoo with argan oil, some herbs, and applied a combo of essential oils. Sometimes, it seems there is improvement, but it’s just wishful thinking. Laser hasn’t helped after 2 months. I’m open to ayurvedic herbs. Wigs don’t thrill me.
Thanks!
Linda July 21, 2017at 10:56 am
I take biotin and shampoo with ayurvedic herbs. This has caused regrowth of lost hair due to hypothyroidism. Adding scalp massage 3x per week to my routine was pretty significant. I never dreamed I’d have good looking hair again! Conventional shampoos seem to cause me to lose hair.

Thanks. I’ve used it for years, but no substantial improvement.
