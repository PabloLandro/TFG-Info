Croup treatments
1-minute read
Listen
Most children with croup don’t need treatment. You can manage the symptoms in exactly the same way as for a cold. It’s important to try and keep your child calm, because your child can have more trouble breathing if they are upset, frightened or stressed. Croup is most commonly caused by a virus, so antibiotics won’t work. Antibiotics treat only bacterial infections.
Steam therapy, including the use of vaporisors, is no longer recommended.
If the croup does not settle with comforting, or the child becomes more distressed or unwell, or you are concerned about your child, the child needs to be seen by a doctor.
Your doctor may prescribe medicines that can help reduce the inflammation and swelling such as oral corticosteroid medicine.
A few children with croup need to go to hospital for observation, to ensure that their windpipes don’t get blocked. While in hospital, your child might initially receive nebulised adrenaline (adrenalin given via a face mask) to relieve the spasm and swelling until the steroids work.

Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children | Cochrane
Croup is a common childhood illness which primarily affects those between the ages of six months and three years, with a peak annual incidence in the second year of life of nearly five per cent. Males and females are affected equally. Croup is most often caused by a viral infection.Symptoms of croup include a hoarse voice, a 'barking' cough and noisy breathing.These symptoms are the result of swelling that occurs in the area of the windpipe (trachea) just below the voice box (larynx).Although most cases of croup are mild and resolve on their own, occasionally the swelling can be severe enough to cause difficulty in breathing.In these children, epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is a medication that is inhaled as a mist to temporarily shrink the swollen area in the trachea.

Glucocorticoids for croup | Cochrane
Croup is common in children and is thought to be triggered after a viral infection. Croup causes swelling in the throat and windpipe (trachea) and causes hoarseness, a barking cough and noisy breathing. Croup usually gets better by itself but sometimes drugs are used to try and improve this condition. The review looked at trials of one type of steroid drug, glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids can reduce the swelling and make it easier for the child to breathe. We found that glucocorticoids can start improving croup in children within six hours (14 studies, 1031 children). The effect lasts about 12 hours (eight studies, 532 children), lessens the need for other drugs, and shortens hospital stays by 12 hours (eight studies, 795 children). There were no adverse events associated with glucocorticoids. Additional studies are needed to determine the best dose of glucocorticoids.

Nebulized racemic epinephrine for extubation of newborn infants | Cochrane
The use of inhaled nebulized epinephrine after extubation in newborn infants is not supported or refuted by evidence from randomised controlled trials. Following mechanical ventilation, airway swelling and obstruction can occur in newborn infants (especially after prolonged, traumatic or multiple intubations). This may compromise breathing and cause failure of extubation. Because epinephrine can decrease swelling and its effect has been proven in the treatment of croup in infants, it has been used immediately after extubation to prevent breathing problems. The reviewers did not identify any studies that examined clinically relevant outcomes following the use of nebulized epinephrine in newborn infants. They concluded that there is no evidence either supporting or refuting the use of inhaled nebulized epinephrine in newborn infants.
