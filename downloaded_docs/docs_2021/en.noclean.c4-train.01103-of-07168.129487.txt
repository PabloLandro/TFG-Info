Cardiovascular disease is fairly common among adults, if left untreated it could lead to severe complications such as aneurysm, stroke, and heart attack. Simple lifestyle changes including a healthy balanced diet and being active can help to reduce development of this condition, as published in the American Journal of Hypertension.
Eating at least two servings of yogurt per week was found to be of benefit to those with hypertension by researchers from Boston University School of Medicine, who also found it may lower risk of suffering severe outcomes from cardiovascular disease as well.
This study focused on adults aged 40+ who were diagnosed with high blood pressure to evaluate the correlation between yogurt and risk of developing CVD. Dairy and yogurt intake was monitored every four years from 1980-2006 via questionnaires, and access was granted to medical records and events which were reported to them.
Hypertensive subjects who consumed more yogurt were found to have a lower risk of suffering from stroke and heart attack; and women had lower probability of undergoing any type of revascularization procedure. Regular dairy consumption resulted in lower blood pressure; and fermented dairy products improved vascular endothelial function.
Limitations of the study indicated that other factors involved in a healthy lifestyle that were not assessed may have also contributed to positive results. Specific types of yogurt need to be studied further as different combinations of probiotics can have different effects on blood pressure and development of CVD.
Yogurt is produced by fermentation of lactose in milk by bacteria which causes production of lactic acid that curdles the milk. Yogurt has been used since 5000 B.C as cuisine or to ease ailments such as diarrhea. Yogurt is rich in calcium, vitamin B2, B12, and protein; it also contains live bacteria referred to as probiotics which can be alone or in combinations. Curative effects of yogurt in bowel related symptoms can be associated with these live bacteria, some such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria are known to improve disorders related to the colon, and reduce inflammation that commonly occurs with gut disorders.
