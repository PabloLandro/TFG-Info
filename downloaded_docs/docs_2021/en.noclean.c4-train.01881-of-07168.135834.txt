NewGel+E Advanced Silicone Gel for Scars - 15 grams
We will be talking about a skin care product called NewGel+E Advanced Silicone Gel for Scars - 15 grams. During our research, we gathered information concerning how to use the product as well as its ingredients, benefits, and disadvantages.
Product and Treatment Explanation
The gel is produced by an international company known as NewMedical Technology, founded in 2003. The company's members specialize in skin care and design
products to treat scars and wounds.
An interesting thing is that the gel uses only two ingredients. However, there are reviews and that show the product is, in fact, effective. However, results will vary depending on the user.
The product helps fade away multiple types of scars whether due to surgical operation, injuries, etc. The gel doesn't treat just recently developed scars either, but it can help with scars that are older.
How it works is by creating a protective layer over the skin. This can prevent the scars from worsening due to factors such as bacteria and sunlight. What that, it adds moisture to the skin.
When applied, the gel dries pretty quickly and lasts for up to 24 hours. Plus, it's waterproof and doesn't contain an odor. Though it's recommended that you reapply the gel after showering, you don't have to.
The product should be applied at least 2 to 3 times per day. It may work better to use it with an exfoliator for removing dead scar tissue.
The ingredients for NewGel+E Advanced Silicone Gel for Scars - 15 grams are:
Tocopherol (vitamin E)
polymerized siloxanes (silicone gel)
Vitamin E
Vitamin E is widely believed to help treat scarring despite there being insufficient evidence on the theory. In addition, the vitamin is suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties.
Silicone gel
Several studies have documented results from the use of silicone gel on people with scars. In one study that included 30 patients, the gel was massaged into the skin for a few minutes 2 times daily over the course of 3 months. Following the trial, scars significantly become less visible.
The gel is also useful for relieving symptoms of scars such as itching, pain, and redness.

Science Behind the Product
Here are some details on the science behind the ingredients of NewGel+E Advanced Silicone Gel for Scars - 15 grams.
Polysiloxanes
Based on research, the use of silicone gel penetrates the stratum corneum, boosting moisture levels. The stratum corneum is the outer layer of the epidermis, consisting of dead cells.
Plus, silicone gel is reported to help regulate the production of collagen. As the body's most abundant protein, collagen is also considered to contribute to the development of scars. We know that collagen is what provides the skin its structure. However, excessive amounts of the protein can result in scar tissues.
The gel also increases the levels of the fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), also said to play a role in regulating collagen.
Vitamin E
Vitamin E, on the other hand, is not well understand with treating scars. Researchers, however, suggest that the vitamin's antioxidant properties could be the reason why it's linked to skin health.
Antioxidants are beneficial because they protect against free radicals like the sun. Excessive sunlight exposure can darken the scars, thus causing them to appear more visible.
Further information is that vitamin E can help boost blood circulation to the scar tissue, thus speed up healing.
A review from 2006 details studies documenting the results of vitamin E treatment for the scars. The results are mixed. In one study, patients were given topical vitamin E to treat scars caused by burn injuries. The treatment didn't appear to have any effect.
An additional study showed that vitamin E could have potential in treating scars. Some participants were given vitamin E-infused silicone gel sheets while others received sheets without the vitamin added to them. Both groups saw 50% improvement in scars. However, a higher percentage of people from the group treated with vitamin E-infused silicone gel sheets saw improvement.
