About Beverly Hills MD Scar Recovery Restoration Serum
By HighYa Staff
Beverly Hills MD Scar Recovery Restoration Serum uses natural, powerful ingredients that penetrate deep into the skin to “flatten, lighten, and reduce all types of scars and stretch marks.” This including scarring caused by acne, surgery, burns, and other injuries, as well as kebloid and hypertrophic scars.
How? By applying Scar Recovery Restoration Serum 1-3 times daily (including one application at night), it will address the underlying factors that “make scars discolored, uneven, and rigid,” lighten their appearance, improve the elasticity of your skin, boost your skin’s natural healing process, and improve the appearance of uneven skin tone.
So, whether your scars are old or new, and regardless of your skin type, Scar Recovery Restoration Serum can help return your skin “to its normal, healthy state,” without the need for surgery or prescription medications.
Even though the physical pain of your scars has long passed, they continue to make you feel self-conscious. After all, it feels like everyone’s looking right at them!
Have you finally found an answer with Beverly Hills MD’s Scar Recovery Restoration Serum, or will you be paying a lot a getting very little in return? That’s what we’re focused on helping you decide in this review. First? The 411 on scarring.
What Causes Scarring? Can They Be Removed?
According to WebMD:
“Scars form when the dermis (deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. The body forms new collagen fibers (a naturally occurring protein in the body) to mend the damage, resulting in a scar. The new scar tissue will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding tissue. Scars form after a wound is completely healed.”
But why does this occur? It’s all based on how scar tissue forms, compared to the surrounded tissue.
Basically, your normal skin is “a random basketweave formation of collagen fibers,” while scarred tissue forms a cross-linked pattern in one direction. This is what gives scars their distinctive appearance.
Scars can be classified by whether they’re raised (known as hypertrophic or keloid scars, caused by too much collagen production) or sunken into the skin (caused by the loss of underlying tissue).
The truth is that, if you’re looking to make your skin look exactly as it did before scarring occurred, you’re bound to be disappointed. However, if you’re looking to minimize their appearance, you have lots of options. This includes topical treatments like Scar Recovery Restoration Serum, although according to the WebMD article noted above:
These topical treatments, “such as vitamin E, cocoa butter cream, and several commercial skin care products are available over-the-counter with the claim to help heal scars but are not effective.”
There are other, more effective (and more expensive) options, including surgery, steroid injections, radiotherapy, dermabrasion, laser resurfacing, and more.
Given this, how well can you realistically expect Scar Recovery Restoration Serum’s ingredients to work?

A Closer Look At Scar Recovery Restoration Serum’s Ingredients
Based on the product’s website, Scar Recovery’s lineup includes proprietary ingredients like Actipone Green Papaya, ERASYL®, and Fiflow® BTX. Outside of the Beverly Hills MD website, there wasn’t any information mention of ERASYL anywhere else online, and there wasn’t any clinical evidence showing the other ingredients work as advertised.
Scar Recovery Restoration Serum also contains dozens of other ingredients, including (only active ingredients are hyperlinked):
Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, PEG/PPG - 18/18/ Dimethicone, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Isononyl Isononanoate, Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense) Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Water, Tetrapeptide-14, Honey Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Butyl Methoxydibenzoyl Methane, Bisabolol, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sarcosine, Ahnfeltia Concinna (Algae) Extract, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Sodium Cocoyl Amino Acids, Disodium Acetyl Glucosamine Phosphate, Caffeyl Glucoside, Avena Sativa (Oat) Extract, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Sea Whip Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Oat Beta Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Alteromonas Ferment Extract, Blue-Green Algae Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cucumis Satvius (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Everlasting (Helichrysum Arenarium) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root (Licorice Root) Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Beta Maritima Extract, Laminaria Digitata, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Perfluorodecalin, Perfluorodimethylcyclohexane, Perfluorohexane, Perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Sorbitol, Symphytum Officinale Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)
Do these have any more clinical evidence behind them than the Serum’s proprietary ingredients? In short, not really. Some of these ingredients might mildly lighten your skin, while perfluorodecalin is known to help deliver oxygen to the skin and sodium hyaluronate can help reduce trans-epidermal water loss. But the vast majority of these are skin conditioning and lubricating ingredients only.
In layman’s terms, they might help your skin feel more moisturized and pleasant to the touch, but it doesn’t appear to contain anything especially useful for treating scars, and definitely none that “will address the underlying factors.”
Will Scar Recovery’s Serum’s Price Scar You For Life?
Scar Recovery Restoration Serum is priced as follows:
1 Bottle: $88
2 Bottles: $158.40
3 Bottles: $224.40
Like all Beverly Hills MD Products (more about this next), Scar Recovery Restoration Serum comes with a 60-day refund policy, less S&H charges.
In order to request one, you’ll need to call customer service at 877-828-5528. Speaking of customers, what’s everyone saying about the company behind this serum?
Customer Feedback For Beverly Hills MD
Beverly Hills MD has quickly become a popular online-only anti-aging company, with an ever-expanding line of products that includes Dark Spot Corrector, Lift + Firm Sculpting Cream, Dark Circle Corrector, and many more.
Here on HighYa, Beverly Hills MD’s products have an average rating of about 4 stars, with many customers complimenting their ease of use, positive results, and pleasant consistency.
Similarly, the company had an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau as of 1/5/16, with just two closed complaints. Only one of these provided any details, which referenced difficulty obtaining a refund.
Will Beverly Hills MD’s Scar Serum Work, Or Just Blemish Your Trust?
The bottom line is that you can’t rearrange the collagen fibers within your scar and make it appear more like the surrounding skin. So, if you’re expecting Scar Recovery Serum to magically make it disappear in a short period of time, this probably isn’t the product for you.
But will Scar Recovery Restoration Serum provide solid results with long-term use? Based on what we know about its ingredients, we’d be inclined to say that it won’t do much more than moisturize your skin. And it almost certainly won’t be as effective as a treatment at your doctor’s office, which might ultimately provide more value for the money.
But we’ve said this same thing for many of the company’s other products, and some have received high praises from customers. So if you feel like giving Scar Recovery Restoration Serum a shot, the company seems to stand behind it with a 60-day refund policy.
And while you’re waiting for your order to arrive, why not try these 7 ways to reduce the appearance of scars?
