Boil, Soap and Sugar Poultice for
April 30th, 2008
“Poultice made of yellow or soft soap and brown sugar, equal parts. Spread on cloth and apply faithfully.” This makes a good strong poultice, and has great drawing powers and would be apt to create a good deal of pain, but would draw the boil to a head. The above remedy was sent in by a number of mothers, all of whom said they had tried it with success when other remedies failed.
