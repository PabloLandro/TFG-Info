However in rare cases, the disease can cause serious complications such as meningitis, polio can even lead to death.
How common is hand, foot, and mouth disease?
The disease occurs most often in infants and less than 5 years old. However, older children and adults can still be infected. You can minimize the chance of having hernias by reducing your risk factors. Please discuss with your doctor for further information.

Know the causes
What causes hand, foot, and mouth disease?
The cause of HFMD is coxsackievirus A16 and sometimes Enterovirus 71 or some other virus. These viruses can be found in bowel movements (stool) and body fluids of the nose and throat. It spreads from person to person by touching the body fluids of someone who is infected.
Know the risk factors
What increases my risk for hand, foot, and mouth disease?
Certain factors may increase your risk of developing HFMD.
Age: HFMD mainly affects children under 5 years old.
Poor personal hygiene: This will help the virus have more opportunities to infect the body.
Regular in public places: HFMD is infectious disease so if you contact with many people in long time, your risk for FMD will be higher
Not having risk factors does not mean you cannot get hamstring strains. These factors are for reference only. You should consult your doctor for more details.
Understand the diagnosis & treatment

How is hand, foot, and mouth disease diagnosed?

How is hand, foot, and mouth disease treated?
There are no specific treatments for HFMD. However, you can still ease the symptoms until the disease end by itself by methods below:
Medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may reduce fever and help control pain.
Rinsing the mouth or gargling with warm salt water ( ½ spoon of salt with one glass of water)
Taking antacids and using topical anesthetic gels can relieve pain from mouth sores.
Drink plenty of fluids. Extra fluid is needed when there is a fever. The best fluids are cold milk products. Do not drink juice or soda because their acid content causes burning pain in the ulcers.
To avoid spreading the disease, use separate eating utensils and boil them, or use disposable utensils. Boil pacifiers and bottle nipples separately form bottle. Keep the child away from other children.
