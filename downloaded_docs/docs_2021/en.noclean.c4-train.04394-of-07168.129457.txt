Features
The profile insert runs alongside the Achilles tendon to produce uniform application of pressure and a local massage effect during movement. This mode of action improves metabolism locally and reduces edema.
The integrated viscoelastic heel wedge raises the heel (approx. 6 mm) to relieve the Achilles tendon.
Coordinated muscle control is assisted via the effect on proprioception.
The active knitted support is anatomically contoured for maximum comfort.
The integrated tendon pad is viscoelastic and anatomically contoured.
A separate heel cushion is also provided for the unaffected leg to offset the length difference.
Indications
Achillodynia (paratendinitis, tendinitis, Achilles bursitis e.g. in Haglund's deformity)
Follow-up treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures
