Home remedies for common cold
Common cold is a very common malady which affects people during monsoons. (Also see the post Beauty and body care in monsoon for a monsoon beauty regimen.) It can be caused by any one of more than 200 viruses. Normally it is confined to the nose and throat although the virus can infect the larynx and lungs. It is said that there is no particular cure for colds, they are naturally relieved within a week. Treatment is just an attempt to relieve its symptoms such as headache, stuffy nose, sore-throat and congestion. Paracetamol tablets are generally taken to get relief from these symptoms.
Home remedies for common cold
1) Black tea prepared with black pepper powder, dry ginger powder and basil(tulsi) leaves. This tea can be taken 3 to 4 times a day to get relief from runny nose, headache and sore throat. It is as good as aspirin or paracetamol tablets.
2) Camphor is used as a smelling salt in bouts of cold. Put a few drops on a hanky and sniff to clear stuffy nose.
3) Eat one gooseberry (amla) twice a day. It is a rich source of vitamin C and strengthens the respiratory immunity.
4) Another simple home remedy is milk and turmeric (haldi). Add ½ tsp of pure turmeric powder to a cup of hot milk, along with a pinch of pepper powder and little sugar to taste and drink thrice a day to get relief from cold. How to prepare turmeric milk the right way and its various benefits are explained in the post Dry Cough - Try these home remedies.
5) Inhalation of turmeric powder added to water and boiled is also a good remedy for cold.
6) Saffron mixed in milk and applied over the forehead quickly relieves cold.
7) Lime is actually ideal in colds and fevers unless you are especially allergic to citrus fruits. Dilute lime juice with honey to drink is the best application in cases of common cold attacks.
8) Water boiled in cumin(jeera) and ginger(adrak) can also be used as a beverage to clear the infections.
9) Apply a fine paste of drumstick (Sahijan in ‘Hindi’) leaves with a pinch of lime at the base of the throat at bedtime. Combine this therapy with a salt water gargle for a sore-throat caused by common cold. Also read about medicinal uses of drumstick leaves.
10) Chewing on cardamom soothes the throat and clears any obstructing phlegm.
11) 1 tsp of honey should be mixed in a glass of decoction of harad (available in any stores selling ayurvedic products) and consumed, twice a day.
12) Regular intake of white radish juice with a tsp of honey is said to be effective in keeping colds at bay.
JUICE THERAPY FOR COLD
1) Lemonated warm water should be taken internally.
2) Any of these juices can be taken: ginger, orange, carrot, radish and garlic.
These are most effective when taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.

drink a glass of warm water, with half a lemon squeezed in it,first thing in the morning every day. That way you develop immunity from cold. But it a slow process. Takes time.
Then yoga breathing exercises help a lot. They can even cure sinus.

Whenever I had a cold my mom would make me some hot green tea and chicken noodle soup always works, and with a sore throat I would stay away from all sweets, and stick with hot foods,also if you have a lot of crap in your nose I recommend put on layers of sweaters to let all the crap from your nose to come out and blow your nose as often as you can and get tons of sleep, you should be better in no time!

The common cold is a viral infection, characterized by nasal congestion, a clear, runny nose, sneezing, scratchy throat and general malaise.
For all its achievements, medical science does not have a cure for the common cold. The common cold is a minor illness caused by one of as many as 200 different kinds of viruses, including rhinovirus and adenovirus. These viruses can also cause laryngitis or bronchitis by infecting either the larynx (voice box) or the bronchial tubes in the lungs. Infections are spread from one person to another, by hand-to-hand contact, or by a cough or sneeze that sprays many virus particles into the air.

Garlic, onion, water, chicken stock, hot sauce, salt, pepper, basil, oregono and a little bit of white rice mixed together and heated to a boil. Sip while hot. Also drink water with it to avoid stomach aches. Good for sinus/chest 20-30 minute steaming hot shower. Sinus. Vitamin C tablets. Anti-oxidant. Lots of sleep. Move around when possible, do light chores. To keep body active. Lots of water and juice to keep hydrated and to flush the system.
Rest when tired. Periodic stretching / exercise (cycling does wonders if you’re careful). Good to get the blood flowing and heart pumping. OTC medicine (liquid Nyquil) to get better sleep.
These won’t get rid of the cold right away, but they will help the body stay stronger longer to fight it better and faster. It sure makes me feel better longer and I don’t exhibit as many symptons.

Lady's fingers are highly valuable in treating irritation of the throat and a persistent dry cough. This vegetable is rich in mucilage and acts as a drug to allay irritation, swelling, and pain. About 100 gm of lady's fingers should be cut into pieces, and boiled down in half a litre of water to make a decoction. The steam issuing from this decoction may also be inhaled once or twice a day to relieve throat irritation and a dry cough.

6 pcs. Chicken 1 cup soy sauce 1 cup white vinegar 6″ piece fresh ginger root, peeled and sliced thin 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 or 3 tablespoons brown sugar
Combine all ingredients in a casserole and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 5 minutes.

: filipendula flowers. It's a great antiviral agent, so it not only cures but also prevents cold sores, since herpes is a virus. I just pour some boiled water over a tablespoon of flowers and drink it as tea - it smells like honey, and tastes pretty good too. And you can also dip a cotton swab in it and apply to the cold sore, it will help you get rid of it faster. I used to have cold sores every three month - and up until noe did not have a single one since last july. Sounds unbelievable, but worth trying!

A good thing that can help is to sweat it out. Cover yourself with a thick cover/blanket and sweat. Don't take off the covers just to get some cold air otherwise it won't work. Just stay beneath them and sweat. Make sure you wipe your sweat though or have a towel behind your back and neck.

I made a tea of eucalyptus leaves. Fill an empty tea bag with 1 tbsp of crushed, dried leaves, place in hot (not boiling) water and cover for about 5-10 minutes. Try to inhale the steam afterward (great for a sore throat, mind you). Drink this over maybe a course of 2 or so days, but do NOT ingest the leaves themselves as this can be poisonous

Common cold symptoms are usually treated with bed-rest and symptomatic medication until the immune system overcomes the infection. Unfortunately, traditional medications often come with unwanted side-effects.
Antibiotics are not effective against viruses and only help in the case of secondary infections. They also rob the body of important "good" bacteria. All natural cold medicine can provide safe and effective herbal cold relief.
A popular homeopathic cold remedy is chicken soup.

Once you come down with the sickness, rest and fluids is the only way I know of. Personally, I've found that a cold usually starts with a sore throat, and a salt water gargle (i.e. very salty, like seawater) helps stop the cold in the beginning. It might still help because you have a sore throat; scientifically it makes sense because salt water would dehydrate the virus, making it easier for your body's immune system to kill.

An almost sure fire way to ward off and beat a cold, congestion and sore throat before they can get a grip is to take lots of colloidal silver, echinacea, and vitamin C along with some olive oil extract capsules. Gargle with the colloidal silver before swallowing - and it is best to have the echinacea in extract form so you can gargle with it too, but capsules will do (if you use capsules take 3 capsules 3 times a day at the first signs of a cold).

Eucalyptus is a main ingredient in many of the vapor rubs on the market. But if you can't use them for some reason or another (allergic to the other ingredients or something) then you can use the following substitutes:
burning eucalyptus scented incense. if you can't burn incense due to breathing issues or just don't want the smoke around you can make a spray. using eucalyptus essential oil in a basic room/linnen spray is quite easy. depending on the size of the spray bottle, you'll need only about 3-6 drops of oil. fill the rest of the bottle with water, and spray around room as needed. it is completely safe to spray on clothing and pillows as well. not only does the scent open up your sinuses, but it also lends a nice clean scent to the air that others can benefit from as well.

onion is a great natural decongestant. Put a couple slices of raw onion on a small plate and keep it next to you until the onions stop stinking. Throw them away and get a couple new slices to replace them. That will keep your head clear. You may smell like you need a shower, but you'll be able to smell, too.

drink lots of orange juice. Echinacia pills helps to prevent you from getting the cold but if you've already got it it won't do much. Get plenty of sleep, that helps aswell

Rest, sleep well, eat healthy foods that are light and nourishing, take some cold medicine to manage the worst of the symptoms and rest. Yes, I said it twice. There are no set time limits for cold treatment, your immune system will fight it in it's own time.

Ice a little bit if lemon juice with the lemon, a little bit o lime juice with the lime and a little bit of marichimo cherry juice with the cherries. Stir and drink all of it. Sit in a steamy room too and rest.

I'd drink a glass of hot water with the juice of three lemons and two pinches of salt mixed in and go to bed immediately. You will immediately begin to sweat and within two hours feel very much better. It'll be a tough swallow but its been working for me for 50 years.

Garlic soup is an old remedy to reduce the severity of a cold, and should be taken once daily. The soup can be prepared by boiling three or four cloves of chopped garlic in a cup of water. Garlic contains antiseptic and antispasmodic properties, besides several other medicinal virtues.

he body is self-healing and will recover naturally from a cold.
This is how alt-med works - by giving pills for things which your body recovers naturally from anyway, and then taking the credit.

Eat more foods rich in vitamin C ~ in particular, limes and lemons, also oranges, strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes, leafy and green vegies, red and green peppers♥
vitamin C will bolster your immunity and help to torch those nasty cold and flu germs♥

That's normal with a cold, because more mucus is lining your throat and nose, and you might have a little mucus in your lungs too. Just take it easy, don't push yourself too hard so your body has a chance to fight the cold.

Try gargling with golden seal tea,
Sage is another good choice for a sore throat
Raw garlic is the most effective
Take two or more cloves, crushed or whole, at the first sign of a sore throat and continue eating two or more cloves until your symptoms clear up

You can try a simple breathing technique ,that involves holding your breath and altering the way you breathe. It clears the nose in 3 or 4 minutes.
It sounds simple but it does work. The idea is that carbon dioxide is a natural dilator of the smooth muscle tissue in the body and by increasing your CO2 in your system you open up the airways.

When you have the cold, as the name suggests, your internal body is "cold" so you need to keep warm, and take food that heats up your body. During a cold, try to avoid fruit juice

One of the things that you should do when you have a cold is clean your tongue. The cold germs will also collect on the surface of your tongue and continue to infect your body. In addition, you need to know the real cause of bad breath:

A first indication that you've contacted a virus, like sniffles, sorethroat, etc., chop very fine one clove of fresh garlic, place on a teaspoon, slide it off with your upper lip, and chase down with a half cup of water. The symptoms will be gone in a few hours.
