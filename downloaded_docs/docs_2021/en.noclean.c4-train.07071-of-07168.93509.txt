Dewi:
“Most people past the age of 30 will start to experience skin pigmentation or discoloration, a result from years of UV damage, harsh skin treatments, or skin disorders. To help combat hyperpigmentation and scars, I have combined high-performing ingredients for askin-brightening-correcting Vitamin C serum. This serum also works amazingly in stimulating collagen synthesis, so if you’re concerned about sagging and uneven skin, this is the serum I’ve created for you.”
About:
Our best-selling product, this advanced multi-action serum treatment is created with skin-brightening, pigment-lightening and anti-aging botanical extracts, actives and powerful doses of vitamin C to target uneven skin tone with spots, scars or other types of hyperpigmentation. It reverses discoloration to restore a youthful radiance and suppleness to the skin (vitamin C has been clinically proven to visibly brighten dull and pigmented skin).
This treatment works in a three-step approach: Brighten, Regenerate and Protect. Working at the surface, it Brightens as it lightens scars and discoloration, revealing the skin’s natural clarity. On the epidermal level, vitamin C activates collagen Regeneration within the skin cells and recovers the skin’s elasticity and resilience, resulting in a youthful radiance that glows from within. Simultaneously, the treatment Protects your skin by defending against future pigmentation issues and collagen degradation.
This formula is suitable for all skin types.
