Deal With Hemorrhoid By Using This Advice
External hemorrhoids often appear beneath the skin surrounding the anus, and internal ones are commonly found within the rectum. External hemorrhoids are far more painful than internal ones, but there are methods for dealing with both. Read this article to learn more about different treatments you can try.
One of the best and most effective solutions to get long-term hemorrhoid relief, is to add more fiber to your diet on a daily basis. For example, you can enjoy healthy, high-fiber foods like apples, dark leafy greens, whole grains and even oatmeal. Fiber in your diet can encourage spontaneous activity of the bowels and prevent the need for straining.
If hemorrhoids are a problem for you, keeping the anal area clean is very important. Specially-designed hemorrhoid wipes are usually more sanitary than toilet paper, not to mention more comfortable. A sitz bath at a lukewarm temperature will help reduce the swelling and irritation of hemorrhoids. Soak the area for 20 minutes or more.
Proper Absorption
If you have hemorrhoids, try taking Rutin. Weak blood vessels can contribute to hemorrhoids. The proper absorption of Vitamin C is essential for maintaining strong, healthy blood vessels and the flavonoid Rutin is essential for proper absorption. Rutin is found naturally in citrus fruits, broccoli and onions. Take 500mg of rutin every day.
Ice and heat applications can ease hemorrhoid pain. Switching between the heat and the ice will help shrink your hemorrhoid and help heal it. A 10 minute application of ice can be followed by 20 minutes with a moist heat application for maximum results.
Consider using witch hazel as a treatment for discomfort and pain. Witch hazel relieves pain because it shrinks hemorrhoid tissue. You can easily apply a cotton ball or pad soaked in witch hazel to the affected area for 5 minutes. A few drops in a sitz bath may also help.
When you are dealing with hemorrhoids, take care to not use any personal products which have fragrances, oils or dyes in them, near the affected area. Exposing these tissues can cause painful stinging and more forceful itching and swelling sensations.
Drink lemon water to help ease your hemorrhoids. Lemon offers soothing properties and can lessen any irritation caused by hemorrhoids. You’ll feel better if you drink lots of lemon water.
Before you turn to a doctor for a prescription to treat hemorrhoids, try implementing home remedies. A sitz bath is particularly beneficial after a bowel movement. Hemorrhoids can be quite itchy, but you want to avoid scratching because this will just aggravate the area more. Instead, dampen some pads with witch hazel and apply them to the hemorrhoids for temporary relief! Eat tons of food with fiber, and make sure you drink at least eight cups of water each day. This helps to maintain soft, regular bowel movements.
Excess Weight
Losing excess weight is a great way to reduce hemorrhoid pain. Being overweight increases the likelihood of developing hemorrhoids and makes the experience of them more unpleasant. The pressure that is on your abdomen from the excess weight and waste can boost pressure on your anal veins. Make sure your diet plan includes a lot of fiber so that you can relieve some of this pressure. Remember, don’t be tempted to speed your weight loss or deal with your hemorrhoids by using laxatives.
Hemorrhoids are the usual suspect, but a trip to the doctor is wise just to make sure. Other serious conditions, such as cancer, can cause bleeding. Put your mind at ease by having the problem diagnosed. If it does end up being hemorrhoids, your physician can direct you towards the best treatment options.
Laxatives can offer temporary relief, but they aren’t a long-term solution. While laxatives can help to ease the discomfort of one rough patch, making a bowel movement easier, it is only a temporary solution. An improved diet, or even surgery, may be needed to cure a hemorrhoid problem.
External Hemorrhoids
The article here gives you an understanding of hemorrhoids of different types people suffer from. External hemorrhoids are supposedly more painful, but both internal and external hemorrhoids require preventative treatments in order to deal successfully with them. You can seek relief from hemorrhoids by using the advice from this article.

A simple remedy you can use at home is applying ice, then heat. This has the effect of shrinking the hemorrhoid. You should start with ice, applied for about 10 minutes per day, then switch to a moist heat, which you should leave on for around 20 minutes.
When you are treating hemorrhoids, it is important to use hygiene products that are free of dyes, essential oils and fragrances. These substances could cause a burning, stinging or itching sensation on those already sensitive areas.
Ice Pack
To get relief from hemorrhoids, apply ice to the affected area. Hemorrhoids usually involve a lot of discomfort and pain. Take an ice pack and apply it to the inflamed area in order to reduce the amount of swelling and minimize the pain. Alternate between an ice pack and a warm compress. Soaking in a lukewarm tub and then switching to a cold compress, is a good way to ameliorate the discomfort and swelling caused by hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids are a lot like chicken pox in that they can make you crazy trying to avoid scratching them. No matter how much you want to scratch, you should resist the temptation in order to avoid opening the hemorrhoid. If your hemorrhoids are torn open, they will be far more painful, and it will greatly increase your risk of contracting bacterial infections.
Frequent heavy lifting is a little-known potential cause of hemorrhoids. Lifting puts undue strain on your rectal area. If you find that you are having regular occurrences with hemorrhoids you really should consider finding a way to avoid heavy lifting altogether.
If hemorrhoids are causing you great distress, it is important not to rely on laxative drugs to solve constipation. These medications are developed to help you with one bowel movement. If you find that you are having issues with bowel movements and regularity, change your diet.
To rid yourself of hemorrhoids, lose weight. If you are overweight, you can experience more issues with hemorrhoids. Intense pressure on your lower abdomen that is caused by excess waste and weight adds to the pressure on the veins around your anus. Make sure your diet plan includes a lot of fiber so that you can relieve some of this pressure. Remember, don’t be tempted to speed your weight loss or deal with your hemorrhoids by using laxatives.

Most hemorrhoids cases are easily treated from the comfort and privacy of your home. As people learn more about the causes of hemorrhoids, and couple the knowledge with home treatment, most can manage to reduce the painful effects.
