Fight Cold and Flu’s with the Powerful Vitamin-C
Top 5 Health Benefits of Vitamin C
Did you know that vitamin C keeps you fit and healthy? Also referred to as ascorbic acid, it supports tissue growth and repair, boosts immunity, and speeds up wound healing. This nutrient also regulates energy metabolism and helps your body absorb iron from foods. Its beneficial effects on immune function are well-researched.
Here is why you need vitamin C in your diet:
Promotes Cardiovascular Health †
Recent studies indicate that vitamin C impacts blood pressure, cardiac function, cholesterol levels, and other aspects of cardiovascular health. This nutrient has been shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative damage, prevent atherosclerosis, and lower the risk of stroke and heart attack. It also helps maintain vascular integrity and improves blood lipid profiles.
Improves Circulation †
Daily vitamin C supplementation may be as helpful to your heart as walking. According to science, ascorbic acid inhibits the release of endothelin-1, a protein that supports the constriction of small blood vessels. Obese and overweight individuals have higher endothelin-1 levels compared to healthy individuals. Taking vitamin C regularly may help improve circulation, boost cardiovascular health, and prevent early death.
Relieves Flu and Cold Symptoms †
Even though there is no evidence that vitamin C prevents the common cold, it does help relieve its symptoms. Ascorbic acid fights free radicals and boosts iron absorption, which helps strengthen your immune system. This increases your body's resistance to infections, cold, flu, and contagious diseases. Researchers have also found that vitamin C can make cold medications more effective.
Stimulates Collagen Production †
This nutrient is a key ingredient in anti-aging creams and body lotions. In addition to its strong antioxidant effects, vitamin C promotes collagen synthesis and keeps your skin young. As you age, your collagen levels drop. This causes your skin to lose its elasticity and firmness. Over time, it leads to the formation of wrinkles and fine lines. Vitamin C can help slow down aging and restore your complexion.
Prevents Arthritis †
Due to its role in collagen synthesis, ascorbic acid prevents arthritis and keeps your joints strong. Low collagen levels increase your risk of inflammatory disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. Your body uses this protein to build tendons, ligaments, scar tissue, and skin. Vitamin C supports these processes by keeping your collagen levels up.
Deficiency Warning Signs
The recommended daily dose of vitamin C is 75 to 90 milligrams. However, some experts recommend up to 1,000 milligrams a day. Since your body can not produce this nutrient on its own, you must get it from food and supplements. Vitamin C deficiency may cause: †
Joint and muscle aches
Fatigue
Recurring infections
Gum disorders
Scurvy
Impaired immune function
From children and teens to elderly, everyone needs vitamin C. This nutrient accelerates recovery from training, supports protein metabolism, and helps your body fight all sorts of diseases, such as cancer and endometriosis. Make sure you also eat foods rich in vitamin C, such as berries, pineapple, red cabbage, citrus fruits, mango, and broccoli.
