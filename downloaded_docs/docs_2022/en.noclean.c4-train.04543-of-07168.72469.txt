Remove Skin Tags At Home Fast- Here’s The Top 16 Picks
Watta Life :) Wattalyf June 20, 2018 0
Do you have skin tags (acrochordons) or those small, soft and flesh- colored growths in the skin? Don’t worry, they can develop on anyone, anywhere, and at any time. They are harmless and generally grow in body folds and can occur all over the body. The most likely locations include neck groin folds, under breasts, and underarm/armpits. They can also grow on the eyelids or under the folds of the buttocks.
Skin tags and many warts are similar in that they extend beyond or above the skin. But how to tell the difference between skin tag or wart?
• Skin tags can’t spread to other parts of the body or other people; warts, however, are contagious.
• Skin tags are smooth and soft, while warts tend to be rougher with an irregular surface.
• Skin tags are knobby and hang off the skin, while warts are usually flat.
Who are more at risk of developing them?
 Individuals who are overweight/ obese
 Women who are pregnant
 People with diabetes
Are they contagious?
No. There is not strong evidence to suggest that common skin tags are contagious. People do not catch them from anyone and do not transmit it to anyone, unlike warts that are caused by a virus called HPV and are known to be very contagious.
Are they a sign of cancer?
There’s no reason to worry about skin tags. Although they are considered tumors but they are rarely malignant. They don’t usually cause pain or discomfort. They’re not cancerous and they don’t increase the risk of any kind of cancer.
Do you need to remove skin tags?
Skin tags are harmless and most people don’t need any treatment for them. However, you may want to consider getting them removed if they are already irritating, unsightly and almost affecting your self-esteem. Watch the video below to see the plenty of great options to remove skin tag fast at home without spending much money.
