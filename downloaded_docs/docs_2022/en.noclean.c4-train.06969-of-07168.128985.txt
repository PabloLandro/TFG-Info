Anal bleaching has become a very popular treatment because of dark spots and pigmented skin around the anus. Most people find it as a problem that they can not live with. Some salons now offer the treatment and now the availability of safe and effective products to bleach your anus. Here are the Four ways anal bleaching is done.
Various ways of Anal Skin Bleaching
Using reliable skin lightening product
When using any skin lightening product we always recommend doing your careful research into the ingredients. Many prescribed skin lightening products in the USA still contain hydroquinone as the main active ingredient. Hydroquinone has been banned in products by the European Union, and the FDA has also stated that it can not be ruled out like a cancerous agent. I highly recommend avoiding any products that contain hydroquinone.
Dermatologist anal bleaching
Doing a consultation with a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon is crucial.They are in a position to provide the right action to take in order to have bleached anus. They are also in a position to prescribe the best medical solution to bleach the anus. Such may include creams that may be used for anal bleaching. These won’t affect you as your dermatologist has approved them.
Skin Bleaching Creams
Bleaching creams have been used for a couple of decades on other parts of the body like face, hands and legs. Similarly, one may use some mild cream for bleaching the bum. It must contain 2% hydroquinone only. It must be mild as you are using it on the delicate area. Sunblock lotions usually compliment the skin lightening creams, and consequently, they are the best recommended. The night formula is common as people do not have a lot of movement and hence one of the best. You must apply them twice every day. After the skin tone gets light and smooth, then you can discontinue using them.
Anal Bleaching At Home
Annal bleaching at home is now a far less complicated process that requires care following of instructions, though. The first step is to acquire an anal bleaching cream. The hair type needs to shave the skin so that the cream may penetrate into the cells. Washing the anus with warm water is recommended, then drying the surface before applying the cream. Care must be taken to ensure that there is no infection to this delicate are during this bleaching process. Any form of infection must be treated with immediate effect.
