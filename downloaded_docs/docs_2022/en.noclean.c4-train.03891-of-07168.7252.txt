Why do females have urinary tract infections (utis) more often than men?
Mazin Albert Dr. Albert
8 doctors agreed:

A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria to travel up the urethra to the bladder. The urethra in a female is also closer to the rectum allowing for a shorter distance for bacteria to travel. This is why proper hygiene is recommended for females to prevent uti. ...Read more

Urinating before and after intercourse helps to decrease risk of uti. Cranberry juice and increasing water intake may help prevent bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall. Recurrence may indicate anatomical or medical (diabetes, hiv, etc) problems and warrant a work up. ...Read more
