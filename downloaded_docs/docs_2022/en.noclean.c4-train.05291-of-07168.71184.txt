West Virginia: Freedom Industries Chemical Spill Triggers Tap Water Ban For Up To 300,000 Residents
January 10, 2014 by Infinite
– West Virginia chemical spill triggers widespread tap water ban (Reuters, Jan 10, 2014):
Up to 300,000 residents in West Virginia were left without tap water on Friday after a chemical spill that forced the closure of schools and business in the state capital and led the federal government to declare a disaster.
Health officials advised residents to use tap water only for flushing toilets and fighting fires and the company that runs the state’s largest water treatment plant said it was unable to predict when the water would be safe again to drink.

Meditation Technique Repairs The Brain Processes That Aspartame Destroys
June 21, 2012 by Infinite
– Meditation technique repairs the brain processes that aspartame destroys (Natural News, June 21, 2012):
Research has shown that with as few as 11 hours of mindful meditation, the white matter of the brain that aspartame destroys, can begin to grow back. Research into the brain damage that aspartame causes, has revealed lesions to the nerve fibers known as white matter. This is due to the by-products created when aspartame is ingested, namely methanol and formaldehyde. The effects of ingesting these chemicals are so serious that they cause symptoms often mistaken for multiple sclerosis. Other artificial sweeteners such as neotame, which have the same by-products, have the same effects.

Methanol, Biproduct Of Aspartame Linked To Autism, Preterm Delivery
April 29, 2012 by Infinite
– ﻿﻿Methanol, Biproduct of Aspartame Linked to Autism, Preterm Delivery (Natural Society, April 27, 2012):
One would think that with the extreme and almost omnipresent dangers of aspartame that there would be far less of the substance on the market compared to a decade or two ago. But, with fully sanctioned advertisements telling you just how great products are which contain aspartame, there seems to be no end in sight for this dangerous edible chemistry experiment. There have been, however, several dozen studies on just how viable the purely artificial sweetener actually is for the human body, mostly ignored by the general populace and still consumed just as much of the sweetener as before.

Neotame Is 13,000 Times Sweeter Than Sugar And Even More Toxic Than Aspartame
March 16, 2012 by Infinite
– Neotame: 13,000 Times Sweeter Than Sugar And Even More Toxic Than Aspartame (Prevent Disease, Mar 13, 2012):
In the event that the public becomes too informed and savvy about toxic additives in our food supply, what’s a multi-billion dollar industry to do? The first step is to create another more toxic version of the additive. The second step is to collude with regulatory authorities such as the FDA to convince the public that the new, more toxic additive is safe. The third and final step is to prevent the toxic additive from being listed on any ingredient labels. From the folks that brought us Aspartame, meet Neotame, a deadly sweetener that you’ll never see on a label because…well that’s just the way the FDA wants it.
Neotame is officially marketed as an inexpensive artificial sweetener made by NutraSweet, which is a former division of Monsanto and original manufacturer of aspartame.
Eighty percent of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) complaints pertain to aspartame’s adverse reactions. These reports include: grand mal seizures, brain tumors, blindness and other health-related problems, including deaths. Monsanto’s Nick Rosa stated in 1998, that Neotame is “based on the aspartame formula.”
It is up to 13,000 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). The product is very attractive to food manufacturers, as its use greatly lowers the cost of production compared to using sugar or high fructose corn syrup (due to the lower quantities needed to achieve the same sweetening).
Neotame is aspartame plus 3-di-methylbutyl, which can be found on the EPA’s list of most hazardous chemicals. The aspartame formula is comprised of Phenylalanine [50%], which caused seizures in lab animals and Aspartic Acid [40%], which caused “holes in the brains” of lab animals — bonded by Methyl Alcohol, or Methanol [10%] which is capable of causing blindness, liver damage and death.
Methanol, or wood alcohol in aspartame breaks down further in heat and in the body, into Formaldehyde (embalming fluid), Formic Acid (venom in ant stings) and the most deadly of all — Diketopiperazine (DKP), a brain tumor agent.
When it comes to human health, neotame is in the same dangerous category as aspartame, but it is a deadlier neurotoxin, immunotoxin and excitotoxin. The long-term effects are essentially cell-death.

Dr. Russell Blaylock: Hidden Sources Of MSG In Foods (Flashback)

– Hidden Sources Of MSG In Foods (PDF)
From the book
“Excitotoxins – The Taste That Kills”
by Dr. Russell Blaylock, MD
What if someone were to tell you that a chemical (MSG) added to food could cause brain damage in your children, and that this chemical could effect how your children’s nervous systems formed during development so that in later years they may have learning or emotional difficulties?
What if there was scientific evidence that these chemicals could permanently damage a critical part of the brain known to control hormones so that later in life your child might have endocrine problems? How would you feel?
Suppose evidence was presented to you strongly suggesting that the artificial sweetener in your diet soft drink may cause brain tumors to develop, and that the number of brain tumors reported since the introduction of this widespread introduction of this artificial sweetener has risen dramatically? Would that affect your decision to drink these products and especially to allow your children to drink them? What if you could be shown overwhelming evidence that one of the main ingredients in this sweetener (aspartate) could cause the same brain lesions as MSG? Would that affect your buying decisions?
And finally, what if it could be demonstrated that all of these types of chemicals, called excitotoxins, could possibly aggravate or even precipitate many of today’s epidemic neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, ALS, and Alzheimer’s disease? Would you be concerned if you knew that these excitotoxin food additives are a particular risk if you have diabetes, or have ever had a stroke, brain injury, brain tumor, seizure, or have suffered from hypertension, meningitis, or viral encephalitis?
Would you also be upset to learn that many of the brain lesions caused by these products in your children are irreversible and can result from a SINGLE exposure of these products in sufficient concentration?
