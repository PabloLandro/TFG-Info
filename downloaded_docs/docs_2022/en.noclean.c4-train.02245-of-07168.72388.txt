About Us
Himalayan salt lamps are made by placing a light bulb inside large chunks of pink Himalayan salt. They have a distinctive look and emit a warming, pink glow when lit. Himalayan salt lamps are a beautiful light source that may offer the benefits of color therapy, by cleaning the air hygroscopically and in alleviating allergies. They are an inexpensive no-blue light source to use after dark and as a sleep-friendly night light for kids.
