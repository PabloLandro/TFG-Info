Goals: 40 svj, then work on 46 in rvj off 1 or 2, 40 yard dash
Age: 32
Height: 5'9
Weight: 214
Body fat: 98%
Squat: full squat paused 365 PR a few years ago though at 187 lb
Deadlift: 315 don't do it much
SVJ: 27in
Sleep schedule: Gettign better and more consistent
Race: chinese mountainous asian descent
Athletic history: played bball a lil age 15. Quit basketball for a long time and gained lots of weight (from 130 lb to 185 lbs).
Health history: Conditioning getting better.
Injuries: a little bit of knee soreness/tendonitis, shin splints, flaring meniscus...
Body type: I've gained a lot of mass/fat lately. My squat went from 240 to 280 in about 3-4 weeks. And I have stopped doing any type of cardio and bball in the last 5-6 weeks. I also started to do upper body work outs after my rib heeled. So weight went from 158 to 170.
Diet: lots of food
Short term: i plan on continuing the 3 sets of 5 rep work out and adding 5 lb every time. Also plan on cutting the cals and upping the cardio to cut and get more agile for upcoming bball tournament and school bball workouts.

I'd still squat and include a GHR, even with tendonitis. Strong hamstrings can protect the knee.
Of course, if it's really painful, you might have to rest a little until it's gone or at more manageable levels. Make sure to stretch / foam roll, especially the IT band.

Here some of my advice if you want it:
That 7 months may have actually done good for you, because it seems like your vert numbers haven't really dropped. That said, you still took 7 months off, so I would work slowly back in.
1) Keep playing basketball, but definitely cut down the volume, because you'll be playing more and more as the season/tryouts get closer. You don't want to peak in the middle of your training.
2) Do more GPP work. I don't know the specifics of your jumper's knee, but if 7 months of rest didn't do anything for it, you should definitely do more GPP. That means for the first 2 months now, your warm-ups should be longer, including lots of lunges, squats, Cossack squats, glute activation work, etc. You should also try to get some extra GPP work in on days you don't workout.
3) More posterior chain work. This means when you squat, go FULL, calves touching hamstrings. I know that seems counter-intuitive to your jumper's knee, but going full will get way more hamstring activation. If you find that your knees go too far past your toes(not necessarily a bad thing, but can aggravate bad knees) then try pushing your knees out to the sides when you squat. This is kind of like Mark Rippetoe's squat style, but I would still keep a high bar position.
Ditto on GHRs and other PC exercises like Romanian deadlifts.
4) Ease into training with a linear periodization type of method. That is, go for lighter weight higher reps now, and then get progressively heavier as the season approaches. This will be ideal if you're doing more GPP in the beginning.
5) MORE soft tissue work/stretching. Like what creativelyric said, IT band/TFL are very important. Basketball is a game where you almost never exceed 90 degrees of hip flexion. This means that your psoas major is almost never used for hip flexion, and muscles that are supposed to be used as synergists in hip flexion have to pick up the slack. That would be your stuff like TFL, Illiacus, etc. They will get tight as hell from the work. I would go further than just a foam roller, and use a lacrosse ball or other harder massaging implements. Go to mobilitywod.com they have some good ideas on this kind of stuff.
Don't ignore your quads either, rectus femoris stretching plus massaging for the quads goes a long way. Work on your calves/achilles tendon too if you wear high tops.

Thanks for all this enlightening info. I got jumper's knee or tendinitis recently from over use i'm guessing, I've never had knee tendinitis prior to the 7 month layoff. My only other nagging injury is this pain in my right shin. I think it is shin splint, but it has been bothering me last year during intense bball season (not 7 month layoff time though). I just hope it's not a bone spur and just posterior shin splint.

Been lacking in journals here is last month:
3/10
machine squat 10x120 10x160 7x180 5x 240
hydro plyometrics/swimming for 45 min
3/17
deadlift just to get form right 10x 95, 10x 135
3/24
squat 20x 95, 15x 115, 10x 135, 7x 155, 4x185 Form still sucks, not going parallel, back arching wrong way
4/2
squat 20x 95, 10x135, 10x135, form much better, going almost parallel, doing wide stance much easier and back is better. also bar is lower on back but it is hurting my shoulder joints
4/9
squat same as 4/2, just trying to get form right
I have also been doing some leg curls to strengthen knees, can't really do a proper GHR yet.
I have been running games about 3 times per week (was running 5 times a week), have some shin splints, and knees r feeling better from soreness/minor pain
have also been doing some other workouts such as seated calf raises and reverse calf raises (heel raises?)
Also did lunges for 2 sessions. with 60 lbs. Did about 3x10 reps.
Am contemplating whether I should incorporate some type of plyo or should i wait for weight/fat% to go down and knees to get better?

4/12 3AM I am about to go to the gym which opens at 5 AM for an intense morning training of hydro and weight and some bike.
A few questions-- Having had a drug/nicotine/alcohol problem in the past (which I have thankfully beat) how bad of an effect would that have on my bone density, muscles, tendons and current development?
Also, I have decent legs to torso ratio and decent waist length, however, being asian would that still put me at an disadvantage athletically speaking compared to an african american of the same physique. I ask bc part of the reason some asians are disadvantaged is bc their legs to torso ratio is bad.
Finished training:
Warm up in sauna and stretching- 20 min
Did some dribbling drills with 2 balls, 4 full court sprints and some shooting - 1 hour
Squat
95 x 15, 115 x 15, 135 x 10, 155 x 7
V-squat
115 x 10
Seated leg curls (alternating right and left leg)
10 x 30, 10 x 50 x 2, could not do pull of 70 lb (either leg)
I am not doing regular leg curls bc I bruised a rib and it hurts to lie on my chest.
seated calf raises
20 x 70, 15 x 90, 12 x 115
reverse calf raises (off ledge)
50 x body weight, 30 x body weight (exhaustion)
weight- 161

i think out of all the machine squats available, this is the most effective. I try to incorporate this bc i cant seem to go ATG with good form without doing a super wide stance. I've been practicing flexibility though.

i see, but then that would make my knees a bit inward, since i think i have a lil bit of pronated knees perhaps bc i used to play bball 5 days a week while being heavily overweight.

More importantly, you need to shove your knees out. Not necessarily pointing your toes out, although many people prefer squatting that way, because it cues the knees out.
With the knee pain you have though, I probably wouldn't go with the toes out unless you have good control of you hips.
Try doing some light goblet squats in your warm up. I've never done squats on a machine like that, but you could probably replace that with heavy goblet squats.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKmrXTx6jZs
These will definitely help your depth, as they're much easier to get depth on than even bodyweight squats. Ben Bruno is using a pretty wide stance here, no need to use one this wide, just go with what you're comfortable with.
Then work your way up to front squats, and then overhead squats.
So basically slowly work your way from:
Goblet -> Front -> Overhead
Give that a shot, with some foam rolling/stretching. You'll hit good depth in no time.
