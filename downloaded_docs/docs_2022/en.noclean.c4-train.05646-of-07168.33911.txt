Is it possible to confront a weed-smoking neighbor?
05-11-17 Category: Marijuana
“It’s my right to breathe clean air in my own home,” says 28-year-old Margie O’Neill (name changed), a resident of Sacramento’s most vibrant and energetic Midtown neighborhood. Though Margie never had any objections about legalizing marijuana or biased attitudes toward pot enthusiasts, she doesn’t want to wake to the smell of weed in her home.
However, Margie’s next-door neighbors seem to be oblivious to her right to clean air. Many times in the morning or late in the evening, and continuously on weekends, her neighbor’s smoke starts making its way into her apartment through a vent, leaving her feeling hot-boxed in her own home throughout the day. The pungent and skunky odor has, in fact, left her frustrated causing her to wonder what her rights are in her own place. She says her neighbor has a valid medical marijuana card, but he is a weed junkie. Though federal law doesn’t recognize medical marijuana, users can legally smoke medical pot in the privacy of their own homes as per California state laws.
There are countless neighborhoods in California where families live in close proximity to others including non-smokers as well as pot smokers. Under such circumstances, there is a huge possibility of marijuana smoke drifting through windows, doors and shared ventilation systems in community housing societies, multiunit apartments and condos. According to state lawmakers, many people have raised concerns about inhaling secondhand smoke involuntarily.
Smoking weed in California is legal, but perhaps not in an apartment
Although California has decriminalized both medical as well as recreational use of marijuana including growing a stipulated number of cannabis plants within one’s residence, but property owners and landlords still have the right to raise objections in one way or the other. According to Proposition 64 and present landlord-tenant policy, an enforceable ban on smoking or use of tobacco on the premises can be included. Moreover, even if the agreements don’t make explicit mention of marijuana or cannabis products, landlords could always resort to several other stipulations such as a “no illicit substance” policy, a nuisance clause or an existing provision that prevents occupants from violating state or federal laws, providing no protection to even medical marijuana users.
In general, landlords do not seek to intrude into the private lives of their tenants. But, in the case of complaints by neighbors in a multifamily residential locality, they certainly have the right to look into the grievances and suggest a remedy. Until some years ago, even smoking cigarettes was a big issue in multiunit homes due to concerns about residents with respiratory ailments or children who were forced to become passive smokers. In fact, inserting clauses, which ban smoking, in rental contracts is a commonly accepted practice.
Additionally, with the passage of Proposition 64 in California in November 2016, lawmakers introduced a clause banning smoking in public spaces and prohibiting smoking marijuana in locations where smoking tobacco is not permitted.
Marijuana is a highly addictive drug
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), more than 22 million Americans aged 12 or older were using marijuana in 2015. In light of the popularity of the pro-medical marijuana campaigns, which insist on decriminalization of the drug, many fear that damaging and addictive nature of cannabis will get sidelined. In fact, experts believe that the nation is doing a terrible disservice to the future generations by adopting a lax attitude toward the dangers of marijuana.
The therapeutic value of marijuana remains a controversial and heavily contested issue. Despite the wide acceptance of marijuana in many states, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has neither recognized nor approved its medicinal value. As per the FDA, pharmacologists have not conducted extensive clinical trials to determine the medicinal value of marijuana which could outweigh the possible health risks.
Irrespective of the decriminalization of medical and recreational marijuana in certain states, people at large should be made aware of the fact that it is a highly addictive and mind-altering substance, which can lead to adverse health concerns. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main ingredient in marijuana that induces psychoactive changes in the body leading to dependence and triggers cravings in chronic users.
Being a long-acting drug, cannabis is known to stay in the system for a longer period of time exposing the individual to several health hazards. Research shows that use of marijuana over a period of time can cause short-term memory loss and chronic smoking can damage the respiratory tract. Also, prolonged pot smoking is known to cause wheezing, shortness of breath, production of morning sputum and airway obstruction in the nasal passages.
Sovereign Health can help
Research shows that everyone has the neurobiological potential to become an addict. However, in the area of rewards, every individual might not be on the same level as people addicted to a substance where it might be simply hard-wired into their gray matter. Nevertheless, marijuana modifies the brain’s reward system by inducing a dopamine rush, which automatically tweaks the brain for a heightened response to other drugs.
Sovereign Health understands the plight of someone who is unable to discontinue the use of harmful substances despite the negative impact on his or her life. Our customized marijuana addiction treatment programs at our reputed marijuana treatment centers are tailored to individual needs in order to treat the person holistically.
