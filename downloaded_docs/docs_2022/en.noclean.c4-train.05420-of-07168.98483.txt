What Is HIV (and How Is It Different from AIDS)?
Learn more about how HIV takes a toll on your immune system.

New research for HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, has greatly advanced HIV treatment and prevention efforts. Although there is no cure for HIV, patients who stick with their medication are living longer, stronger, a and healthier lives.
Here’s what we know about HIV. HIV is a kind of virus that attacks the CD4 T cells in the immune system, or the part of your body that protects you against infections. Upon transmission, the HIV virus multiplies rapidly and creates several million copies within the first couple of weeks, according to hematologist Jeffrey Laurence, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Dr. Laurence is also is the senior scientific consultant for programs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.
In early stages, HIV presents itself as what many describe as the “worst flu ever.” As the body tries to fight back against the infection, someone with HIV may experience severe flu-like symptoms, and other issues including skin lesions, diarrhea, headaches, and high fever. Learn more about the progression of HIV symptoms here.
The body adapts to this, however, and HIV shifts to a latent period, which may last several years. If untreated, the virus will continue to destroy T cells, and HIV patients will become more vulnerable to cancers, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other infections.
Doctors can track the progression of a patient’s HIV using the T cell count. Once someone’s T cell count drops below 200, the patient is diagnosed with AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is the last stage of HIV infection, when the immune system is at its weakest.
Transmission of HIV occurs when bodily fluids from an infected person enter another person’s body in one of four ways: sexual transmission (including vaginal, anal, or oral), sharing needles, direct contact with contaminated blood, or transmission between a between mother and fetus. Contrary to popular belief, HIV is not transmitted through air, water, hugging, saliva, sweat, tears, mosquitos, or sharing food or drinks.
It is important to remember that not all people with HIV show symptoms, so doctors recommend you consistently use a condom with sexual partners when you don’t know their HIV status.
What’s important to know, says Dr. Laurence, is that “HIV is no longer a death sentence.” Thanks to modern treatments for HIV, which can be as simple as one pill a day, doctors now see no difference in the lifespan of someone infected with HIV and someone who isn’t as long as patients adhere to their HIV drug regimen and get regular medical care.

00:07 Hello and welcome to HealthiNation.
00:10 I'm Dr. Keri Peterson.
00:12 When the first cases of HIV were reported in the early 1980s,
00:15 we knew almost nothing about the disease.
00:17 Treatment was nonexistent and those with the condition succumbed to an early death.
00:24 Since then, there have been vast advances in understanding the virus that
00:28 causes HIV and how to treat people with the infection.
00:33 Those advances have made it possible for
00:35 people with HIV to live not just years, but decades, after being diagnosed.
00:42 HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus,
00:46 attacks the immune system and makes it difficult for the body to fight infection.
00:51 It's estimated that more than 1 million Americans have been infected with HIV.
00:56 It's the sixth leading cause of death of Americans age 25 through 44.
01:03 HIV attacks cells that fight infection called CD4 T-cells.
01:07 They're also called CD4 or T-cells for short.
01:12 As these T-cells are destroyed, the body becomes vulnerable to other infections and
01:17 cancers that a healthy immune system would be able to fight off.
01:22 Over time, the number of T-cells in the body go down.
01:26 When a person infected with HIV has a very low T-cell count,
01:31 under 200, with or without associated infection,
01:34 that person is said to have AIDS or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
01:41 AIDS is the last stage of HIV infection.
01:45 There are two types of human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2.
01:51 In the United States, most cases are HIV-1, and
01:55 HIV-2 is primarily found in West Africa.
01:59 While the two have similar modes of transmission and the resulting
02:02 opportunistic infections, there are some differences between the viruses.
02:07 In this video series, we will be discussing HIV 1.
02:12 HIV transmission occurs when bodily fluid like semen, blood, or
02:17 breast milk from an infected person enters another person's bloodstream.
02:22 The virus is typically passed in one of three ways,
02:26 through sexual contact, from sharing contaminated needles,
02:30 or from mother to child during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding.
02:37 The only sure way to avoid sexual transmission is abstinence.
02:43 Anal, vaginal, and
02:45 oral sex with an infected person can all transmit HIV to the partner.
02:51 However, using condoms during sex can reduce the risk of spreading HIV.
02:57 Since someone with HIV may not show any symptoms,
03:00 practicing safer sex by using a condom can help reduce the risk of transmission.
03:08 Someone who has multiple sex partners has an increased risk of
03:12 becoming infected with HIV.
03:14 This risk further increases if that person has another sexually transmitted disease.
03:21 If someone has HIV and another sexually transmitted disease, he or
03:25 she is more likely to transmit the HIV virus.
03:30 Needles and syringes that are contaminated with HIV can spread the virus to others.
03:36 Drug users who share needles and
03:38 other drug paraphernalia are at risk of getting HIV.
03:41 If a healthcare worker gets stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle,
03:47 there is a chance the virus could be transmitted, but this is rare.
03:53 An expectant mother can transmit HIV to her unborn child during pregnancy,
03:58 during birth, and to a baby by breastfeeding.
04:02 Pregnant women should be tested for
04:04 HIV, and those with HIV should be under the care of a doctor.
04:09 Taking anti-retroviral medicines to combat HIV during pregnancy
04:14 can significantly reduce the chances of passing HIV to the unborn child.
04:20 It's recommended that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their
04:24 children because the virus can be transmitted through breast milk.
04:30 It is technically possible to get HIV from blood transfusions or
04:35 medical tools in a doctor's or a dentist's office.
04:39 However, the routine testing of blood and
04:42 other safety protocols makes this extremely rare.
04:47 To prevent HIV transmission from tattooing and
04:50 piercings, only sterile tools should be used.
04:55 HIV is passed from one person to another when infected blood, semen, or
04:59 breast milk enters another person's bloodstream.
05:03 HIV cannot be spread by casual contact like shaking hands or
05:09 hugging, saliva, sweat, tears, closed-mouth kissing,
05:16 air, water, or bug bites like from mosquitoes.
05:23 While we know so much more about HIV today,
05:26 it is still a serious disease that poses a serious health risk.
05:30 Anyone who is sexually active or uses IV drugs needs to
05:35 be mindful of how HIV is transmitted and careful in their actions.
