Dr. Brian Hooker Addresses Protest Crowd in N.Y. as Former CDC Director Who Approved Gardasil Vaccine is Named “Woman of the Year”
As we have previously reported here at Health Impact News, former CDC director, Dr. Julie Gerberding, has been referred to as either "one of the most evil people in medicine today" or the Healthcare Businesswomen's "Woman of the Year." A crowd gathered in New York City to protest the Healthcare Businesswomen's award, and Dr. Brian Hooker, who has spent many years of his life uncovering corruption at the CDC, addressed the crowd. He talked about the conversations he had with CDC whistleblower, Dr. Willliam Thompson, who worked with Dr. Gerberding during the years she served as the Director of the CDC, when the Gardasil vaccine was approved.

The CDC’s History of Research Fraud Regarding Vaccines and Autism

The CDC’s History of Research Fraud Regarding Vaccines and Autism
Documents obtained by the Freedom of Information Act indicate that Centers for Disease Control (CDC) officials gave preferential treatment to the Danish grantees (including Dr. Poul Thorsen), and took no apparent action to evaluate the veracity of any of the study data when theft of over $1 million of grant money by Thorsen was made known. In 2009, when CDC officials became aware that Thorsen failed to obtain legally required ethics permissions for the autism bio and genetic data projects, these CDC employees worked with the Danish grantees to hide this fact. Dr. Coleen Boyle, current Director of NCBDDD at CDC, should have shut this grant down immediately upon being informed that ethical clearances were not in place. She should have immediately contacted the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity as well as the Office of Inspector General. Funding should have been discontinued. She should have led the charge to have these papers retracted. There should have been, at a minimum, a press release from the CDC to inform the public. Instead, Dr. Boyle along with Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, Joanne Wojcik and Dr. Diana Schendel worked with their Danish Grantees to ‘fix it’ and retrospectively apply ethics approvals. How can the CDC be trusted with stewarding vaccine safety for the U.S. if this is an example of how ethics are regarded within their ranks? Unfortunately, this is just one of many instances of research fraud and malfeasance within the CDC. CDC officials in the Immunization Safety Office and the Developmental Disabilities Branch have repeatedly omitted data and manipulated statistical results to deny any relationship between vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism.

New CDC Statistics: 1 out of every 36 Children in the U.S. has Autism

New CDC Statistics: 1 out of every 36 Children in the U.S. has Autism
New statistics released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) show that one out of every 36 children in the U.S. now are diagnosed with autism. The rate in 2013 was one out of 50, in 2008 the rate was one out of 88, in 2002 the rate was one out of 250, and in 1980, six years before Congress and President Reagan passed a law giving vaccine manufacturers total legal immunity for injuries or deaths caused by vaccines, the rate was only one out of 10,000. MIT researcher Dr. Stephanie Seneff has stated that given current trends, by the year 2025 half of all children will be diagnosed with autism. To break down the data supplied by the CDC, the VAXXED team turned to Dr. Brian Hooker. Dr. Hooker is perhaps the most knowledgeable person in the world regarding the CDC and the data they have compiled regarding vaccines and autism. Dr. Hooker is the father of a vaccine-injured child, and is a Ph.D. researcher. He has fought against the CDC for more than 14 years, using the Freedom of Information Act to try and gather as much data as he could from the studies that the CDC has published that claim there is no link between vaccines and autism. He has submitted much of the results of his own internal investigation of the CDC data on vaccines and autism to Congress. Congressman Bill Posey has assisted him in forcing the CDC to comply with many of these requests. After almost 12 years, his tireless pursuit of finding the truth resulted in the CDC finally handing over documents so that Dr. Hooker could look at the raw data that the CDC used to claim that there was no link between vaccines and autism. It took some Congressional pressure from Congressman Bill Posey to get this information. Shortly after that, one of the top vaccine scientists at the CDC contacted him to become a whistleblower regarding vaccine research fraud. The story of this CDC scientist whistle-blower is featured in the film, VAXXED. In this interview from December 5, 2017, Dr. Hooker discusses the new report issued by the CDC that covers the current rate of autism, and explains how the CDC has downplayed the significance of the data in their report. Dr. Hooker gives us the alarming news that the CDC numbers are actually too low, and that the real rate of autism is much higher.

Does Data in Hospital Research Show Flu Shot Given to Pregnant Women Increases Autism in Unborn?
Brian Hooker, Ph.D., PE, has 15 years experience in the field of bioengineering and is an associate professor at Simpson University where he specializes in biology and chemistry. His over 50 science and engineering papers have been published in internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Hooker has exposed fraud in vaccine studies for years, and in 2014 a top CDC vaccine scientist turned whistleblower and chose to reveal evidence of fraud in the CDC to Dr. Hooker. Health Impact News has used Dr. Hooker in the past to unravel research on vaccines, much of it sponsored by the government and your tax dollars, where the data uncovered in the research was spun to the public and corporate media to achieve a result that was not supported by the data at all. Dr. Hooker has done this once again, by analyzing the data in a recent study by Kaiser Permanente looking at the data regarding the annual flu shot which is recommended for pregnant women, and the possible link between the flu shot and the unborn baby being diagnosed with autism. Did the conclusions of the authors of the study support the actual data?

Dr. Brian Hooker Exposes Fraud at the CDC – Congress Refuses to Hold Hearings
In what is perhaps one of the most in-depth public interviews ever recorded with Dr. Brian Hooker, who is featured in the recent film VAXXED which is creating major controversies in film festivals all across the U.S. as powerful vaccine special interest groups try to censor the film, Dr. Hooker reveals on the National Safe Child Show how his 10 year fight with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) resulted in one of the top vaccine scientists at the CDC contacting him to become a whistleblower regarding vaccine research fraud. Dr. William Thompson of the CDC was a co-author of a landmark vaccine research paper published in 2004 that supposedly proved that there was no correlation between the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 3-combo vaccine (MMR) and autism. However, in phones calls between Dr. Thompson and Dr. Hooker in 2014 that were secretly recorded, Dr. Thompson revealed that the CDC deliberately hid and destroyed data that showed there was in fact a link between the MMR vaccine and autism among certain groups of children. After the phone conversations between Dr. Hooker and Dr. Thompson went public, Dr. Thompson hired a whistleblower attorney, and sent all of the data that he had retained showing the fraud to U.S. Representative Bill Posey. According to Dr. Hooker, Dr. Thompson was also deposed and filed an affidavit that Congressman Posey retains in his possession. Yet in spite of these revelations, not one Congressional committee chair has called a hearing to subpoena Dr. Thompson and investigate fraud at the CDC. In this interview with Dr. Hooker on the National Safe Child Show and Tammi Stefano, Dr. Hooker explains how he was harassed and opposed by the CDC as he spent over 10 years filing over 100 freedom of information acts (FOIAs) to recover raw data sets used to publish research on vaccines by the CDC. They even targeted his son, who was injured by the MMR vaccine and today has autism.

CDC Whistleblower Scientist Given Huge Bonus and Asked to Rewrite Fraudulent Vaccine-Autism Study
Brian Hooker, Ph.D., issued a press release today clarifying some issues related to his past relationship to Dr. William Thompson of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Dr. Thompson originally contacted Dr. Hooker and confessed that the CDC had covered up data in a 2004 article published in the Journal of Pediatrics that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. When the phone conversations between Brian Hooker and William Thompson went public, Dr. Thompson hired a whistleblower attorney. However, in spite of the confessions of fraud at the CDC by Dr. Thompson, he retained his position at the CDC, and no committee chair in Congress dared to take on the pharmaceutical cartel and hold hearings on the matter. Dr. Thompson was never subpoenaed to be questioned about the alleged fraud at the CDC. Congressman Bill Posey was the lone voice in Congress calling for hearings, and he allegedly received documents from Dr. Thompson as well as an affidavit. Dr. Thompson appeared willing to testify, but only under oath before Congress. It never happened. With the recent popularity of the film VAXXED, which features the story of Dr. Thompson becoming a whistleblower and revealing fraud at the CDC, more information has come forward about just why it is believed Dr. Thompson retained his position at the CDC, and just how the CDC is going to handle this story, which for the most part has been censored in the mainstream media, but been on fire in the Alternative Media and Social Media. Dr. Brian Hooker made some comments at one of the Q & A sessions of the film's premiere in Manhattan recently, and today he issued a formal press release explaining the basis of those comments.

Dr. Brian Hooker: Father of Vaccine-damaged Child and His Relentless Pursuit to Expose Fraud at the CDC
A top researcher employed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has come forward as a whistle-blower, confessing to his participation in actively covering up data that clearly links vaccines to autism. This is not a story the mainstream media (MSM) will be able to ignore for long. However, the MSM is heavily funded by the pharmaceutical industry, and the pharmaceutical industry has their appointed spokespersons on all of the major networks. The pharmaceutical industry is well-funded. They are perhaps the richest and most powerful group in the world here in the 21st Century. They will fight back and spin this story as best they can - you can be sure of it. What we will need are more whistle-blowers from the MSM. They will most certainly lose their jobs and careers if they become whistle-blowers, as Sharyl Attkisson, formerly of CBS News, lost her job. Others, like Ben Swann, have left the MSM to start their own independent reporting where they are more free to publish the truth on many issues, including vaccines and autism. Dr. Hooker is the father of a vaccine-injured child, and is a Ph.D. researcher. He has fought against the CDC for more than 12 years, using the Freedom of Information Act to try and gather as much data as he could from the studies that the CDC has published that claim there is no link between vaccines and autism. He has submitted much of the results of his own internal investigation of the CDC data on vaccines and autism to Congress. Congressman Bill Posey has assisted him in forcing the CDC to comply with many of these requests. After almost 12 years, his tireless pursuit of finding the truth that the CDC was hiding paid off, as the CDC finally handed over documents so that Dr. Hooker could look at the raw data that the CDC used to claim that there was no link between vaccines and autism. It took some Congressional pressure from Congressman Bill Posey to get this information. Dr. Hooker is hero, and I believe history will bear that out. He faces a tough road ahead, as he continues to analyze the CDC data that has been covered up and withheld from the public for so long. He needs our prayers and support during this time, as does Dr. Thompson the CDC whistle-blower. Dr. Hooker has clearly stated what his goal is his pursuit of getting the truth from the CDC: a safer vaccine schedule for children. Tens of thousands of children are damaged or killed by vaccines, as the government vaccine compensation program proves, and yet the CDC continues to promote a one-size-fits all vaccine schedule that sacrifices the lives of so many children. Read more about what Dr. Hooker is saying about the recently revealed whistle-blower and the damaging cover-up by the CDC.

U.S Congressman: CDC Can’t be Trusted Regarding Vaccine Safety
Congressman Bill Posey's strong resolve and demands for transparency were evident as he discussed the Center for Disease Control (CDC)'s handling of vaccine safety studies which affect "our most precious resource in our nation – our children." The 30-minute interview, conducted by vaccine industry watchdog, PhD biochemist Brian Hooker, delves into what Posey called "the incestuous relationship between the public health community and the vaccine makers and public officials." The Florida legislator, known as "Mr. Accountabililty," did not mince words when criticizing current and past CDC officials including indicted fraudster Dr. Poul Thorsen; CDC director turned Merck Vaccine President Dr. Julie Gerberding; and the agency's current spokesperson regarding autism and vaccines, Dr. Coleen Boyle. Congressman Posey said, "The CDC can't be trusted regarding investigating vaccine safety. Huge conflict of interest. I think the CDC should be investigated."

Big Pharma Tries to Discredit Documents Hidden By CDC Linking Vaccines to Autism

Big Pharma Tries to Discredit Documents Hidden By CDC Linking Vaccines to Autism
On February 21, 2013, we published the press release from A Shot of Truth which announced that after nearly 10 years of trying to obtain documents from the CDC through over 100 Freedom of Information Acts (FOIAs), that Dr. Brian Hooker had finally obtained documents showing that the CDC had been hiding data linking the mercury in vaccines to autism. This story has gone viral on the Internet, receiving a lot of attention, as can be expected given the fact that the CDC now admits that one in every 50 children in the U.S. are now diagnosed with autism. Apparently, Big Pharma was already expecting this, and very quickly issued an attack piece to discredit the data that had been released. The person appointed to write this response, was a pro-pharma, pro-vaccine, pro-GMO "science" writer. Interestingly, the response was not published in a scientific or medical publication, but in a business magazine. As we wrote earlier today, journalist and constitutional attorney Glen Greenwald published information earlier this week showing how international spy agencies train Internet trolls to use deception and manipulation to infiltrate social media. And that's exactly what the trolls did, targeting sources all over social media who were covering the press release and pointing them to this article, which was reprinted in many mainstream media sources, most of them in the financial sector. This news is obviously seen as a threat to the multi-billion dollar vaccine empire. So here is the response to the Big Pharma hit piece, written by Dr. Brian Hooker and A Shot of Truth:

CDC Vaccine Link to Autism Scandal: The Wrong Man was Condemned

CDC Vaccine Link to Autism Scandal: The Wrong Man was Condemned
If there is one issue regarding vaccines that the mainstream media joins together with one common voice, it is the claim that autism is linked to vaccines, particularly mercury contained in vaccines. The mainstream media accepts as fact, without even bothering to investigate, that this claim has been proven false, and that the man who supposedly invented this claim has now been condemned. That man who is now the scapegoat of the mainstream media around the world when the topic of autism and vaccines is discussed, is Dr. Andrew Wakefield. What the media never reports, however, is that Dr. Andrew Wakefield's study linking the MMR vaccine to autism was one of many studies showing the same link. The mainstream media also ignores the large amount of awards for damages being made to vaccine damaged children with autism in the U.S. Vaccine Court, or that other courts of law in other countries are ruling that vaccines cause autism and awarding damages to children with autism. There is one man that practically gets a free pass from exposure in mainstream media, however. This man is currently a fugitive and is somehow escaping capture better than the world's worst terrorists. That man is Dr. Poul Thorsen. Thorsen has been accused of stealing millions of dollars of CDC research money and fabricating studies that supposedly showed there was no link between mercury in vaccines and autism. And yet, the CDC still relies on this man's research to make the claim that there is no link between vaccines and autism. Now, perhaps unwittingly, the CDC has published new research that looks at the same data as the original Thorsen study claiming no link between mercury in vaccines and autism, and the results are contradictory. But don't expect to read any of this in the mainstream media. They have been wrongly condemning the wrong man for years now, and they are not in the habit of admitting their mistakes.
