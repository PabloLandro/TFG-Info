Statements made, or products sold through this web site, have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. People who ate at least two servings each week of certain whole fruits — particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples — reduced their risk for type 2 diabetes by as much as 23 percent in comparison to those who ate less than one serving per month.
Eating more whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, according to a new study led by Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) researchers. The researchers examined data gathered between 1984 and 2008 from 187,382 participants in three long-running studies (Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study). The fruits’ glycemic index (a measure of how rapidly carbohydrates in a food boost blood sugar) did not prove to be a significant factor in determining a fruit’s association with type 2 diabetes risk.
The researchers theorize that the beneficial effects of certain individual fruits could be the result of a particular component.
Harvard analysts discuss the unusual dynamics and events of the 2016 presidential election, and what they mean for our political system going forward.

Harvard nutrition experts and leaders of the food industry met this week at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge to discuss recommendations for changing menus of everything from restaurants to cafeterias to prepared foods in an effort to improve the American diet and lessen the environmental impact of the foods we eat. In January, when the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a meta-analysis of 100 studies that probed the relationship between body mass index and mortality — studies that found slightly overweight people have lower all-cause mortality than normal weight and underweight people — media around the globe trumpeted the news.

Men may think that women want a big, tough-looking guy but new research shows that women are drawn to something else entirely. The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis claims that features like strong jaws suggest that a guy has a high level of testosterone.

Our findings provide novel evidence suggesting that certain fruits may be especially beneficial for lowering diabetes risk,” said senior author Qi Sun, assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at HSPH and assistant professor of medicine at the Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Participants who reported a diagnosis of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at enrollment were excluded. Conversely, those who consumed one or more servings of fruit juice each day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 21 percent. However, the high glycemic index of fruit juice — which passes through the digestive system more rapidly than fiber-rich fruit — may explain the positive link between juice consumption and increased diabetes risk.
Previous studies have linked anthocyanins found in berries and grapes to lowered heart attack risk, for example. Sun was supported by a career development award from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Rowling delivered the keynote address this afternoon (June 5) at Harvard University’s annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association.

Women might enjoy holding on to a strong arm, but what they are really looking for is an arm that they can hold onto forever.

Usually, this bacterium first infects the stomach antrum (stomach mucosa without acid-producing cells) acutely and may progress to infect most or all of the stomach's mucosa over time (chronic gastritis) and remain there for years. Any type of deficiency will lead to increased body fat, less muscle, and increased chance of disease.

This infection generates an initial strong inflammatory response and eventually, a long-term chronic inflammation with intestinal cell changes may develop. One study performed in the United Kingdom showed that men with heart disease die sooner if their testosterone levels are low.
Another major cause of acute and chronic gastritis is the use (and overuse) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Another study found that low testosterone in men could increase the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes (June 2003).
