Genetic Counseling and Cancer
Bronson Riley, Board-certified genetic counselor
Genetic Counseling is the process of helping patients understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of the genetic contributions to cancer. This is done by looking at and interpreting family and medical histories to assess the chance of cancer or any disease occurring or recurring and educating the patient about inheritance, testing, management, prevention, resources and research. Counseling assists in promoting informed choices and to help the patient adjust to the risk or condition.
It is estimated that about 5 – 10% of all cancers result from gene mutations that were inherited from a parent. As a result, not all cancer patients will be referred to genetic counseling. A patient’s health care provider determines whether genetic counseling would be of benefit to the patient. They make this decision by looking at the rarity of the type of cancer, whether the patient is younger than usual for the type of cancer, i.e. colon cancer in a 20 year old, if the patient has more than one type of cancer or if the cancer is occurring in a gender that is not usually affected (male breast cancer.)
Family members who are at-risk of having an inherited cancer can discuss the medical, psychological and insurance impact of genetic testing for hereditary cancer. Individuals who are subsequently identified as having an inherited cancer risk can undergo increased cancer screening, risk-reducing surgery or take a drug that reduces their risk for cancer. Additionally, the children of these individuals would be at risk of having inherited cancer. For the majority of cancer patients, genetic counseling does not affect their cancer treatment. Although, this may be changing in the future as we learn more about how a person’s inherited DNA contributes to how one responds to treatment. Right now, genetic counseling may help health care providers determine whether their patients or the patients’ family members are at an increased risk for cancer or additional cancer.
For any patient, an accurate family medical history is essential. For more information and tools to help you document your family medical history go to https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/familyhistory.
Bronson Riley has been practicing as a board-certified genetic counselor since 2006. Prior to that, he coordinated clinical research on families with hereditary cancer in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Creighton University Medical Center. He is the first genetic counselor to be licensed by the Nebraska Board of Medicine and Surgery. Originally from McCook, he graduated from University of Nebraska-Lincoln with dual Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees, and then obtained a Master of Science degree in genetics at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine. Bronson is a past National Society of Genetic Counselors executive committee board member and past certification exam chair for the American Board of Genetic Counseling. In 2010, he was awarded the New Leader Award by the National Association of Genetic Counselors.

What is a Gene?
​Each cell in the human body contains 25,000 to 35,000 genes. Genes are found in chromosomes inside cells. Each gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. The DNA, which makes up the genes, instructs the genes to make specific proteins which are the building blocks of our bodies. Genes carry the information that determines the characteristics and traits that are passed on to you from your parents. Each parent has two copies of their genes. Each parent passes along one copy to make up the genes you have. They pass on the physical traits you have. Are you tall? Do you have blue eyes? Is your hair curly or straight? This all comes from your parents and their parents and their parents, etc. You can even find out where your ancestors came from by using a DNA test. Some genetic problems, though, can be inherited from a parent.
Scientists are busy studying genes because they want to know what illnesses are caused by genes that don’t work correctly. Researchers think that illnesses like lung problems and cancer may be partly caused by these mutated genes. Many people have had their genetic composition studied to see if they are at risk for a certain disease. This has been controversial in the past but as medical knowledge advances genetic testing and treatment may become more and more common.
