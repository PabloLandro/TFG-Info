Amazon removes books claiming autism cures amid anti-vax frenzy
Amazon removes books claiming autism cures amid anti-vax frenzy
admin
March 14, 2019
Amazon has removed a pair of books available for purchase on its website claiming to offer ways to cure autism.
The tech giant confirmed the books, “Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism” and “Fight Autism and Win,” had been pulled.
Listings found through a Google search performed by USA TODAY confirm the books are no longer available to buy through Amazon’s website.
As detailed in a piece published on Monday by Wired magazine, “Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism” shows parents how to make a bleach-like substance called chlorine dioxide to give to kids.
The other book, “Fight Autism and Win,” parents are advised to give their kids DMSA, a medicine used to treat lead poisoning, reports Wired.
There is no cure for autism, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but early intervention services can help improve a child’s development.
Autism has been linked to the anti-vax movement, as many parents believe vaccines cause the disability. However, several studies have shown vaccines do not cause autism. A decade-long study published earlier this month revealed the measles vaccine does not increase the risk of autism.

Amazon’s removal of the books comes as tech companies grapple with how to curtail the spread of misinformation on their platforms.
Pinterest blocked all searches on its service related to vaccines or vaccinations to stop the spread of false information related to anti-vaxx posts.
Meanwhile, Facebook — which has been criticized for how it handles the spread of misinformation since 2016’s presidential election — said it was cracking down on false information linked to the anti-vax movement.
