Why Do Vape Pens Explode?
Vape pens are equipped with lithium-ion batteries, which aren’t always the best quality. They are often made cheaply by manufacturers, and can overheat and explode. When this happens, shrapnel may fly through the air and harm vapers as well as other individuals who are near them.
It’s important to understand that vape pens do not have to be in use in order to explode. Believe it or not, there have been several reports of vape pens exploding in pockets or right after a new lithium-ion battery was installed. Unfortunately, vape pen explosions can occur at just about any time, and lead to a variety of serious injuries.
Most Common Types of Vape Pen Injuries
The heat paired with the significant force of vape pen explosions leads to catastrophic injuries that come with hefty medical bills, lost wages, disfigurement, pain and suffering, and a number of other damages.
The most common injury that results from a vape pen explosions is a burn. Often, victims are left with third-degree burns that appear on their faces and require skin grafts as well as months of inpatient care. In addition to burns, victims of vape pen explosions may experience the following:
Lacerations
Fractures
Scarring
Cracked teeth
Soft tissue injuries
Vision damage or blindness
Death
What to Do After a Vaping Explosion Injury
If you or someone you love has sustained a third-degree burn or another vape explosion injury, you are likely overwhelmed and have many questions running through your head. After seeking medical attention, taking photographs of your injuries, and keeping the vape pen that caused you harm in a safe space far away from you and others, contact a Texas product liability lawyer right away.
You can depend on an attorney to perform a thorough investigation of your case and help you determine liability. Once liability has been established, they can file a claim on your behalf so you can recover the compensation you deserve.
How to Prevent Vaping Explosions & Vape Explosion Injuries
If you are an avid user of vape pens, you should know that there are certain ways you can reduce your risk of experiencing a vape pen explosion and the injuries that it may cause. First, be sure to read and adhere to all instructions for use and storage. It’s important to follow battery charging guidelines and refrain from using your cell phone charger to charge your vape pen.
In the event you believe your batteries are old or damaged, throw them away. You should also be mindful of the weather, as extreme cold and heat may damage lithium-ion batteries.
In addition, do your research and don’t just go with the first vape pen you find. Read reviews and recalls so that you increase your chances of purchasing a quality product.
