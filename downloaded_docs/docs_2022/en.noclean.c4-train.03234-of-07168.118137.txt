What’s Your Weight Loss Secret? COFFEE!
Coffee has always been an everyday on-the-go booster and at the same time, it also boosts your metabolism to easily lose weight. Yes, your everyday fuel can also be your one secret to get that dream body and be part of your diet weight loss plan. But do consult your doctor about making coffee as part of your diet. Know the benefits and risk of what this amazing coffee beans can do for you.
Burning Fat with Coffee
That amazing element on your hot cup called caffeine is the best juice every single person on this planet would love to have more than 3 times a day. Not only does it help us to stay active and productive on a daily basis, but is also a key factor to easily lose weight.
Do you know that 1 cup of freshly brewed coffee can burn almost 9 calories in just one hour? Not much, but absolutely! And it can also help in eliminating your cravings and cut off your appetite.
Losing Weight with your Favorite Coffee Drink
Although coffee alone cannot make you lose weight fast, changing your lifestyle will contribute more. With balanced diet and exercise, you can easily achieve your goal of getting those extra pounds off your body. That means you have to let go of sweets, carb-full meal, soda, fatty and oily food, and unhealthy junk snacks. Substitute them with fruits, lean meat, fish, vegetables, and fresh juices in order to get enough vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay fit and healthy.
So, if you’re the type of person who likes his coffee, sweet and creamy, then you cannot consider that as your diet support drink. Definitely not an alternative. Why? Because sugar and milk, add calories to your cup of hot Joe. 2 teaspoons of sugar alone, with the same proportion of milk adds up to 70 calories on your coffee. See that? Be watchful of your DIY coffee this time.
On the brighter side, we can always try alternatives, here’s how. With the use of organic or natural compounds that can be a replacement for sugar and 1% of fat milk added to your cup of coffee lessens the calories to 20 percent from the former 70. Also, you might want to decrease the intake of your favorite frappe because one serving can produce up to a hefty calorie content of 400 cals! You definitely will not like burning out so much time at the gym just to get rid of those calories.
You might want also to try or shift to organic coffee, which is 100% naturally safe and will really supply you with the caffeine benefits your body and brain needs without any artificial additives.
The Advantages and Drawbacks of Coffee
Aside from the potential weight loss benefits of coffee diet, your daily dose of that hot cup may also help in preventing diabetes, certain cancers like liver cancer, heart attacks and diseases, and Parkinson’s as well as Alzheimer’s disease. Research and studies are being conducted to further bring out the more underlying benefits of coffee to human health and how it can further be a healthy drink for us to avoid beverages that will only harm our health in the long run or will just add numbers to our body’s sugar count. We’re working hard to reduce them and not to add more, right?
Now, a bit of the downside of coffee is that it is not a preferable liquid staple for some. Others may feel an increase in their heart rate, panic attacks, or nervousness after drinking a single cup or less. Whilst those who tend to drink more than the recommended daily consumption may find it hard to get a good night’s sleep and end up tired or in an extremely bad temper. That will surely disrupt your diet plans and efforts you have already started. Lack of sleep will trigger your hungry hormones to push your cravings and increase your food intake for self-satisfaction. This will also make you less aware of your food preferences and proportions and will just pick whatever your appetite wants. So consider getting a good sleep to obtain a healthier and fit body.
Wanting to get fit and fab will always be part of our goal in life. Because, of course, if you look good, you will feel good and will think better which will result in a rewarding aftermath. But always remember that before trying those weight loss programs in the market, visit your diet clinics Leesburg or any trusted weight loss specialists for you to be properly guided on the best program that will suit you and is good for your health. Keep this note to yourself: HEALTH IS WEALTH.
