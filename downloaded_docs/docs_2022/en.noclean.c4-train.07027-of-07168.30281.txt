Mosquito bites can be especially common, irritating, and dangerous when you are pregnant. In addition to the bites being painful and irritating, mosquitoes can spread dangerous diseases, such as West Nile virus and Zika virus, through their bites.[1] In order to avoid mosquito bites while pregnant you will need to both make yourself unattractive to mosquitoes and avoid being around them if you can. With this two-tiered approach, you should be able to avoid the irritation, pain, and potential danger of getting mosquito bites while you are pregnant.[2]
Steps
Method 1
Making Yourself Unattractive to Mosquitoes
1
Use commercial mosquito repellent. The most effective way to prevent mosquito bites while you are pregnant is to use commercial mosquito repellent. Commercial mosquito repellents that contain DEET and picaridin have been approved by the EPA and thus are considered safe to use for pregnant and breast-feeding women.[3]
Follow the directions for when and where to apply, how much to apply, and how often it should be applied. Only apply the repellent on exposed skin and on clothing, not on skin under clothing. Also, keep it away from the eyes and mouth, and use sparingly near the opening of ears.[4]
The commercial mosquito repellent that you use should contain at least 10 percent DEET or picaridin.
Some people are allergic to DEET, so stop using it if it irritates your skin.
2
Use natural mosquito repellents. There are some natural mosquito repellents that can increase your unattractiveness to mosquitoes when used on your skin. These include lemon eucalyptus oil, lavender, cinnamon oil, Greek catnip oil, thyme oil, soybean oil, citronella, and tea-tree oil.[5]
Most of these natural oils should be combined with water and then sprayed on your skin in a diluted form.
For pregnant women concerned about the communicable diseases that can be spread by mosquitoes, natural mosquito repellents should be used in combination with commercial products, not as your only protection.
3
Cover your skin. If you want to make yourself less attractive to mosquitoes you should try to cover up as much skin as possible. Mosquitoes are attracted to various scents released through your skin. If you cover it up, mosquitoes will be able to smell you less effectively.[6]
A few things that mosquitoes are attracted to are heat and carbon dioxide. Pregnant women usually give off more of both of these things.[7]
The color of your clothing may also matter. Mosquitoes have been found to prefer dark colors, so opt for lighter colored clothing when possible.
4
Apply mosquito repellent to your clothes. In addition to wearing clothing that covers most of your skin, you can also apply mosquito repellents such as Picaridin and DEET to your clothing.[8] This provides another layer of protection from mosquito bites.[9]
The best products to apply to your clothes are marked for that use and include the active ingredient permethrin. This is the only FDA approved chemical mosquito repellent approved for use directly on fabric, though should never be applied directly to skin.[10]
Method 2
Avoiding Mosquitoes
1
Stay indoors. The most effective way to avoid getting mosquito bites is to avoid being around mosquitoes. This means that in order to assure that you are not bitten, you will need to stay indoors in rooms that have screens on the windows or have closed windows and air conditioning. Keeping mosquitoes out of your home and staying in your home is the best way to avoid getting bitten.[11]
This is especially important at times of day when they are most active, at dusk and dawn.
2
Use mosquito netting. If you are staying somewhere that is not airtight, and thus mosquitoes can get into your home, then you should use mosquito netting to avoid getting bitten. A bed that is covered in mosquito netting can be very effective in keeping you from getting bitten while you sleep.[12]
If you are spending time outdoors, for instance eating a meal outside, consider covering the area you are spending time in in mosquito netting. A patio or tent that is concealed in mosquito netting will allow you to be outside, while protecting you from mosquito bites.
3
Use mosquito deterrents. There are a variety of products that you can use to keep mosquitoes at bay. The most commonly used product is citronella, which mosquitoes do not like the smell of. Citronella is most commonly put into candles, which are burned to release its odor into the air. However, candles that contain geraniol, a different mosquito deterrent, will be more effective at keeping mosquitoes away than those containing citronella. [13]
Mosquito deterring products, such as Citronella, are available at most home improvement stores, as well as online.
4
Avoid areas where Zika or malaria outbreaks are reported. In order to avoid the risk of getting the Zika virus or malaria, you should not travel to areas where the viruses are active while you are pregnant. Canceling plans is worth avoiding a risk to your health and a risk to your pregnancy.
You can find out where there are current Zika outbreaks or malaria risks by doing an online search and looking at websites of governmental agencies the track disease outbreaks, such as the Center for Disease Control.
Method 3
Treating Mosquito Bites While Pregnant
1
Apply a cold ice pack. Putting a cold ice pack on the affected area can reduce the swelling and itching of mosquito bites. However, do not keep the ice pack on your bites for more than 10 to 20 minutes at a time, and always use a barrier such as a towel between the pack and your skin.[14]
In general, use an ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes once an hour for the first 72 hours after you are bitten. If pain persists, use ice for about 10 minutes 3 times a day.[15]
2
Put aloe vera on your bites. Aloe vera applied to mosquito bites may work in order to minimize swelling. However, aloe vera can cause irritation if left on the skin for a long period of time, so use it sparingly if it irritates you.[16]
Aloe vera can be grown at home. If you are growing aloe vera you can simply cut off a leaf and cut it open to expose the gel inside. This gel is what should be applied to your bites.
3
Avoid irritating the bites. Avoid scratching or rubbing the bite if you can. If you can successfully avoid scratching your bites, they should clear up within a day or two. A bite that has been scratched excessively can open up, raising the risk of infection and additional pain.[17]
It can be very difficult to avoid scratching a mosquito bite that is very itchy. Try covering up the bite with clothing or a bandage so that you don't have access to the bite. This will minimize the chance of you itching the bite without thinking about it.
4
Discuss the use of an over-the-counter medication with your doctor. When you are pregnant you should discuss all medication use with your doctor, even over-the-counter medications. In most cases, your doctor will approve the use of one of these over-the-counter medications to ease symptoms:[18]
Benadryl
Hydrocortisone Cream
Calamine lotion
5
Contact your doctor immediately if you suspect exposure to Zika or other diseases. If you think that you may have been exposed to Zika by getting mosquito bites in an area that has a known Zika threat, then you should contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will then be able to closely monitor your pregnancy and assess any symptoms that might be developing.
Your doctor will likely order tests to see whether you have been infected by the Zika virus.
The doctor will do imaging to assess any impacts the virus may be having on the developing fetus. However, imaging, such as ultrasounds, can see most but not all of the side effects sometimes caused by Zika.

Tips
If you are pregnant and you think you are getting more mosquito bites, it's not your imagination. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide and pregnant women expel more carbon dioxide than non-pregnant people.[19]
Warnings
It is especially important for pregnant women to avoid mosquito bites if they are in an area that is known to have the Zika virus. Zika is a virus spread by mosquitoes that can cause birth defects if pregnant women are bitten. If you are pregnant, you should not visit areas that have the Zika virus.[20] However, if you live in an area where the Zika virus is active, then you need to be especially vigilant about avoiding mosquito bites.[21]
