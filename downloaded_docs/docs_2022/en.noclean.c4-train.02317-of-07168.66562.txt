Methanol Poisoning
Aka: Methanol Poisoning, Methanol, Carbinol, Methyl Alcohol, Wood Alcohol, Wood Naptha
Pathophysiology
Methanol is a common industrial and household solvent (paint remover) and fuel additive
Antifreeze
Perfume
Pain solvents
Windshield washing fluid
Mechanisms of ingestion
Accidental Ingestion by children
Alcoholism with Methanol ingestion when Alcohol unavailable
Bootleg Alcohol (especially in developing nations, and where outlawed in conservative countries)
Industrial workers may inhale Methanol vapors (e.g. formaldehyde production, shellac processing)
Methanol is quickly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract
Serum levels peak within 90 minutes of ingestion
Hepatic Metabolism
Methanol is metabolized into Formaldehyde (via Alcohol dehydrogenase)
Formaldehyde is metabolized into Formic Acid (via aldehyde dehydrogenase)
Formic acid is the primary toxin resulting in most of the ingestion-related damage and Metabolic Acidosis
Formic acid is very slowly metabolized into carbon dioxide and water (via Tetrahydrofolate)
Symptoms
Symptom onset is delayed 12-24 hours from ingestion
Related to delay in metabolism to formic acid
Neurologic
Headache
Altered Level of Consciousness
Seizure
Extrapyramidal symptoms
Parkinsonism
Paresthesias
Tinnitus (from Ototoxicity)
Cardiopulmonary
Dyspnea
Tachypnea
Kussmaul Respirations
Hypotension (or Hypertension)
Bradycardia
Gastrointestinal
Nausea or Vomiting
Ocular
Blurred vision
Double Vision
Progressive Vision Loss
Lab
Serum Methanol level
Available at many community hospitals
Serum Lipase or Serum Amylase
Metabolic panel
Decreased serum bicarbonate
Anion-gap Metabolic Acidosis
Osmolal Gap
Hypomagnesemia
Hypophosphatemia
Differential Diagnosis
See Altered Level of Consciousness
See Toxic Ingestion
See Vision Loss
Ethylene Glycol Toxicity
Liver failure (hyperammonemia)
Renal Failure (Uremia)
Head Injury
Encephalitis
Meningitis
Complications
Vision Loss
Formic acid causes Optic Nerve demyelination
Occurs with serum Methanol levels >20 mg/dl
Onset of ocular changes within 48 hours of ingestion
Parkinsonism
Methanol and metabolites cause Basal Ganglia damage resulting in Parkinsonian-like signs
Onset weeks after ingestion
Hemorrhagic Pancreatitis
Occurs in more than two thirds of Methanol Poisoning
Death
Minimum lethal ingestion: 1 mg/kg
Management
Fomepizole (Antizol)
Start immediately if Methanol toxicity is suspected
Hemodialysis
