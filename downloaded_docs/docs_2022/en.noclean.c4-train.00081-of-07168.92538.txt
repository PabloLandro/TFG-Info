Obviously drinking to the point of water toxicity is bad. But, even short of that, drinking large amounts of water tends to reduce the kidney's ability to function as a filter. Additionally, water can increase your body's ability to excrete electrolytes.
You may not be thirsty, you may be lacking in salt and potassium. And drinking more water only makes it worse.

Technically, too much water can be harmful. If pure water is drank while exerting one's self strenuously to replace lost water from sweat, it is hypothetically possible to get hyponatremia or "water toxicity". This is because pure water is being replaced, but all the other lost minerals are not, and it creates an electrolyte imbalance.
Having said that, doing this while not exercising is extremely unlikely - something to possibly be mindful of on a very, very hot day.
Frequent urination is a side effect of drinking "a lot" of water, but can also be a sign of other conditions. If you are concerned, talk to your doctor.
99% of the time, "drinking a lot of water" (in a colloquial sense, not a medical one) is rarely a bad thing.

As long as you aren't chugging it all in a short amount of time it is fine. Just space out your drinks. Also, if you are drinking a ton of really cold water many believe that can cause problems. Have you ever been checked for diabetes?

Are you trying to lose weight? Are you buying into the BS that water helps you lose bodyfat when in fact it just helps you to lose water AND electrolytes?
You need water to lose weight eh?
Check out naked and scarred the TV show where people are left naked in a deserted area for a month. They find VERY little drinkable water, much less than any normal person consumes in a day let alone 3 freakin litres.
Guess what happened? They didnt die, they were dehydrated, AND they all lost a tremendous amount of fat (and some lbm).
Why? Because they ate much less calories. Macros count little when your eating only 30% of your TDEE. And you need just enough water to survive. In FACT , had they had endless purified water, they might have DIED from losing too many essential vits/minerals etc.

Do you have enough salt in your diet? Too much caffeine-dehydration. Hopefully not diabetes?
