Yes, who would’ve thought that something as simple as baking powder or baking soda can help you fight and win the fight against cancer?
His name is Vernon Johnston and he used baking soda and molasses as the driving force to recover from aggressive stage 4 prostate cancer, which had even metastasized into his bone matter.
Vernon’s Story
Shortly after Vernon was diagnosed with prostate cancer, his son told him to work on raising his pH, because cancer cannot thrive in a high or alkaline pH. So, a few weeks later, Vernon met Larry, who would later recommend the use of cesium chloride to raise his pH levels into a high alkaline level physiologically.
So, Vernon decided that he was not going to use any conventional treatments. This could only mean one thing – Vernon decided to give the alternative therapy a go. So, Vernon ordered the cesium chloride, but it got lost in the mail. So eventually, Vernon looked for another source of raising his pH level into the alkaline range.
After some time, Vernon discovered the remedy of baking powder or bicarbonate of soda with maple syrup. Not having maple syrup in his kitchen, he decided to use the molasses that was handy. He was anxious to kill the cancer before it killed him.
And Vernon also recorded all his treatments and methods in a diary. Vernon called his treatment the last “dance with cancer”. The protocol he used included a good diet to promote alkalinity along with mineral and vitamin supplements, and lots of sunshine. Vernon also practiced breathing exercises to assist the increased oxygenation initiated by the sudden pH rise from sodium bicarbonate. Anaerobic cancer cells cannot tolerate oxygen.
So, he used molasses which worked and actually end up creating a more solid mineral base for his nutritional support. Most experts recommend more than one protocol if one is doing it alone at home. Keep in mind that part of any alternative cancer therapy involves abstinence from processed foods and sugars – sugars especially fuel cancer growth.
How to make this cancer fighting remedy?
It’s very simple – you just have to add two teaspoons of baking soda in a cup, add a teaspoon molasses or maple syrup, and pour a cup water. Consume this mixture few times a day. You can also heat it for the baking soda to dissolve quickly.
After that, Vernon received a medical examination that confirmed his complete reversal of prostate and bone cancer. And yes, Vernon is still telling his story today. There are many different alternative cancer solutions, which are used for more than 100 years.
