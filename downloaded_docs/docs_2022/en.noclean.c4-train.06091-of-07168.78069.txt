The third classification of hemorrhoid herbal remedies are the ones that affect hemorrhoids most directly through the circulatory system. This set of herbs includes butcher's broom, horse chestnut, and the Japanese pagoda tree. Taken internally, butcher's broom narrows blood vessels, improves and strengthens blood vessel walls, and lessens inflammation and swelling. Horse chestnut improves microvascular circulation, lessens fluid retention and brings down swelling. Japanese pagoda tree extract reduces bleeding, helps maintain vein health, and helps with hemorrhoid symptoms such as itching, burning, or inflammation. Because these herbs are taken internally and they affect the workings of the circulatory system, do not take them if you have a heart or blood condition, and check to make sure that they don't interact badly with any ongoing medication you're currently taking.

There are several categories of herbs that qualify as hemorrhoid treatments. The first, and most commonly used, are astringents. This classification covers such hemorrhoid standbys as witch hazel, aloe vera gel, and apple cider vinegar. In short, these herbal extracts reduce inflammation and cause hemorrhoidal tissue to dry out, thus reducing pain, irritation, and itching. Witch hazel and aloe vera gel come in the form of medicated wipes that can be used to pat the area. Apple cider vinegar is generally used on a moistened sterile cotton ball or swab. While many hemorrhoid sufferers find that witch hazel and aloe vera are more effective than apple cider vinegar, if you have vinegar on hand, it does offer enough immediate relief to plan for the future. While medicated pads can't be used directly on internal hemorrhoids, 99% pure aloe vera juice is available as a drink that may assist. A less common herbal astringent is a poultice made from the roots or rhizomes of cranesbill, mashed and used as a poultice.
