Does Green Coffee Assist in the Process of Weight Loss?
There are a number of ways by which you can lose weight. You can exercise for long hours in a gym. You can follow a low calorie diet. Or, you can drink green coffee. It is a fact well established that green coffee comes with a wide array of health benefits that makes it perfect for consumption for those who are interested in living healthy. If you want to flush out all those terrible toxins from your body, then drinking green coffee on a regular basis can help you to do just that. Green coffee can be taken before or after meals and it is also known to be useful for weight loss. If you have put on a few extra pounds and want to look in shape, without having to sweat it out for long hours in a fitness center or follow an undesirable and unpalatable low calorie diet, then you can simply drink green coffee two to three times in a day for best results. To know more about how green coffee can help you to lose weight and give you that figure that you so desire, read on.
Why is Green Coffee Healthy?
The manufacture of green coffee beans is something that takes place organically. This means that the coffee beans are not made to go through the oxidation process that regular coffee beans are made to. Green coffee is in fact full of the anti-oxidants that can be used to fight all those free radicals in your body that are responsible for the damage of cells and which should not be allowed to grow and multiply. Some of the anti-oxidants that are included in green coffee are Vitamin C, Vitamin E as well as beta carotene all of which play an active role in boosting your immunity system and in keeping your body entirely free from disease. Green coffee also contains catechins. The catechins are active ingredients that help to improve your body’s metabolism, helping you to digest your food more easily and to lose weight more readily and quickly.
Why Should you Consume Green Coffee for Weight Loss?
1. Assists in the Fat Burning Process
It is believed by health experts around the world, that the active ingredients which are contained in green coffee, known as catechins, are those that are responsible for fat burning. You can thus get rid off considerable amounts of fat in your body by drinking green coffee for about two to three times in a day.
2. Facilitates Fat Oxidation
The antioxidants that are present in green coffee are known to improve the process of a fat oxidation as well, leading to a higher rate of insulin activity and metabolism, which in turn helps in the process of weight loss greatly. You will find yourself having reduced body weight by a few pounds at least when you drink coffee for two to three weeks at a stretch, without a gap or a miss in between.
3. Low Calorie Content
One of the most important reasons why green coffee helps in the process of weight loss, is the fact that it does not contain a lot of calories. The low calorie content of green coffee allows you to enjoy consuming this beverage while avoiding putting on a lot of weight at the same given time. You can easily include green coffee as a part of your snack time in the evenings. You can also drink green coffee at the time of breakfast every morning. You will not only be able to avoid putting on weight but you can improve your digestive health too.
4. Calming and Sedative Effect on the Brain which assists Weight Loss
A crucial reason why green coffee is associated with the weight loss process is the fact that it contains an amino acid that is known as theanine. Theanine helps in the fat oxidation process. It also has quite a sedative or calming effect on the brain which in turn is believed to help with the weight loss process as well. You will find yourself losing weight within just a few weeks when you include the intake of green coffee as a part of your daily diet. The more green coffee you consume, the slimmer and trimmer you become in shape.
Which is the Best Time of the Day to Have Green Coffee?
The best time of the day to have green coffee is undoubtedly in the morning hours. This is the time when you really need to flush out the toxins in your body and allow your body to rejuvenate and restore itself internally. A fine way to benefit from your consumption of green coffee is to first have a glass of water on an empty stomach followed by a hot cup of green coffee. You will feel refreshed and comfortable from within, while enabling yourself to lose that awful body weight that has been bogging you down for such a long time.
Things to Know when Drinking Green Coffee
1. Have it After Meals
If you intend on taking green coffee on a regular basis in order to improve your health and keep your body in shape, then you need to remember to take it regularly. You should have two to three cups of green coffee in a day, after meals rather than before your meals, as the green coffee can help you to digest your food rather easily while keeping you from putting on weight a bit too easily.
2. Follow a Good Diet
If you want to lose weight through your intake of green coffee, then you need to make sure that you follow up on the dietary front as well. For instance, oil rich foods are those that you definitely need to avoid if you wish to lose weight through green coffee consumption. The oil rich foods will only add all the empty calories to your body that you burn or remove with the help of green coffee.
Conclusion
Thus, there are quite a few ways by which green coffee can help you to lose weight quickly and easily. It is always better to opt for drinking green coffee and losing weight easily rather than spending several hours in the gym working out. Signing up for a membership at a fitness center is often quite expensive and it also takes a considerable amount of time for you to see the improvement in yourself. Of course going to a fitness center also helps you to build muscles and create a nice body. However, when it comes to losing weight in particular, green coffee consumption can prove to be far more effective, inexpensive and less tiresome. Green coffee is something that you can easily have before your meals or after meals, though it is preferred that you have green coffee after meals. It also has no side effects so you don’t ever have to worry about suffering from vomiting, nausea or indigestion when you include green coffee as part of your daily diet. Rather green coffee assists in digestion and can help you to digest your meals, no matter how heavy these are, rather easily.
