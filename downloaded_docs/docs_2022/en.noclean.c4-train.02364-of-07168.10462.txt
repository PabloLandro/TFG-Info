Exercise Myths Busted
Are Squats Bad for My Knees?
Should I Squat?
Yes! A squat is a very functional movement that we use on a daily basis. If you think about it we do a squat every time we go to the toilet, sit on a chair or get in or out of bed.
Squatting is a safe way to position your body in order to lift something heavy so that your lower back is not taking the full load and your hips, knees and ankles help to divide the load over your centre of gravity.
Why Do My Knees Hurt When I Squat?
Squats should not hurt your knees if you are doing it correctly.
Here is Beth demonstrating bad technique vs good technique
Can you see the difference?
Technique is the key!- Squatting is great for your knees as it incorporates your gluteal muscles (buttocks) as well as your accutane online quadriceps muscles (knees). If these muscles work together they can provide a lot of support to your hips and knees. Your knees will love you for squatting, but it must be done properly!
So Remember…
1. Feet should be hip width apart
2. Back should be straight, not curved forward
3. Stick your bottom back so your knees do not go over your toes
4. Bend at the knees and hips
5. Dig your heels into the floor to then stand back up by straightening your knees and bringing your hips forward
