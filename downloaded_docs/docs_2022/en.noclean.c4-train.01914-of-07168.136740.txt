Hift is the Tinder-like dating app for those with Herpes, (HSV-1, HSV-2), HIV, Hepatitis and other STDs.
If you have an STD and you're looking for love, you've come to the right place.
KEY POINTS: HIV crossed from chimps to humans in the 1920's in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This was probably as a result of chimps carrying the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a virus closely related to HIV, being hunted and eaten by people living in the area.
Are you feeling alone for that you suffer from Herpes(HSV-1.
The lack of transport routes into the North and East of the country accounts for the significantly fewer reports of infections there at the time.11 By 1980, half of all infections in DR Congo were in locations outside of the Kinshasa area, reflecting the growing epidemic.12 In the 1960s, the 'B' subtype of HIV-1 (a subtype of strain M) had made its way to Haiti.So you've got a STD and you're looking for love, support and hope , you've come to the right place!Whether you are looking for Herpes dating, HPV dating, HIV dating or only looking for some support or friendship, Hift will be your ultimate online community.This explains why there is more than one strain of HIV-1.6 The most studied strain of HIV is HIV-1 Group M, which is the strain that has spread throughout the world and is responsible for the vast majority of HIV infections today.HIV-2 comes from SIVsmm in sooty mangabey monkeys rather than chimpanzees.7 The crossover to humans is believed to have happened in a similar way (through the butchering and consumption of monkey meat). As a result, it infects far fewer people, and is mainly found in a few countries in West Africa like Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.8 Studies of some of the earliest known samples of HIV provide clues about when it first appeared in humans and how it evolved.
