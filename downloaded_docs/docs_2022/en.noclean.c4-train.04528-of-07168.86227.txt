Methanol is very harmful for human beings. It makes our liver toxic and when we drunk a pure methanol our metabolism became formic acid.

Reason behind death due to methanol:
It is detected through its spectral emission lines. Methanol when drunk is metabolized first to formaldehyde and then to formic acid or formate salts. These are poisonous to the central nervous system and may result in blindness, coma, and death.
Methanol has a high toxicity in humans. As little as 10 mL of pure methanol when drunk is metabolized into formic acid, which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve. 15 mL is potentially fatal.
