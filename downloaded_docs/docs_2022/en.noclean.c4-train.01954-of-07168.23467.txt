A urinary tract infection (UTI) can strike anyone — even babies.
But adult women tend to get UTIs and the accompanying uncomfortable UTI symptoms — like painful urination, lower abdominal cramping, and low back pain — more than anyone else.
In fact, women are 10 times more likely than men to get a urinary tract infection, and one in five women will have a UTI at some point.
Why women are more prone to UTIs isn't completely understood, but experts do know that the way a woman's body is put together creates a perfect setup for bacteria to enter the urinary tract.
The urethra, which is the tube through which urine exits the body from the bladder, is shorter in women than in men. That makes it quicker and easier for bacteria to infiltrate the bladder.
And a woman's urethra is closer to the anus, allowing those bacteria to reach the urethra without going far.
One thing that increases a woman’s risk of getting a UTI even more? Sexual activity.
How Is Sex Connected to UTIs?
Sex is a common cause of UTIs in women because sexual intercourse introduces bacteria into a woman's urinary tract.
During sex, the urethra comes into contact with the bacteria from the genital area and anus, allowing them to enter the urethra, the bladder, and possibly eventually the kidneys, and result in an infection.
In fact, almost 80 percent of premenopausal women with a UTI have had sex within the previous 24 hours.
Any time a woman has sex, she's coming into contact with bacteria, and putting herself at risk for a UTI.
Using a diaphragm for birth control increases the risk even more, as the location of the diaphragm doesn't allow the bladder to totally empty itself — allowing urine and bacteria to collect. Using a spermicide also increases the risk of UTI from sex, as does irritation of the genitals from sex.
When a woman first starts having sex, she's more likely to get a urinary tract infection. She's most at risk the first time she has sex with a new partner. Frequent sex increases the risk of developing a UTI, too, as does having more sex partners.
Urinary tract infections have been nicknamed "honeymoon cystitis" — cystitis is another name for an infection of the bladder — because frequent intercourse often leads to the development of a UTI.
5 Ways to Prevent UTIs Associated With Sex
You don't have to stop having sex to prevent UTIs. Here are some steps you can take to minimize bacteria buildup and reduce your risk of getting UTIs from sex:
Urinate before sex, and promptly after.
Clean your genital and anal areas before and after sex.
Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water; this will help rid your urinary tract of bacteria.
Don't use a diaphragm or spermicide as your form of birth control.
Men can also develop urinary tract infections from sex, so they should also always be sure to thoroughly clean their genitals before and after sex. Wearing a condom can also help reduce a man's risk of getting a UTI from sex.
If you do notice the symptoms of a urinary tract infection, seek UTI treatment from your doctor right away. If you get UTIs often, your doctor may give you antibiotics to take at the first sign of symptoms.
Urinary tract infections are quite common, and unfortunately, getting one puts you at a greater risk of having more in the future.
But taking care to minimize the bacteria that enters the urinary tract can help keep you safe from painful urinary tract infections.
