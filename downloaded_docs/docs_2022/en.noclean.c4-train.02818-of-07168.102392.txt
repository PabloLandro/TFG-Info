Prehosp Disaster Med 2018 Oct;33(5):543-549
Loughborough Design School,Loughborough University,Leicestershire,UK.
IntroductionA Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and explosive (CBRNe) event is an emergency which can result in injury, illness, or loss of life. The emergency department (ED) as a health system is at the forefront of the CBRNe response with staff acting as first receivers. Emergency departments are under-prepared to respond to CBRNe events - recognizing key factors which underlie the ED CBRNe response is crucial to provide evidence-based knowledge to inform policies and, most importantly, clinical practice.

Scand Cardiovasc J 2018 06 16;52(3):141-148. Epub 2018 Mar 16.
d Department of Cardiology, Division of Medicine , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.
Objectives: Haemodynamic monitoring during post arrest care is important to optimise treatment. We compared stroke volume measured by minimally-invasive monitoring devices with or without thermodilution calibration, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and hypothesised that thermodilution calibration would give stroke volume index (SVI) more in agreement with TTE during targeted temperature management (TTM).
Design: Comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors receiving TTM (33 °C for 24 hrs) underwent haemodynamic monitoring with arterial pulse contour analyses with (PiCCO2®) and without (FloTrac/Vigileo monitor) transpulmonary thermodilution calibration. Read More

Introduction Members of faith-based organizations (FBOs) are in a unique position to provide support and services to their local communities during disasters. Because of their close community ties and well-established trust, they can play an especially critical role in helping communities heal in the aftermath of a mass-fatality incident (MFI). Faith-based organizations are considered an important disaster resource and partner under the National Response Plan (NRP) and National Response Framework; however, their level of preparedness and response capabilities with respect to MFIs has never been evaluated.

International Master Courses in Protection Against CBRNe events,Department of Industrial Engineering and School of Medicine and Surgery,University of Rome Tor Vergata,Italy.
Mathematical modelling is an important tool for understanding the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases, which could be the result of a natural outbreak or of the intentional release of pathogenic biological agents. Decision makers and policymakers responsible for strategies to contain disease, prevent epidemics and fight possible bioterrorism attacks, need accurate computational tools, based on mathematical modelling, for preventing or even managing these complex situations. In this article, we tested the validity, and demonstrate the reliability, of an open-source software, the Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM), designed to help scientists and public health officials to evaluate and create models of emerging infectious diseases, analysing three real cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks: Uganda (2000), Gabon (2001) and Guinea (2014).

Study Objective: Methanol poisoning outbreaks are a global public health issue, with delayed treatment causing poor outcomes. Out-of-hospital ethanol administration may improve outcome, but the difficulty of conducting research in outbreaks has meant that its effects have never been assessed. We study the effect of out-of-hospital ethanol in patients treated during a methanol outbreak in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2014. Read More

Cyanide toxicity is common after significant smoke inhalation. Two cases are presented that provide framework for the discussion of epidemiology, pathogenesis, presenting signs and symptoms, and treatment options of inhalational cyanide poisoning. An evidence-based algorithm is proposed that utilizes point-of-care testing to help physicians identify patients who benefit most from antidotal therapy. Read More

Unlabelled: September 11, 2001 saw the dawn of the US-led global war on terror, a combined diplomatic, military, social, and cultural war on terrorist activities. Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE), as a group of tactics, are often the preferred weapons of terrorists across the globe. We undertook a survey of US medical schools to determine what their self-reported level of training for terrorist events encompasses during the four years of undergraduate medical education.

Introduction: Emergency healthcare providers are required to care for victims of Chemical, Biological, Radiologic, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) agents. However, US emergency departments are often ill prepared to manage CBRNE casualties. Most providers lack adequate knowledge or experience in the areas of patient decontamination, hospital-specific disaster protocols, interagency familiarization, and available supply of necessary medical equipment and medications.

Antidotes for poisoning by alcohols that form toxic metabolites.
Authors:
Kenneth McMartin Dag Jacobsen Knut Erik Hovda
Br J Clin Pharmacol 2016 Mar 4;81(3):505-15. Epub 2016 Jan 4.
The Norwegian CBRNe Centre of Medicine, Department of Acute Medicine, Division of Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424, Oslo, Norway.
The alcohols, methanol, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, have many features in common, the most important of which is the fact that the compounds themselves are relatively non-toxic but are metabolized, initially by alcohol dehydrogenase, to various toxic intermediates. These compounds are readily available worldwide in commercial products as well as in homemade alcoholic beverages, both of which lead to most of the poisoning cases, from either unintentional or intentional ingestion. Although relatively infrequent in overall occurrence, poisonings by metabolically-toxic alcohols do unfortunately occur in outbreaks and can result in severe morbidity and mortality. Read More
