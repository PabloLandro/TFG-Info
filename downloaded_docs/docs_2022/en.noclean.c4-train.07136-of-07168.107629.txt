Morphine Addiction
What is Morphine Addiction?
Morphine addiction is a growing problem in society today, and without professional help, morphine addiction will take the ultimate toll of death to the addict. Morphine is a highly addictive, opiate-based prescription medicine that is used for pain management following surgery or chronic illness.
Once the physical and psychological dependence associated with morphine addiction has developed, it becomes a complex disorder that will require professional morphine treatment to overcome.
You Can Break The Addiction
When a dose of morphine is missed or abstinence is attempted, withdrawal symptoms can occur such as:
Diarrhea, nausea or vomiting
Sweats, chills, shakes or tremors
Insomnia, depression, erratic behavior
Intense cravings for the drug
Depending on the duration and severity of the addiction, these withdrawal symptoms can become dangerous or life-threatening and professional treatment will be needed to ensure safe withdrawal.
Getting Help To Break A Morphine Addiction Is The Answer
A person never chooses to become an addict when they begin using prescription drugs such as morphine. Often, a person will ask themselves how they got addicted, and why. Most opiate-based prescription drugs such as morphine are considered safe when used according to directions, but studies show that even the slightest variation in dosage can lead to dependence or addiction.
As with illegal drugs, prescription drug addictions can force a person to lie and steal to continue the habit, and become someone who can’t be trusted anymore.
