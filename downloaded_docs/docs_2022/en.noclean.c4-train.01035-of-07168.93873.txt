So true about taking pics after leg day. Bolsen, you're good at pushing heavy weight, why not just leave it at that?

Actually the dangers of knees over toes is proving to be overrated. Brad Schoenfeld has said that yes, having your knees go forward is gonna put stress on your knees, but no enough to cause any kind of damage.
I also saw this the other day...
http://www.luciano.si/images/blog015_raziskava.pdf
It says that when knees shot forward (unrestricted), it added 250% more force on the knee.....but when trying to keep your shins vertical and knees back (restricted), it added 2000% more force to the hips.
And here is a breakdown by The Strength Guys
Repost of the Week - Are Squats bad for your knees?
Mclaughlin, Lardner & Dillman (1978) noted that the shins should remain as vertical as possible to reduce torque on the knees. While it is true that torque increases as the knee travels further forward, they did not account for hip torque. In 2003, Fry et al. did just that and saw a ~1000% increase in hip torque when preventing the knees from passing the toes, as compared to a ~250% increase in knee torque when the knees were allowed to pass the toes.
The "don't let your knees past your toes" cue is given to beginners to avoid the habit of putting the weight on their toes, making it more difficult/nearly impossible to engage the hamstrings. The two main preventative mechanisms of going into anterior tibial translation are the ACL and the Hamstrings. If the Hamstrings are not engaged in the squat that burden is placed on the ACL.
So are Squats bad for your knees? Absolutely not. Squats with bad form are bad for your knees. Control the movement and distribute your weight correctly and reap the benefits out of one of the best exercises available.

SSB has helped my BB squat form tremendously. John Meadows has me use a SSB every few weeks for squats and when I go back to BB, I find it easier to stay more upright and tighter.

You are correct, however it's my opinion that you are severely limiting your potential if you don't squat

Again, learn how to squat correctly. You are just proving my point, the squat is too difficult to learn so the lazy people skip it. That's you...the "lazy people."
I went Camp Crystal Lake when I was younger.

Everyone trying to go against squats either has a bag ego with them or has bad form from some underlying issue or to big of an ego to start over and re-learn with better form. Or they are too lazy, since 9x out of 10, because will say they hate squats. Everyone at my gym hate them, except 2 of us.

I'm not against someone not doing squats, but I personally feel like I don't do anything meaningful during my routine when I take squats out sometimes to rest my body.

i squat, but i have zero problem with people who dont. i dont deadlift, it is a overrated exercise for me personaly. i dont know how many people have annoyed me because i dont deadlift anymore. same with shoulder presses and barbell bench press. i find that dumbells are way better for both chest and delts and military press is probably the most overrated excersise ever to me. i dont like barbell curl, bothers my wrists, i just do dumbells and ez-bar. arnold would probably crucify me because i dont do flat barbell bp or bb curls, but i just do what i like to do.
front squats, barbell row, pull ups, incline db bp, isolation stuff for the delts are MY bread and butter exercises.

ask yourself what the goal is...to prove that you can learn how to squat properly, or to grow wheels as big as you can?
