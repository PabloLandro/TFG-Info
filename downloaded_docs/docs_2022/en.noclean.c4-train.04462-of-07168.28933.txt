A lot of people would want to have an edge on losing weight with some practical and familiar routine that we know of. From exercising early in the morning to working out in a gym, drinking coffee has now been proven to help us lose weight.
What is Coffee?
Coffee, one of the most consumed drinks in the world, is a brewed beverage with a distinct aroma and flavor, extracted from the roasted seeds of the Coffee plant. Although the Ethiopian first recognized its significant effect, its origin still traces back to the 9th century in southern Arabia where the first coffee cultivation also took place. The coffee bean is the seed of a round red cherry fruit of a tropical evergreen shrub. A coffee tree is capable of growing more than 30 feet high. The trees can live as long as 20 – 30 years and are capable of growing in a wide range of climates, as long as there is no variation of temperature that will affect their cultivation. They are usually planted in rich soil and mild temperatures.
In the commercial coffee industry, there are two important and most common coffee types—arabica and canephora, more commonly called robusta. Robusta grows at lower elevations and produces higher yield per plant. It is also a more disease resistance than its Arabica relative. Robusta beans are notable for their unfavorable, dirty flavor with twice much caffeine than the normal yield. Its low costs of production make Robustas favorite by a lot of coffee roasters. The Arabica species, on the other hand, grows best at higher elevations and is the source of all the world’s great coffees. About 75 percent of the world’s total production of coffee is Arabica and at most 10 percent of that is actually of “specialty” quality.
Coffee is more than just a morning drink. Coffee is also a famous anti-oxidant drink in many countries especially in the US. Coffee contains a high level of antioxidants which have been linked to a variety of health benefits through continuous studies and research. The antioxidants from coffee have been found out to reduce the risk of colorectal and liver cancer, asthma, type-2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Why Coffee?
Over the years, coffee is entitled as body beauty slimming coffee for various reasons. One is that the caffeine in the coffee suppresses your appetite thus leading to weight loss. However, this reason is highly debatable and inconclusive since there has been no further study to fully understand how long exactly the appetite is suppressed. Second reason is connected to the diuretic properties of caffeine that makes one person go to the bathroom more. The loss of water will make a difference on a person’s weight but is still not enough to support its effectiveness on weight loss since loss of water is not much significant and reliable in losing weight. The third and the proven reason of losing weight by drinking coffee is through the thermogenic properties of coffee. The caffeine in coffee boosts your metabolism so you can burn more of the calories you consume. This greatly contributes in weight loss because if you’re burning more calories, there will only be few fats to be converted and stored. When you use a controlled calorie coffee, weight loss is even more achieved.
Types of Effective Coffee
Green Bean Coffee
One of the best and common Coffee Drink that has been proven to help lose a significant amount of weight is the green bean coffee. Green beans coffee are simply coffee beans that have not yet been roasted. The unroasted green beans coffee contains a higher amount of chlorogenic acid which is said to lessen and slow down the release of glucose in the body, thus, losing weight. Green beans coffees that are roasted contain little to no chlorogenic acid.
Black coffee
Black coffee is also the most practical way and by far the best option of losing weight. One cup of black coffee offers a small amount of calories because it is basically a calorie-free beverage. What’s more is that coffee contains antioxidants which fight free radicals that threatens our health. Coffee will also make you more alert to give that extra energy boost to burn down more calories and fats.
Skinny Latte
Skinny Latte is also a good weight lose Coffee drink as it cut down the fat milk and sweetener to lower the calories present. Starbucks have made this option possible for drinkers who aim to drink coffee without getting fat. Many coffee shops out there would also be happy to accommodate the type of drink you want. You can also order your coffee black, and then choose your own low-calorie fixings.
Losing some weight without much effort needed can now become attainable. However, one must continue to take guard on one’s health and consult the Doctor if necessary.
