Most people think of ginger as a remedy for flu and only consume it in the cold season. Few are aware of the essential health benefits of ginger and how this plant can improve your well-being all year long.
We put together a list of all the amazing ways in which ginger is good for you according to science and medical research. If you are not using this spice in your daily meals, here are some excellent reasons to do it!
1. Ginger improves digestion
Traditional medicine often uses ginger in remedies for several digestive problems, including bloating, abdominal pain and constipation. It is a rich source of antioxidants and healthy compounds that help you empty your stomach safely, naturally and without damaging the gut mucus.
If you are struggling with indigestion, you can consume ginger tea to get an alleviating relief from stomach cramps. You can also grate fresh ginger root and add it to your meals to improve regular digestion and prevent bloating.
2. Ginger has anti-inflammatory benefits
Medical research shows that regular consumption of ginger can diminish the risk of inflammation. This plant contains functional ingredients like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols that fight off common conditions like osteoarthritis, joint pain, and stiffness.
The best way to profit from the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger is to take a highly-concentrated supplement, especially if your condition is at an advanced stage. Additionally, you can combine ginger, cinnamon and sesame oil in a home remedy that alleviates articulation pain and stiffness.
3. Ginger is good for nausea
Doctors recommend ginger to pregnant women to reduce morning sickness and nausea. This plant contains a potent mix of medicinal compounds that can relieve sickness and feelings of revulsion and vomiting.
Ginger is also great for people who undergo chemotherapy treatments or post-surgery nausea. You can consume it raw or as an infusion to alleviate stomach pain and to reduce the burning sensation from Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
4. Ginger has antioxidant properties
Ginger is a rich source of antioxidants. People have been using it for centuries to increase immunity, heal minor colds and reduce the symptoms of the flu. It has powerful antibacterial properties and can be a soothing natural remedy for a sore throat, intense cough, headaches, and fatigue.
You should drink a few cups of ginger tea every week during the cold season to maintain your immunity high and stave off potential flu viruses and microbes. If you do not like the taste of the infusion, you can always add ginger to your meals in the form of dry spice or freshly-grated root.
5. Ginger is good for muscle soreness
Ginger is a natural painkiller that can relieve muscle pain and soreness. Whether you are a professional athlete or you practice sports occasionally, consuming ginger regularly can reduce muscle aches and tiredness.
The alleviating effect of ginger is not instant. This plant’s painkilling properties work best if it is part of your daily nutrition. Adding ginger to your meals should reduce muscle soreness and help you recover easier and faster from exercise-induced muscle aches.
6. Ginger reduces blood sugar
Clinical studies show that ginger can have a direct impact in preventing diabetes and heart disease. Regular intake can reduce blood sugar and bad cholesterol while improving arterial circulation at the same time.
If you consume ginger regularly, whether as an infusion or dry-powdered spice, you have a good chance of keeping your glucose levels in check. Also, its significant amount of antioxidants supports heart health and protects arteries from oxidative stress and hardening.
7. Ginger can help you lose weight
As part of your meal or an infusion, ginger can increase thermogenesis, which is the biological process responsible for burning fat. Since this plant also lowers blood sugar levels, your body needs extra glucose to consume and create energy. Ginger accelerates this process and improves your chances of losing weight.
If one of your goals is burning a few extra pounds, you can include ginger in any form you prefer in your nutrition. As part of a balanced diet, ginger should support your weight loss efforts in the long run.
8. Ginger alleviates menstrual pain
Due to its essential anti-inflammatory properties, ginger can also ease the menstrual cramps. A medical study refers to its alleviating effect as being on par with the painkilling remedy of ibuprofen. So, if you want to reduce menstrual aches naturally, you can opt for a ginger infusion instead of medication.
9. Ginger enhances brain function
Regular consumption of ginger may reduce the risk of oxidative stress, which is one of the leading causes of brain function deterioration and Alzheimer’s disease. This plant can improve cognitive functions, reduce inflammation and enhance your ability to make and store memories.
The bioactive components of ginger protect the brain against the adverse side effects of aging, such as a decline in mental alertness, memory loss and a difficulty to maintain focus.
10. Ginger increases liver protection
Ginger is efficient in reducing the stress and damage that medication produces to the liver. Patients who undergo extensive medical treatments can take ginger extract to enhance the protection of their livers, and reduce the toxicity level in blood and kidneys.
11. Ginger may help fight cancer
Experts believe that the active substances in ginger may help fight cancer. Compounds like gingerols can lower the rate at which cancer cells reproduce and subsequently the rate of inflammation. While research in this matter is not definitive, experiments continue to use ginger extract against tumors, colon and ovarian cancers.
The Bottom Line
Ongoing research shows the immense benefits of ginger consumption. Slowly, but steadily, this plant rises to the reputation of a superfood, and becomes an essential part in both traditional and modern medicine remedies.
Make ginger a regular ingredient in your diet and profit from the amazing health benefits that it provides. Besides keeping you safe from seasonal flu and minor colds, this plant can also alleviate pain, indigestion, and nausea while providing you with a significant amount of essential antioxidants.
