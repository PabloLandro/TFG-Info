How a doctor and a lawmaker want you to believe that baking soda can cure cancer. NO!!
2/27/2015
A lawmaker and a doctor who believe saltwater and baking soda can cure cancer. NO!!!
Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore believes cancer is “a fungus” which can be cured by “flushing, let’s say, salt water, sodium carbonate” through the body." What happened to responsible people acting responsibly?http://wapo.st/1JRb2kq
Apparently you have to take a doctor's advice with a grain of...baking soda. @FitCampNYC wants to highlight the fact that you should question everything! Even if a doctor or a lawmaker tell you it's good. (in this case, it isn't)
