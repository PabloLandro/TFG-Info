BYRON BAY PUBLIC SCHOOL STOP EXPOSING OUR KIDS TO THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF WIFI GO HARDWIRED

Concerned Parent started this petition to Byron Bay Public School Principal LINDA TRIGG and 1 other
Did you know that Byron Bay Primary School, each individual classroom has a ceiling mounted wifi router that is on 24/7 regardless of whether its being used or not?? These were upgraded mid 2018 without any notice to parents or consent from parents.
Meanwhile in other countries wifi exposure to kids has already been BANNED, limited, and much stricter limits applied as a precaution until "it's deemed safe for human exposure."
2011: The WHO/IARC classified RF-EMF (radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, otherwise known as “wireless radiation”) as a Class 2B Possible Human Carcinogen based on credible evidence that linked long term wireless exposure to brain cancer.
The Class 2B classification includes wireless radiation from any transmitting source such as cellphones, baby monitors, tablets, cell towers, radar, other wifi, etc. It applies to RF-EMF in the range of 30 KHz to 300 GHz emitted from any device- not just cell phones. This fact is detailed in the Lancet’s published statement and in the related press release in 2011. All wireless electronic devices emit RF-EMF (wireless radiation). It does not matter what type of device is the source. While cell phone use at the head results in highest exposures to the brain, many other devices emit lower levels of exposures that can have a cumulative effect on the whole body.
Other 2B carcinogen's are LEAD, DDT and CHLOROFORM!
So just because you can't see the EMF radiation doesn't mean it's not there!!
FRANCE BANS WIFI IN NURSERY SCHOOLS!
On January 29, 2015, the French National Assembly made history by passing a new national law to reduce exposures to wireless radiation electromagnetic fields.
WiFi Banned in Nursery Schools: WIFI and Wireless devices will be banned in “the spaces dedicated to home, to rest and activities of children under 3 years”.
WiFi Minimised in Schools: In schools for children up to 11 years, WIFI routers should be turned off when not in use for pedagogic purposes.
Schools Will be Informed: The board of the school should be informed when new tech equipment is being installed in schools.
Meanwhile Spain, Belgium, Israel, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, India, have all put strict limits/bans on wifi when it comes to exposing children.
BUT THERE IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION:
AND THAT IS TO GET THE WHOLE SCHOOL HARDWIRED. Which follows what other countries have already put in place.
Hardwiring the school is a precautionary approach that many schools in Australia and worldwide have taken already. Byron Bay Public should be one of them!
IT STOPS ANY EXPOSURE TO KIDS. KIDS ABSORB 20% MORE RADIATION THAN ADULTS!
NSW is rolling out $4.2billion dollars to upgrade NSW schools. Byron Bay being one of them. I have spoken to the SINSW and they said Byron Bay public can be hardwired if the Principal and enough parents, community get behind it.
So now more than ever we need signatures to make this happen!!
We can do this together and protect the kids!!
Hardwiring the school is a precautionary approach that many schools in Australia and worldwide have taken already. Byron Bay Public should be one of them!
THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE ASAP AS THE NEW BUILDING HAS ALREADY STARTED AND STILL HAS THE CHANCE TO BE HARDWIRED ALSO IF WE DEMAND IT!!
THINGS WE NEED TO DO:
1: SIGN THIS PETITION and SHARE to protect our kids please!!
2:PRINT OUT THE 'I DO NOT CONSENT TO MY CHILD BEING EXPOSED TO WIFI AT SCHOOL & SIGN. hand this into school addressed to Principal Linda Trigg
3: MAKE A FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SCHOOL AND THE DECISION. https://education.nsw.gov.au/about-us/rights-and-accountability/complaints-compliments-and-suggestions/complaint-compliment-suggestion-form
****And if you are a parent, at home please be vigilant and research the health effects of this new technology and it's effects on kids. The evidence is mounting and it's best to follow countries like France who are more advanced on safety measures and already have precautions in place. It's banned for under 3 year olds. It's easy to switch off wifi and go back to ethernet connection and reduce exposure on kids. Download games on ipads, iphones so children play without wifi on. Switch mp's on airplane mode and switch everything off at night. There is a lot of information online about safe use of technology in the household.****
I am hoping that hardwiring Byron Bay Public will set the precedent so that other primary schools, childcare, nurseries, preschools, kindy's and high schools in the area will also be hardwired. Find out and take action to help protect your kids from EMF radiation****
Please watch this presentation by Dr Erica Blythe as she explains EXACTLY the health risks and why every parent needs to send in a NON CONSENT FORM!

Many thanks for your time.

To Principal Linda Trigg/Natalie Lennon,
I DO NOT give you permission or the school to expose my child to the current wifi EMF radiation that is constantly being omitted 24/7 throughout the school. Nor do I give permission in the new building.
It is in the best interest of my child's health that Byron Bay Primary School needs to be completely hardwired as soon as possible. All existing wifi to be removed in the old building and more hardwiring to be installed. And the new school to be completely hardwired. Further more, a strict policy on teachers mobiles phones should be switched off when in classrooms, and student's phones switched off or banned.
ARPANSA standards are outdated. New 2019 levels need to be measured.
Their current safety standards only protect against the heating of body tissue (thermal effects) in a short period of time. The safety standards do not account for any biological effects from prolonged or accumulative exposure to low level electromagnetic radiation.
ARPANSA also states “research relating to children is limited and the possibility of harm cannot be ruled out”
ARPANSA also have the following below disclaimer on their website:

2011: The WHO/IARC classified RF-EMF (radio frequency electromagnetic fields, otherwise known as “wireless radiation”) as a Class 2B Possible Human Carcinogen based on credible evidence that linked long term wireless exposure to brain cancer.
THIS IS THE SAME CLASSIFICATION AS LEAD, DDT and CHLOROFORM. I DO NOT WANT MY CHILD EXPOSED TO A 2B POSSIBLE CARCINOGEN WHEN THERE IS A SIMPLE ANSWER TO GO HARDWIRED!!
FRANCE BANS WIFI!
On January 29, 2015, the French National Assembly made history by passing a new national law to reduce exposures to wireless radiation electromagnetic fields.
WiFi Banned in Nursery Schools: WIFI and Wireless devices will be banned in “the spaces dedicated to home, to rest and activities of children under 3 years”.

Meanwhile Spain, Belgium, Israel, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, India, all put strict limits/bans on wifi when it comes to exposing children.
Many schools have completely gone completely Hardwired as a safe guard.
Why aren't we?!!
In summery I DO NOT give you permission or the school to expose my child to the current wifi EMF radiation that is constantly being omitted 24/7 throughout the school. Nor do I give permission in the new building.
Thank you for your time
