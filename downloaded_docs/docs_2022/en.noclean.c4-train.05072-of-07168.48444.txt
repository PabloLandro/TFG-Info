Do you have hemorrhoids? If you do, you have probably been told that your diet is causing them.
But‚Ä¶does a poor diet really result in hemorrhoids? What is the best diet for hemorrhoids?
In this post we will share best foods to eat for hemorrhoids and also let you know what foods and drinks to avoid to keep your them away. If your looking for the right hemorrhoid diet, we‚Äôve got your back.
While diet may not always be the reason for your hemorrhoids, in many cases it is responsible.
Here are several foods that make a great diet for hemorrhoids:
Whole grains
Lots of water
Fish
Nuts
Vegetables
Fruits
Quinoa
Lentils
Grilled chicken
Grilled turkey
Remember to eat the grilled chicken and turkey in normal amounts. Overeating meat can back up your digestive system and cause hemorrhoids.
Here are some foods and drinks to avoid when choosing a diet for hemorrhoids:
Excess pizza
Excess red meat
Processed foods
Alcohol
Coffee
Caffeinated tea (caffeine will dehydrate you)
Spicy foods
Hot sauce
Hemorrhoids are frequently caused by constipation and in some cases caused by diarrhea (1). If you are constipated and suffering with hemorrhoids, you‚Äôll want to take a look at what you are eating or drinking that is causing your constipation.
Avoid these foods to keep hemorrhoids away.
Now, there are many things that can cause constipation other than food.
So, check this list first to see if one of these might be causing your constipation:
Certain medications (2)
Not exercising, walking, or being active
Being stressed
Not using the bathroom when you need to
Too many laxatives
Eating to many antacids
Hypothyroidism (3)
Cancer of the colon
Digestive system problems (connective tissue, muscular and nerve) (4)
IBS
Pregnancy
Bulimia
Anorexia
If you are frequently constipated and one of the above is causing your constipation, make sure you see a doctor to find out how you may address the issue.
Once you have addressed that issue, let‚Äôs take a look at how you can change your diet for hemorrhoids.

The Most Common Poor Diet Scenario
Often times the first thing we do in the morning is have a coffee. While this isn‚Äôt necessarily bad for hemorrhoids, coffee does dehydrate you in strong enough doses (5, 6, 7).
For most people, coffee sends you right to the bathroom in the morning.
But, if your one of those people who finds yourself straining on the toilet seat or sitting for longs periods of time before passing a bowel movement, coffee might be your problem.
When you go to bed at night, you won‚Äôt get any fluids for at least 6-8 hours. That means you are dehydrated when you wake up. Add some strong coffee in the mix first thing in the morning, and now you could be very dehydrated.
That is why I have a full glass of water first before I have coffee. I make sure I‚Äôm hydrated and my bowel movements have been great‚Ä¶.and guess what? I don‚Äôt have hemorrhoids.
Is Alcohol Bad for Your Hemorrhoids Diet?
If your searching for the right hemorrhoids diet, you better believe that alcohol is nowhere near it.
Like strong coffee, alcohol dehydrates your system (8). A lack of fluids in your body (dehydration) can cause all sorts of digestive system problems, including hemorrhoids (9).
If you are drinking too much alcohol, you are going to be dehydrated unless you also drink lots of water.
The worst thing you can do is have alcohol at night and then coffee in the morning before drinking water.
You will back your system up and really put some stress on your digestive system and bowels.
When Should I Try a Liquid Diet for Hemorrhoids?
Your doctor may recommend a liquid diet for you if you have a hemorrhoidectomy or PPH Stapled Hemorrhoidectomy.
The reason is that passing a bowel movement can be very uncomfortable and possibly damaging to the surgery and your sutures.
Passing a bowel movement after hemorrhoid surgery can be extremely painful (10).

Is There a Diet for Internal Hemorrhoids?
Whether you have internal or external hemorrhoids, your diet should be the same. Make sure to drink plenty of water, avoid processed foods and red meat, eat complex carbohydrates, nuts, vegetables and fruits.
Many people have reported a change in the severity of their hemorrhoids after changing their diet (11).
Is a High Fiber Diet Important for Hemorrhoids?
Yes, a high fiber diet is very important for hemorrhoids, especially when you are constipated (12). While you can use stool softeners or supplements with fiber, we recommend that you change your diet first.
Using laxatives is a very poor long-term solution as it can cause health issues. Supplements with fiber can work, but you‚Äôre better off changing your diet first or using our amazing herbal supplement for hemorrhoids, called HemRid.
