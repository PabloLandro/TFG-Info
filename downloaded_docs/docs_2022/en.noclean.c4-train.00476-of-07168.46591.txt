6 positive effects of ginger against nausea, colds, muscle aches and other problems
Ginger, a centuries-old natural remedy
Ginger has been used in China and India for centuries before being recognized in other parts of the world. Ginger roots are used as a spice and natural remedy against various diseases
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regards ginger as a food supplement and has not recognized it as a drug, but some studies suggest the use of ginger to relieve certain conditions. In this regard, we have prepared for you some recipes where you can use ginger to make your diet tastier and healthier.
Why is ginger good for your health?
Here’s why ginger can be beneficial for your health:
1. Ginger can help relieve nausea
There are facts proving that ginger is an effective remedy for nausea. It helps alleviate nausea when they represent side effects of chemotherapy and treatment for HIV / AIDS or when they are due to other causes, such as morning sickness in pregnant women, motion sickness and postoperative nausea. While its anti-nausea effects are proven, it seems that ginger doesn’t help prevent vomiting.
2. Ginger can help reduce muscle pain after sport
In a study conducted by the University of Georgia, it was found that ginger helps reduce post-exercise muscle pain by 25% among participants. But it was a small study involving 74 people. It takes more research to confirm the efficacy of ginger on this subject.
3. Ginger can help relieve menstrual pain
It has been proven that taking 1,500 mg of ginger daily in 2 divided doses during the first 3 days of menstruation can relieve pain and other symptoms.
4. Ginger can be used as a cure for colds and flu
Ginger appears to have antiviral and antibacterial properties. Drinking ginger tea when you have a cold or flu can help relieve symptoms and keep you warm. Add some lemon and honey to your tea for a better effect.
5. Ginger can lower blood cholesterol
In one study, participants who had high cholesterol level took 1 gram of ginger three times a day for 45 days and saw their total cholesterol and triglyceride levels drop. These results suggest that ginger can help keep your heart and vessels healthy.
6. Ginger can be beneficial for people with arthritis
Ginger may have anti-inflammatory properties, and some studies show that it can help relieve joint pain in people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
