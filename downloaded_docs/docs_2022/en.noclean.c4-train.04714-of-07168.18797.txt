In this article we will explain to you the steps involved in wisdom teeth removal recovery. Following wisdom teeth extraction, it is important to maintain cleanliness and good oral hygiene. You can use salt water rinse and gently rinse, but try not to over-stimulate the extraction socket. Four days post extraction, you can brush your teeth but stay away from the extraction site. At this stage, it is better not to use oral rinse, but salt water rinse are recommended and will not dislodge the clots. Avoid touching the area with your fingers and rubbing it with your tongue.
However, do not rinse your mouth, brush your teeth, use a mouthwash, or spit during the first 24 hours following the extraction procedure. Rinse with warm salt water after meals and every 2 hours while awake. Do this for about a week after the surgery, mixing half a teaspoon of table salt and eight ounces of water. Resume brushing after the first 24 hours. To be on the safe side, you may slosh water instead of swishing it. Tilt your head from side to side and to get the water out, tilt it over the sink.
You do not have to spit in this way. In any case, it is not recommended to brush your teeth during the first 24 hours because it may open up the wound. This is going to hurt quite bad, and it is better to wait until the next day. These precautions are necessary to avoid complications such as bleeding, infections, dry socket, etc. Once the extraction site heals, you can rinse with a non-alcohol mouthwash which kills bacteria in the mouth and helps prevent infections.
It is important to keep the blood clot intact because if it is lost, this may cause swelling, discomfort, and pain, and will delay the healing process. What is more, the nerve endings will be directly exposed, and this may cause immense pain. It is important to keep the wound clean, avoid smoking, and take steps to prevent complications. Your oral surgeon may recommend oral antibiotics, an antiseptic solution to be applied to the wound, or antibacterial gels and mouthwashes which are applied before and following the surgical procedure.

Tooth extraction blood clot if not fully treated can lead to dry socket. Blood clots are considered to be very crucial when it comes to the healing process after a successful tooth extraction.
Loss of blood clot can trigger an infection after the extraction. If the blood does not clot quickly, the healing process after tooth extraction can be prolonged.
It is highly advisable for a doctor to be contacted as soon as possible when this happens as the blood clot can easily be dislodged within the first twenty four hours after the tooth extraction.
This can be achieved by rinsing vigorously. The process of suctioning via a straw can as well help in dislodging a blood clot. On the other hand, it is believed that hot fluids e.g. coffee can easily dissolve the blood clot.
How to Tell if Blood Clot Formed After Tooth Extraction
There are various ways that one can use to know whether a blood clot has formed after tooth extraction.
Read on to learn these ways.
One way that you can use to determine whether tooth extraction blood clot is keeping the gauze over the tooth extraction area is to apply some pressure for a duration of about an hour. Some people would ask where the gauze will come from. Well, in most cases, once you have been done a tooth extraction, the dentist will provide you with gauze in your mouth over the area that has been treated.
After an hour, you are free to remove the gauze keenly to find out whether the bleeding has stopped or not.
The next step that you will be required to do in knowing whether tooth extraction blood clot has formed is applying more gauze that will aid in controlling any bleeding for the first twenty four hours. In most cases, people use a tea bag that has moistened which is considered to work effectively.
This can be used as a substitute and at the same time it helps in the formation of clotting because of the presence of tannic acid(1). In case the bleeding persists after the twenty four hours are over, it is worthwhile to contact your dentist as soon as possible.
The formation of tooth extraction blood clot starts once you notice a dark, red like substance. At times, it may feel like a soft piece of chocolate once you touch it. When touching the site, you are highly advised to be very careful and ensure that you touch it if you find it quite daunting to see the blood clot.
Conclusion
However, this will greatly be determined with the locality where the extraction has been done. While doing this, it is important to utilize the services of a dental mirror to help you during this process. In case you find it necessary to touch the spot, you should do it briefly but if you cannot see the dark clot, you shouldn’t do it. Avoid brushing your teeth but instead rinse it gently using a solution of salty and warm water for the following consecutive days

Tooth Extraction Complications

There are several tooth extraction complications that are requiring ample precaution to avoid them from causing adverse effects. It is important for a patient to note that with this type of surgery, there can be complications or even problems thereafter. In addition to this, a patient is supposed to know that the teeth located in the bottom jaw tend to have more extraction complications as compared to the top teeth.
While this is the case, patients should stay prepared for any complications that may occur in order to know how well you can be able to curb them. Once the extraction has been carried out, you will experience some swelling, pain as well as bleeding. However, all these become a problem if they persist. When this happens, it is important to contact or see the doctor as soon as possible. In addition, in case you experience the provided complications below, be on the alert to contact your doctor as soon as you can for the necessary precaution to be taken.
One of the major tooth extraction complications is dry socket which is pain that persists for several days. It usually takes place when there is blood clot dislodged from the socket. When this happens the bone underneath is exposed which n return causes severe pain. While this takes place, your doctor will be prompted to restitch the region and at the same time prescribe antibiotics that you will use to guard against infection.
Allergic reaction is one of the major tooth extraction complications which occur when the jawbone, tongue or throat happens to swell to the point where it causes difficulty in breathing. This is a clear indication that you have an allergic reaction which requires you to call your dentist immediately.
In case you experience bad breathe a week shortly after receiving the extraction as you may have some infection. It is the obligation of the doctor to provide you with an antibiotic that will help in preventing the infection. You can as well use warm salt water to rinse the mouth in order to reduce the chances of infection.
Excessive bleeding is one other major tooth extraction complications. In case you experience severe bleeding without ceasing it simply implies that there is a damage done on the blood vessel during the procedure and this means that you require further treatment from your dentist as soon as possible.
However, in case you are involved in smoking or drinking directly from a straw, you will experience minor bleeding for a few days. It is therefore important to avoid this so that your dentist may not end up restitching and packing the extraction area for it to heal.
Alveolar nerve damage is yet one of the major tooth extraction complications. In most cases, this is evident when your bottom teeth tend to lose sensation once a tooth extraction has been done. This simply implies that maybe your dentist has damaged the alveolar nerve. In most case, the nerve sensation should basically come back in 3 months.
Wisdom Teeth Smoking: How It Delays the Healing Process

After the extraction of wisdom teeth smoking is not recommended, and many report developing a dry socket because of smoking following the procedure. Smoking is also a reason for wisdom teeth removal according to the University of Maryland Medical Centre.
Periodontal disease is common among smokers and smoking cigars, pipes, and cigarettes causes gum inflammation. It results in a more intense production of cytokines, which leads to periodontal disease. Moreover, wisdom teeth are a fertile ground for different bacteria to grow which can result in periodontal disease. Thus, there are two factors that increase the risk of dental conditions for which extraction may be required.
As said, smoking may cause a dry socket to develop, and it is recommended to avoid smoking during the first 24 hours. During this period, a blood clot forms over the extraction site. This clot is very important, and it keeps patients from experiencing alveolar osteitis or dry socket.
According to the American Dental Association, this may require special treatment such as pain medications and medicated gauze dressings. Sucking actions, for example, dragging on a cigarette and drinking from a straw, can dislodge this clot, increasing the risk of developing dry socket. For this reason, smoking should be avoided during the first day following the extraction.
After the removal of wisdom teeth smoking is not advisable, and some recommend not to smoke for two or three weeks after the surgery. Smoking puts fine, hot particles in the mouth, and they increase the risk of infection. Mouthwash does not help with this and in fact, using mouthwash during the first couple of days can contribute to or cause dry socket to develop.
Persons with severe addiction who must smoke are advised to wait at least a couple of days (three to five). It is important not to suck rigorously because this can dislodge the blood clot. Nicotine patches may be of help so that patients avoid the urge to lit a cigarette. If possible, avoid smoking until the extraction site has healed completely.
Finally, after the extraction of wisdom teeth smoking should be avoided because it makes blood thinner. This delays or stops the clotting process, and the wound takes longer to heal.
Wisdom Teeth Dry Socket, Complications, and Treatment

Wisdom teeth dry socket represents a hole in the bone at the site at which the wisdom tooth has been pulled. After the tooth is removed, a blood clot forms inside the socket, and it protects the bone tissue and nerves underneath.
In some cases, the blood clot dissolves or becomes dislodged several days after the removal.
This leaves the nerve and bone exposed to fluids, food, and air. Possible complications include severe pain and infection that may last for 5 to 6 days.
Wisdom Teeth Dry Socket Symptoms
Who is likely to get a wisdom teeth dry socket after a tooth is extracted? In this group are women who use birth control pills, persons who have poor oral hygiene, those who smoke, have a history of dry socket, have wisdom teeth pulled, and have had a complicated extraction surgery.
In general, dry socket, also referred to as alveolar osteitis represents a painful condition. This is a common complication after wisdom tooth extractions, including the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth. If dry socket develops, pain typically begins 1 to 3 days after removal.
Among them are visible bone inside the socket and total or partial loss of the blood clot, as a result of which you can notice a dry or empty looking socket.
Another symptom is severe wisdom teeth pain a couple of days after the tooth removal procedure. Unpleasant taste in the mouth is yet another symptom, as well as foul odor and bad breath in the mouth.
Another is pain radiating from the dry socket to the neck, temple, eye, or ear on the side of the face where extraction took place. Finally, swollen lymph nodes on the neck or jaw indicate that dry socket has occurred.
What are the ways to treat wisdom teeth dry socket?
It is important to visit to dentist’s office where the dentist will have the tooth socket cleaned and will remove any debris and other particles from the hole. Then, the dentist will place a special passed or a medicated dressing in the hole to speed up the healing process. You may have to visit the dentist’s office for a dressing change every day until the pain lessens and the socket heals.
The dentist may prescribe you some antibiotic so that the socket does not become infected.
Wisdom Teeth Healing Process: Activities That Delay It

The wisdom teeth healing process involves healing of all wound surfaces. The socket’s floor heals vertically while its sides heal laterally. Healing normally takes place through a process known as organization. Blood vessels and fibrous connective tissue (granulation tissue) grow and penetrate the blood clot. Epithelial tissue also grows on the top of the socket. It should be noted that the blood clot may be unrecognizable because its red coloration fades out with exposure to saliva.
Manipulation of the socket is not recommended during the wisdom teeth healing process. In fact, this may delay it to the extent the patient disturbs the blood clot. Aspirin should be avoided as well because it thins the blood, and there is a risk your mouth may bleed.
Remember that it is normal for the extraction site to be tender during the first couple of days. Bruising and swelling sometimes occur following wisdom teeth extraction. The worst jaw stiffness, pain, and swelling typically occur during the first 2 – 3 days after the extraction procedure.
The best thing to do is to take it easy during the first two days and avoid exercising for at least 24 hours. During the first night after the extraction, it is best to keep your head up (you may use pillows for this). Lying flat may prolong bleeding. Do not do heavy lifting and do not bend during the next 2 or 3 days. Physical activity and exercise may increase bleeding.
Your dentist or oral surgeon will give you advice on how to control bleeding if it occurs. In most cases, you will be using a gauze pad to be placed on the surgical site. Keeping pressure on it is important. The dressing should be changed every 40 minutes, but this depends on the amount of bleeding. Some people worry that they are bleeding excessively (which may be a concern is some cases). Usually, it is a large amount of saliva mixed with a small amount of blood or what dentists call ‘spit’.
Finally, smoking may delay the wisdom teeth healing process. It is recommended to avoid smoking during the first 24 hours following wisdom teeth removal. The sucking motion may loosen the blood clot, thus delaying healing. Furthermore, smoking may bring contaminants and germs to the surgical site and decreases the blood supply.
Foods You Can Eat After Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Out

In this article we will discusse the foods you can eat after getting your wisdom teeth Out. If you have wisdom teeth taken out, one important consideration is what types of foods you can eat to speed up the recovery process. Experts recommend light diet, especially during the first twenty four hours. Stay away from hot and warm liquids and foods.
The reason why you shouldn’t eat hot foods is that they may disturb the blood clot.
Eat only cold, chewy or soft foods during the next 2 days. Frozen yogurt or ice cream is a good choice while drinking plenty of ice cold water aids the recovery process.
The Best Foods You Can Eat After Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Out
Foods you can have include: cold applesauce, frozen yogurt, cold tomato soup, mashed potatoes, non-frozen yogurt, etc. You can have cottage cheese if you like it. Cottage cheese will aid recovery as it is high in protein. You can mix it with applesauce and soft fruit if you like the taste. Some dentists advise not to eat dairy for 8 hours, so keep this in mind. Dairy products do not mix well with some medications, and it is best to ask your dentist about this.
If you have wisdom teeth taken out, other foods to eat include porridge, banana (mashed banana), and soup. You can have boiled and scrambled eggs, milk shakes, and mashed potatoes. If you have low tolerance for milk products, you should stay away from yoghurt and ice cream. Have fat-free pudding and apple sauce instead.
Do not skip meals because proper food is necessary for recovery. Eat anything you do not have to chew and can easily swallow. Otherwise, it can get stuck in the hole. The same goes for soups with veggie pieces, which tend to stuck in the hole. It is best to stay away from them during the first 2 or 3 days. You can have a fresh baked muffin, but let it sit in your mouth a bit. Baby food is good if you like the taste. Mashed cauliflower is a good carb substitute for mashed potatoes. You can have some peanut butter if you need some protein.
Have smooth peanut butter so that it won’t get stuck.
What about alcohol? Alcohol content in the blood may cause profuse bleeding by unclotting your wounds. Alcohol thins blood out, making it difficult to clot. Finally, you should not mix pain medications with alcohol because this can cause serious problems.
