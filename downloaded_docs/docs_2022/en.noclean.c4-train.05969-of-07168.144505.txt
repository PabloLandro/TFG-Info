Outdoor Living in the Montgomery County area is a Dream
With a wet beginning to the summer it looked like a wash out was inevitable. While it’s hard to complain about rain when so many parts of the country and the world are suffering immense droughts, it was getting to be quite depressing.
Alas, Summer is Here
Luckily, it can’t rain all the time and the weather has given us some breaks. Between the tropical heat and humidity that has become part of the Montgomery County summer climate and the complete down pours, there are some really lovely days that are important to get out and enjoy. The fleeting clear warm days accompanied by cool nights feel like autumn is coming and I even needed a light jacket one day last week. I’d hate to hear of anyone losing the opportunity to be outside enjoying those perfect days due to mosquitoes and ticks.
Time to Get Outside
When a perfect day with low humidity and warm temperatures presents itself, now is the time to get outside. Go play ball in the yard with the kids. Invite your friends over for a barbecue. Take the dog for a nice long walk. Whatever you love doing, go do it outside, take full advantage of the weather as much as you can. With these gorgeous days being tucked in between rainy wet days and hot humid days it is vital that you have your yard treated for mosquitoes and ticks now, before these days arrive. If you wait until the weather is nice to call us, you’ll have already lost some outdoor time.
The Best Outdoor Living Is Pest Free
Outdoor living is best done with a bit of preparation. Being chased in by mosquitoes or having your dog come in covered in ticks is not something you want to worry about when your trying to make the most out of the beautiful weather. To really live outdoors without annoyance or dangerous bug bites, you need a mosquito control and tick control plan. Make your adventures outdoors spontaneous and without ridiculously smelly sprays, by eliminating the mosquitoes and ticks in your yard with Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery. With our traditional barrier spray eliminating 85-90% of the mosquitoes in your yard you can head outside any time day or night without having to spray yourself, light candles or torches or cover yourself from head to toe. When outdoor living can become this easy, you’re sure to take advantage of every moment of this beautiful Maryland summer.
Dangers of Not Controlling Mosquitoes and Ticks at your Home
Mosquitoes are multiplying rapidly thanks to the wet weather that has just recently let up. They carry and transmit diseases that can really make you sick. West Nile Virus has already been discovered in mosquito pools all around the North East this summer and there has even been a human case of West Nile Virus in Delaware.
With the number of deer loitering in our backyards from Darnestown and North Potomac to Derwood and North Bethesda, deer ticks are at an all time high — making Lyme Disease more widespread than ever. With West Nile Virus hitting so close to home and the increase in Lyme Disease, spread by ticks being heavily reported – protecting yourself, your family and your pets is crucial to living a carefree outdoor life.

Mosquitoes and Ticks (stink bugs, fleas, gnats and other outdoor pests too) are All we do at Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery
Do you want your landscaper to be held responsible for the mosquito and tick control in your yard? How about the HVAC and plumbing company? We’ve come across a new trend here in Montgomery County that is intriguing to say the least. Other service industry businesses are going out and buying some products, arming themselves with a fogger machine and offering up mosquito control services as part of their product line.
You may have seen signs on the corner, or mailers that say $19.95 for your first spray (be careful, the fine print that says this is for a yard under 5,000 square feet.) We’ve also seen full season offerings that are priced so low we know that either 1.) They are operating at a loss and will soon be gone from the industry or 2.) They are not using the quality products and highly qualified and trained technicians we employ.
In an effort to keep our professional integrity and superior service we refuse to race to the bottom of the price wars. We know that our valued customers are aware of the difference between fly by night/non-specialty mosquito control services and what Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery is providing.

Mosquitoes on the Side
You may have called other services because you saw a special promotion. When they answer the phone you likely talked to someone who couldn’t answer any questions but just wanted to send someone out to inspect your property. Or if you’re lucky you may have gotten someone with a little bit of knowledge who could tell you the cost for a yard your size, but it seemed as if they were guessing and trying too hard sell you without an agreed upon price. Or you may have had the worst luck and been placed on hold by three different people before finally hanging up. Here at Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery if you don’t get through to one of our expert customer service representatives immediately, we let you leave us a message so we can pay special attention to every caller and get back to you right away with all of the answers you need.

Rain, Rain Go Away So We Can Spray for Mosquitoes Today
We have a love/hate relationship with the rain and we’ve had a LOT of rain lately here in Montgomery County. For mosquitoes to breed and business to be good we need the rain. To be able to spray, successfully eliminating those rain produced mosquitoes we need it to stop raining sometimes. When a summer like this one comes along it is a double-edged sword, but you might be surprised at how uneven that double-edged sword really is.
Our Sticky Time-Released Formula
Our traditional barrier spray has a timed-released formula that allows it to last for up to 3 weeks even if it rains later that very same day. Before buying this franchise location, I had a really good chance to test the effectiveness of this product, even in rain. My yard was being sprayed every three weeks for the summer and the results were amazing. Then came an extended wet period. One July day despite very heavy skies my yard was treated and within one hour we had the heaviest torrential rain of that summer. My first inclination was to call and request a respray. But because I was considering buying this franchise, I realized I had a great opportunity to really test the product. Being the curious person I am, I decided not to ask for a respray. I am not kidding you, I had zero mosquitoes for the next three weeks. Given enough time to dry, our product really sticks.
If you see a chance of rain in the forecast you can still get treated with the regular product. As long as the mosquito spray has time to dry you should be good to go. If it does rain after an application don’t fret, hold off and see, it really does stick as long as it has dried first. With our traditional barrier spray sticking to leaves, grass and other foliage, mosquitoes that come along after the fact will be eliminated or repelled for up to 3 weeks.
How Long Does it Take for Mosquito Spray to Dry?
There is not an exact answer for how long it takes for mosquito spray to dry. I can’t say with certainty that after 31 minutes and 28 seconds you can turn on the sprinklers and do the rain dance. There are many variables. On a hot sunny day with low humidity it can be very fast. On a cool cloud damp day it can take a bit longer. Generally an hour is enough time to dry in most conditions. As always we guarantee our product, so if it does indeed rain shortly after your yard is sprayed and you find the effectiveness to be diminished in some way – we will come out and respray, no questions asked.
Susan Levi, Owner Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery.
We are crossing our fingers that we get some great summer weather to enjoy in between these bursts of rain, but even if we don’t get our wish you can still protect your family from mosquito bites and mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile Virus. Protect your family and friends today by contacting Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery to schedule mosquito and tick protection for your special outdoor occasion and all season long!

Choices, choices: Did you know we offer an organic and traditional barrier spray program?
It seems the word “Organic” is appearing more and more on the shelves of every grocery store. Whether concern over GMO food, the antibiotics used in our meat or concern over the pesticides used to increase the production of food, the term organic is used on more products. As popular TV shows on food and health teach us, buying organic is more important when buying some foods than it is for others. We may choose to pay more for organic fruit when we are going to eat the outside skin of our fruit. For other fruit, like bananas and oranges we have fewer health concerns eating ones sprayed with pesticides. The more we know about the food we eat, the better choices we can make for our families and our self. When considering a mosquito barrier spray for your yard, you also have a traditional and organic option. They each work differently, so we want to point out some of the things you may want to consider when making your choice between a traditional or organic barrier spray for mosquitoes.
Traditional Barrier Spray Keeping mosquitoes away is the best way to prevent mosquito bites,and the further away they are, the better. Our traditional barrier spray eliminates 85-90% of the mosquitoes in your yard. Since most mosquitoes are poor fliers, most live their life within 300’ of where they are born. Eliminating mosquitoes in your yard means fewer mosquitoes and fewer bites throughout the summer. The traditional mosquito control approach uses a very effective and proven insecticide. The spray eliminates mosquitoes on contact and continues eliminating them for weeks, as they rest and feed on the treated vegetation. When the spray dries, this take approximately an hour, it remains there. It will need to be reapplied usually every 21 days.
Organic Barrier Spray Our organic mosquito control spray is made from garlic. It reduces the number of mosquitoes in your yard by repelling them rather than eliminating them. When applied, the spray has a slight odor. After it dries, you will no longer smell the odor. However, mosquitoes will be able to smell it and continue to be repelled. This spray will reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard by 70-75%. Just as any organic farmer knows, natural pesticide solutions don’t last as long as traditional pesticides. They need to be reapplied more often. The same is true when using our organic mosquito control treatment. Our organic treatments needs to be reapplied every 14 days in order to receive continuous protection in your yard.
Your Decision The decision on whether to use our traditional or organic spray is often decided on how you use your yard and whether you have infants or toddlers. You should know that our technicians are trained to avoid spraying flowering plants or fishponds. Fish ponds usually have moving water to support the fish. Mosquitoes prefer standing water like that found in flowerpots and tires. Focusing the spray on areas where mosquitoes are more likely to be resting will also help prevent harm to any beneficial insects.
If you have a vegetable garden or fruit trees in your yard, or little ones who are still crawling, you may feel more comfortable using our organic barrier spray. When spraying, we use foggers to mist vegetation. Of course, some of the mist will come in contact with the lawn where toddlers may later be playing and crawling. Until your children are walking and not on hands and knees, you may feel more comfortable using our organic spray.
Whether you choose our organic garlic, organic essential oil or traditional barrier spray each will typically dry on leaf foliage within an hour after treatment. You can feel comfortable using your yard as you normally would after that time. The difference noted in your yard will feel like night and day when it comes to mosquito bites. Finally, you can enjoy working in your flower garden or grilling outside with friends and family no longer worried about mosquito bites. Preventing West Nile disease and other mosquito-borne infections begins and ends with reducing your exposure to mosquitoes and their bite. Using either a traditional or organic barrier spray is an effective place to start with your mosquito control program.

Mosquito Eater? Mosquito Hawk? Giant Mosquito? What is this Huge Flying Daddy Long Legs Looking Thing?
Crane Fly
“You just sprayed my yard and it’s covered in giant mosquitoes! Please come back and spray again.” Receiving a call like this at Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery County is our worst nightmare. It is also something we are not accustomed to and we take it very seriously. We headed out to the house in question that very same day to see what possibly could have happened.
A Giant Mosquito Infestation
Sure enough, the back yard really was covered in large mosquito-like insects. Upon closer inspection however, they were not mosquitoes. They in fact were Mosquito Eaters. Often mistaken for giant mosquitoes these lovely creatures resemble a cross between a mosquito and a Daddy Long Legs with wings. They are also widely known in the south as Mosquito Hawks or Skeeter Eaters. But their proper name is actually Crane Fly.
What You Should Know About the Crane Fly
Crane flies do not eat mosquitoes. They were named after them because they look like large versions of them, not because they eat them.
Crane flies do not bite humans.
Adult Crane flies usually don’t eat at all, but their larvae will devour any decaying matter in the water where they live.
Adults only live for 10 to 15 days after hatching.
Living to reproduce, sometimes the female Crane fly will die immediately after laying her eggs.
Crane flies are known for their lazy flight, attraction to light and their dangly long legs. Many of us were under the impression that they were a natural form of mosquito control. If one would get in the house we might carefully shoo it out, realizing its value in eating mosquitoes was too important to squash. Carefully picking it up and trying to release it back in the wild was always a challenge with their fragile long legs often becoming victims to our good will.
Mosquito
Don’t Kill Mosquito Hawks
While you don’t have to “save” them for their mosquito control value, there is no need to eliminate these harmless flies. They serve as food for a large variety of other insects, birds and fish and their larvae provide a great service in munching away at the decaying matter in wetlands. There have been reports of larvae munching on the roots and destroying lawns when they show up in massive droves but that is the exception not the norm.
If you happen to be an angler you might be very familiar with The Crane Fly and its value. But you probably don’t call it a Crane Fly either, you quite likely call it great bait or fish food. Known to be a wonderful bait for catching Bass, the Crane Fly can be mighty useful to the fishing sportsman/woman.
Susan Levi, Owner Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery.
While we don’t advocate killing Crane Flies we do suggest you eliminate its smaller, much more dangerous, smaller name sake – the mosquito.

Don’t Let One Mosquito Turn into One Billion Mosquitoes in your Montgomery County Back Yard
The wet weather that has been occurring here in Maryland over past weeks presents the perfect mix of moisture and warmth, resulting in booming mosquito populations. In honor of Mosquito Awareness week, which is June 21-27, we want to do our part in making the public aware of the reality of mosquitoes we want to share with you the crazy, unbelievable facts about how fast mosquitoes can reproduce going from 1 to more than 1 billion.
You may think having an unprotected property means you will have a few pesky mosquitoes here and there. You will have to light a candle or spray some spray when you are going outside for the evening, no big deal. Right? Wrong. What you don’t know can hurt you, and your neighbors! It only takes one bite from one mosquito carrying West Nile Virus (WNV) or Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) to make you, a loved one, or your neighbor very sick.
Only One Mosquito to Make you Sick. What Will a Billion Do?
Here at Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery County we like numbers. Numbers help us make sure we are doing our job. How many mosquitoes did you see in your yard before we treated it? How many did you see after? Numbers are a perfect measuring tool. Let’s look at the numbers to see how in the world mosquito populations get to be so big so fast.
Week One
That one female mosquito comes a takes a bite out of you. The blood you provided her allows her to develop viable eggs. This little lady goes and lays up to 300 eggs at one time! (She can lay 3 batches of eggs in her lifetime.) About half of these 300 eggs will become egg laying female mosquitoes, hanging out in your backyard waiting for a meal to help them produce their 300 eggs.
Week Two
Now you have 151 female mosquitoes flying around your back yard laying their eggs. Not only will these mosquitoes be gaining 300 new siblings as Mom lays 300 more eggs, but they are also making Momma mosquito a grandma to 45,000 grandbabies. Add the grandbabies and siblings up and you have 45,300 new mosquitoes during week two.
Week Three
It is safe to assume half of week two’s new mosquitoes are egg laying females, or 22,650. Do you want to do the math? 22,650 x 300 eggs each = 6,795,300 new mosquitoes and that is just from the mosquitoes that hatched from week 2. You still have to add their mothers’ new batch of eggs laid (for simplicity we will skip that part).
Week Four
Keep doing the math as we have before and week three’s 3,397,000 new female mosquitoes are laying their eggs in week four. We are talking about 1,319,250,000 mosquitoes in your yard (and your neighbors I am sure) in just four weeks. Four weeks is all it takes for 1 female mosquito to turn into 1.3+ billion mosquitoes.
Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery County wants to help you nip it in the bud when you are in week 1 or at the least, week 2. Doesn’t it make sense to eliminate 1-300 mosquito bites and avoid the whole math thing in the first place? Don’t fret if you are already in the thick of your mosquito multiplication problem, our traditional barrier spray eliminates mosquitoes on contact. With the time-released formula it keeps working for up to 3 weeks eliminating up to 90% of the mosquitoes in your yard.

Your Guardian Angel For Montgomery County MD Mosquito Control
The fresh, warm air has us all wishing we could sprout wings and fly out into nature! Birds call; creatures chatter, and flowers begin to bloom. It is a magical combination of warmth and sunshine that beckons us to once again get out in our yards and enjoy the world around us. The balmy spring weather; however, brings something else with it as well: mosquitoes and ticks coming out of hibernation. Hiding out all winter season in abandoned tires, woodpiles, and sheds, they rouse with the heat and are naturally ready to feast, like little vampires. How do you fight a vampire? With an angel, of course! Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery County is ready to help protect you, your family, and pets from pesky mosquitoes and ticks. To keep your yard from laying out the welcome mat to the pest kingdom, we have some divine tips you can take under consideration.
Mosquito Squad’s 5 Tips for Mosquito Control
Tip. Tip over those standing containers of water! Mosquitoes need only a bottle cap’s worth to breed in, so empty the water. This includes freshening bird baths and dog bowls at least every three days.
Toss. Toss out that old pile of leaves you’ve been meaning to get to. Adult mosquitoes use standing debris as their nesting ground, so keeping yard clutter to a minimum ensures fewer mosquitoes have a place to hang out.
Turn. Turn over any large items that may be holding stagnant water. This includes kiddie pools, toys like dump trucks, buckets, canoes, kayaks, or yard equipment, like your wheelbarrow.
Tilt. Double check all your tarps and gutters to ensure that they are water free. Sags equal pooling water, and that equates to a mosquito breeding sanctuary. It only takes 10 days for mosquitoes to hatch, and one adult female mosquito can lay up to 3,000 eggs in her lifetime. She is welcome to lay her eggs somewhere other than your yard, and by eliminating haunts for her, you reduce the mosquito population in your area automatically.
Treat. The best Montgomery County MD Mosquito Control is through the use of a proven, effective barrier spray. Our barrier spray places a boundary, or a “no fly zone” between your yard and mosquitoes. Unlike other companies who only spray around the perimeter of your house, we believe you are allowed to be in your entire yard, whenever you wish. Mosquitoes bites are painful and annoying, but it is the illnesses (like West Nile Virus and heartworms) that infected mosquitoes carry that make having a hedge of protection between you and them a smart idea.
Let Dread Skeeter and our trained service technicians be your family’s guardian angel when it comes to keeping 85% – 90% of mosquitoes at bay. Here at Mosquito Squad of West Montgomery, we offer EPA-approved barrier spray protection for your entire landscape. We stand behind our work with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. Enjoy getting out in the beautiful warm weather and being a part of nature this Spring and Summer. We welcome your call for a free quote 301-444-5566 or email us at westmontco@mosquitosquad.com
