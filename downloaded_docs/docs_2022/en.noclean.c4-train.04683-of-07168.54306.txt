Benefits
There are numerous reasons for you to use this gift from nature.
Salt is needed for the osmosis to occur that allows the water into our cells.

The himalayan salt with all of its nutrients enables the cells to absorb water. This is the action that also enables nutrients to enter our cells from our supplements or food..
This natural salt is great to replace the salt the bodies lose when sweating. Sweating can cause the sodium in the blood to go low. This can turn into a serious condition if not corrected. You can even mix some of the himalayan sea salt with water, lemon juice and a natural sweetener for a beneficial sports drink.
Himalayan pink salt can be used in neti pots to flush your sinuses out. This can make it hard for the viruses and bacteria to take hold in the nose to cause infections. It can be used as a nasal inhaler to help with respiratory functions.
Negative Ions are released after a storm or around water. They can even be found high on the tops of mountains. These ions can clean the air of various pollutants and with the Himalayan sea salt and special lamp can be made to help achieve this at your house.
This salt also will not raise blood pressure like regular table salt. It is one salt that is nothing but good for you.
