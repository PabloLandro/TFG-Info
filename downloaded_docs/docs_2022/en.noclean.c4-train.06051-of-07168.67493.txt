How Addictive Is Morphine?
The Recovery Village January 19, 2019 Uncategorized
A substance use disorder is a challenge no matter what substance you use. However, morphine is a particularly addictive substance. Why is it so addictive, and what can you do if you experience morphine addiction?
What Is Morphine?
Morphine is a drug that is often used for pain relief. It is prescribed in small doses to help people manage acute pain after surgery or injury and is prescribed as a patch, suppository or a pill.
It is an opiate found in the poppy plant, and it is widespread and potent. Over time, people who are prescribed the drug might find that their bodies get used to its effects, and they need more of the drug to combat pain and feel the same as they did when they began taking it. This is a sign that the body is becoming dependent on the drug. Dependence on the drug may lead to developing a substance use disorder.
Why Is Morphine So Addictive?
Morphine is an opioid drug. Opioids work with the opioid receptors in the brain, spine and other organs that experience pain. They block the pain and fill you with dopamine, which makes you feel good. The reason opioids are so addictive is that they lead to the same pleasurable feelings that you would get from doing other activities, such as eating your favorite food.
However, the brain can get used to this level of dopamine and craves more. As a result, you end up having to increase the dose of morphine. Over time, opioids limit your ability to control yourself, so it is harder and harder to stop using them.
Morphine is a narcotic as well and can lead to a feeling of sleepiness. Over time, the body gets used to this, and it becomes the body’s new normal. Without opioids, you begin to feel anxious and jittery.
Morphine Use Can Lead to Heroin Use
Morphine addiction can lead to heroin use. Because morphine is given by prescription, some people who become dependent on morphine replace it with heroin or other inexpensive illicit drugs when their prescription runs out or when their physician refuses to prescribe more.
Drugs like heroin or fentanyl are stronger than morphine, meaning that the risk of overdose is higher for these drugs.
The right rehab program will give you opportunities to try other activities that make you feel better.
Finding the Right Rehab Program
When you search for support for your substance use disorder, what do you need to find to better manage your morphine addiction? You may benefit from a rehab facility that offers:
Medical assistance to quit. It can be physically challenging to stop using a substance like morphine. When you are withdrawing from morphine, you can expect to experience physical symptoms such as aches, chills, sweating and fever. You can also experience psychological symptoms such as anxiety, irritability and depression. Having support during this time can help encourage you and minimize the symptoms.
A variety of inpatient and outpatient programs. For instance, you might choose to begin in an intensive inpatient program that involves counseling, group therapy and other supportive activities. You can then move on to outpatient programs and into aftercare. Continued support through aftercare is a helpful way for you to stay on track with your sobriety goals.
Alternative therapies such as art therapy, recreation therapy or animal-based therapies. Alternative therapies can help you find a positive focus. For instance, focusing on creating art can help you to relax. It is a positive activity that you can turn to instead of substance use.
Are you looking for rehab resources to support you as you attempt to better manage your substance use disorder? At The Recovery Village Columbus, you can focus on your recovery. Contact The Recovery Village Columbus today and see how to take the first steps on the road to recovery.
