Health / June 18, 2018 by fitguy / Leave a Comment
We all know that all the technological devices have some side effects. But, we tend to ignore their harmful effects while enjoying their benefits. Wi-fi is one of those technological devices. There is no point explaining how it makes our lives easier and better. But bad news it has lots of bad sides like ruining your health.
Wifi has lots of harm to your body
Here are the things that wi-fi does to your body:
It causes Oxidative Stress
It effects your sex life in a bad way by killing your sperms.
It causes calcium overload.
It effects your endocrine levels.
It gives damage to your cellular DNA.
It kills your cells.
So, what will we do now? Should we not use wi-fi anymore. I guess It is not possible anymore. But At least, we can limit the time we are exposed wifi signals.
