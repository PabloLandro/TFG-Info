Drinking a daily glass of 100% fruit juice not associated with a higher risk of hypertension in people with type 2 diabetes

It has been speculated that drinking 100% fruit juice does not compare with eating whole fruit from a health perspective. To evaluate this scientifically, a large prospective study in the US analysed how 100% fruit juice and whole fruit compared in relation to increased hypertension or type 2 diabetes risk.
The study involved more than 1 million US women who completed baseline food frequency questionnaire before being followed up regularly for nearly 8 years. The results showed that moderate intakes of whole fruit (2.4 vs. 0.3 portions daily) and 100% fruit juice (225ml daily vs. zero) were not associated with incident hypertension or type 2 diabetes. It was also found that drinking 1 serving/day of 100% fruit juice did not increase the risk of either condition developing.
The authors concluded that moderate amounts of 100% fruit juice or whole fruit were not significantly associated with increased risk of hypertension or diabetes in US postmenopausal women. It should be noted that this is an observational study which has methodological limitations in that it can only determine associations, not cause and effect.

Nutrients in 100% fruit juice are bioavailable but processed has edge over fresh for bioactives
In accordance with EU regulations, 100% fruit juice (100%FJ) has nothing added or taken away, which is why it reflects the nutrient content of the fruit from which it is made1 . The nutrient composition of 100% orange juice (100%OJ) is shown below per 100 g. Values in red represent official ‘source’ claims that can be made on pack.
