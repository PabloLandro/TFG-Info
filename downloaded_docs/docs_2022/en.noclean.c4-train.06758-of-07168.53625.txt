No way cell phones cause cancer, Economist contends

Following a report issued late last month by the World Health Organization suggesting cell phones may be carcinogenic, The Economist has published a response column dismissing the report as overblown. According to the report, low-frequency microwaves such as those emitted by cell phones simply do not have enough power to produce anything but extremely low levels of heat. “No matter how powerful the transmitter, radio waves simply cannot produce ionising radiation,” the column reads. “Only gamma rays, X-rays and extreme ultra-violet waves, which operate in the far (ie, high-frequency) end of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with fission fragments and other particles from within an atom, and cosmic rays (those particles’ equivalents from outer space) are energetic enough to knock electrons off other atoms to break chemical bonds and produce dangerous molecules called free radicals. It is these highly reactive free radicals that damage a person’s DNA, causing mutation, radiation sickness, cancer and death, depending on the dose.” The energy carried by these microwaves, the report contends, is approximately one million times too weak to produce free radicals.

So who to believe on matters of health, the World Health Organization or a blogger for the Economist?

Also, read the article. They go into a lot more detail there and there are some helpful comments as well.

All WHO said was that it’s possible. Attacking the source is good fun, but if he’s stating indisputable facts in re: radio waves and what they can and can’t do… I don’t see where the counter-argument lies.

Well, the counter-argument lies in the fact that the WHO said it may be possible… You pretty much answer your own question.

WHO just looked at a bunch of studies and said that there might be something to it. This guy says radio waves don’t work that way.
When you think about it, neither side produced any proof worth a damn. It’s just differing interpretations. Upon further consideration, I think the best thing to do is ignore WHO and random blogger guy. Everybody figured it might be possible. We’ll find out in 20 years or so.
Biggles
Science isn’t interpretation. Maybe there’s another path to causing cancer, but radio waves from a cell phone do not provide anywhere near enough energy to produce free radicals. Fact. Period. The interpretation is trying to make heads or tales of statistics. It’s virtually impossible to factor out external variables in a study. Do heavy cell phone users have other specific habits that put them at higher risk for cancer? The only side taking liberties here is WHO.

Well, lol, the World Health Organization is controlled by a group of people who will say and do whatever benefits their pocket book. So, we (the public) don’t really know who to believe. There are many underground groups and organizations that work openly in the public eye without us even noticing why certain things happen the way they do. We call them Doctors, Lawyers, and Politicians, etc..
So “believing the blogger for the Economist on this matter” doesn’t sound so Unbelievably bad at all.

So the UN is “a group of people who will say and do whatever benefits their pocket book”?
And “Doctors” are an “underground group”?
Yikes. So what do you do when you need legal representation or when you have health issues? Just lock yourself in your underground bunker?
And if they’re just looking for money, I’m sure that saying cell phones may cause cancer is the wrong way of going about it. Cell phones are massive business now and they’d be more likely to get money from the industry by saying cell phones are perfectly fine for use.

Doctors are simply people. People prefer to keep their jobs and will do most anything to keep it.
There’s also the simple fact that the WHO didn’t actually perform any medical tests nor provide medical evidence to prove this to be true.
As it stands physicists and statisticians have a much better chance to determine if cell phones can cause cancer than a doctor can.
Anonymous
You make a good point. Doctors very much need to do whatever they can to keep their jobs. Medicine is a declining industry, and people just don’t get sick anymore! It’s a shame so many doctors have to work side jobs as baristas and drug runners!
There’s also the simple fact that the WHO didn’t claim to “prove” anything other than saying that, based on tests, there MAY be a correlation.
By the way, where the f*ck am I right now? The comments section of YouTube? A forum for the Tea Party? “Doctors are SCAMS!” “Lawyers are an underground group!” “F*ck the WHO!”
Before long people will be in here talking about the “myth” of climate change.

Big Pharmaceutical companies decide what vaccines you need and when you should worry about things like H1N1. They also control when the WHO or the UN should care. Sorry sheep.

Hmmm, Person A works at the WHO. Person A likes working at the WHO and not as an emergency room doctor or a urologist or whatever other medical profession they could get. Person A doesn’t want to leave WHO. Person A sensationalizes a study they didn’t actually perform themselves so they can get more funding.
I never said WHO as a whole does this or that they are all this way but just because an organization says something is true doesn’t mean it automatically is. I guess you believe the myriad of Republican’s who also happen to be doctors as well right?
Think for yourself and don’t be a sheep… and yes, climate change is real. Thanks for obfuscating the issue.

oh shyt you brought the real norm out..
Point is there is no point.. WHO said a cellphone may or may not cause cancer.. EVERYTHING EVER CREATED MAY OR MAY NOT.. The blogger said Microwaves can’t cause cancer by radiating a cell.. Last time I checked Asbestos, Oil, and Smoke didn’t have microwaves either.. Cellphones are made of all kinds of other components that can cause cancer as well.. And who know if there is some secondary microwave related cause..
They both can be 100% right and we still won’t know if cell phones cause cancer or not..

Go and read the who “study”. This “study” was not even a metanalysis of previous research, it was a bunch of “experts” telling us that it was possible. Big deal, I can say it is possible too. I can also say that it is not possible because the radio waves lack sufficient strength to mutate the cell membranes as well. Big frickin wooooo. Show me a study that shows a casual link, heck, show me a study that shows a strong significant correlation between cell phone usage and brain cancer and we’ll talk. Until then, I am unimpressed.

You’re one of those morons who blindly follow an organization just because, aren’t you? Just because someone is a blogger or an economist doesn’t mean they don’t know what they are talking about. I know plenty of doctors who majored in English—does that mean that they aren’t great physicians?
Dumbass.

F**k doctors, next time I have pains in my chest I am calling an economist…

The WHO does not have Doctors – it has politicians in it.
Anonymous
That’s weird, because their website lists a whole shitload of doctors who work for them.

Sorry I stand Corrected – I just looked it up they also employ doctors but most of the organization is Politicians, economists, etc.

Yes because the pronouncement by the WHO is backed by so much medical study and evidence. When you go to your doctor with chest pains I’m sure you’d be happy if he just looked at you and said “hell, looks like a heart attack, here’s some asprin.” That’s a simplification of what the WHO did in this “study.”
Radio waves cannot cause cancer, period. End of story. It’s not physically possible and if it were we’d have 6 foot tall turtles with martial arts expertise running around.

Cell phones dont cause cancer…Chuck Norris does…

Phones don’t cause cancer. WHO is a sham organization. They’re funded by perpetuating hypothetical health scares so the can continue their “research efforts.” This is what happens when someone else (the govt) is spending your money. They carelessly throw it after wasted causes w no return on investment.
Anonymous
Indeed! Hypothetical health scares such as HIV! The more people they educate about HIV the more money they rake in! MUAHAHAHAH!
Stupid guvm’nt!
Anonymous
Actually yes. Outside of Africa the incidence of HIV is extremely low ~.3% Throw in the fact that it is an actually traceable and identifiable pathogen and there’s not much in common with this cell phone scare.
Anonymous
Guess Africa doesn’t matter…
Also, who said it is similar to this cell phone report? And might the WHO have something to do with the low incidence of HIV?
Anonymous
I never said Africa doesn’t matter, but it isn’t the worldwide epidemic they make it out to be and it’s mostly preventable by simply NOT HAVING SEX. Yes there are a myriad of ways you could get it without having sex, but that’s the predominant transmission method. This isn’t the bubonic plague where unsuspecting victims are surprised by a deathly airborne pathogen.
PS And before you try to redirect everyone, yes I believe in global warming and I don’t think the WHO is entirely bad. I just don’t believe them here because they didn’t actually conduct any sort of a study.
jb
That’s really not true (about the extremely low worldwide incidence — it’s been dramatically growing in terms of geographic areas affected over the last 15 years) — HIV is a widespread problem throughout Asia, Russia, and the former Soviet republic member-states. Unfortunately, many of the affected nations refuse to acknowledge the problem — but there are proven statistics/mortality and infection studies — not to mention actual suffering, and in many cases, dying, individuals.
jb
*Also — with regard to sources and means of infection in less-developed and poor economies — many people are infected by healthcare practitioners reusing needles on multiple patients! So, a routine vaccine or blood test could infect a whole subset of a population or community…which then unknowingly spreads the infection. This has been documented already in Asia, Africa, and some of the former Soviet states (Romania).
Ray Darbinyan
I completely agree.
Majority of the people on this planet follow a certain rule. And that rule is called “Herd Mentality”
That is why sham organizations such as WHO are able to manipulate the simple minded grass eating humans and inject silly stories about cancer causing cell phones just so we can pay big BUCK$ for “Cancer Research.”

Seriously how much $$$ has all that cancer walk, race for the cure, raised in the past couple of years? Where the F*** does it all go, seriously? All the money goes into a big mattress that THE MAN uses to fertilize his lawn…
(yes I know, there are several things that are wrong with my post)
Matt
From the WHO’s report: “the evidence, while still accumulating, is strong enough to support a
conclusion and the 2B classification. The conclusion means that there could be some risk, and
therefore we need to keep a close watch for a link between cell phones and cancer risk.”
So… there might be a risk and we should keep working to find out if there really is. Doesn’t sound too nefarious to me.

He doesn’t know it doesn’t anymore than anyone else suspects it might. Err on the safe side and get some earphones!

So everyone… nothing to see here, don’t even read the study or watch the videos that support it, just believe a writer.
mmmkay…
so now someone needs to check his bank account and see if there a large sum that’s been recently deposited. There, I said it.

Huh?

Awesome logic. Ignore science and put your faith in the subjective interpretation of a vague study.

only one way to find out for sure…… :)

What about the cell antenna located on my building? Wouldn’t that accelerate the cancer process?

If you hug it for an hour each day of the year, yes. Otherwise, you’re fine.

Okay, so why is this only coming out NOW?
WHY couldn’t someone have stated this unequivocally, months even years ago?

Really? Then how do you explain sunlight giving people malanomas? There is still more we don’t know about cancer than what we do. I think it is prudent to take measures to reduce your risk until we know.
Having said that as smartphones have proliferated dramatically over the past five years, has the incidence of brain cancer risen accordingly? All indications currently suggest this is not the case which would bolster the direction of this article – but still, you should use a headset until confirmed.
PseudoMan
“Really? Then how do you explain sunlight giving people malanomas?”
This is very well known. Melanoma is caused by UV light (which is a type of ionizing radiation; microwaves are non-ionizing). UV light creates free radicals, and these free radicals mess up DNA. Sometimes, the messed up DNA allows the cell to divide out of control (which is cancer).
Cells phones do not emit electromagnetic radiation that is powerful enough to cause free radicals. Structural damage to the DNA is not occurring unless the microwaves are burning the crap out of your tissue when the electromagnetic radiation is converted to heat energy, which you would surely notice.
I wouldn’t worry about it. It would do more damage to stress yourself out worrying about things like this or thinking you can expect negative things (read up on the nocebo effect), especially when there is no correlation or scientific evidence supporting it.
