WD-40: The Ultimate Survival Spray
by Erich
If you’re looking for a versatile multi-use cleaning/lubricating spray to add to your home storage, look no further than WD-40 (thanks for the idea Linda). Although there are a lot of urban myths surrounding this product’s uses (ease arthritis pain? what are you the tin man?) as well as its main ingredient (its petroleum NOT fish oil) there are still thousands of uses for it around the home, garden and shop.
Here’s the main functions for using WD-40:
LUBRICATES: WD-40’s lubricating ingredients are widely dispersed and hold firmly to all moving parts.
CLEANS: WD-40 gets under dirt, grime and grease to clean. It also dissolves adhesives, allowing easy removal of labels, tape, stickers, and excess bonding material.
PROTECTS: WD-40 protects metal surfaces with corrosion-resistant ingredients to shield against moisture and other corrosive elements.
PENETRATES: WD-40 loosens rust-to-metal bonds and frees stuck, frozen or rusted metal parts.
DISPLACES MOISTURE: Because WD-40 displaces moisture, it quickly dries out electrical systems to eliminate moisture-induced short circuits.
For a complete list (over 2000) of its uses check out this link from WD-40’s website: List of 2000+ Uses of WD-40

WD-40 is NOT a lubricant. It removes lubricant.

I knew there are lots of uses for WE40, but nowhere near this many. Can’t wait to try more of them!

Ha-Ha-HA! You’re witty, Wames. Does this work on OO7’s latest martini creation, “Vesper?”
You should have a blog called Wames’ Whimsicals.
My name’s Joy S. Leigh, and I’m 53.

I used wd 40 specialist to clean my chalk boards. They were like new again. Thank you WD40. No one believed me when I told them how I got the “new” boards.
