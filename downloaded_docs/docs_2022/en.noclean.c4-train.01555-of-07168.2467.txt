Amalgam Fillings
Always remember to be careful if you have had an injection, as you may bite your cheek, lip or tongue. The amalgam restoration, or silver filling, will set to approximately 75 to 90% of its maximum strength in around 1 hour and then reach its final strength after 24 hours. It is important that if the filling has covered more than one surface of your tooth, you do not eat directly on it immediately after your appointment. If the food you are eating is very soft, eating there can often be done after 1 hour.
It is normal to experience some hot, cold and pressure sensitivity after your appointment. Your gums may be sore for several days. Rinse your mouth three times a day with warm salt water (put a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water, rinse and spit) to reduce pain and swelling.
Sometimes you may notice an electrical reaction to the new amalgam filling, which can often be set off when a metal object comes into contact with the filing. This is referred to as Galvanic Shock. This often disappears within two weeks of having the filling placed.
Remember that amalgam does not wear down easily. If the filling is very low, it most likely has been placed like that when it was originally placed. This is not ideal as the opposing tooth often “grows” to bite further into the tooth with the low filling and this increases the chances of that tooth breaking later. When the filling is carved lower than the tooth it is similar to digging a hole and filling it with not enough dirt. This is often referred to as “ditching”. Often with badly ditched cusps, they have to be smoothed down as the opposing tooth has grown too far to meet the inadequately filled original hole. Come back and see us if you feel that the filling is too low.
We usually try to ensure that the restoration is built much higher than required and then gradually reduce the height of the filling until the bite is perfect. This creates a better occlusion, or bite, and prevents the opposing tooth from “growing down”. During the next few days, if the bite feels too “high” or too “low”, contact us for a follow up appointment. Any bite adjustments will be done free of charge within a reasonable time after the filling was placed.
If you have any other problems or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us immediately. We will do our best to ensure your satisfaction!
Extractions
After tooth extraction, it is important for a blood clot to form to stop the bleeding and begin the healing process. Although we may have placed a dissolvable material in the extraction area to assist with clotting, it is recommended that you firmly bite on a gauze pad for 30 to 45 minutes following the procedure. You should change the pad every 15 minutes. You may bite on a tea bag instead of gauze. Small amounts of blood in the saliva can make your saliva appear quite red. This is normal and may be noticed the rest of the day after the procedure.
Swishing, sucking through a straw, and smoking can all dislodge the clot. Smoking should be stopped following surgery. Healing and success of the surgery will be substantially reduced by the cigarette smoke chemicals in your body. Also the suction created when inhaling cigarettes can dislodge the clot. Smokers are at greater risk of developing a painful Dry Socket. Keep anything sharp from entering the wound (crunchy food, toothpicks, eating utensils).
Do not brush your teeth for the first 8 hours after surgery. After this, you may brush your teeth gently, but avoid the area of surgery for 3 days. After 24 hours, you may gently rinse your mouth with salt water three times a day (one teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm water, rinse-swish-spit). Rinsing after meals will help in preventing food from accumulating in the extraction site.
Reduce exercise for the first 24 hours. This will keep blood pressure lower, which will reduce bleeding from the extraction site. To reduce swelling, place an ice pack or an unopened bag of frozen peas to the area. Swelling usually should subside after 48 hours. Drink lots of fluids, and eat soft food on the opposite side from the extraction site. Avoid alcoholic beverages and hot or spicy foods. Be sure to chew on the opposite side for 24 hours. You may resume normal eating as soon as you are comfortable.
Some discomfort is normal after surgery. To minimize pain, take two Tylenol, Nuprin, Advil, or similar non-aspirin pain reliever every 3 to 4 hours until bedtime to maintain comfort. Take it before the anesthesia wears off. If prescription pain medication is prescribed, take it as instructed on the label. Don’t exceed the dose on the label. Taking with food or milk will help reduce upset stomach. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery when taking pain prescriptions. Do not drink alcohol while taking prescription pain medications. Nausea is most often caused by taking pain medications on an empty stomach. Reduce nausea by preceding each pain pill with soft food, and taking the pill with a large glass of water.
If you were given an antibiotic prescription, take all of them as directed until they are gone. Women: some antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. Use alternate birth control methods for two months.
If your sinus was involved in the procedure, you should avoid blowing your nose or playing a wind musical instrument for one week. Use of decongestant medications might be recommended.
You may need to return to the office to have sutures removed, or just for a brief follow-up healing check. Please call your dentist if you have:
Uncontrollable pain
Excessive or severe bleeding
Marked fever
Excessive warm swelling occurring a few days after the procedure
Reactions to medications, especially rash, itching, or breathing problems
Following these instructions very closely will greatly help your comfort, and promote uneventful healing of the area. If any of the instructions are not followed, you might have significantly more discomfort, and the success of the procedure may be affected. If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us! We are here to ensure your heal comfortably and with satisfaction.
Dentures
New dentures always require a period of adjustment. First-time denture patients may require several weeks to get used to their new appliance. Speech may be altered, and may require adaptation of the tongue and lips.
For the first few days, you should wear your dentures for as long as possible, and chew soft food in small bites. Remember, dentures do not have the same chewing efficiency as natural teeth and may affect your taste of food. If your bite feels uneven after several days, we can adjust the way your teeth contact at follow-up visits.
It is not unusual for sore spots to develop in isolated areas of the mouth. These areas can be relieved easily at follow-up appointments. If a severe sore spot develops which prevents wearing the denture and an appointment is made for adjustment, please wear the denture for 24 hours prior to the appointment. This will greatly aid in locating the exact location of the area, and make adjustments significantly easier and more predictable.
Do not wear your complete or partial dentures to bed. It is important to allow your gum tissues and jaw bones to rest in order to prevent further tissue irritation, infection, and future bone shrinkage. At this time, you can soak the denture in a denture cleaning solution. You can also clean it with a brush. Proper cleaning of your denture is important to prevent stains and bacteria from accumulating on your appliance. Since cleaning procedures differ for various types of appliances, please follow the directions given to you at your insertion appointment.
Over time, or with weight loss or gain, the supporting gum tissues and bone may change shape and size. Periodic relines of your dentures may be necessary to ensure a retentive fit. Denture teeth may wear or chip over time. For this reason, an annual check of your tissues and dentures is recommended.
Following these instructions very closely will greatly help your comfort. If any of the instructions are not followed, you might have significantly more discomfort, and the success of the appliance may be affected. If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us! We are here to ensure your comfort and satisfaction.
Gingival Graft
What to Expect Following Surgery
Bleeding: Small amounts of blood in the saliva can make your saliva appear quite red. This is normal and may be noticed the rest of the day after the procedure.
Pain: Moderate discomfort may be noticed when the anesthetic first wears off, and may continue for several days.
Swelling: Some swelling and discoloration of the lip and/or cheek may occur and may last for a few days.
Sensation: There may be a temporary loss of feeling in the gums in the operated area. The teeth may also feel loose for a time. The teeth may be sensitive to hot and cold temperatures.
What to do Following the Surgery
After leaving the office, rest and avoid strenuous activities for the remainder of the day. Keeping blood pressure lower will reduce bleeding and aid healing.
Take two Tylenol, Nuprin, Advil, or similar non-aspirin pain reliever every 3 to 4 hours until bedtime to maintain comfort. Take it before the anesthesia wears off.
If pain medication is prescribed, take it as you need it. Don’t exceed the dose on the label. Taking with food or milk will help reduce upset stomach. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery when taking pain prescriptions. Do not drink alcohol while taking prescription pain medications.
Nausea is most often caused by taking pain medications on an empty stomach. Reduce nausea by preceding each pain pill with soft food, and taking the pill with a large glass of water.
Applying an ice bag to the face over the operated area will minimize swelling. Apply for 15 minutes, then remove for 15 minutes. Continue this for the first day.
Eat soft foods for the first 2 – 4 days. Maintain a good, balanced diet. Drink plenty of water. Do not drink through a straw. Avoid alcohol for 48 hours.
Avoid chewing directly over the operated area until the sutures are removed.
Brush all of your teeth after each meal. Avoid the operated area for the first day. Take care to avoid pulling the sutures.
Do not rinse vigorously; do not use a Waterpik®.
A saltwater solution (1/2 teaspoon salt + 1/2 cup warm water) held in your mouth for 2 to 3 minutes every hour may make your mouth more comfortable.
Avoid lifting the lip with your fingers to look at the area. It is possible to accidentally tear the sutures, open the incision, and delay healing.
Smoking should be stopped following surgery. Healing and success of the surgery will be substantially reduced by the cigarette smoke chemicals in your body.
If you were given an antibiotic prescription, take all of them as directed until they are gone. Women: some antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. Use alternate birth control methods for two months.
You may be instructed to use a prescription antimicrobial mouthrinse.
Return to your dentist’s office for removal of the sutures or follow-up checks as directed.
Please call your dentist if you have:
Uncontrollable pain
Excessive or severe bleeding
Marked fever
Excessive warm swelling occurring a few days after the procedure
Reactions to medications, especially rash, itching, or breathing problems
Following these instructions very closely will greatly help your comfort, and promote uneventful healing of the area. If any of the instructions are not followed, you might have significantly more discomfort, and the success of the procedure may be affected. If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us! We are here to ensure your comfort and satisfaction.
Root Canal Therapy
The tooth and surrounding tissues may be tender for several days as a result of manipulation during treatment, and due to the previous condition of your tooth. This is a perfectly normal and expected reaction. For a few days you may experience mild to moderate discomfort when eating. Avoid chewing on the tooth as much as possible.
If a temporary filling was placed to seal the tooth, avoid flossing in the area. It is not uncommon for a small portion of the filling to wear down or chip. If the entire filling breaks or falls out, please contact the office to have it replaced.
To control discomfort, take pain medications such as Advil, Motrin, or Tylenol as directed. Warm salt water rinses (one teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm water) may aid in relieving discomfort.
If swelling occurs, place an ice pack on the affected area. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection and swelling are gone.
A permanent restoration, either a filling or crown must be placed to protect the root canal tooth from fracture or decay. Please be sure to keep all scheduled follow-up appointments for these procedures.
Please call your dentist if you have:
Uncontrollable pain
Excessive or severe bleeding
Marked fever
Excessive warm swelling occurring a few days after the procedure
Reactions to medications, especially rash, itching, or breathing problems
Following these instructions very closely will greatly help your comfort, and promote uneventful healing of the area. If any of the instructions are not followed, you might have significantly more discomfort, and the success of the procedure may be affected. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Periodontal Scaling
Following scaling and root planning, you can expect to notice less redness, less bleeding, and less swelling of your gum tissues. Your teeth may feel smoother, and your mouth will taste and feel better. Your gum health must be maintained with proper homecare, as instructed, and regular professional care.
When anesthesia has been used, your lips, teeth, and tongue may be numb for several hours after the appointment. Avoid any chewing until the numbness has completely worn off. It is easy to bite or burn your tongue or lip while numb. It is recommended that you take some ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil, 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed) before the anesthetic completely wears off. This will help with any swelling or pain at the injection sites where your anesthetic was administered. A saltwater solution (1/2 teaspoon salt + 1/2 cup warm water) swished in your mouth for 2 to 3 minutes every hour may make your mouth more comfortable.
It is not unusual for the teeth to be more sensitive to hot or cold temperatures, and/or sweets. This occurs as the gum tissue heals and shrinks in size. Brushing two to three times daily with sensitivity toothpaste or using fluoride rinses may help alleviate this over time. If sensitivity continues or is severe, professional application of a desensitizing agent may be required.
For a few days, a soft diet is recommended, chewing on the opposite side that was most recently worked on. Smoking should be stopped. Success of the treatment will be substantially reduced by the cigarette smoke chemicals in your body.
Consistent and thorough daily oral hygiene is essential to the proper healing of your gum tissues. Brushing, flossing and rinsing with recommended products are critical. Use Listerine, or if prescribed, Peridex (Chlorhexidine).
Following these instructions very closely will greatly help your comfort, and promote uneventful healing of the area. If any of the instructions are not followed, you might have significantly more discomfort, and the success of the procedure may be affected. If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us! We are here to ensure your comfort and satisfaction.
Composite Fillings
Always remember to be careful if you have had an injection as you may bite your cheek, lip or tongue. It is normal to experience some hot, cold and pressure sensitivity after your appointment. Your gums may be sore for several days. Rinse your mouth three times a day with warm salt water (put a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water, rinse and spit) to reduce pain and swelling. Your new composite filling is fully hardened before you even leave the office; however, it is wise to chew on the opposite side from the location of the newly placed filling(s).
Remember that the filling does not wear down easily. If the filling is very low, it most likely has been placed like that when it was originally placed. This is not ideal as the opposing tooth often “grows” to bite further into the tooth with the low filling and this increases the chances of that tooth breaking later. When the filling is carved lower than the tooth it is similar to digging a hole and filling it with not enough dirt. This is often referred to as “ditching”. Often with badly ditched cusps, they have to be smoothed down as the opposing tooth has grown too far to meet the inadequately filled original hole.
You will note that the restoration is built much higher than required and then gradually reduce the height of the filling until the bite is perfect. This creates a better occlusion, or bite, and prevents the opposing tooth from “growing down”. During the next few days, if the bite feels too “high” or too “low”, contact us for a follow up appointment. Any bite adjustments will be done free of charge within a reasonable time after the filling was placed.
If you have any other problems or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us immediately. We will do our best to ensure your satisfaction!
Crown and Bridges
Always remember to be careful if you have had an injection as you may bite your cheek, lip or tongue. Your gums may be sore for several days. Rinse your mouth three times a day with warm salt water (put a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water, rinse and spit) to reduce pain and swelling. Your new crown or bridge are fully cemented in before you even leave the office; however, it is wise to chew on the opposite side from the location of the newly placed filling(s).
Crowns and bridges usually take two to three appointments to complete. At the first visit, the teeth are prepared and a temporary crown or bridge is placed with temporary cement, while awaiting the final restoration. The temporary restoration not only protects the tooth from damage, but it also prevents it from shifting position, helps the gum tissue to heal in the proper location, and provides a cosmetic solution until the permanent restoration can be placed.
It is normal to experience some hot, cold and pressure sensitivity after your appointment. Your tooth may feel sensitive to temperature, sweets, or biting. This is normal and should subside in a few days. If this sensitivity is severe and does not dissipate, please contact the office immediately for an evaluation.
Do not eat anything sticky, hard or chewy as this may pull the temporary off or break it. Be careful brushing and avoid flossing adjacent to the temporary as this may cause it to become dislodged. Once the permanent restoration is placed, you may brush and floss normally. Should a temporary inadvertently come off, try to place it back on the tooth, and contact the office immediately to have it recemented. After the permanent restoration is placed, if the bite feels too “high” or too “low”, contact us for a follow up appointment. Any bite adjustments will be done free of charge within a reasonable time after the restoration was placed.
Your temporary may feel rough to your tongue and may not be the same shape or color as the permanent restoration. You can feel confident that your new restoration is being made using state-of-the-art materials by the finest laboratories and technicians. We will give you the opportunity to view the permanent restoration in the mouth before fully cementing it in
If you have any other problems or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us immediately. We will do our best to ensure your satisfaction.

Implant
There will be a metal healing abutment protruding through the gingival (gum) tissue. Small amounts of blood in the saliva can make your saliva appear quite red. This is normal and may be noticed the rest of the day after the procedure. Some bleeding or redness in the saliva is normal for 24 hours. Excessive bleeding (your mouth fills up rapidly with blood) can be controlled by biting on a gauze pad placed directly on the bleeding wound for 30 minutes. If bleeding continues please call for further instructions. Do not disturb the wound. Avoid rinsing, spitting, or touching the wound on the day of surgery.
After leaving the office, rest and avoid strenuous activities for the remainder of the day. Keeping blood pressure lower will reduce bleeding and aid healing. Applying an ice bag to the face over the operated area will minimize swelling. Apply for 15 minutes, then remove for 15 minutes. Continue this for the first day. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid hot liquids, hot food, anything spicy, and alcohol. Soft food and liquids should be eaten on the day of surgery. Return to a normal diet as soon as possible unless otherwise directed.
Smoking should be stopped following surgery. Healing and success of the implant will be substantially reduced by the cigarette smoke chemicals in your body. Avoid all rinsing or swishing for 24 hours after your procedure. After 24 hours you may begin gentle rinsing with a saltwater solution (1/2 teaspoon salt + 1/2 cup warm water). Avoid commercial mouthrinses. You may be instructed to use a prescription antimicrobial mouthrinse. Do not brush your teeth for the first 8 hours after surgery. After this, you may brush your teeth gently, but avoid the area of surgery for 3 days.
Some discomfort is normal after surgery. To minimize pain, take two Tylenol, Nuprin, Advil, or similar non-aspirin pain reliever every 3 to 4 hours until bedtime to maintain comfort. Take it before the anesthesia wears off. If prescription pain medication is prescribed, take it as instructed on the label. Don’t exceed the dose on the label.

If you were given an antibiotic prescription, take all of them as directed until they are gone. Women: some antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. Use alternate birth control methods for two months.
If your sinus was involved in the procedure, you should avoid blowing your nose or playing a wind musical instrument for one week. Use of decongestant medications might be recommended.
Your dentist will give you specific instructions if any prosthesis is associated with the implant, such as dentures. To avoid putting any pressure on the new implants before they have healed, your denture might be adjusted or significantly modified. In certain cases you will need to go without your dentures for a period (days or weeks) after the implants are placed. Sometimes a temporary removable appliance is made for cosmetic purposes, until a new non-removable one can be made.
You may need to return to the office within the first 14 days to have sutures removed, or just for a brief follow-up healing check. You may need to return after the implant has integrated for a small second procedure to expose it in preparation for the final restoration.
