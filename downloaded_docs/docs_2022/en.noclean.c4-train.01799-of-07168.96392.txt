Cataracts
What is a Cataract?

A cataract is a clouding of the lens that disrupts vision. They slowly progress and a reduction in vision becomes more and more noticeable. If left untreated cataracts can lead to blindness.
How Many People Get Cataracts?
Cataracts are common among aging people. In the USA over 20 million people have cataracts by the age of 40. At 80 years approximately half the population has cataracts.
Due to increased levels of sun exposure, cataract rates are substantially higher for surfers. Depletion of the ozone layer is also expected to increase cataract rates in the coming generation.
What are the Causes of Cataracts?
The main cataract causing factor is long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Surfers who spend long hours in the sun, fighting reflection off the water are especially at risk.
Other cataract causing factors are smoking, exposure to radiation, secondary effects of diabetes, and advanced age.
Prevention of Cataracts
The best preventions for cataracts are staying out of the sun or wearing full coverage sunglasses with 100% UV protection (like all the casual sunglasses and surf sunglasses sold on WearSurfGlasses.com)
Research is currently being done on special eye drops that may help prevent or even reverse cataracts. But these drops cost around $100 dollars for a 1 month supply.
Cataract Surgery
Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure. The time required for full recovery varies from a few days to up to a month. During the first week after the surgery patients are advised not to rub the eye, put their head bellow their heart, or take a strenuous bowl movement.

Ask your physician, but you should be back surfing 2 weeks to a month after the surgery.

Cataract surgery costs from $3,200 to $4,500 per eye.
