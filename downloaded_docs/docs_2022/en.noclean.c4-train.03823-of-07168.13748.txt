"How can too much water consumption be bad for you"
Water is an important component of healthy regulation of body organs. Doctors advise to drink adequate water to dehydrated patients, but many times, this advice taken in other ways which lead to overhydration. Drinking excess water may cause intoxication. Shockingly, this causes hyponatremia which leads to affected brain functionality and even death in some cases. This happens, when you drink more water than you actually need. So, how much water should actually be consumed?
Two types of overhydration:
Higher Water Intake
This happens when you intake more water than your kidney is able to remove from the urine. This leads to too much water in your bloodstream.
Water Retention
When the body cannot rid of the excessive water, a medical condition appears which causes the body to retain water.
Overhydration is fatal because of it imbalances the water-sodium proportion in the body.
What causes overhydration?
In a nutshell, overhydration is the improper balance of bodily fluids. It is the end result of your overworked kidneys. You drink too much water that your kidneys consume a lot of energy in removing the excess water, which makes you bed-ridden.
Water levels rise up when you drink too much water but your kidneys cannot remove them. This is dangerous because this fades away some important substances from your blood. This can be an underlying problem in athletes as drink a lot of water before and after the race.
When an amount of 8-10 cups a day is recommended, this varies according to age, sex, and height.
Your overall health should be taken into consideration before following this regime. However, during a normal day course, there is no exact formula for water intake, but it may vary as per the circumstances of heat, illness, and fever.
Urine is always an accurate indicator of hydration levels. While most people think that, water-like transparent urine is the sign of hydration, sadly this may not be the case. If your body is fairly hydrated, it should excrete straw-colored urine. A pale yellow urine with the color of lemonade is a great sign. Any darker color in urine means more water intake is required. Likewise, colorless urine indicates over-hydration.
Some cases of overhydration may cause:
• Liver disease
• Disturbance in levels of anti-diuretic hormone
• Uncontrolled diabetes
• CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)
• Kidney problem
