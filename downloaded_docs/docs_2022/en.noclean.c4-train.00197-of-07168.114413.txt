Love bees and trees – fight 5G
Posted on April 20, 2019 | Leave a comment
Normally we don’t write posts about things we are advocating for or against, but this is important for you to be aware of. Utilities are putting up 5G radiofrequency units on poles throughout the world and even President Trump wants to see it rolled out all over the USA. While you may think this will help your connectivity, it has been shown not to be that beneficial over 4G and there are numerous safer alternatives to supply service in remote areas. We don’t need an ugly group of hundred-pound units on the top of every so many poles on our street. Plus the radio-frequencies have proven to have a negative effect on not only our health but the health of nearby trees, birds and bees.
Currently, 5G technology is effective only over short distances and doesn’t penetrate through solids—requiring numerous antennae with unobstructed paths between transmitters and receivers. Wireless antennas emit microwaves – non-ionizing radiofrequency radiation – and essentially function as cell towers. Each installation can have over a thousand antennas that are transmitting simultaneously. They increase electromagnetic radiation near homes. Property values drop after a cell tower is built near homes and this ugly units will do nothing for curb appeal. Health effects to people and animals include:
Increased Wireless Exposure– Since this new standard will require extensive towers, Users will be subjected to more cell tower radiation as it will be nearly impossible to escape wireless radiation as more wireless-enabled devices will appear on the market.
Increased Number of Electromagnetic-Sensitivity (ES) Cases – ES is the condition in which people develop intolerances to radiation from wireless technology devices such as cell phones, cell towers, Wi-Fi, smart meters and antennas. Symptoms range from tingling and headaches to sleep disturbances, nausea and memory problems. With the increased radiation associated with 5G, we can expect to see a drastic uptick in the number ES cases. For more information on EHS go to www.safehelpsyou.org
Negative Environmental Impacts– Wildlife is expected to be affected by the introduction of widespread 5G. It is theorized that the navigation of birds and insects (especially bees) will be disrupted and more research is required to explore the exact repercussions of Wi-Fi radiation on our environmental surrounding. According to a study by Wageningen University in the Netherlands, radio frequency signals could very well be responsible for the diseased trees, which exhibited bark tears, bleeding and leaves prematurely dying. Trees with closest proximity to Wi-Fi networks suffered from telltale indicators of radiation sickness, including a “lead-like shine” on their leaves, which is caused by the deterioration of outer-cell layers — leading to premature death of the foliage.
*bulleted text taken from the Canadian website http://c4st.org
We believe the responsible course of action is to defer 5G deployment until the full biological and environmental effects are understood. To protect our health, more research must be undertaken. Additionally, there should always be an option to opt-out from 5G technology from devices like appliances and cars—ensuring the safety of those with electromagnetic-sensitivities, the elderly and the young. – the AntiAgingLady
.During the recent years over 240 scientists from more than 40 countries have expressed their “serious concerns” , via EMF Scientists Appeal, regarding the ubiquitous and increasing exposure to EMF generated by electric and wireless devices – already before the additional 5G roll-out. The over 240 scientists refer to the fact that ”numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines”. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.As of March 31 2019, 229 scientists and medical doctors have signed the appeal. The 5G Appeal is still open for endorsement for scientists (PhD, professor) or medical doctors (MD. Please contact professor em. Rainer Nyberg or ass. professor Lennart Hardell. (Contact.)

Xylitol can harm dogs.
Posted on February 4, 2019 | Leave a comment
Since 2004, the ASPCAs Animal Poison Control Center has been warning that xylitol, a sweetener found in many sugar-free candies, gum and products including nut butters, toothpaste and throat lozenges, can cause potentially life-threatening problems in our dogs.
In most mammals, xylitol has no significant effect on insulin levels, but in dogs, xylitol stimulates a rapid, dose-dependent insulin release that can result in profound hypoglycemia. Symptoms could include a sudden drop in blood sugar resulting in depression, loss of coordination, seizures and live failure. These symptoms can occur quite rapidly often within 30 minutes and a quick trip to the vet would be advisable Activated charcoal does not appreciably bind xylitol and is not recommended. If hypoglycemia develops, it should be managed with dextrose IV boluses and/or constant-rate infusions. In one study, 62.5% of dogs with signs of liver injury died or were euthanized despite aggressive veterinary intervention. So the moral of the story – keep xylitol products out of reach of your pooch!

We are electrical.
Posted on October 31, 2018 | Leave a comment
The human body is a highly sophisticated electrochemical machine. The nervous system is composed of nerve cells, or neurons which in the brain alone number 85-200 billion! A typical neuron consists of a cell body with a nucleus and two or more long fibers (dendrites that put out impulses toward the cell body and axons that return the signal). The neurons use chemical signals call neurotransmitters to transmit their signals. So what happens if this field is interrupted?
Many things can inhibit the chemicals needed to support these neurotransmitters including foreign electromagnetic signals not harmonious with the body and drugs such as antidepressants. Eating foods laced with pesticides and additives can create free-radicals in the body that not only compromise health but short-circuit our neurotransmitter production.
Foods that support neurotransmitter production are green leafy vegetables (especially spinach), brown rice, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds are full of ingredients required for the production of serotonin, that gives us our positive mood. Walnuts, flaxseed, hemp and chia seeds contain Omega-3 fatty acids that are excellent for raising serotonin levels and balancing neurotransmitters naturally.
Besides chemicals in our food that produce free-radicals, coffee, alcohol and sugary drinks have a negative impact on dopamine levels which is an important neurotransmitter for feelings of pleasure and happiness and essential in maintaining energy levels. Ripe bananas and sesame seeds are excellent sources of dopamine. Wheat germ are rich in nutrients that raise acetylcholine levels in the brain, which is another important neurotransmitter that affects mood, memory, anxiety and more.
In regards to increasing and balancing neurotransmitters in the brain naturally, your dietary focus should be on consuming mostly alkaline foods. In this brief article we have touched on only a few of the neurotransmitters that control not only our mood but our bodily functions. There are numerous articles on restoring neurotransmitter efficiency online.

AntiAgingLady’s dad’s new book on flying and barnstorming in the 1930s
Posted on September 15, 2018 | Leave a comment
I thought I would alert you to my latest endeavor. My dad wrote his flying memoirs prior to passing away and finally I put them together in this book. Lots of cool stories, photos, news clippings from back then and tales of his flying adventures and misadventures… check it out.
A Barnstormer Aviator. My personal journey to scarf and goggles flying in the 1930s Author: Nick Vuyosevich with Nina Anderson
ISBN 9781513637075 12.95 Click Here to Order
Living in the 1930s, with nary a nickel in his pocket an immigrant’s son learned to fly. This was Nick’s story written by him 50 years after that first solo. Come back to the time when crashes were common, navigation was “I follow roads”, scarf and goggles were standard pilot gear and barnstorming was the way to get folks out to the airport for a ride. Written by a pilot from the 1930s who tells his story of learning to fly in Clarence Chamberlin’s airplanes and becoming a barnstormer, who founded the Jersey City Flying Club, Clifton and Whippany airports. He tells his adventures in flying the Hisso Standard, Swallow two place with OX5 and Kinner engines, Waco, Great Lakes, along with the Consolidated Trainer, as well as the Curtiss Fledging, Eaglerock, and many other biplanes of the times.
“This true story written by a New Jersey biplane pilot, is filled with names, places, aircraft and adventures from the golden era of aviation! What a fun read.” James P. Adams, ATP, Gold Seal Flight Instructor, Retired FAA Operations Inspector, FAASTeam Program Manager
“This book gave me insight to the circuitous path budding pilots, who were just part of the general population, had to follow to learn to fly. I loved the misadventures, calamities and comradery depicted among the early aviators that Nick described.” Nova Hall, author of Spirit and Creator, The Mysterious Man Behind Lindbergh’s Flight to Paris.
“General aviation pilots from the 1920s and 30s are at times overlooked especially those from New Jersey. As the industry grew in New Jersey, few chronicled the struggle to provide flight schools, airports and flying clubs for would-be aviators seeking to fly those incredible scarf and goggles machines. This book describes the trials and tribulations, adventures and misadventures, and the insider stories of early aviators such as Clarence Chamberlin, Eddie Gorski, Chet Coons and George Stone. Documented with original photos, this book is an archival treasure of New Jersey flying in the golden age of aviation”. – Ralph Villecca, Executive Director, Aviation Hall of Fame & Museum Of New Jersey

Is your pet getting sick because of your wifi?
Posted on June 25, 2018 | 1 comment
I don’t mean to harp on this subject but it needs to be said. A big article came out recently in the Innovative Veterinary Care magazine from Canada regarding the effects electro-pollution had on our pets (us too). I am taking out bits from that article.
Ionizing EMR (electromagnetic radiation) are known to cause direct damage to cells and DNA such as those from x-rays. Non-ionizing EMR is low-frequency found coming from our electronics and are thought to be safe if they don’t create heat, but studies have shown that is a fallacy. Evidence from studies and research has shown that EMR even if it doesn’t heat tissue, compromises normal physiology and intercellular communication leading to the breakdown of healthy cellular processes. If the cell deteriorates its membranes harden, free radical damage occurs, nutrients can’t find their way in and toxins can’t be removed.
Other problems occur as endocrine function is harmed and vets have seen a marked increase in endocrine disease in pets over the last 20 years. EMR radiation is a hormone disruptor and causes reduced melatonin levels which is a key hormone in keeping free radicals in check. Tests showed increases in human breast cancer cell growth when exposed to EMR. We have also seen an increase in pet cancers lately even when they are kept indoors (perhaps in a WiFi environment). As melatonin is key in suppressing the development of breast cancer, it also supports the killer lymphocytes and enhances the ability of vitamin D to inhibit tumor growth.
Many studies are also reporting the effects of EMR on wildlife with one showing when mobile phones were placed in a honey bee hive, worker bees stopped returning and honey production steadily declined. It is not only our indoor pets that we need to be concerned about. Riders on horseback who keep their phones turned on and in their back pockets are exposing the animals to high electromagnetic radiation. And remember that your dog, cat, gerbil, pet bird, and fish are tiny compared to a human. Therefore a small amount of exposure would be much more lethal as it has shown to be to a small child.
Best solution is to keep phones away from pets, to limit use of WiFi and investigate one of the subtle energy technologies, diodes and pendants you can affix to their collar or cage to harmonize the frequencies and make them less destructive to the body.

Dr.’s who recommend folic acid may be wrong
Posted on May 22, 2018 | Leave a comment
Homocysteine is a naturally-occurring amino acid that is a breakdown product of the essential amino acid, methionine and is linked to cardio problems, cancer and DVT. Normally the homocysteine is converted back into a harmless amino, cysteine but folks with gluten sensitivity may increase its buildup. Low levels of Vitamin B, especially B12 and B6 also puts them at risk. Women with the highest homocysteine levels had 2.3 times the heart attack risk and also had low folic acid levels, which has also been linked to autism.
Doctors seem to recommend supplementing with folic acid to help homocysteine normalize and especially when recommending the Bs. But, if they don’t test you for a mutant MRHFR gene they can’t tell you which folic is good for you and which can be dangerous. “Folic acid” and “Folate” are often used interchangeably to describe Vitamin B9. But, they are not the same. Folic acid, is actually a synthetic form of Vitamin B9, which is not found in nature, nor is it naturally found in the human body. In order for folic acid to be metabolized, it must undergo metabolism via the enzymes FOLR2 and DHFR, primarily in the liver although many people don’t have enough of these enzymes to do the job, such as those with an MTHFR mutation. These individuals cannot complete the final metabolic step that converts folic acid to the active form L-methylfolate (5-MTHF)
An epidemiological study conducted in 2007 found that men and women with previous colorectal adenomas, who took 1000 mcg of folic acid daily for 6-8 years had increased risk factors for colorectal cancer (10). It is certainly plausible to consider the possible cancer risks associated with excessive folic acid. It is for this reason that certain conventional cancer treatments use folate-blocking drugs such as methotrexate.
However, natural folates found in whole foods appear to be metabolized via the intestinal mucosa. A more homogeneous choice would be L-methylfolate which is the biologically active form of vitamin B9. L-Methylfolate (5-MTHF) has emerged as a popular alternative, and has been used as a complementary medicine in several recent clinical trials. Studies show that L-Methyfolate supplementation is equally (if not more) effective than folic acid for increasing circulating folate in those with an MTHFR mutation. It is also highly effective at reducing homocysteine levels in healthy people. It is also better absorbed and interacts with fewer medications than folic acid.
Note: To find out whether MTHFR should be on your radar, you can take raw data from 23andme, or another provider like Ancestry, and upload the data to a site like Genetic Genie to determine whether you have one copy, or two copies of either MTHFR C677T, or MTHFR A1298C, the “mutant” versions of the gene.

Nattokinase: help to prevent strokes
Posted on May 17, 2018 | Leave a comment
Nattokinase is a protein digesting enzyme isolated from the traditional Japanese food prepared from fermented soybeans. Fermentation converts to a form that is safe and can be absorbed, the enzyme inhibitor in soy that prevents digestion and creates the estrogenic problems.
Nattokinase works by breaking down fibrogen, a component of blood clots and plaque. It is different from an anticoagulant like Coumadin. A blood clot forms after the platelets, fibrogen and red blood cells aggregate in the presence of clotting factors. Nattokinase can help break down a clot by breaking down the fibrin mesh that holds the clot together. It does this by increasing the activity of the body’s natural clot buster (plasmin).
Aspirin and fish oil helps prevent clots by reducing the stickiness that lets the form to coagulate. Nattokinase actually can help reduce the bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase the good (HDL) as well as reducing blood viscosity and improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure.
Do your own research to see if this is right for your or ask your ND. Don’t use it if you are already on a prescription blood thinner.

Why is Chicken Soup recommended for the Flu?
Posted on January 25, 2018 | Leave a comment
We are told to eat chicken soup when we are sick but do you know why?
Chicken contains an amino acid called cysteine,that is released when you make the soup. Cysteine has the ability to breakdown proteins found in mucous that settles in the lungs. You may be familiar with the supplement NAC which is N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine which converts to glutathione. The cysteine in the chicken soup does the same thing. Glutathione is a potent antioxidant, protecting fatty tissues from the damaging effects of free radicals. and also is a powerful detoxifier of heavy metals, but specifically for colds is helps carry nutrients to the immune system cells.
Dr. Stephen Rennard of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha in 2000 did a study and found that the ingredients (they never determined which ones specifically) inhibited the movement of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cells that defend against infection. Dr. Rennard theorizes that by inhibiting the migration of these infection-fighting cells in the body, chicken soup essentially helps reduce upper respiratory cold symptoms.
The veggies in chicken soup also help when you have the flu. Carrots are a good natural source of beta-carotene. The body takes that beta-carotene and converts it to vitamin A. Vitamin A helps prevent and fight off infections by enhancing the actions of white blood cells that destroy harmful bacteria and viruses. Onions, another chicken soup regular, contains quercetin, another very powerful anti-oxidant and as far as a cold goes, it helps inhibit histamine, which acts as a natural anti-histamine in many bronchial related conditions. Plus it has anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties!
Chicken soup also contains minerals in a form the body can absorb easily—not just calcium but also magnesium, phosphorus, silicon, sulphur and trace minerals. Minerals are needed for communication by the brain to help the body fight the invaders.
Check out the adjunct liquid vitamin complex to strengthen the immune system with humic and fulvic acid. Throw about all those bottles. Daily Metrix has everything and non GMO, organic too! I take it. www.longlifenews.com

Can your car make you sick?
Posted on January 4, 2018 | 1 comment
This is a great article. Part of it is recreated below. Read more from the link to learn what to do and what it can cause.
https://emfacademy.com/emf-radiation-in-cars/
EMF radiation from the electronics in your car will have both short-term and long-term health effects. Common symptoms and health issues of EMF Exposure are:
Glioma and other brain cancers
Male and Female Infertility (see my post for more on this)
Mood Disorders
Childhood Cancers
Heart Disease
Severe depression
Heart Disease
Anxiety
Muscle Pain
and much more
Sources of EMF Radiation In Cars
The Battery – Most car batteries are a form of DC power, and do not typically emit EMF Radiation consistent with AC power. However, they often will emit a powerful temporary field of DC voltage when changing currents, such as when the vehicle first starts. People that are especially EMF sensitive (suffer from EHS) are likely to respond to this.
Vehicle Relay Switches – Many operations in the vehicle will cause these relay switches to fire, such as pressing the break, turning on the hazard lights, flipping a turn signal, etc. These relay switches create magnetic field radiation.
Vehicle Computer Systems – These should be self explanatory. Any type of computer system will emit a large amount of EMF radiation. Both the on board computer that controls the media system, as well as engine compartment computers will emit radiation.
Electric Engines – Most vehicles have small electric engines that control things like windows and wiper blades that will emit a small amount of radiation.
Alternator – The vehicle alternator is one of the largest sources of EMF radiation. Most commonly found in the far side of the engine compartment, the alternator creates dirty electricity and EMF radiation as it alters the electrical waves to fit the needs of the vehicle.
Key-less Entry Systems and Start Systems – Many new vehicles now no longer require a key, but instead rely on radio waves from the remote control key, and a push button to start the vehicle. These more advanced systems utilize both radio waves, and Bluetooth radiation to control these systems, both of which emit EMF radiation.
On Board Wifi – Wifi creates an enormous amount of radiation (read more about that here). Many vehicles are now coming equipped with Wifi routers built in so that families can be connected without having to rely on cell towers. This is EXTREMELY harmful as it produces an enormous amount of harmful radiation in very close proximity.
Alarm Systems – Also utilizing radio waves, these alarm systems produce EMF radiation.
