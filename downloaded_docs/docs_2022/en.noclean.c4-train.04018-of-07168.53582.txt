Drugs and Alcohol Addiction is a universal problem. There are several ways to overcome it.
Morphine Addiction
Morphine is a narcotic analgesic drug. This drug is highly addictive and acts directly on the central nervous system of human body. Most commonly used earlier as a surgical anesthetic, currently cough medications and pain relievers have Morphine as an ingredient. This drug when abused harms the mental and physical performance of an individual. It relieves anxiety and fear and produces euphoric effect.
Physical dependence develops very quickly in abusers who are exposed to high doses of Morphine. If suddenly stopped, the body experiences severe withdrawal symptoms. Addiction to this drug produces a craving towards it.
Morphine is isolated from opium and is available in tablet form. Abusers depend on this drug for its euphoric effects. It is often taken orally, inhaled and injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Abusers chew or crush this drug to eliminate its controlled-release mechanism. Thus an outsized amount of drug is released into the blood which creates immediate action. Abusers who employ this method develop an amplified tolerance towards this drug, a condition in which higher amount of the drug is essential to get the initial effect.
Effects of Morphine
Regular use of Morphine decreases hunger, reduces the sex drive, produces constipation, inhibits the cough reflex; it also interfere with the menstrual cycle of women abusers. This drug has effect on babies born to addicted mothers. It is passed through the placenta and reaches the unborn baby. Breast-fed babies of addicted mothers become addicted to the drug which they ingest through their mother's milk. Morphine overdose can create dilated pupils, drowsiness, coma, low pulse rate, low blood pressure and fluid in the lungs. It reduces the ability to think or be fully aware of surroundings.
Symptoms of Morphine Addiction
Regular use of Morphine will result in developing tolerance, physical and psychological dependence towards it. With the sudden stoppage of this drug, the body of abuser experiences withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, tearing, yawning, chills, and sweating lasting up to three days.
