This sounds weird, but it is true and good. Cancer cells live on sugar, but the sugar used here will act different. The baking soda makes this sugar neutral and good.
The honey or maple syrup is good to be used and can affect the cancer cells strange. The soda and this sugar get inside the cell of cancer and kill it.
THE RECIPE
You need:
Baking soda
Honey or maple syrup
METHOD:
Mix 1 part baking soda and 3 same parts honey. Mix them smooth and cook 10 min with low heat.
USE:
Get 3 tsp in the morning and for 30 days too.
During the method, avoid flour, meat and sugars.
