Himalayan Salt Inhaler
Himalayan Salt Inhaler
£19.99
Himalayan Salt crystals rest in a chamber inside the inhaler. As you breathe, natural moisture in the air absorbs the salt particles into the lungs, which can help with sinus problems, asthma, the common cold, allergies, hay fever and congestion. It is also a good idea to place the inhaler over a cup of boiling water for an even stronger effect.
