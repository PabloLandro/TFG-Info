WIFI too dangerous for German schools
Posted on December 3, 2014 by Bradford S. Weeks, MD | 0 Comments
Dr. Weeks’ Comment: GMO foods are heartily approved by the FDA for we Americans… but other more civilized nations are governed by leaders who put people before profits and they have outlawed GMO food – most recently Russia. It is the same with electronic pollution. WIFI causes cancer. The research is clear – it (and other electrical pollution – cell phone, DECT phones, cell towers etc.) is bad for human and plant health. But WIFI is not questioned in America where government process is bought by corporations who could not care less for human health and suffering. Other than that, have a Nice Day!

Hamburg stops WiFi in schools
At six schools in Hamburg the digital age was about to begin. But the city and the school board are holding back: The wireless network is considered too dangerous for the health of students.
HAMBURG | The school board’s plans to equip students in three Hamburg schools and three high schools after the summer holidays with tablets and notebooks are for the time being on ice. The reason is that the terminals would be connected with wireless networks. Both potential health consequences and legal questions remain unclear.
“Six schools will replace their blackboard, textbooks, notebooks and pencils with laptops and tablets in class,” announced in May school senator Ties Rabe. During the two-year project up to 1,300 students or about 30% of children and teens were supposed to participate in this pilot project. But the school board had second thoughts : “We are currently investigating whether there are data protection or other legal problems,” admitted spokesman Peter Albrecht.
The project started making big waves when independent MP Walter Scheuerl tried to stop it by submitting two requests by concerned citizens and various reports. The computer data would be transmitted by extremely high microwave frequencies, both up- and downstream.
In fact, some medical doctors have already criticized the introduction of tablets, smart phones, and wireless media as teaching tools as “an uncritical acceptance of progress hype”. In an open letter, about 20 doctors from the “Medical Working Group on Digital Media in Stuttgart” wrote that the caveats expressed by science and medicine regarding the use of digital media in schools were not being given consideration. “The correlation between the increase of burnouts, headaches, ADD and mental illness with the growing use of digital media is worrying,” said Prof. Manfred Spitzer, psychiatrist and brain researcher from Ulm. Scientific research has proven that wireless transmission technology is harmful to the health; it does not only lead to impaired concentration, but can also cause sperm damage and the breakage of DNA strands and thus cancer. Both the manufacturers, as well as the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, warn not to use the equipment in close contact with the body and operate them in minimum safe distances, the doctors said. Neither school board nor health authorities of the Hanseatic city responded to these warnings.
Dirk Petersen, environmental expert at Consumer Protection in Hamburg, however, stated: « In our view, we do not have any reliable information which proves this technology is harmful.” The energy of wireless radiation is simply too small to be harmful, he added. Ellen Kruse, a spokeswoman for the BUND electrosmog group in Hamburg, however, countered: “There are a tons of independent studies showing that Wi-Fi is very harmful.” She called for independent experts to educate the schools. The microwave energy skyrockets when up to 30 students in each class use Wi-Fi simultaneously, said Kruse. The World Health Organization also warns that mobile phones could possibly be carcinogenic. “We are all for the precaution,” she said. However, while not being hostile to progress, BUND asks for wired internet access in schools.
In his petition to the Senate, Scheuerl made also a point about the privacy disclaimers; and whether these would be available to parents, adult students as well as teachers; and what would happen if they would not sign them. The school board admitted that they were studying this matter. Scheuerl said: “The schoolboard had nos really considered that aspect before.” However, the use of Wi-Ffi would be OK in his view if the board would tackle this matter. “The use of Internet in schools is important, especially in regards to the ”information competition », Scheuerl said. He also requested a general clarification on pedagogical and psychological consequences, the liability risks, insurance and copyright issues and general risks.

LEARNING 2.0: Hamburg stops WiFi in schools
from the 29th November 2014
From the editors of Flensburg Tageblatt
At six schools in Hamburg the digital age should find their way. City and school board now back row: The wireless network WLAN was too dangerous for the health of students.
HAMBURG | The Authority announced by the school after the summer holidays measures to equip the students three Hamburg district schools and three high schools each with tablet and notebook, are for the time being on ice. Reason is that the wireless Internet access terminals to be enabled by the wireless network WLAN. Both potential health consequences are unclear, and legal frameworks.
“Six schools replace board, textbooks, notebooks and pencils Laptop and Tablet in class,” it said in May in a statement presented by Senator school Ties Rabe. During the two-year project should thus up to 1,300 students, which is about 30 percent of children and adolescents participate in these schools. Now the school board backtracked. “We are currently investigating whether there are data protection or other legal problems,” admitted a spokesman Peter Albrecht.
High waves had the project mainly beaten because of the non-party MPs citizenship Walter Scheuerl with two kids trying to torpedo the project requests in the citizenry and various reports. So would transmit data over the wireless local radio networks by means of radiating and receiving extremely high microwave frequencies.
In fact, some doctors criticized recently, the introduction of tablets, smartphones, and wireless media as teaching in schools as “an uncritical acceptance of progress hype”. In an open letter complain about 20 doctors from “Doctors Working Group Digital Media in Stuttgart”, that the comments made in science and medicine concerns the use of digital media in schools were not being met. “The correlation of the increase of overwork, headaches, ADHD and mental illness with the growing use of digital media is worrying,” said Ulmer psychiatrist and brain researcher Prof. Manfred Spitzer. According to the state of science whose harmfulness was clear that stress could also lead to impaired concentration, in addition to sperm damage to DNA strand breaks and thus cancer. The manufacturer, as well as the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, would already warning of a body-hugging use the equipment and require minimum distances, so the doctors. Neither school board nor health authority of the Hanseatic city could respond to such warnings.
Dirk Petersen, environmental expert at Consumer Hamburg , relativized: “There is in our view no reliable information, that it is harmful.” For the radiation was simply too small, so the expert. Ellen Kruse, a spokeswoman for the AG electrosmog the BUND Hamburg, however, criticized: “There are a lot of neutral studies showing that Wi-Fi is very harmful.” She called independent experts who educate in schools. Especially the combined use of up to 30 students comprehensive classes is questionable, so Kruse. The World Health Organization warn that mobile phone could possibly be carcinogenic. “We are the precautionary principle,” she said. However, the Bund was not hostile to progress and plead for a wired internet access in schools.
In its requests to the Senate it was Scheuerl also the subject of privacy statements and whether the legal guardian, adult students as well as teachers they would be and what would happen if they would not sign. The school board admitted now, just to check this straight. Scheuerl said: “The Authority had previously not carefully prepared.” However, the use of WLAN is from his point of view in order if they would agree. “The school used for the Internet research is important, but it is also about information literacy,” said Scheuerl. A general education he also called on the educational and learning psychological consequences, liability risks, technical issues, and copyright issues and risks.
