Is WiFi safe ?

Is WiFi radiation safe?
Judging by the many devices that now use WiFi it’d be difficult to believe that it’s not safe.
10 years ago WiFi was virtually unheard of.
Now WiFi is everywhere.
It’s in the home, in the workplace and even in the street.
It’s in Internet connections, in video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii, the Playstation 4, the Microsoft Xbox, in PDAs, in smart phones, and in a whole host of other types of consumer electronics.
So WiFi must be safe, right?
Wrong.
WiFi devices emit radio-frequency or microwave radiation.
Wireless modem routers and wireless computers contain transmitters that use this radio-frequency radiation to send information back and forth in the air.
This radio-frequency (RF) radiation can penetrate walls made of wood, concrete and metal. It can easily penetrate our bodies.
There are now thousands of peer reviewed studies conducted by scientists from around the world that show WiFi radiation to be harmful.
These scientists and medical experts are speaking out, here’s what some of them are saying:
Professor Olle Johannson Dept. of Neuroscience Karolinska Institute Sweden
Dr. Magda Havas Toxicologist at Trent University
In this article I explain what WiFi is, I explain the dangers and I explain what you can do to protect yourself.
What Is WiFi ?
WiFi is a registered trademark owned by the WiFi Alliance. The WiFi Alliance defines WiFi as any wireless local area network (WLAN). By
definition WiFi does not use any wires it uses radio frequency technology.
Webopedia defines radio-frequency as any frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum associated with radio wave propagation and gives the following analysis of the frequencies that make up the electromagnetic radiation spectrum :
Ultra-low frequency (ULF) — 0-3 Hz
Extremely low frequency (ELF) — 3 Hz – 3 kHz
Very low frequency (VLF) — 3kHz – 30 kHz
Low frequency (LF) — 30 kHz – 300 kHz
Medium frequency (MF) — 300 kHz – 3 MHz
High frequency (HF) — 3MHz – 30 MHz
Very high frequency (VHF) — 30 MHz – 300 MHz
Ultra-high frequency (UHF)– 300MHz – 3 GHz
Super high frequency (SHF) — 3GHz – 30 GHz
Extremely high frequency (EHF) — 30GHz – 300 GHz
Power lines operate at 50 to 60 Hz are located in the extremely low frequency range, ELF. An FM radio for instance operates in the VHF range, usually between 88 and 110 MHz. Analog TV operates in the 400 – 600MHz range, Digital TV is in the 600 – 1000MHz range. Cell phones operate in the range of 850 to 1900 MHz (0.8-1.9GHz), UHF, depending where you live in the world.
WiFi has a carrier signal in the 2.4 GHz range (which is nearly S HF) with some more recent devices operating in the 5-6 GHz range AND a digital pulsed signal of 10-250Hz which penetrates walls, ceilings, floors and not to mention humans.
WiFi radiation is commonly termed RF (radio frequency) radiation because it operates within the range 3kHz-300GHz. It is also called microwave radiation. Microwave radiation is in fact a subset of RF radiation, it operates in the range 300 MHz to 300 GHz.
Is WiFi More Dangerous Than Cell Phones?
So cell phones and digital TV are operating broadly in the same frequency. The reason why we don’t hear any alarming reports about cancer and digital TV usage is probably because your digital TV is not positioned a few centimeters from your head.
But WiFi is operating much higher up the spectrum than these other devices, more energy is in play. Fortunately WiFi modems and transmitters are not held in such close proximity to the human body as cell phones, or are they? Many cell phones also offer a WiFi functionality.
WiFi Pollution Is Non Stop
The biggest problem with WiFi is that the majority of WiFi modem/routers emit radio frequency radiation 24/7. It’s pulsed microwave radiation just like cell phones.
You may have a cell phone but is your cell phone switched on all the time? If you have a WiFi router at home this generally operates 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Many people sit in offices completely oblivious to the fact that they are exposing themselves to WiFi radiation.
How To Make WIFI Safe And Cut Down On Your Personal Electrosmog
The only way you can effectively reduce reduce your exposure to electrosmog is to measure your electromagnetic pollution using an emf meter. These have now become inexpensive easy to use devices which allow you to easily detect and measure the radiofrequency pollution in your home or workplace.
You don’t have to take my word for it when I say that WiFi is very bad for your health. More and more studies point to the adverse health effects of radio frequency radiation.
I have never had WiFi in my home. I make sure that the WiFi function is disarmed on my modem and also that it is disarmed on my laptop, and I test regularly with my EMF meter for WiFi radiation from my neighbors routers, I would advise you to do the same.

Rudy said,
Would definitely agree with you. There is certainly enough evidence out there to at lest call for further investigation into the possible harmful effects.
barbaralayne said,
So, Lloyd, if you want to continue using a computer,
for your health, would it be best to use a modem connection from your internet provider, instead of WIFI?
Lloyd said,
Using a modem or router via WiFi means that RF radiation is emitted into the immediate environment ‘(up to around 100 meters). The studies tell us that that this radiation, even at low levels, long term, is very bad for our health. Disabling your WiFi and going hardwired is by far the safer option.
Christine said,
Lloyd, I just bought a Samsung Tablet and a Belkin router to get wifi at home. If I turn the router off when not in use, does it continue to emit radiation. Reading the accompanying disclosures about radiation that came with the router is unnerving! Wondering if I return the router and don’t have wifi service to my home, could I use the tablet in internet cafes. A jungle of information, the deeper I enter. Thanks.
Lloyd said,
Be careful about switching off the WiFi through the software….many routers are configured to receive software updates 24/7 and when they do they revert to factory settings…the WiFi switches back on again…only an RF meter will tell you whether this is the case with your router. If you don’t have an RF meter I advise pulling the plug at the wall to switch. Better still (for your health) remove the WiFi router from your home…
Ron Becker said,
Hi Lloyd,
I love your site, thanks for all of your dedication!
I have a Netgear N600 wireless duel band router. I use it only with the wired function. I tested it with the Accustometer and found that the wireless signal leaks through when the router is on but not when its turned off.(3.65 v/m ) What do you recommend ?
Thank You,
Ron
Lloyd said,
Hi Ron
If your Netgear router is emitting radiation I suggest using it a strict minimum, better still, replace it with a model which does not have this problem. Your Acoustimeter will tell you exactly what the RF radiation sources are in your environment, then its just a question of eliminating/minimizing their effects as much as possible.
jon sid said,
Digital TV operates in the same spectrum as analog TV. Where did you get your facts from? The reason TV signals are not discussed too much here as being harmful is because there are too many people who aren’t willing to give up their TV.
Lloyd Burrell said,
The biggest concern with TV broadcasts is the nature of the signal (analog or digital) rather than the frequency itself. Digital TV broadcasting emits a pulsed digital signal similar to that of cell towers and WiFi routers…. considered to be much more dangerous than the previous continuous analog signal.
Adrienne @ Whole New Mom said,
Hi there. Just found your site. I am very interested in getting to the bottom of this. Can you tell me your thoughts about this? I have asked a number of professionals (in IT, for example) about EMFs from laptops. They have said something like, “Well, it’s nothing really – there are cell phone towers all over the place so you are getting radiation anyway. By comparison, your WIFI is nothing.
Could you address that please? Thank you in advance.
