Brain Cancer & Cell Phones
Ethics compelled us to ensure that all reasonable people have access to the basic scientific facts. Your cell phone is a microwave transmitter and it should bear a cancer warning! Microwave energy oscillates at millions to billions of cycles per second. The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry reports that these frequencies cause cancer and other diseases by interfering with cellular DNA and its repair mechanisms. Brain cancer and cell phone risk is real. Microwave promotes rapid cell aging. Italian scientists have recently demonstrated that cell phone radiation makes cancerous cells grow aggressively. Cordless phones marked 900 megahertz or 2.4 gigahertz emit the same dangerous microwave radiation as cell phones.

California Department of Public Health Releases Cell Phone Radiation Warning Document (VIDEO)

What is inside that draft is alarming, but state health officials say it was never finalized or officially adopted by the department. Berkeley-based doctor, Joel Moskowitz, sued the state in 2016 under the California Public Records Act to get it released. So, the first thing you’ll notice is the big black letters stamped across it, “draft and not for public release."

Everywhere you look, someone is carrying around a cell phone – many people see these devices as extensions of themselves. Whether in your purse, in your hands, or in your pocket, a cell phone is always within arm’s reach in case a text message, an email, or a phone call comes in.
