2.Drink water You may know the drill already, sixty-four ounces of water daily, about 8 glasses. This helps the fiber in your diet, as it allows the fiber to do it's job - the fiber soaks up the water, thereby bulking the stool. Without water, the fiber may cause even worse constipation. It is best to take the water straight, but not essential.
Other common symptoms are itching and burning during and after bowel movements. This is caused by mucus and feces that stick to the bulging hemorrhoid and irritate the anal opening.
Now, one question you may ask, is how much extra fiber is that over what I am getting already in my diet? The answer is, if you are eating white bread, you are likely on a diet that has a meagre 11 grams of fiber per today, but the good news is, that means you only need to add in an extra 20 grams! That's about 3 to 4 large apples / oranges.
In a very high fiber diet for hemorrhoids you may be asked by your doctor to consume as much as 3.5 ounces or 96 grams of fiber a day, to keep your body healthy and balanced. A high fiber diet, that is normally sufficient for a hemorrhoid suffer is about one third that dose - 31 grams or one ounce.
Cream, ice cream, Whole milk, 2% milk. Most pies, pastries, cakes. Most cheeses (like cream cheese, cheddar, American) Many snack foods (like nuts and chips)
2. Salt A restriction in dietary sodium intake can reduce the incidence of hypertension. Studies have shown that there is a clear relationship between dietary salt intake and Blood pressure and people who consume less salt have a smaller rise in Blood pressure with advancing age. Salt restriction to about 100mmol/day (2.4 gm sodium or 6 gm sodium chloride) has been shown to produce a significant reduction in systolic Blood pressure to about 8-14 mm Hg in several randomized placebo-controlled studies. In some people, eating too much salt can make blood pressure much worse and In other cases the same salt consumption may have no effect.
"When one complains of rectal bleeding, the physi??cian has to determine its exact cause. Hemorrhoids are the most common cause of this symptom but it can also be due to rectal polyps or rectal cancer. So a complete evaluation is in order," Corpus said.
No doubt, a drugstore remedy will also provide you instant relief, but it may not last for too long. Surgery is yet another hemorrhoids cure no doubt, but it may be hurtful and is sometimes not too effective as well. Venapro is a safe hemorrhoids cure that along with home hemorrhoids cure should do the trick for you as it has for others.
"There are three complications of hemorrhoids. If they always bleed, the patient may lose a lot of blood and become anemic. Another problem is prolapse which is what happens when an internal hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus and can't be pushed back. This can cause a lot of discomfort and pain. A third compli??cation is thrombosis which occurs with external hemor??rhoids. A blood clot forms within the veins, it hardens, and the patient experiences excruciating pain," Corpus said.
If hemorrhoids don't bother you, they should be left alone. But if they cause pain, bleed, itch or protrude, they have to be treated. This is especially true with chronic cases which can lead to corrtplications.
External hemorrhoids are almost always painful since they stretch the sensitive skin of the anus. This type can be felt as a firm, rounded mass and the pain subsides only when the clot softens after a few days.
High blood pressure if left unchecked results in increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and leads to target organ damage such as LVH, retinal changes and vascular changes. The main objective in the management of hypertension is prevention of target organ damage and reduction of cardiovascular risk. The management requires a multi-prolonged approach. Although it is widely accepted that drug therapy is essential for optimal Blood pressure control, it should not be forgotten that nonpharmocological measures are also important in the management of hypertension.
4- Caffeine Intake: The evidence from the literature is rather conflicting and the effects of caffeine seem to depend on multiple variables such as daily dose, preexisting Blood pressure and coffee drinking habits. The ingestion of 250mg of caffeine has been shown to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure ranging from 6mm of hg in normal individuals to 10 mm hg in patients with hypertension and an increase in diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm hg in normal individuals to 8.5 mm Hg in patients of hypertension.
More salt intake will result in more retention of fluid by kidneys and this will lead to more preload on heart, that will result in more blood pressure. You should avoid salt in your diet if you really want to control your blood pressure. If you are already a patient of hypertension, then reduce salt in your diet as it just accentuates the problem. You can lower your blood pressure to a great extent if you reduce salt consumption in your diet. You should not have more than 6 grams (100mmol/day) of salt per day. Pizza, canned foods, frozen diners, broths, canned soups and salad dressings have high sodium so try to avoid these foods. If you are non-vegetarian then make sure you are including white meat like chicken and fish rather than red meat in your diet.
To obtain an accurate diagnosis, the physician can examine the anal area with an endoscope (a short lighted tube-like instrument) or a proctosigmoidoscope (a longer instrument that enables the doctor to see the lower portion of the large intestine). This is important since bleeding may signal the presence of other diseases like colorectal cancer which kills thousands of people yearly.
Most cookies contain high fat content Many fast foods are also rich in fats Saturated fats are not good for heart and blood vessels. Low density lipoprotein LDL is main factor which causes thickening of blood vessels so causing extra strain on blood vessels in patients of high blood pressure. The balanced high blood pressure diet should include mild amounts of saturated and trans-fats (red meat, fast food), and moderate amounts of other fats (olive oil and canola oil).
It may take years before hemorrhoids become apparent and symptoms develop. The person only becomes aware of them when there is blood on the toilet paper or bloody feces. This often occurs with an internal hemorrhoid which can be felt as a soft lump. This type usually returns into the rectum or can be pushed back in with a finger.
The mere act of sitting on the toilet bowl for pro-longed periods - even if you just read there - can make you vulnerable to hemorrhoids. The problem may also be inherited and tends to run in families. "As you know, 90 percent of varicose veins are inherited. The problem is genetic. It's caused by weakened valves and vein walls. When you inherit that tendency, there's not much you can do. That's true with hemorrhoids," said Dr. Ed T. Corpus Jr., a general and vascular surgeon at the Vein Care Clinic at Ferosa Condominium in Manila.

Following Foods should be avoided if you have High blood pressure: 1. Alcohol The association between alcohol and high blood pressure is well documented both in population and clinical studies. An Alcohol intake of about 80 g/day (Equivalent to four pints of beer) has been shown to raise Blood pressure particularly in patients of hypertension. Blood pressure tends to fall when alcohol is stopped or reduced and remains low in patients who continue to abstain. Patients with hypertension should avoid Alcohol. As alcohol can raise blood pressure directly, is also an important factor in damaging walls of blood vessels, which can elevate the blood pressure further and make it more difficult to treat, while at the same time increasing the risk of complications. Limit consumption of Alcohol to no more than two drinks per day in most men and one drink per day in women and lightweight men.
There are many thousands of patients of hemorrhoids that are seeking a home hemorrhoid cure for their problem since they may be afraid of, or may simply not wish to see a doctor about their hemorrhoids. As time has gone by, inventive souls have come up with home hemorrhoids cure that really do work, and all that remains is finding which one is most suitable in a particular instance as all cures may not suit each and every individual being.
Cures However, if you are a person not afraid of a visit to the doctor, you will also find that going under the surgeon's scalpels to be another hemorrhoids cure. You may be sure that your hemorrhoids cure will depend on where the hemorrhoids are located; what are the problems that they are causing you as well as the level of severity of the problem. Sometimes, the hemorrhoids condition may be no more than temporary for which warm sitz bath cold compresses or even topical analgesics should suffice.
4. Bowel training Essentially go to the toilet at the same convenient time every day. Sit for about five minutes in the toileting posture ( feet raised on ball of feet, elbows resting on knees). Let your body become accustomed to this timing and hopefully, you will start doing your business on a regular daily basis, at about the same time every day.
3. Fats Food that is rich in fats should be avoided. Foods High in Fat are as follows Fats and oils (like margarine, vegetable oils, butter, lard, salt pork, meat drippings, gravy, and fat back)
3.Exercise Walking is good, bicycling better. Walking or bicycling quickly for 30 minutes, three to four times a week, improves one's overall health, but, more importantly, it helps get the intestines stronger and healthier, allowing for the bowel motions to be moved more easily out, without all that straining on the toilet.
This can help train your bowel to empty on a daily basis, which can help reduce the incidence of constipation General guidelines: Do not force. Do not sit for much more than five minutes. If nothing happens, try again tomorrow. If the urge hits at a different time - GO! - otherwise you may cause yourself more hemorrhoid problems.

Since obesity is a factor in hemorrhoids, it pays to lose weight. You can do this with the help of Zyroxin, a safe and natural supplement that will maximize your weight loss through its unique fat-burning ingredients. For details, visit http://www.zyroxin.com/.
Using a food table to work out the fiber in the foods you like, you can also see if there are any foods that stand out as worthwhile. Still can't adjust your diet to get enough fiber, then try fiber supplements. They work out to be about $20 to $40 a month, but compare that to the cost and inconvenience of a hemorrhoid operation that may run thousands of dollars and leave you in pain and discomfort for weeks. Powdered psyllium husks are a good option.
What are the foods to be avoided in high blood pressure? This is very common question my patients often ask me. On one hand, it is exceedingly complicated and complex and has been the continued focus of research by doctors and physicians. On the other hand, the vast majority of dietary recommendations for hypertension have resemblance and similarities to general healthy diet recommendations.
Pregnancy itself does not cause hemorrhoids but it may hasten their development. This is caused by hormones in the woman's body that dilate blood vessels more easily. The same goes for women with many children and those who regularly use laxatives and enemas.
1. Introduce more fiber into your diet. Fiber is extremely good at relieving constipation - the main cause of hemorrhoids - and fiber is well renown for preventing them and alleviating their symptoms. Fiber does this by bulking the stool and making it soft, so that the body can eliminate it without much straining.
A simple home hemorrhoids cure is to apply vitamin E to the hemorrhoids for which a Vitamin E capsule containing liquid should be used. Breaking this capsule into two equal pieces, you can then take the liquid and apply directly on the hemorrhoids, which will help in healing your condition a lot sooner.
Fatty meats (like corned beef, regular ground beef, ribs, sausage, hot dogs, bacon, bologna, salami,) Fried foods (like French fries and fried chicken)
Fiber preferably is to be taken via fresh fruits, whole grain foods, and beans. If you notice that your body is letting off too much gas, this may be the result of increasing the fiber in your diet too quickly. Just cut back on the amount of fiber and gradually increase it over time.
Conclusion:
Hemorrhoids afflict millions every year. They are painful, uncomfortable, basically unbearable. The simple natural treatment for hemorrhoids above, can go along way to bring an end to your suffering.
