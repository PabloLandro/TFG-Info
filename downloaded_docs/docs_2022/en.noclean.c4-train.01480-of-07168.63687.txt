A lot of people want to know how to tell the difference between cold sores and herpes, but the truth is it's all herpes.
Throwing around the word "herpes" tends to worry people. There's a huge stigma attached to the disease, eclipsed only by the lack of general knowledge about what exactly is herpes. This is frustrating since it affects so many people. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated two-thirds of the global population under the age of 50 have herpes simplex virus type 1, otherwise known as HSV-1, most commonly referred to as oral herpes. Meanwhile, its counterpart, HSV-2, or genital herpes, affects about one out of every six people aged 14 to 49, according to the CDC. This begs the question: Why are we so scared of something so common?
Most of the answer lies, again, in misinformation. The general gist of herpes is pretty misunderstood. Both types of herpes are spread through physical contact, and both can be transmitted by kissing, oral sex, and bodily fluids. Far too many people remain in the dark about their chances of having herpes, and they are unnecessarily judgmental of those who have it. The truth is, the disease is only visible during a breakout, which may only happen once during the lifetime of someone who is infected. It’s similar to acne in that there are certainly ways to prevent it, but it affects most people at some point in their lives, so there’s no reason to see it as a moral shortcoming. If you’re affected by either HSV-1 or HSV-2, get treatment immediately, but don’t feel like your life is over.
HSV-1 = Oral herpes (usually)
Unlike HSV-2, which is almost entirely transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, HSV-1 is transmitted via oral-to-oral contact, usually resulting in orolabial herpes, or cold sores around the mouth. These cold sores, which are also known as fever blisters, can be extremely painful and usually last about 7 to 10 days, but that time can be reduced with proper treatment.
They’re contagious, obviously, but it’s not just through mouth-to-mouth contact. If you’re experiencing a cold sore, it’s best not to touch the affected area with your hand since the infection could spread via your fingertips (in general, it’s a good idea to always be extra-vigilant and wash your hands when you have any sort of open wound). The cold sores can also appear on other parts of your body, like the inside of your mouth, on your face, or inside your nose.
HSV-2 = Genital herpes
HSV-2, meanwhile, is transmitted via genital-to-genital contact and might never produce symptoms. However, those symptoms tend to be severe if you do experience them. They include small blisters around the genitals, which eventually break open, producing a painful sore, and might be accompanied by flu-like symptoms; cracked, raw, or red areas around the genitals without pain or itching; itching or tingling in the genital or anal region; pain when urine passes over the sores; and headaches and backaches.
You can get genital herpes from someone who has oral herpes
While the two types of herpes generally stay in their genital or oral place, oral-to-genital transmission of HSV-1 is possible. To prevent spread, the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) recommends abstaining from oral contact, like kissing and oral sex, while experiencing an HSV-1 outbreak, aka cold sores or fever blisters. Otherwise, using a barrier, like a dental dam or a condom, can limit exposure as well.
If you already have oral herpes, it's harder to get genital herpes
It’s more difficult for someone with HSV-1 to become infected with HSV-2 than someone without HSV-1, which is pretty good news, since the ASHA points out that most adults already have HSV-1.
There is no cure for either, but both can be treated
Neither form of herpes has a cure, but the discomfort can be treated with medication. Genital herpes can reach a severe level of discomfort in people with a suppressed immune system and should not go untreated. Sore close to the mouth, vagina, or rectum can also increase the risk of giving or getting HIV if one partner has it, so monitoring these symptoms is key.

What's most important to remember is that a herpes diagnosis or a cold sore popping up is not the end of the world. It might feel scary to have to tell potential sexual partners about your diagnosis, but Dr. Vanessa Cullins, MD, the vice president of external medical affairs at Planned Parenthood, previously gave Teen Vogue a few tips on what to say to make the interaction a little less intimidating. She suggested knowing your facts so you can calmly tell your partner when they have questions. It's important, she said, to tell a partner before you two engage in any sexual contact, so you're both fully informed and in control. And even before that, sex educator Lena Solow previously wrote for Teen Vogue, you should find a doctor you trust who isn't judgmental about your health, so that you feel both informed and empowered.
"STIs, and herpes in particular, can cause a lot of shame, fear, and confusing feelings about your body," she wrote. "But I will tell you right now — your body is still amazing, and you still deserve to feel good in your body and have great romantic and sexual relationships! You are still the same wonderful you."
