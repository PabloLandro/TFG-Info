Health Benefits of Sunglasses
By raghava July 11, 2018 January 24, 2019
Sunglasses with 100% UV tinting cut down on glare from reflected sunlight. This reduces squinting (and the wrinkles it causes), and can prevent certain migraines and headaches brought on by bright light. But the real benefit comes when you’re driving: glare from a road can temporarily blind drivers. UV tinted sunglasses allow you to avoid this potential hazard. And you don’t have to choose dark lenses: pale amber or other light colors work just as well to prevent glare, as long as they are 100% UV tinted.
Wind and air conditioning can dry out your eyes, causing discomfort, redness, itchiness and soreness. In cars, air conditioning often feels best when it’s blowing near your face – and that means into your eyes. Wearing sunglasses – even when it’s not sunny – cuts down on the effects of air blowing directly into your eyes.
Don’t forget cataracts – one of those ailments you don’t really think about until it’s too late. Long term excessive exposure to UV rays can cause cataracts in your eyes. Symptoms include blurred vision, light sensitivity, double vision, needing brighter light to read, and fading of colors. Wearing sunglasses regularly can prevent or slow the development of cataracts, so it’s never too early to start.
