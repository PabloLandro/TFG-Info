Is it good or bad drink lots of water? The definitive answer
by Humphrey · July 26, 2016
We have been told that you have to take two liters of water a day, yet there are health professionals who warn about the risks of drinking too much water. So, what we were? Is it good or bad drink lots of water? We give the answer.
Is it good or bad drink lots of water?
Water is a key body chemical, so you must stay within a healthy range in order to balance the body. Drinking enough water is essential to the human body to function properly, but drinking too much can be as dangerous as drinking too little. Why? There are several reasons…

No. 1: Over consumption of water hinders the bodys ability to get rid of waste
The more water we drink, the more we urinate. You might think that means you are getting rid of waste faster. But studies have shown that when excess urine your kidneys have to work overtime to try to stabilize the system.
No. 2: Excess water negatively affects the brain
Most cells have room to stretch because they are embedded in the flexible, such as fat and muscle tissues, but this is not the case for neurons. Brain cells are tightly packed into a rigid bone cage, skull, and have to share this space with the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

Athletes are particularly at risk. According to experts, 14 deaths of marathon runners, football players and other athletes have been attributed to drinking too much water during physical activity. The condition is known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), in which the kidneys are overwhelmed by the large amount of liquid they have to process.
Common symptoms of hyponatremia include dizziness, fainting, nausea, bloating and weight gain during physical activity. In severe vomiting, headaches, confusion, agitation, delirium, convulsions and coma appear.
So you know, it’s good to drink water, but it’s bad drink plenty of water. So you see, even water must be taken in moderation).
