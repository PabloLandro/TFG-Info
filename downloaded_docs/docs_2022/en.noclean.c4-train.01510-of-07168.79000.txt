Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements
Vitamin C, 1,000 to 6,000 mg daily - essential for collagen synthesis and connective tissue repair
Vitamin A, 10,000 to 25,000 I. U .daily
Vitamin E, 400 to 1,200 I. U. daily - inhibits enzymes that break down cartilage
Vitamin B-complex (especially B-6), 50 mg daily
Proanthocyanidin (grape seed extract or pycnogenol)- 100 to 300 mg daily - a strong anti-inflammatory
Zinc picolinate - 30 to 50 mg daily
Selenium - 200 mcg
Copper aspirinate - 2 mg
Calcium - 1,000 mg
Magnesium - 400 to 800 mg
Manganese - 10 to 20 mg
Boron - 6 to 9 mg - improves the symptoms of arthritis.
Glucosamine sulfate - 1,000 mg three times daily for 12 weeks, followed by a maintenance dosage of 500 mg three times daily. Glucosamine is a building block of cartilage and is useful in the repair of damaged cartilage or to grow new cartilage. A multitude of studies (nearly three hundred, including 20 double-blind studies) have shown that glucosamine can relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. It usually takes four to eight weeks to get significant benefit from glucosamine.
Niacinamide (Vitamin B-3) 500 mg four times daily - beneficial in treating arthritis.
Methionine, 250 mg - 4 times/day - an amino acid needed for cartilage formation, has been shown in some studies to be more effective than ibuprofen in treating osteoarthritis.
Essential fatty acids in the form of omega-6 oils, such as evening primrose oil, black currant seed oil, and borage oil; and omega-3 oils from cold-water fish (salmon, sardines, and tuna) and flaxseed oil have been effective in treating arthritis. Flaxseed oil should be taken in a dosage of two tablespoons daily, and is better absorbed if taken with a small amount of cottage cheese. The best omega 3 and 6 combination is EPA (1,000 mg)/DHA (500 mg) or any 2:1 combination of EPA:DHA.
Bovine cartilage and supplements containing chondroitin sulfate may be helpful.
S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) has been successful for the past twenty years in treating arthritis in Europe.
