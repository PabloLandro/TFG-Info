Woman, 63, drinks her own urine to “stay young”
Posted on October 9, 2013 by Dr. Eowyn | Leave a comment
Would you drink this to stay young?
Women (and increasingly men) have resorted to cosmetic surgery cutting up their faces in a quest to erase signs of aging like wrinkles, double chins, and under-eye bags.
A narcissistic British woman is going a different route. She drinks her own urine to “stay young.”
Katy Winter reports for the Daily Mail, Oct. 3, 2013, that 63-year-old Sylvia Chandler claims drinking a pint of her own urine every day for the last 20 years has kept her slim and youthful.
She also uses her urine to wash her hair and moisturize her face, and insists she hasn’t gone to a doctor in over a decade.
Chandler told the UK entertainment website Closer:
“Drinking my own urine has kept me healthy and energized. And it helps me stay young — men are often surprised when I tell them my age. I have a glass of urine in the morning and another couple during the day. It tastes delicious – it’s a bit like water, but sweeter. I haven’t been to the doctor in a decade. I never get colds and I’ve maintained my size 10 figure.”
The thrice-married single mother-of-two is an advocate of urine therapy for everything from keeping youthful to healing wounds, and keeps a bottle of old urine in the kitchen in case she burns herself, as aged urine has stronger healing properties.
But she admits that she had to start small when it came to actually drinking her urine. She diluted her first glass with cranberry juice, but soon progressed to drinking it straight three times a day.
Chandler justifies the purported health benefits of drinking urine, saying that when we were in our mothers’ wombs, we were swimming in and drinking our own urine: “For nine months before you were born you floated in a combination of your own and your mother’s urine. You drank it, it fed you, it grew your lungs entirely. All of your skin, your bones are made from tiny crystals which are all formed by urine. Most of us came out perfect with beautiful skin, and it’s only when we’ve lived this toxic life that we get sick. If you came out perfect, it doesn’t matter what you get wrong with you, you can put yourself back to being perfect.”
But Rob Hicks, M.D. — a general practitioner — thinks otherwise. He reminds us that urine is a waste product, produced by our kidneys ridding the body of toxins: “Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine, but as far as I’m aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims. The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body doesn’t need, so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive. Personally, I believe there are better – and more palatable – ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and keeping stress under control.”
The pic below is the only pic of Sylvia Chandler that I could find by googling images of “Sylvia Chandler.” It’s taken from a very long and tedious video of her extolling her “urine therapy.” Note that she’s shot in dim light and from a distance, not to mention her hair conceals most of her face.
I took this screenshot (below) of her at the 40:21 mark in the video, showing more of her face:
.
Then I cropped her head, and magnified it
Even in the dim light you can see those deep bags under her eyes.
Take away the youthful long hair (washed in urine!) and mini-skirt. What you have is a 63-year-old woman who looks her age — and more!
Yuck!

She should fill her swimming pool with it. Then she will claim to have
found the fountain of youth.

someone get this poor woman some cucumber and potatoes juice and place on her sad looking eyes. I have read about this *theory* but never tried it. I think if the good Lord wanted us to do this, it would have been written. Thankfully, it is not!

Good Lord – I know many women in their 80’s that look younger than she does. She is completely delusional.

The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
