So if you really what to do it right, be sure the salt lamp you buy is actually made from legit Himalayan pink salt and not, say, plastic. (Or get the plastic one, but don't remotely expect it to be more than a night-light.) If you're not into the raw salt crystal shape, you can also find salt lamps shaped like obelisks, pyramids, and the like. They also come in colors that aren't pink! Do a big Google search. You'll find one you like. https://himalayansaltboutique.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-easycart-data/products/pics1/4%20Four%2015-20%20%20lb.%20Salt%20Lamps%20Pack_0c8ea23313bec2460a133f1212a52fed.jpg

In January of this year, Michael's issued a recall on some of their salt lamps sold under the Lumière brand. Rest assured, the issue and recall had nothing to do with the Himalayan salt itself but reported hazards with the dimmer switch and plug. If you’re looking to purchase a lamp, talk to the retailer and make sure it has been assembled properly and that the piece you’re interested in was not included in the recall. https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2342/4477/products/salt-lamp-6kg-to-8kg-homewares-ishka_273_260x.jpg?v
"Salt crystal is naturally hygroscopic, absorbing water molecules from the air. You will notice if your salt lamp remains unlit for long periods of time, it will begin to 'cry.' The heat from a small light bulb keeps these beautiful crystals dry and in turn releases negative ions (the healthy ones found in abundance in places like oceans, waterfalls, even your shower) into the air," according to the site. http://www.usefulinnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Himalayan-salt-lamp-with-dimmer-switch.jpg
Match the beauty of a natural Himalayan salt lamp with the power of technology with a multicolor USB salt lamp. All of the benefits that you expect from a Himalayan salt crystal lamp are featured, most notably its ability to draw in moisture and purify the toxins that you may have in your environment from the air in a process known as hygroscope. They also have the natural orange-pink glow that has made Himalayan salt crystal lamps famous throughout the world.
Rose McClintick, a QXCI Practitioner and Biofeedback Analyst, who has been working in the holistic health field for seven years, tested our salt lamps and offered an enthusiastic endorsement in regard to their generation of negative ions: “Regarding the salt lamps, I can tell you that my test shows that it has improved the negative ions. (They) will be recommended to have in the bedrooms. You get both working for you, improved neg. ions and a better night’s sleep.” Zykoff Bodywork
The structure aspect is important, says Beauchamp. One way to get crystals to generate ions is to alter the shape of its crystal structure via temperature, something that can happen if a crystal structure is asymmetric. He points to a crystal called lithium tantalate, which changes its crystal structure when heated up in such a way as to create areas of high and low electrical potential when heated or cooled. This property allows it to generate an electric field that could, in theory, ionize the air around it. Sodium chloride’s chemical structure is a symmetrical cube that does not have the capability to generate high electric fields in the vicinity of a crystal. https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/12/salt_lamp_tw.jpg?resize

In 1966, a hospital in Jerusalem conducted a study of thirty-eight infants suffering from respiratory problems. They cared for half of the infants in a ward without any ion change, and cared for the other half in a ward where a negative-ion generator was in use. “The researchers reported that neg-ions without any other treatment “ that is, no drugs “ seemed to cure attacks of asthma and bronchitis more quickly than drugs, antibiotics included… children treated with neg-ions were less prone to ‘rebound attacks’ (relapses)… the scientific report said that the tests ‘demonstrated that atmospheric ions have an effect on infants, especially those suffering from asthmatic bronchitis. Less scientifically, they found that the babies didn’t cry as often and as loudly as they did in normal air.” The Ion Effect, by Fred Soyka, p. 57, 1991. https://hddmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/my-himalayan-salt-lamp-e1504526903824.jpg
If you’re in the market for a Himalayan salt lamp, you want to do your homework to make sure you choose the best option possible. There are said to be several ways to tell if you have a salt lamp that’s the real deal.

Everyday appliances such as televisions, cell phones, computers and tablets release positive ions into the air constantly. These and other common electronics can cause an overflow of electromagnetic radiation (EM), which, although invisible, is believed to cause some serious long-term effects. Constant exposure to EM radiation is known primarily to cause fatigue, increase stress and weaken the immune system. Himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions and cancel out positive ones. Therefore, by neutralizing electromagnetic radiation, they help reduce artificial frequencies and even prevent static buildup.
Another way to improve the quality of air in your house is by frequently airing the place, so the air can circulate. In the winter months or when there are high levels of air pollution, it might be difficult to leave the windows open and sufficiently air all the rooms. That is when the salt lamps can be particularly useful and can help cleanse the air and remove the stubborn winter bugs. https://www.sun-gazing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/32f23f233f232ff2323f32f3ff32.jpg

Regular use helps to reduce its shape.
Himalayan salt lamps can be used as an aid in color therapy (chromotherapy), an alternative method of diagnosing and treating a large number of illnesses. They produce a soft light in hues of ambient orange, yellow and red that helps with stress, attention deficit disorder, and general relaxation, among others. The serene light is thought to balance physical, spiritual and emotional energies.
I bought this salt lamp to help my allergies. The lamp was heavier and bigger than I expected, which I liked. The shape is really pretty and different than the typical ones I see in the stores. The only con was the bulb was missing, but I emailed the company at the address in the brochure and they shipped a new bulb to me right away. Great customer service. https://chardmayores.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/cropped-18901603_10209952595073981_1530431220_o1.jpg

Salt is hygroscopic, which means it attracts water molecules to itself. Being the big hunk of salt that it is, a Himalayan salt lamp is believed to work by attracting the water molecules. This water vapor can also carry indoor air pollutants like mold, bacteria and allergens. Once the water vapor comes in contact with the salt lamp, the pollutants are believed to remain trapped in the salt. Since the lamp is heated, the salt dries out and is able to continue the cycle of attracting water vapor and pollutants, releasing the water vapor back into the air but holding on to the health-hazardous pollutants. https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/HrkAAOSwNSZa7eZE/s-l640.jpg
"There has been some talk in the holistic community about the fact that electromagnetic radiation from cellphones, from microwaves, from computers, creates positive ionization of our body," Kogan explained to TODAY. "The talk has been that the negative ions supposedly produced by the lamps help to neutralize the positive charge. But to be honest with you... I haven't seen any large studies that would confirm this."
Our modern lifestyle is producing more positive ions than the naturally produced negative ions. We need to augment the negative ion production to help stay healthy, both physically and emotionally. This is very easily done by keeping salt lamps in our homes. The salt lamps work on the principle of hygroscopy. The bulb inside of the lamp heats the salt crystals. The mild heat of the lamp, evaporate the water and during the evaporation process the negative ions are formed to combat the positive ions by binding to them. The salt lamps liberate negative ions that help us relax and reduce insomnia by creating a peaceful environment for sleep.
I did my research and know these can be great and they also can be fakes. This is the real deal and a reputable great company. Well packaged and price is spot on compared for amazon. I have only had it two days now so I can not speak of long term effects, but even simply as a lamp it is relaxing and alluring. I plan to get at least 3 more for our home. https://empoweredsustenance.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/salt-lamp-air-purifier.jpg

Anyway - I will admit that I did what others have done - I licked my finger and taste tested the lamp. Yup it is real salt, and yes I encouraged all the recipients of the lamps to do the same!! Before giving the gifts, and because of some of the reviews about function problems, we unboxed each lamp and plugged them in to ensure that they all worked properly. They did and as promised - each beautiful lamp was stunningly unique. The shapes, the shades of color, and even the lines that ran through the lamps made sure that no ... full review https://himalayansaltboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/set-of-five-himalayan-salt-lamps-HSBa-468x468.png
Also, your citation of an EPA website is useless. It just links to the EPA’s IAQ site, which isn’t helpful in trying to figure out what you actually were using from the site. I don’t think I’d use WebMD as a source either if you want to appear reputable to the more intelligent people who can spot bullshit. (Not say WebMD doesn’t have valuable info. Kinda like Wikipedia, a lot is useful and valid, but I would never use it as a source.) https://facthacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-You-Need-To-Get-A-Himalayan-Salt-Lamp.jpg

It had started as a coping mechanism to keep my mind off of my worries — a stabbing here, a throat-slit there — but it quickly spun out of control. First it was an ugly wanted man, then a good-looking catcaller, next, a creep on the bus, then a guy who yelled at my dog, eventually some lady didn’t hold the door for me at Yogurtland. Then I woke up one day and realized I was just murdering – without cause. It got to the point that I lost count of the bodies, sometimes burying one right on top of the other while the grave was still fresh – this is the kind of thing people with anxiety go through. People would say, “Snap out of it!” or “Why can’t you just stop?” or “Fucking shit oh shit you stabbed my neck oh fucking shit shit shit” – it’s this kind of stigma that keeps people with mental illnesses from seeking treatment. https://3utkj32z22c5182hg334ib6l-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lamp71-300x300.jpg
If you've been scratching your head over what exactly a Himalayan salt lamp is, here's a quick explainer. This wellness product is created out of pink salt crystals that are native to areas close to the Himalayas, like Pakistan. The pink salt is used in everything from cooking slabs for grilling to what's known as "salt therapy" at local spas. When it comes to the lamps, the pink salt is thought to release negative ions into your space, which would be able to get rid of dust particles that may affect your health. Because of that, many believe that it can do everything from increasing your energy levels to alleviating symptoms of allergies. There's also claims that these pink salt lamps can even help boost your overall mood and can help you sleep more soundly. https://www.evolutionsalt.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/220x/4a33b682e1015750f63ec994cd57f81d/e/n/enl-04.jpg
Remember, even if you’re like me and you can’t sleep unless the room is totally dark, you can always turn the lamp off at bedtime. Just leave it on for the rest of the day so it can do its work while you’re awake. People in humid climates should be aware that HPS lamps tend to weep when the salt becomes cool. You’ll definitely want to protect surfaces by placing a saucer underneath and be sure to follow the instructions for use and care which should be included with your lamp!
This claim has existed sporadically in the scientific literature for decades, but ultimately is not supported by current science. A 2013 review of psychological effects attributed to air ions, which looked at 33 studies from 1957 to 2012 evaluating “the effects of air ionization on depression, anxiety, mood states, and subjective feelings of mental well-being”, concluded: https://i2.wp.com/www.wherehumrests.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4728.jpg?resize
In order to achieve relief and feel at peace, we often find ourselves in areas near a waterfall or on a secluded beach. We often feel the calmness in those areas because of the high number of negative ions present. According to WebMD, negative ions are able to increase oxygen flow to the brain which results in higher alertness, decreased drowsiness, and more mental energy. Based on claims, the Himalayan salt lamp can give us the same feeling.

We have already talked about the fact that the environment in this technological world in which we live is full of positive ions. They make our organisms unbalanced and increase the chance of stress controlling our lives. On the other hand, negative ions, which are found in nature (mountains, forests, beaches), allow us to protect ourselves from that stress. They make us feel more energized and in tone. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5914b7ca46c3c432a410a716/t/5a1338a5652dea9417030c74/1511209135649/saltlamp-benefitsbanner-01.png?format
Himalayan salt lamps have the ability to chemically and physically transform a room, and have unique health benefits. People who use pink Himalayan salt lamps say that they help to increase blood flow, reduce allergy symptoms and even help to get a better sleep. Some of the other health benefits of Himalayan pink salt lamps (HPS lamps) include reduction of mental health related disorders, improvement of skin conditions and respiratory problems such as asthma and even colds.

Himalayan salt lamps are made from large rock crystals of salt mined in Pakistan and India in the vicinity of the Himalayas. The crystals are usually orange or pink but can range from off-white to dark brown. Carved into lamps, they can be lit from within using a light bulb or candle. These give out an attractive, soothing light and have been credited with providing various health benefits including the elimination of the “electro-smog” you mention. Retailers also tout their production of “positive energy” in the form of negative ions that supposedly bring oxygen to the brain, reduce indoor pollution, boost the immune system and cure seasonal affective disorder (SAD). http://claypoolsgiftandhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/salt-lamps-006-620x465.jpg

If you've been wanting to purchase a Himalayan salt crystal lamp for your home, but the natural stone shape hasn't felt quite right, then take a look at the modern allure of a salt lamp carved into a pristine decorative Himalayan salt crystal lamp shape. Cast a regal shine over your personal kingdom with the orb lamp, create a serene space for seeking enlightenment with the pyramid shape, or mimic a row of torches through your foyer with these flame-shaped lamps. https://draxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Himalayan-Salt-Lamp-FB-NLMeme-01.png
Deep underground mines in Khewra, Pakistan, are the only source of true Himalayan pink salt. If you’re questioning whether you have a real Himalayan salt lamp, look for mention of Pakistan as the salt crystal’s country of origin. You can also ask the lamp’s maker about the salt’s origin, keeping in mind that it may list the country of origin as the location of the lamp’s assembly.
Real Himalayan salt lamps are made of salt so it’s not surprising that they’re fragile objects. A good manufacturer knows this and has return policies that are flexible since there could be some damage in transit. If a salt lamp’s maker is extremely strict (like a “NO RETURNS” policy), then it makes you wonder if it’s a scam operation. This might not necessarily be the case, but some fake retailers have been known not to permit any returns because they know they’re not giving you the real thing. https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1546/3501/files/how-to-care-for-himalayan-rock-salt-lamps-550.jpg?v
