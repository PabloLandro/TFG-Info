Take Care Of Those Hemorrhoids: Here’s How
Internal hemorrhoids are found inside your rectum, and external hemorrhoids are located near the anus, below what is known as the dentate line. The hemorrhoids that are most painful are the external, but both respond to treatment and prevention strategies. The article below will help you deal with existing hemorrhoids or prevent the occurrence of new ones.
One of the best and most effective solutions to get long-term hemorrhoid relief, is to add more fiber to your diet on a daily basis.

Dramatically upgrading your bathroom hygiene habits cuts down your odds of external hemorrhoid formation. Opt for softer toilet tissue that will not leave residue or paper behind, and keep a box of moistened wipes in the bathroom for use after each and every bowel movement.
Blood Vessels
Take Rutin for your hemorrhoids. Weakened blood vessels can cause hemorrhoids. The flavonoid, Rutin, assists with vitamin C absorption, thereby strengthening the blood vessels. It is found in vegetables, like onions and broccoli, and citrus foods. If taken as a dietary supplement, 500mg per day is a good dosage.

Hemorrhoids are just as bad as chicken pox in terms of resisting the urge to scratch them. It can be hard to not scratch them, but if you do, you can further irritate them. If your hemorrhoids are torn open, they will be far more painful, and it will greatly increase your risk of contracting bacterial infections.

Drink plenty of water. Drinking more water keeps you hydrated and is probably of the easiest ways to prevent hemorrhoids. Being well hydrated prevents constipation, which is a cause of hemorrhoids. Drinking water also enables your body to cleanse itself internally. Set a target of ten glasses of water per day for best results.

Donut Cushion
If you are dealing with painful hemorrhoids, then you should think about purchasing a donut cushion. A donut cushion is designed with a hole in the middle for your bottom and keeps the sensitive hemorrhoid from contact with hard surfaces.
