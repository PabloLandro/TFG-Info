Background
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which is needed by the body to form collagen in bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.
Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.
Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.
The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.
Evidence Table
These uses have been tested in humans or animals. Safety and effectiveness have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are potentially serious, and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider.
GRADE *
Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet. Although scurvy is uncommon, it may occur in malnourished individuals, those that need more vitamin C (such as pregnant or breastfeeding women), or infants. If vitamin C is unavailable, orange juice can be used for scurvy in infants. Symptoms should begin to improve in 1-2 days, and end completely within seven days. Treatment should be under strict medical supervision.

Safety
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and supplements. There is no guarantee of strength, purity or safety of products, and effects may vary. You should always read product labels. If you have a medical condition, or are taking other drugs, herbs, or supplements, you should speak with a qualified healthcare provider before starting a new therapy. Consult a healthcare provider immediately if you experience side effects.
Allergies
Avoid if sensitive or allergic to any ingredients present in Vitamin C products.
Side Effects and Warnings
Vitamin C is generally regarded as safe in amounts normally obtained from foods. Vitamin C supplements are also generally regarded as safe in most individuals in recommended amounts.
Vitamin C may cause abdominal cramps or pain, chest pain, dental erosion, dizziness, diarrhea, faintness, fatigue, flushing, gut blockage, headache, heartburn, increased risk of lung cancer, increased risk of Parkinson's disease, inflamed esophagus, injection site discomfort, nausea, red blood cell complications, skin tingling or irritation, slowing of endurance training, thickening of blood vessels close to the heart, urinary complications, and vomiting.
High doses of vitamin C have been associated with multiple adverse effects. These include blood clotting, death (heart-related), kidney stones, pro-oxidant effects, problems with the digestive system, and red blood cell destruction. In cases of toxicity due to massive ingestions of vitamin C, forced fluids, and diuresis may be beneficial.
Use cautiously in chronic, large doses. Healthy adults who take chronic large doses of vitamin C may experience low blood levels of vitamin C when they stop taking the high doses and resume normal intake.
Vitamin C in high doses appears to interfere with the blood-thinning effects of anticoagulants such as warfarin. Caution is advised in people with bleeding disorders or those taking drugs that affect bleeding. Dosing adjustments may be necessary.
Vitamin C may affect blood sugar levels. Caution is advised in people with diabetes or hypoglycemia, and in those taking drugs, herbs, or supplements that affect blood sugar. Blood glucose levels may need to be monitored by a qualified healthcare professional, including a pharmacist. Medication adjustments may be necessary.
Vitamin C may increase blood pressure. Caution is advised in people with high blood pressure.
Use cautiously in people with cancer (e.g. lung), cataracts, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, anemia and related conditions, disorders of the gut, kidney stones, or sickle cell disease.
Use cautiously in people after angioplasty and in pregnant women at risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy.
Use cautiously in greater than recommended doses in breastfeeding women.
Use cautiously in people taking antibiotics, anticancer agents, HIV medications, barbiturates, estrogens, fluphenazine, or iron supplements.
Use injected vitamin C cautiously, especially in high doses, as it may lead to kidney function problems.
Use vitamin C tablets cautiously, as dental erosion may occur from chewing vitamin C tablets often.
Avoid in people with known allergy or sensitivity to any ingredients in Vitamin C products.
Avoid high doses of vitamin C in people with conditions aggravated by increased acid, such as advanced liver disease, gout, a disease where kidneys fail to remove extra acid from the body, or a disease with early breakdown of red blood cells.
Avoid high doses of vitamin C in people with kidney failure or in those taking agents that may damage the kidneys.
