It is common belief that the majority of pregnant women have nausea in the morning only. Less than 20% of pregnant women actually have nausea only in the morning (“morning sickness”). The majority of pregnant women (80%) have NVP throughout the day “all-day sickness”. Speak with your healthcare professional for treatment recommendations. If your well being or activities of daily living are affected by your NVP, speak with your healthcare professional for treatment recommendations.
