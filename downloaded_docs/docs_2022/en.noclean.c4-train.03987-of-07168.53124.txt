side effects, nutrient depletions, herbal interactions and health notes:
Data provided by Applied Health
• Lipitor (Atorvastatin) is in the category of Statin drugs, used to lower high cholesterol levels, and also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Statin drugs have been shown to affect the absorption or utilization of coenzyme Q10. Supplementation may prove beneficial. Tests showed the average concentration of coenzyme Q10 in blood plasma decreased by approximately 50% after statins were used for 30 days.1
• Alcohol intake should be limited.2
• Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may increase the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, except Pravastatin, and should not be consumed at the same time. It is suggested that these medications be taken with water. Grapefruit contains substances that may inhibit the body’s ability to break down statin drugs increasing the toxicity of the drug. Muscle pain, tenderness, or muscle weakness may be a result. If you begin to notice these symptoms, contact your doctor.3
• Niacin is the form of vitamin B3 used to lower cholesterol. Large amounts of niacin taken with a statin drug may cause serious muscle disorders (myopathy). Reasonable levels of niacin combined with statin drugs have been shown to enhance the cholesterol lowering effect. For proper dosage, consult your physician before taking niacin4
• Pomegranate juice has been shown to inhibit the same enzyme inhibited by grapefruit juice. This may cause reactions similar to grapefruit juice when it is used with statin drug treatments.5
• A supplement containing red yeast rice can effectively lower cholesterol and triglycerides in people with moderately elevated levels of these blood lipids. This extract contains small amounts of naturally occurring HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Consult your doctor if you are currently taking Red Yeast Rice and a statin medication.6
• A study of 37 people with high cholesterol treated with diet and statin drugs found vitamin A increased in the blood over two years of therapy. People taking statin drugs and vitamin A supplements should have blood levels of vitamin A monitored.7
• Magnesium- and aluminum-containing antacids were reported to interfere with statin drug absorption. To avoid this interaction, take statin drugs two hours before or after any aluminum/magnesium-containing antacids. Some magnesium supplements such as magnesium hydroxide are also antacids.8
• It should be noted that doctors often recommend supplementing with 100mg of coenzyme Q10 per day for maintaining healthy levels. However, those on statin drugs may have a greater need for a higher dose. It further should be noted that the symptoms associated with the combination of grapefruit juice and statin drugs (muscle weakness and discomfort) are commonly reported as symptoms associated with CoQ10 depletions. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 is strongly recommended.9
• Certain herbs may increase the action of this medication and should be discussed with your pharmacist or physician. These include Artichoke plant, Fenugreek, Garlic plant, and Plantain all of which may lower cholesterol levels.10
