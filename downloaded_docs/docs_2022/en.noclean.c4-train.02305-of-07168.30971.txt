Baking Soda – Helped to Cure Cancer

Tulio Simoncini is a former Italian oncologist in Rome who developed a theory that all cancer is caused exclusively by a fungus called Candida albicans.
“Cancer is a fungus, called Candida albicans, and it can be treated using sodium bicarbonate”.
His natural cancer cure is actually a simple treatment. He believes that the body and tumor needs to be alkalized, and this can be done using a cheap, common compound. This is actually sodium bicarbonate which is used to tackle the Candida, shrink the tumor and thus stop metastases.
Acid bodies, sodium bicarbonate, Candida, beneficial bacteria, and cancer
Simoncini’s work rests on four theoretical elements, which are the following:
Initially, acid bodies, since they are known to be related to health issues and cancer.
Secondly, the body can be alkalized using sodium bicarbonate, which is known to have been used as antacid, an ingestion aid in many preparations. A small pot of this ingredient can be found for a little over one pound in high street chemists.
Thirdly, the beneficial bacteria in your intestine are now known to direct up to 85 per cent of your immune response, to release anti-cancer vitamins (like biotin, B-12, folic acid, vitamin K) from your foods and even to produce a compound (sodium butyrate) which causes cancer cells to self-destruct. Beneficial bacteria work imperfectly if the acidity of the gut increases.
Fourthly, the first line of defense consists of beneficial bacteria. At night when you sleep, a vast quantities of microbes, fungus and yeasts that you consumed during the day with your food are digested by beneficial bacteria. Actually, the favorite food of beneficial bacteria is the yeast or fungus, Candida albicans.
Candida and cancer
Yeasts like Candida are anaerobes, which means that they generate their energy in the absence of oxygen. When in the blood stream, they can colonize certain local areas of the body and greatly reduce the oxygen levels in that area. Consequently, the local cells do not die, but switch their own energy production from an oxygen-based system to one that doesn´t use oxygen.
Cancer cells do not use oxygen to generate their energy from food molecules so they employ this same system. In fact, Otto Warburg won a Nobel Prize in 1931 for telling the world this property of cancer cells and that oxygen was their enemy!
Candida Albicans is possesses a property to escape the intestine and travel around the body in the blood stream. The yeast in the bloodstream can be killed by oregano oil and cinnamon. About 25 percent of type-2 Diabetics were shown to improve when given cinnamon.
This is due to the fungus sitting on the outer membranes of cells, preventing crucial receptor sites from working properly – in the case of diabetes, those receptor sites are for insulin.
Moreover, Candida also produces a sugar-like waste product, so people with higher blood sugar levels develop more cancer and survive less.
Therefore, the results of a research covered in CANCERactives research service Cancer Watch come as no surprise, showing that women who had taken antibiotics more than 25 times during their lifetime had twice the risk of breast cancer.
Their immune systems were weak, indicated by the illnesses that required the antibiotics. In addition, their friendly bacteria were reduced allowing Candida more chance to survive in the gut and move to the blood stream.
Dr Simoncini was a respected Italian Oncologist who developed his theory that all cancers are caused by the fungus Candida albicans.
Furthermore, he believed that the cure of cancer is to alkalize the body in order to produce conditions in which the Candida could not thrive. What is even more important, this can be done using an inexpensive and easily attainable weapon, baking soda.
Unfortunately, he was struck off in Italy. His main weapon is the inexpensive, sodium bicarbonate. Even though his discoveries and remarkable theory were of greatest importance, he was struck off in Italy.
