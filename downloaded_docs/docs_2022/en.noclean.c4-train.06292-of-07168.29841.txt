What Are Star Ratings?
Our proprietary "Star-Rating" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people.
For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being.
3 StarsReliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit.
2 StarsContradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit.

Morning Sickness
1 gram powder daily
Ginger, well-known for alleviating nausea and improving digestion, appears to be an effective and safe treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.
Ginger is well-known for alleviating nausea and improving digestion. One gram of encapsulated ginger powder was used in one study to reduce the severe nausea and vomiting associated with hyperemesis gravidarum. This condition is potentially life-threatening and should only be treated by a qualified healthcare professional. A review of six double-blind trials concluded that ginger is probably an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.
Because ginger contains some compounds that cause chromosomal mutation in the test tube, some doctors are concerned about the safety of using ginger during pregnancy. However, the available clinical research, combined with the fact that ginger is widely used in the diets of many cultures, suggests that prudent use of ginger for morning sickness is probably safe in amounts up to 1 gram per day.
3 Stars
Motion Sickness
Adults: 500 mg one hour before travel and then 500 mg every two to four hours as necessary; children: 250 mg (half dose)
Ginger may help prevent and treat mild to moderate cases of motion sickness. Studies have shown it to be as effective as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) but with fewer side effects.
Ginger may be useful for the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate cases of motion sickness. A double-blind trial examined the effects of ginger supplements in people who were susceptible to motion sickness. Researchers found that those taking 940 mg of powdered ginger in capsules experienced less motion sickness than those who took dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). Another double-blind trial reported that 1 gram of powdered ginger root, compared with placebo, lessened seasickness by 38% and vomiting by 72% in a group of naval cadets sailing in heavy seas. Two clinical trials, one with adults and one with children, found that ginger was as effective in treating seasickness as dimenhydrinate but with fewer side effects. In one controlled trial, though, neither powdered ginger (500 to 1,000 mg) nor fresh ginger (1,000 mg) provided any protection against motion sickness. Doctors prescribing ginger for motion sickness recommend 500 mg one hour before travel and then 500 mg every two to four hours as necessary. The study with children used one-half the adult amount.
Ginger's beneficial effect on motion sickness appears to be related to its action on the gastrointestinal tract rather than on the central nervous system.
3 Stars
Osteoarthritis
510 mg daily of a concentrated herbal extract, taken in divided doses
Ginger has historically been used for arthritis and rheumatism. Studies have shown it to be effective at relieving pain and swelling in people with osteoarthritis.
Ginger has historically been used for arthritis and rheumatism. A preliminary trial reported relief in pain and swelling among people with arthritis who used powdered ginger supplements More recently, a double-blind trial found ginger extract (170 mg three times a day for three weeks) to be slightly more effective than placebo at relieving pain in people with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. In another double-blind study, a concentrated extract of ginger, taken in the amount of 255 mg twice daily for six weeks, was significantly more effective than a placebo, as determined by the degree of pain relief and overall improvement.
2 Stars
Dysmenorrhea
250 mg four times per day, beginning at the start of menstruation and continuing for three days
In a double-blind trial, ginger powder was as effective as anti-inflammatory medication (mefenamic acid and ibuprofen) in relieving symptoms of dysmenorrhea.
Ginger has been used in some systems of traditional medicine to treat dysmenorrhea. In a double-blind trial, ginger powder was as effective as anti-inflammatory medication (mefenamic acid and ibuprofen) in relieving symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Ginger was used in the amount of 250 mg four times per day, beginning at the start of menstruation and continuing for three days. In another double-blind trial, 500 mg of ginger taken 3 times per day, beginning 2 days before menstruation and continuing for the first 3 days of the menstrual period, significantly decreased the duration and severity of menstrual pain, compared with a placebo. The treatment was somewhat less effective if it was started at the beginning of menstruation, rather than 2 days before.

Epilepsy (Asian Ginseng, Bupleurum, Cassia Bark, Chinese Scullcap, Jujube, Licorice, Peony, Pinellia)
2.5 grams a day of sho-saiko-to or saiko-keishi-to in tea or capsules
The Chinese herb bupleurum is included in two herbal formulas, sho-saiko-to and saiko-keishi-to. Both have been shown to be helpful for epilepsy.
The Chinese herb bupleurum is included in two similar Chinese herbal formulae known as sho-saiko-to and saiko-keishi-to; these combinations contain the same herbs but in different proportions. The other ingredients are peony root, pinellia root, cassia bark, ginger root, jujube fruit, Asian ginseng root, Asian scullcap root, and licorice root. Both formulas have been shown in preliminary trials to be helpful for people with epilepsy. No negative interactions with a variety of anticonvulsant drugs were noted in these trials. The usual amount taken of these formulas is 2.5 grams three times per day as capsules or tea. People with epilepsy should not use either formula without first consulting with a healthcare professional.
2 Stars
Hepatitis (Asian Ginseng, Bupleurum, Cassia Bark, Chinese Scullcap, Jujube, Licorice, Peony, Pinellia)
Take 2.5 grams of sho-saiko-to three times per day
Trials have shown that the bupleurum-containing formula sho-saiko-to can help reduce symptoms and blood liver enzyme levels in people with chronic active viral hepatitis.
Preliminary trials have shown that the bupleurum-containing formula sho-saiko-to can help reduce symptoms and blood liver enzyme levels in children and adults with chronic active viral hepatitis. Most of theses trials were in people with hepatitis B infection, though one preliminary trial has also shown a benefit in people with hepatitis C. Sho-saiko-to was also found, in a large preliminary trial to decrease the risk of people with chronic viral hepatitis developing liver cancer. However, people who had a sign of recent hepatitis B infection were not as strongly protected in this trial. The usual amount of sho-saiko-to used is 2.5 grams three times daily. Sho-saiko-to should not be used together with interferon drug therapy as it may increase risk of pneumonitis - a potentially dangerous inflammation in the lungs.
2 Stars
Indigestion, Heartburn, and Low Stomach Acidity
2 to 4 grams daily fresh ginger or equivalent for indigestion
Ginger, with its anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea effects, has a history of use in treating gastrointestinal complaints, from flatulence to ulcers. It has been shown to enhance intestinal movements that aid digestion.
Carminatives (also called aromatic digestive tonics or aromatic bitters) may be used to relieve symptoms of indigestion, particularly when there is excessive gas. It is believed that carminative agents work, at least in part, by relieving spasms in the intestinal tract.
There are numerous carminative herbs, including European angelica root (Angelica archangelica), anise, Basil, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, dill, ginger, oregano, rosemary, sage, lavender, and thyme. Many of these are common kitchen herbs and thus are readily available for making tea to calm an upset stomach. Rosemary is sometimes used to treat indigestion in the elderly by European herbal practitioners. The German Commission E monograph suggests a daily intake of 4â€“6 grams of sage leaf. Pennyroyal is no longer recommended for use in people with indigestion, however, due to potential side effects.
Demulcents herbs may be used to treat indigestion and heartburn. These herbs seem to work by decreasing inflammation and forming a physical barrier against stomach acid or other abdominal irritants. Examples of demulcent herbs include ginger, licorice, and slippery elm.
Ginger is a spice well known for its traditional use as a treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal complaints, ranging from flatulence to ulcers. Ginger has anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea properties. Ginger has been shown to enhance normal, spontaneous movements of the intestines that aid digestion.
2 Stars
Liver Cirrhosis (Asian Ginseng, Bupleurum, Cassia Bark, Chinese Scullcap, Jujube, Licorice, Peony, Pinellia)
2.5 grams of the Chinese herbal formula sho-saiko-to three times daily

Menorrhagia
Refer to label instructions
In one trial, supplementation with ginger powder decreased the amount of menstrual bleeding in teenage girls who had been experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding.
In a 3-month double-blind trial, supplementation with ginger powder significantly decreased the amount of menstrual bleeding by 47% in teenage girls who had been experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. The amount of ginger used was 250 mg 3 times per day, starting each cycle on the day before menstruation and continuing for a total of 4 days.
2 Stars
Migraine Headache
Refer to label instructions
Anecdotal evidence suggests ginger may be used for migraines and the accompanying nausea.
Anecdotal evidence suggests ginger may be used for migraines and the accompanying nausea. In a double-blind study, a sublingual preparation that contained both feverfew and ginger LipiGesic M (PuraMed BioScience, Inc., Schofield, WI) appeared to be beneficial for acute migraines. In another double-blind study, a single administration of 250 mg of ginger powder was as effective as the migraine drug, sumatriptan, in the treatment of acute migraines.

Pre- and Post-Surgery Health
1 gram of powder in a capsule 60 minutes before receiving general anesthesia (inform your anesthesiologist)
Ginger has antinausea properties and may prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting.
A recent study found that 24% of surgery patients had taken herbal supplements before their surgeries, and 50 different herbs had been used among these patients. Little research exists, however, on the safety or efficacy of herbs before surgery. Some researchers and healthcare providers are concerned about possible harmful interactions between herbs and medications used around or during surgery, or the possibility that some herbs may increase bleeding during and after surgery. The use of herbs around the time of surgery should be discussed with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner.
Nausea and vomiting can be experienced post-operatively as a result of anesthesia. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has antinausea properties and has been examined for its ability to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting in several controlled trials. In two of these controlled trials, ginger was found more effective than placebo and equal to an antinausea medication; however, in two other controlled trials ginger was not found to have any benefit. A review considering the results of these trials concluded that 1 gram of ginger taken before surgery prevents nausea and vomiting slightly better than placebo, but this difference is not significant. However, a more recent review concluded that ginger is an effective means for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting.
2 Stars
Vertigo
1 gram of powdered root daily
Ginger has been shown to be effective at reducing symptoms.
One gram of powdered ginger (Zingiber officinale) root in a single application has been reported to significantly reduce symptoms of artificially induced vertigo in one double-blind trial. In a double-blind trial, 1 gram of powdered ginger root was found to have very little effect in reducing vertigo related to seasickness.
1 Star
Atherosclerosis
Refer to label instructions
Supplementing with ginger may reduce platelet stickiness.
The research on ginger's ability to reduce platelet stickiness indicates that 10 grams (approximately 1 heaping teaspoon) per day is the minimum necessary amount to be effective. Lower amounts of dry ginger, as well as various levels of fresh ginger, have not been shown to affect platelets.
1 Star
Hay Fever (Asiasarum Root, Cassia Bark, Licorice, Ma Huang, Peony, Pinellia, Schisandra)
Refer to label instructions
The Japanese herbal formula known as sho-seiryu-to has been shown to reduce symptoms, such as sneezing, for people with hay fever.

1 Star
HIV and AIDS Support (Asian Ginseng, Bupleurum, Cassia Bark, Chinese Scullcap, Jujube, Licorice, Peony, Pinellia)
Refer to label instructions
The herbal formula sho-saiko-to has been shown to have beneficial immune effects on white blood cells in people infected with HIV.
The Chinese herb bupleurum, as part of the herbal formula sho-saiko-to, has been shown to have beneficial immune effects on white blood cells taken from people infected with HIV. Sho-saiko-to has also been shown to improve the efficacy of the anti-HIV drug lamivudine in the test tube. One preliminary study found that 7 of 13 people with HIV given sho-saiko-to had improvements in immune function. Double-blind trials are needed to determine whether bupleurum or sho-saiko-to might benefit people with HIV infection or AIDS. Other herbs in sho-saiko-to have also been shown to have anti-HIV activity in the test tube, most notably Asian scullcap. Therefore studies on sho-saiko-to cannot be taken to mean that bupleurum is the only active herb involved. The other ingredients are peony root, pinellia root, cassia bark, ginger root, jujube fruit, Asian ginseng root, Asian scullcap root, and licorice root.
1 Star
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Bupleurum, Dan Shen, Schisandra, Wormwood)
Take a Chinese herbal formula containing wormwood under the guidance of a qualified practitioner
A standardized Chinese herbal combination containing extracts from plants including wormwood, ginger, bupleurum, schisandra, and dan shen reduced IBS symptoms in one study.
Whole peppermint leaf is often used either alone or in combination with other herbs to treat abdominal discomfort and mild cramping that accompany IBS. The combination of peppermint, caraway seeds, fennel seeds, and wormwood was reported to be an effective treatment for upper abdominal complaints in a double-blind trial.
1 Star
Low Back Pain
Refer to label instructions
Herbalists often use ginger to decrease inflammation and the pain associated with it, including for those with low back pain.
Herbalists often use ginger to decrease inflammation and the pain associated with it, including for those with low back pain. They typically suggest 1.5 to 3 ml of ginger tincture three times per day, or 2 to 4 grams of the dried root powder two to three times per day. Some products contain a combination of curcumin and ginger. However, no research has investigated the effects of these herbs on low back pain.
1 Star
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Refer to label instructions
Ginger is an Ayurvedic herb used to treat people with arthritis. Taking fresh or powdered ginger may reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
Ginger is another Ayurvedic herb used to treat people with arthritis. A small number of case studies suggest that taking 6â€“50 grams of fresh or powdered ginger per day may reduce the symptoms of RA. A combination formula containing ginger, turmeric, boswellia, and ashwagandha has been shown in a double-blind trial to be slightly more effective than placebo for RA; the amounts of herbs used in this trial are not provided by the investigators.
Traditional Use (May Not Be Supported by Scientific Studies)
Traditional Chinese Medicine has recommended ginger for over 2,500 years. It is used for abdominal bloating, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, and rheumatism. Ginger is commonly used in the Ayurvedic and Tibb systems of medicine for the treatment of inflammatory joint diseases, such as arthritis and rheumatism.
How It Works
Botanical names:
Zingiber officinale
How It Works
The dried rhizome of ginger contains approximately 1â€“4% volatile oils. These are the medically active constituents of ginger and are also responsible for ginger's characteristic odor and taste. The aromatic constituents include zingiberene and bisabolene, while the pungent constituents are known as gingerols and shogaols.1 The pungent constituents are credited with the anti-nausea and anti-vomiting effects of ginger.
In humans, ginger is thought to act directly on the gastrointestinal system to reduce nausea.2 Ginger has been shown to reduce the symptoms of motion sickness associated with travel by boat and, to a lesser extent, car.3, 4, 5 Two double-blind clinical trials have found that ginger may reduce nausea due to anesthesia following surgery,6, 7 although one trial could not confirm this benefit.8 A preliminary trial has suggested ginger may be helpful for preventing chemotherapy -induced nausea. 9
While ginger is a popular remedy for nausea of pregnancy, it has only been clinically studied for very severe nausea and vomiting known as hyperemesis gravidarum.10 This condition is life threatening and should only be treated by a qualified healthcare professional. Because ginger contains some compounds that cause chromosomal mutation in the test tube, some doctors are concerned about the safety of using ginger during pregnancy. However, the available clinical research, combined with the fact that ginger is widely used in the diet of certain cultures, suggests that prudent use of ginger for morning sickness is safe in amounts up to 1 gram per day.
Ginger is considered a tonic for the digestive tract, stimulating digestion and toning the intestinal muscles.11 This action eases the transport of substances through the digestive tract, lessening irritation to the intestinal walls.12 Ginger may protect the stomach from the damaging effect of alcohol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen) and may help prevent ulcers.13
Ginger also supports cardiovascular health. Ginger may make blood platelets less sticky and less likely to aggregate.14, 15 However, not all human research has confirmed this.16, 17
How to Use It
For prevention or treatment of motion sickness, 500 mg of dried ginger powder can be taken one-half to one hour before travel, and then 500 mg every two to four hours as necessary. Children below the age of six should use one-half the adult amount. For the treatment of nausea associated with pregnancy, women can take up to 1 gram daily,18 but should only use ginger for symptomatic relief of nausea and not on an ongoing basis. Ginger may potentially be used for nausea associated with anesthesia or chemotherapy, but only under the supervision of a physician.
