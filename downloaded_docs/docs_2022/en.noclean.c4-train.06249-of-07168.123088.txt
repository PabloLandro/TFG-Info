Bleeding Hemroids
A survey conducted by doctor's has found that hemroids have been the most common and critical problem of mankind. You will come across very few cases in serious conditions, but they are extremely painful and embarrassing. In some cases they can lead to rectal cancer and therefore hemroids require proper examination and treatment by a physician.
Using a food table to work out the fiber in the foods you like, you can also see if there are any foods that stand out as worthwhile. Still can't adjust your diet to get enough fiber, then try fiber supplements. They work out to be about $20 to $40 a month, but compare that to the cost and inconvenience of a hemroid operation that may run thousands of dollars and leave you in pain and discomfort for weeks. Powdered psyllium husks are a good option.

1. Introduce more fiber into your diet. Fiber is extremely good at relieving constipation - the main cause of hemroids - and fiber is well renown for preventing them and alleviating their symptoms. Fiber does this by bulking the stool and making it soft, so that the body can eliminate it without much straining.
Fiber preferably is to be taken via fresh fruits, whole grain foods, and beans. If you notice that your body is letting off too much gas, this may be the result of increasing the fiber in your diet too quickly. Just cut back on the amount of fiber and gradually increase it over time.
What actually happens at that stage is something like this: A blood clot forms in the external hemroids, creating a thrombosed hemroid. The skin around the anus gets inflamed and becomes painful.
- take lukewarm baths everyday. Sitting on a tub half-filled with warm water will help reduces swelling and gives relief from pain and itchiness.
2.Drink water You may know the drill already, sixty-four ounces of water daily, about 8 glasses. This helps the fiber in your diet, as it allows the fiber to do it's job - the fiber soaks up the water, thereby bulking the stool. Without water, the fiber may cause even worse constipation. It is best to take the water straight, but not essential.
- altering the diet to incorporate fiber-enriched foods that can loosen stools and prevent constipation. A change in the diet also includes avoidance from meaty and processed foods. It also entails the inclusion of water intake. At least eight glasses of water per day should be consumed in order to sustain the smooth flow of digestion and easy defecation.
Symptoms of small external hemroids are harder to determine as well. There can be just the occasional blood smear on the toilet tissue. However when the person has larger external hemroids, it becomes easier as it is accompanied by a dull pain, itchiness and irritation in the anal region. And when someone experiences such symptoms, hemroids can be a prime suspect.
Poor bowel movements can contribute to hemroids too. Don't wait when there is a nature's call.
Constipation, pregnancy, obesity can be the other causes of hemroids.
This can help train your bowel to empty on a daily basis, which can help reduce the incidence of constipation General guidelines: Do not force. Do not sit for much more than five minutes. If nothing happens, try again tomorrow. If the urge hits at a different time - GO! - otherwise you may cause yourself more hemroid problems.
Many people ask whether hemroids develop into cancer. Well, hemroids do not develop into cancer but both hemroids and cancer can cause rectal bleeding. And a physician should be consulted in such serious condition to know the cause of bleeding from rectal area.
What causes Hemroids?
A common cause for hemroids is your sitting posture. Don't sit for too long. Prepare a habit to go for a break of 5 minutes from your work after every one hour.
Hemroids are enlarged veins around anus or the rectal area. Hemroids can be of three types:-
External Hemroids:- They are the fleshy growth or the enlarged veins outside the anus or the rectal area
Laser beam is also another treatment option for external hemroids. Laser is also deemed by many as the fastest treatment among other treatments for hemroids in terms of conducting the treatment procedure. Laser treatment is applicable to small and medium sizes of hemroids.
Sclerotherapy is also another possible treatment for external hemroids. A certain chemical solution is being injected to the affected area which help in the shrinking of the hemroids.
Another procedure is the rubber hand ligation. This is the most famous non-surgical external hemroids treatment since this can be applicable to both small and medium sizes of hemroids. In rubber band ligation procedure, a rubber band is being wrapped around the sac-like protrusion. The rubber band will serve as an instrument that will restrict the flow of blood circulation in the affected area. Lack of blood flow in the hemroids will help in its shrinking, and then, to its eventual healing.
The clot begins to bleed slowly, leaving traces on the underwear. These are the basic hemroids symptoms. Yes that's true. And sometimes the symptoms of hemroids may be completely absent as well. When symptoms do not surface and yet the rectal bleeding persists, it may become necessary to go for a detailed medical examination of the anal canal. This examination is carried out through Anoscopy, Colonoscopy and Sigmoidoscopy and it determines the exact nature and cause of the bleeding that could be due to a polyp, colorectal cancer and also internal hemroids.
Hemroids have two types: the internal and the external hemroids. Unlike internal hemroids that have grown inside the anal canal, external hemroids occur outside of the anal verge. This sac-like protrusion found outside the anus is often characterized by itchiness (pruritus ani), pain, irritation and swelling.

3.Exercise Walking is good, bicycling better. Walking or bicycling quickly for 30 minutes, three to four times a week, improves one's overall health, but, more importantly, it helps get the intestines stronger and healthier, allowing for the bowel motions to be moved more easily out, without all that straining on the toilet.
Hemroids can be vastly classified as Internal Hemroids and External Hemroids. The first symptom of internal hemroids is the appearance of occult blood (fresh and bright red blood) during bowel movement that may tinge the toilet bowl. Traces of it may even be present in the toilet tissue. The blood may come with itching, irritation and low dormant pain in the anal region that is similar to discomforts that are caused by other disorders. However internal hemroids in some cases can even come without pain and when this happens, it may be difficult to identify the symptoms.
Keep the anal area clean, dry and use a mild soap.
Don't wait when there is a nature's call.
Daily two to three time's bath in warm water will provide relief from pain and promotes healing.
Hemroids are caused by increased hydrostatic pressure in the hemroidal venous plexus that is around the anal canal. It is related to straining at stool, pregnancy, portal hypertension and other such conditions, and not due to any external or internal injury to the affected part.
Treating external hemroids is not limited, however, to medical procedures alone. Natural means of healing and prevention can also be applied which includes:
Standing for too long can be another cause of hemroids. As during standing position all the blood above the rectum exerts pressure on rectal area.
Infrared light treatment:- An infrared high intensity light is an effective treatment method for hemroids. As painful hemroids can be treated in a much faster way.
Severe pain: - Hemroids located internally or externally can cause severe pain.
Itching and irritating: - External or internal hemroids leads to itching and irritation and causes embarrassment.
4. Bowel training Essentially go to the toilet at the same convenient time every day. Sit for about five minutes in the toileting posture ( feet raised on ball of feet, elbows resting on knees). Let your body become accustomed to this timing and hopefully, you will start doing your business on a regular daily basis, at about the same time every day.
What's the treatment? Hemroids treatment varies depending on where they are, how serious they are and what problems they are causing. Following treatment measures can be followed if someone is suffering from hemroids:-
Hemroids interestingly, can even be found in people who are otherwise healthy individuals. The symptoms of hemroids are actually caused by certain vascular cushions, and when it happens, most people and medical practitioners refer to them as hemroids. The symptoms of hemroids become most noticeable when they grow to become thrombosed, inflamed, prolapsed and enlarged.
Laser treatment: - Laser treatment is another faster treating method. After laser treatment the patient needs less medication and results in faster healing.
There are many treatments for external hemroids. Some people are still more comfortable doing the "natural" method in treating hemroids, while there are others who rely on the latest sophisticated equipment that the society has now in treating hemroids.
Normally, tissues that bulge and protrude outside the anus is considered as external hemroids; however, there are some instances wherein internal hemroids, due to its worst state, have grown terribly to the point that it protrudes until outside the anal canal (this is also known as prolapsed internal hemroids).
Exercise everyday as it is also useful for good health.
Keep the rectal area clean and dry.
Hemroids are common disorders and heal up with right medication and care. If proper care and medication is carried out hemroids often clear up by themselves.
Complications:-
Bleeding: - Hemroids can bleed in critical conditions whether located internally or externally. In these condition hemroids needs immediate medication.
Include lots of fibrous food in your diet.
Do not delay or try to prevent a bowel movement.
Drink lots of water and take your meals on time.
Now, one question you may ask, is how much extra fiber is that over what I am getting already in my diet? The answer is, if you are eating white bread, you are likely on a diet that has a meagre 11 grams of fiber per today, but the good news is, that means you only need to add in an extra 20 grams! That's about 3 to 4 large apples / oranges.
- wearing of comfortable under wears. Avoid wearing tight-fitting under wears because this will give no room for your external hemroids and might increase pressure towards it, causing more pain.
One of the best treatment for external hemroids is surgery or what is known as hemroidectomy. In this surgical procedure, the swollen tissue is being scraped off using a scalpel. Patient who undergo this kind of treatment is being given an anesthesia (local or general - depending on the state of the victim). Based on testimonies of people who have undergone this kind of treatment, hemroidectomy has a longer-effect despite the intense pain that was felt after the operation. Surgery is always being recommended to large-sized hemroids that have already complicated to the point that it already causes so much discomfort and pain to the patient.
People usually confuse hemroids symptoms with many other similar anorectal problems that may be caused by fissure, fistulae, pruritus ani or abscesses. These conditions are formed in the rectal region due to various reasons and are not directly related to hemroids. The confusion mostly arises from lack of medical knowledge of most people about the human anatomy. Hearsay also often plays a negative role and prevents the sufferer from going the right path.
Symptoms of hemroids are the first sign that something is maybe wrong. Though many tend to neglect them, but it is important not to do so. It is a medical condition that needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.
