Urine Therapy
Uncategorized
Premarin is a hormone women take for estrogen imbalance which is made of pregnant mare’s urine. Hmmm. I can’t imagine. Why drink a horse’s urine when you can drink your own? I’m just kidding—kind of.
A webmaster-mentor of mine once told me that the page on her site that got the most hits was the Urine Therapy page! Of course maybe it has to do with some disgusting YouTube links showing how animals drink their own urine (I’ll let you explore those on your own if you like), but that got me to thinking about a few of my clients over the years who shared their urine drinking stories with me.
This media review is on urine therapy and I’ll admit I’ve never tried this. There are lots of books on urine therapy.
The title of the book on urine therapy that I read is A Treatise in Urine Therapy by John W. Armstrong. Let me tell you that any book title with the word Treatise in the title is usually tedious reading but this book wasn’t so bad. John (not a doctor) describes how he supervised the healing of 96 different people who chose urine therapy as part of their healing process—some of them ingesting disgusting looking urine as their only healing modality after the medical system had given them up for dead.
John writes: “Drinking your own urine acts to cleanse the body, free it from obstruction and rebuild vital organs damaged from disease.” The kidney is an amazing organ filtering components in the urine. Did you know that your urine varies with the foods you eat, the season of the year and that you only produce ¼ to ½ of your urine volume during sleeping hours? Well, it’s true.
“The prime cause of disease is the absence of substances which should be in the body and the presence of substances which should not be in the body” John writes.
Mr. John Anderson is convinced that drinking provides the body with much needed cell salts. Actually his discussion of cell salts was really pretty good if you have any interest in learning more about that. He’s also convinced that the body’s own urine acts as a homeopathic remedy to detoxify the body and repair the lungs, pancreas, liver, brain, heart, bowels and linings of the body. He believes that drinking your own urine accomplishes what mere fasting with water or juices cannot and explains the entire process in full detail in this 136 page book.
His introduction to drinking his own urine was when he became so ill that several doctors no longer felt it useful to treat him. He had what they called in those days, consumption. Well, when you don’t have the energy to do anything you have a lot of time to think. Being a religious sort of fellow it came to him while reading Proverbs V that “Drink waters of thine own cistern” meant that we should drink our own urine to be in optimal health. So he spent the next 45 days doing just that.
John also rubbed urine onto his own body—maybe he thought he was anointing himself? Who knows, but the treatment worked and he has helped heal many others with urine therapy over the years.
Some diseases he’s treated with urine therapy include: Gangrene, cancers of various kinds, Bright’s disease, leukemia, heart disease, malaria and fevers, orchitis, venereal disease, bed sores and burns, the common cold, hemorrhoids, blindness and cataracts.
He noted that arthritis and diabetes were harder to cure with urine therapy but that urine had no side effects and was the only food needed for sick people. Hmmm. No side effects? Well, I guess that’s a matter of opinion. I don’t know how many friends you’d have after you told them that you drank everything that came out of you and I don’t know too many spouses who would want to kiss a urine permeated partner very often—at least that’s what I’ve been told!
I once was brought in on an animal abuse case where the dog was left in its 4 x 8 food cyclone dog kennel for two weeks without food and water. The dog literally drank its own urine to survive. Very sad. After bathing it three times there was still a urine stench to that dog for several weeks. I’m sure that drinking volumes of your own urine would have that same affect.
Of course if your doctor tells you that you’re going to die and has given up on you this opens up the mind to alternative treatments of all kinds. In my practice I see a lot of people with open minds.
Definitely not a book for the squeamish.
