Kojic Acid and Skin Brightners Review
Share
Kojic acid, derived from mushrooms, is a natural product used to reduce the appearance of freckles, skin blemishes, and uneven pigment. Kojic acid is a melanin inhibitor, which means that it prevents an enzyme called tyrosinase from producing melanin in the area where the acid is applied. Many have used kojic acid to tone skin, fight age spots, and even reduce pregnancy scars, and the product is often selected as a natural alternative to whiteners like hydroquinone. Whether or not kojic acid effectively lightens skin pigments is not universally agreed.
Hydroquinone, a bleaching product often found in over-the-counter skin lightening products, is a synthetic and highly toxic substance. It is banned in Europe and may only be sold in concentrations of 2 percent or under in the U.S. Hydroquinone has been noted for causing a wide range of mild to severe side effects. It can cause redness, irritation, and sensitivity. It can also cause “Exogenous Ochronosis,” a condition causing the darkening of the skin in blue-black patches; edema, an unnatural accumulation of fluid below the skin; or erythema, congestion of the capillaries below the skin.
Because so many substances can be harmful to the skin, particularly when you are trying to bleach the skin in some way, it is important to consult a skin care professional about the available options to smooth out your skin tone or hide discoloration. Many laser treatments pose less risk to your skin and will permanently minimize the appearance of blemishes. To learn more about options for lightening and brightening the skin, Healthy Skin Portal provides you with the resources to set up a consultation with a qualified skin care specialist. Don’t ruin your skin by experimenting with dangerous acids or chemicals—consult someone who will treat your skin with great care, and leave you looking and feeling beautiful.
