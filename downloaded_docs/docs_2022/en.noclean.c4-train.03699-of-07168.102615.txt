Chronic emotional stress or psychological worries
Lack of nutrients such as vitamins, iron, copper and iodine in the diet
Medical conditions such as anemia, hypothyroidism, tuberous sclerosis or neurofibromatosis
How to Avoid Grey Hair Naturally
METHOD:
So your first course of action for successfully treating gray hair is to start taking a good liquid colloidal mineral supplement such as these. Colloidal minerals contain ALL the minerals your body needs in a highly absorbable form.
You may need to take extra colloidal copper as well until your grey hair recedes. Colloidal
copper also makes an excellent external treatment for reversing grey hair. Simply soak a couple of cotton balls with colloidal copper, apply to the scalp and massage/rub in.
Be sure to also supplement with black strap molasses as this is rich in essential vitamins and minerals (many people swear by this supplement as a natural remedy for grey hair), along with the very powerful Fo-ti herb, which actually translates to “black-haired Mr. He” (black haired man) in Chinese. This herb has been reported to reverse grey hair very quickly for many people (you can read some positive testimonials here). With Fo-ti, you can either take supplements, buy it as a tea, or actually buy the root and make your own tea everyday.
In addition to these, cereal grasses such as wheat and barley grass are an excellent source of vitamin A and the B group vitamins along with copper, iron, silica and zinc and should also be supplemented with everyday.
Try this :
Add some potato shells in water, and cook them for 30 minutes. Afterwards, remove the shells from the pot and using a brush, apply this brown liquid on your hair.
For better results, this treatment ought to be repeated several times.
Home remedies can be used by anyone no side effect and healthy hairs look as great ♥
Go ahead and get rid off from your grey hairs and look young ♥

Since honey is also known as natural conditioner, one can add it along with the garlic. This will help smooth hair as well as reduce the odour of garlic.

Burn Out Calories
So tasty know !!! But have you ever thought of burning these calories which you intake? 460 calories = 1 Burger. Do you really think you’re half an hour walk or 20 sit ups will work or your 1 hour gym will help you ? An adult needs 2000 calories per day and calories should be in taken with only healthy food not junk food. Have you ever thought where these calories will take you to ? Obesity is the natural answer. But not only obesity many health problems like heart disease, diabetes are usual if you don’t take proper diet and also if proper work outs are not done.
Also See: Yoga poses to Build Immune system Naturally
It is believed that one who don’t eat junk also needs Exercise or walk of at least one hour. So imagine the one who intake lot of junk food , then how much exercise they need to keep themselves fit.
Let’s have a look :
● Mc Donalds burger… ya it is very tasty and double cheese is tastier. How many sit ups do you need for it ?
93 minutes sit ups continuously or running 4 miles. Gosh!! Have you ever done this much Exercise in a month. Seriously I don’t believe that anyone can.
One slice of Pizza. Ya from dominos ahha very tasty but calories ?? Yeah 285 calories
approx. How much workout do you really need ?
50 minutes walk for one slice then think if you intake whole pizza that means either 4 slices or 6.
Multiply 50 minutes into the slices u eat. Will you able to digest it properly without proper
Exercise.
KFC chicken yeah it’s finger licking good !! But again pop up Calories??? What about
it ? How much do you need to play Frisbee for it?
You really need to play it for like 4 hours 3 minutes approx !! Are you serious you can burn these calories. Be really sure of what you it because if you eat that much you really need to work more harder for it.
Do you really think you can work out on your body that much that you can burn these calories ?
Or Do you think it is easy to digest such high calories food?
Unfortunately answer is NO!! No one has that much capability to digest or to work out for like 4 hours or 5 hours. But if you say so that you really can work on your body much then I would say you can go for high calories food but most us cannot , not even most of us but 99.9% people can’t.
Accept the reality and either work out that much or else have proper balanced diet.
Stay healthy stay fit
