If you're constipated, you're probably having a difficult time having a bowel movement. And when you do, your stools are usually small, hard, and dry. If you have to push and strain or sit on the toilet for 10-15 minutes, then expect to have hemorrhoids at some point. Two to three minutes is all you normally need to have a natural bowel movement.
Relieving Hemorrhoids A large part of how to relieve painful hemorrhoids is done by improving the way you have bowel movements. You should only move your bowels when you have the urge to do so and don't spend excess time on the toilet trying to move your bowels. Along these lines it is important that you go to the bath right away when your body has the urge for a bowel movement.
If you don't have much time for a walk and your job requires you to sit all day then a good idea is to try and sit with doughnut shaped cushion which can help take pressure off sensitive areas.

There are two different ways to treat hemorrhoids with essential oils, and these can be used together. The first method involves a shallow bath of hot water. This method should only be done in a bathtub, as the dosages given are not meant for a sitz-bath that fits over the toilet. Run a shallow, hot bath, and sprinkle twenty drops of lavender and twenty drops of juniper
Essential oils are also usually quite volatile, which means that the active, medicinal chemicals in them evaporate quickly when exposed to air. Therefore, essential oils are kept in tightly closed, dark glass bottles, in pure form, until right before they are to be used. Then, and only then, they are mixed with the carrier that dilutes them to their proper strength. If a prepared blend is left exposed to oxygen for even a day, the actual medication is probably gone. It may still smell nice, and can be used for that purpose, but don't expect to get the therapeutic effect anymore.

First, it is helpful to understand precisely what aromatherapy is and is not. Aromatherapy is not magic. It does not imply that merely by sniffing a particular scent your ills will be cured. In point of fact, aromatherapy is a bit of a misleading term. Properly speaking, it should be labeled as plant-based medication that is taken either by inhalation, according to the same principle by which asthma inhalers work, or topically through the skin, just as ointments and creams work. The essential oils used in aromatherapy are medications, and just as chemically complicated and potentially dangerous as any other medications.
Always test yourself for allergies to essential oils by diluting one drop in a small amount of carrier oil and dabbing it on the inside of your elbow. Leave it there for twenty-four hours and check closely for a reaction. If you are allergic to an essential oil, it is important to know before applying it to such a sensitive and tender area of your body. In addition, should you start to have any skin reactions during treatment, immediately cease all aromatherapeutic treatments immediately, along with anything else you've been placing on your skin. Given these cautions, however, aromatherapy has offered relief and treatment to many people who are suffering from hemorrhoids. In combination with a diet and lifestyle change, these aromatherapy treatments should clear up the problem in no time.
