Benefits of Green Coffee for Weight Loss: What Is The Truth?
If you want to know about the benefits of green coffee for weight loss, you have come to the right place! Green coffee extract is getting a ton of attention lately. It has even been featured on the Dr. Oz show. Green coffee’s controversial claims pertaining to aiding in weight loss has many experts advising individuals to ensure they do the proper research before buying into any non-doctor recommended supplement.
Can Green Coffee Help For Weight Loss?
So What is The Big Deal About Green Coffee?
Green coffee has been attributed to having varying degrees of benefits regarding weight loss. Companies selling items containing green coffee extract often over exaggerate the claim that it can contribute to weight loss. What a lot of the companies do not take into account is that any weight loss regime should involve a combination of habitual changes. Habits need to change in order to maintain weight loss, as well as lose weight in a healthy holistic non-harmful way. Despite the controversy surrounding green coffee, many consumers have argued that such products have greatly contributed to their weight loss journey. Some even go so far as to say they dropped the weight at a quicker pace utilizing green coffee products.

How Does Green Coffee Cause Weight Loss?
Although there is the lack of mass scientific evidence to provide proof that green coffee directly causes weight loss, experts agree that it may help as long as other weight loss strategies are incorporated, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise.
What Is The Deal About Green Coffee And Weight Loss?
Unlike regular coffee, green coffee beans are not roasted. They are often soaked and then transformed to concentrate in order to create the extract often used in supplements. Although green coffee does contain low amounts of caffeine, chlorogenic acid is considered the active ingredient contributing to weight loss. By not roasting the coffee beans, there are higher concentrates of chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid is thought to have many health benefits including lowering high blood pressure, increasing metabolic rate, and reducing blood sugar. Research has shown that those taking Green Coffee extract lost an average of 6 and a half pounds more than those consuming regular coffee. Chlorogenic acid also works as an antioxidant, protecting the body against free radicals. In other words, it can protect your body cells from stress and damage preventing things such as cancer from occurring.
A study done on mice in 2006 further support weight loss claims pertaining to green coffee. The mice were given the green coffee extract. Conclusively, the study found that the mice given the extract on a regular basis had reduced visceral fat and body weight. The study suggested that green coffee may cause less fat absorption in the body and increase the rate at which the liver metabolizes fat. A 2012 study was done on human subjects provided similar results.
The reason for precautions? There are not an abundant amount of studies and research regarding green coffee. It is still in the early stages. A direct correlation as to how or why has not been thoroughly produced. It has worked for some green coffee consumers, and not worked for many others. Further research is needed to create a clearer picture in relation to green coffee’s benefits to weight loss.
Fresh Green Coffee Beans
Scientists determine that nothing can supplement regular exercise and a healthy diet. However, green coffee can be an additional strategy to weight loss.
How often and how much should you take to reap the benefits of green coffee?
It is suggested to take around 120-300 milligrams, 3 times a day for 8-12 weeks. However, read the labeling of the product purchased and follow the directions carefully. As with any ingested product, side effects are possible. It is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with anxiety disorders, individuals with bleeding disorders, or individuals with diabetes. Side effects can include diarrhea, glaucoma, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, IBS, and osteoporosis. Currently, there is no definite information on green coffee’s interaction with other supplements or drugs. It is advised to consult your doctor or local healthcare provider prior to purchasing or consuming any supplement or weight loss product.
It is up to the consumer to ensure they are properly informed about any product. Green coffee does have evidential health benefits, some of which pertain to weight loss. Thoroughly read the reviews of any product prior to purchase. Ensure with any weight loss strategy to include a balanced, healthy, and holistic diet and regular exercise. Green coffee should be taken in addition to these approaches. Take control of your weight loss journey. Do the research. Try varying methods and stick to the one that works.

I had heard of green coffee and knew the coffee beans were not roasted but little more than that so it was interesting to read your article.
Does green coffee taste much different to roasted coffee? I guess it must do….is it bitter?
I see that IBS can be a side effect – I already suffer from IBS so I’m guessing it’s probably not the best idea for me to take it?

Hi Louise, it is a little bit more bitter, but this is a factor why it helps so much to drop weight and burn fat.
IBS is not a side effect of it, not more than every other normal coffee also. You shouldnÂ´t drink any type of coffee if you suffer from it.
