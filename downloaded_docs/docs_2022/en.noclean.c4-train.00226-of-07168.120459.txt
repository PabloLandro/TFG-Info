Drinking urine is a trend now? Eww!
Drinking urine may sound disgusting to many of us but that doesn’t mean the trend doesn’t exist. There is a group of people who believe that drinking urine alone can provide many benefits to health. Among them is to get an attractive body shape, smooth and youthful look.
This trend has become a practice of overseas, especially for women and men who are willing to do anything as long as their face and appearance look attractive all the time. It is said that urine is the most natural ‘antidote’ and was worth it to drink rather than throwing it away.
Not only drinking, those who believe in urine benefit also believe that there is a distinctive benefit for the skin if the entire body is ‘moisturized’ in urine and is good for the eyes if applied on the eyelids. In fact, they also claim that the practice of making urine as a ‘health product’ has been around for centuries.
This trend began to follow after some of the popular health bloggers in the United States of America (USA), uploading videos on the benefits of urine intake on their respective websites. In fact, these tips have been practiced by professionals, including Christo Dabraccio, a meteorologist who claims his body to remains energetic, strong as ‘Superman’ and lost about 13 kilos since practicing the diet.

Christo said,
“I first learned about these tips through the internet. Honestly, I was also amused at first. But after an in-depth research and reading the sharings of other people’s experiences. I’m determined to try it myself.
“Urine is filtered from blood, and you need blood to stay alive. So, it makes sense (drinking urine). Soon after I applied these tips, I felt like Superman.
“My body feels energetic, my head feels light, my skin looks younger. It’s as if you’ve just been drinking tonic water.”
Christo also suggested his friend, Julia Sillaman, to try the same tips before Julia informed him that it was effective in treating her acne problems and successfully losing 11 kilos. She keeps her urine in a bottle and drinks about three cups each day, as well as apply it on her own body.

However, medical experts are saying that the communities claiming to drink urine have health benefits as ‘self-deceiving’ because clinical studies have not found evidence to confirm the allegations.

However, for this community, they believe that drinking urine is still logical, though not supported by scientific evidence. They believe that urine compounds can be re-absorbed by the body to enhance the body’s defense system against illness and provide other impotence improves.

Although the community’s argument says ‘yes, urine has its goodness’ it’s believed by many people, but the medical practitioners warn us that drinking urine can actually endanger your health.
To further strengthen their argument, the community also claimed that the act of drinking urine was practiced by high-profile individuals, especially Hollywood celebrities, but did not reveal those involved.
For Julia, the tips suggested by Christo actually helped her recover her spirits after she was almost in despair with the acne problem she had.

Besides making urine as a ‘facial cleanser’ to cope with acne problems, Julia also claims that she lost weight and overcomes digestive problems since she makes urine as a drink. She said,
“I felt very disappointed and inferior of my own appearance and I feel hesitant to meet with the dermatologist.
“Then I met Christo, I still remember how he looks very energetic, healthy and has good skin. I asked what was his secret, and he suggested I practice urine therapy.
“Surprisingly, I did not find it disgusting, instead I felt like trying it out. After several times of applying the urine on my face, I began to see a change. My acne growth slowed down and my skin started getting smoother.”

“I also started fasting. I noticed that my urine began to change and became clearer as well it tastes like coconut water. Now I feel more energetic and close to nature, I feel like I’ve been reborn.
“I think I will practice this therapy throughout my life, but not as much as today. I expect my family to protest, but since they see the change themselves, some of them are also keen to try. “
