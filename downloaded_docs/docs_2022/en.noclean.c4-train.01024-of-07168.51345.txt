Dr. Simoncini’s Incredible Cancer Cure
Posted on July 1, 2010 by Antonia Hagens
Dr. Simoncini, an oncologist, has a simple and incredible cancer cure.
He has successfully been healing cancer for over 20 years
with simple baking soda!! His book is “Cancer is a Fungus”.
When I first heard of Dr. Simoncini’s incredibly
easy way to heal cancer I was intrigued and ordered his book.
I have read about many cancer cures and his book is
an in-depth detail of the history of cancer, his frustration
as an oncologist and a recounting of what lead him to
discover the cancer fungus connection.
A very dear friend assisted in the healing of his elderly
mother’s rare cancer using the baking soda cancer cure,
energy healing and clearing out limiting beliefs.
I have also used baking soda on unusual skin growths
with great success.
I am planning on interviewing him this fall.
