Do hemorrhoids go away by themselves?
asked on Sun, 05 Sep, 2010
I have been seeing blood, just a small trace, when I go to the toilet. I assume this is internal hemorrhoids. It comes and goes and seems to be linked with constipation. Do hemorrhoids go away by themselves?

Most hemorrhoid symptoms improve dramatically with simple, at-home measures. To avoid occasional flare-ups, try the following. Get more fiber. Add more fiber to your diet from food, a fiber supplement (such as Metamucil, Citrucel, or Fiber Con), or both. Along with adequate fluid, fiber softens stools and makes them easier to pass, reducing pressure on hemorrhoids. High-fiber foods include broccoli, beans, wheat and oat bran, whole-grain foods, and fresh fruit. Fiber supplements help decrease hemorrhoidal bleeding, inflammation, and enlargement. They may also reduce irritation from small bits of stool that are trapped around the blood vessels. Some women find that boosting fiber causes bloating or gas. Start slowly, and gradually increase your intake to 25–30 grams of fiber per day. Also, increase your fluid intake. Exercise. Moderate aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking 20–30 minutes a day, can help stimulate bowel function. Take time. When you feel the urge to defecate, go to the bathroom immediately; don’t wait until a more convenient time. Stool can back up, leading to increased pressure and straining. Also, schedule a set time each day, such as after a meal, to sit on the toilet for a few minutes. This can help you establish a regular bowel habit. Sitz. A sitz bath is a warm water bath for the buttocks and hips (the name comes from the German “sitzen,” meaning “to sit”). It can relieve itching, irritation, and spasms of the sphincter muscle. Pharmacies sell small plastic tubs that fit over a toilet seat, or you can sit in a regular bathtub with a few inches of warm water. Most experts recommend a 20-minute sitz bath after each bowel movement and two or three times a day in addition. Take care to gently pat the anal area dry afterward; do not rub or wipe hard. You can also use a hair dryer to dry the area. Seek topical relief. Over-the-counter hemorrhoid creams containing a local anesthetic can temporarily soothe pain. Creams and suppositories containing hydrocortisone are also effective, but don’t use them for more than a week at a time, because they can cause the skin to atrophy. Witch hazel wipes (Tucks) are soothing and have no harmfu l effects. A small ice pack placed against the anal area for a few minutes can also help reduce pain and swelling. Finally, sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones. Treat the clot. When an external hemorrhoid forms a blood clot, the pain can be excruciating. If the clot has been present for longer than two days, apply home treatments for the symptoms while waiting for it to go away on its own. If the clot is more recent, the hemorrhoid can be surgically removed or the clot withdrawn from the vein in a minor office procedure performed by a surg

I know what you mean. I was a sufferer of hemorrhoids or piles as we call them in England. Just a few traces of blood and just after going to the toilet when my stool was dry. Like scratching inside. I found this site: hemorrhoidswiki.com which detail all the answers to the many questions you might have. As far as Do hemorrhoids go away by themselves. Well the answer is, it depends on what is the cause of your hemorrhoids. Constipation causes a great deal of pressure of the anal canal and the hemorrhoid area. So by changing your diet with a home combination treatment, you will be able to remove the root cause and therefore overtime remove your hemorrhoids. Hope this helps.

The most important thing is to be examined by either a colorectal surgeon or gastroenterologist. You can assume the bleeding comes from hemorrhoids, but other causes such as polyps and cancer could cause bleeding as well. My best advice: get checked by a doctor..... depending on your age, you most likely will be recommended a colonoscopy. Good luck! log into www.fascrs.org and click on locate a surgeon

no they don't. if you decide to have them 'banded' a doctor can do it right in the office. it's not painful and after they band the internal hemorrhoid it will shrivel up and fall off in about a week. It's definitely worth getting them taken care of and stop the bleeding.
