In any case I always recommend to ask your doctor and be careful with Hollywood diets. A 5 to 6 day per week exercise routine and healthy food will always give you result.
Women and men everywhere look in the mirror and judge themselves for the shape and state of their bodies. Healthy weight loss can not only improve ones self esteem but it can also be an integral part of increasing overall well-being. The key to this process is the word healthy. Unhealthy weight loss by forms of fad and yo-yo diets can have adverse effects on a person’s body, mind and spirit. Healthy weight loss is often brought about by two of the most difficult things for people to accept: diet and exercise. Read below for more on these two aspects of healthy weight loss.
Diet and Healthy Weight Loss
No healthy weight loss plan is complete without a well-balanced diet. The key is not to eat less or restrict your intake of certain foods, but rather to intake a diet lower in fat and calories. Establishing a healthy diet does not mean taking away all carbs; nor does it mean stocking your shelf with low-fat diet foods. Rather, you should intake a diet full of lean proteins, plenty of fruits and vegetables as well as whole grains. And no diet would be complete without 64 ounces of water per day.
Exercise and Healthy Weight Loss
In addition to a nutritious diet and plenty of water, exercise is also important to healthy weight loss. Regardless of what type of exercise you enjoy, the important thing is to get moving. Try walking three to four times a week and start out at 20 minutes. Then, bump your time up to 30 or 40 minutes.
If walking is not your thing, consider becoming a member of the local gym. There are typically tons of cardio options such as bikes, elliptical machines, stair stepping machines, treadmills, etc. In addition, most gyms offer weight machines, free weights, balls, etc. Most gyms also offer classes such as spin classes, aerobics classes, and more.
If you just can’t seem to go it alone, an investment in a personal trainer may be worth your while as you try to achieve a healthy weight loss. Though personal trainers may seem expensive, they can often offer not only exercises but also meal plans to help you lose the weight effectively.
Conclusion
Though there are many weight loss methods out there, including diets and pills, healthy weight loss often comes in the form of diet and exercise. All changes to routine or diet should be monitored by a doctor.
