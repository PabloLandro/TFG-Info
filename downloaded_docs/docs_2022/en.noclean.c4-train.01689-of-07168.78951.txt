Did You Inherit Cancer Causing Gene Mutations?
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many of us have had a blood relative with cancer. If you inherited certain causing genetic mutations, it can increase your chances of developing cancer as well. Two Types of Inherited Mutations There are two types of inherited mutations that could affect you for cancer. 1. Germline Inherited: These are inherited through the family germline, affecting many generations. They’re relatively rare, connected with causing 10 -15% of cancers. 2. Somatic Inherited: In contrast, the other type of inherited mutation is only present in that person – and not their family. So, with this kind, there is no previous family history of cancer. Most cancers are caused by this type of inheritance. Inherited Mutations with NO Family History This type of inherited mutation occurs when the...

How Genomic Profiling Increases Cancer Patients’ Chances of Survival!
Published by CTOAM on October 3, 2018 1 Comment
In nearly a decade of helping people recover from cancer, CTOAM’s precision oncology specialists have never seen two people with exactly the same cancer. Our specialists have seen people with breast, lung, brain, and prostate cancer, as well as other types of cancer – and, even within the same category, no two people have had the exact same mutations driving their cancer. Therefore, each of our patients has required a unique combination of advanced targeted therapies and nutraceuticals, and sometimes in addition to other treatment interventions. In order to have the best chance of recovery from cancer, your treatment must target your unique genetic mutations. And for that, you need genomic profiling and Precision Oncology’s gene-based approach to cancer care. What is Cancer? Cancer is...

What if Better Cancer Treatment Already Exists?
Published by CTOAM on September 30, 2018 | Share your thoughts
What if there were already better cancer treatment options? Better than standard chemotherapy and radiation? There are! We now have more accurate tests and treatments that help cancer patients live longer than standard cancer care. These treatments have already been approved for use in Canada and have recently become part of standard care in the UK. They’re also already used in most top cancer hospitals in the US, like the Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, and John Hopkins. But, most are not yet available through Canadian public healthcare. It could take upwards of 10 years for these lifesaving treatments to become offered through Canadian public healthcare. That’s where CTOAM comes in. Cancer Treatment Options and Management (CTOAM) is a Canada-based company that specializes in providing Precision Oncology...

8 Ways to Advocate for Your Cancer Care – This Could Save Your Life
Published by CTOAM on June 1, 2018 3 Comments
Do you really need a cancer care advocate or is the basic care you receive from your public oncologist good enough? Read on to find out the truth about standard care and decide for yourself. Joan was 45 years old when she was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma. Her public oncologist gave her the option of standard chemotherapy, which, according to studies, would’ve given her approximately less than a year to live. Since her disease would not respond to standard treatments, her oncologist told her that there were no other treatment options. She was told to get her affairs in order. But Joan wasn’t ready to accept this – so she and her husband reached out to CTOAM. Our cancer experts helped them to access the...

Why Precision Oncology Works – Even if Some Reports on Targeted Therapies Say Otherwise
Published by CTOAM on May 1, 2018 | Share your thoughts
Why You Should Trust Precision Oncology Precision oncology and, more specifically, targeted therapies have been under attack since their inception. There’ve been numerous studies and reports claiming that targeted therapies have NOT lived up to expectations and are still inferior to standard therapies. However, a more detailed look at these so-called ineffective studies reveals many design flaws in their methodologies. When the data is presented accurately, precision oncology produces significant benefits in both overall survival and reduced side effects for cancer patients. Problem #1: Using Targeted Drugs Without the Required Biomarker One issue with many studies involving targeted therapies is the use of targeted therapies without prior testing to ensure the relevant biomarker is present in that patient’s tumour tissue. While this may seem like...

5 Reasons Why You Need Liquid Biopsies for Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment
Published by CTOAM on April 2, 2018 | Share your thoughts
Recently the CBC ran an article called, “Blood Test for Early Detection of 8 Cancers Looks Promising.” The article went on to discuss how this promising new blood-based liquid biopsy was able to identify cancers in people. However, as is typical with new medical advancements, the article requires some further clarification and explanation. The article described the results of the test like this: “The blood tests found about 70% of eight common types of cancer in the 1,005 patients. The rates varied depending on the type – lower for breast tumours but high for ovarian, liver, and pancreatic ones”. The author went on to explain that the liquid biopsy test detects mutations in 16 genes tied to cancer. And it also measures eight proteins that are...
