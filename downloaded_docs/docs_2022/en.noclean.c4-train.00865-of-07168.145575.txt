Baking Soda and Cancer: The Fungus Angle

Baking soda and cancer have been making the headlines these days, which has had the grand effect of confusing cancer patients even more than usual. With all of the information, and disinformation out there, who is right when it comes to deciphering the new findings about the correlation between cancer, fungus, and baking soda? Let us highlight a few important points first before we connect baking soda and cancer:
Truth #1 about Cancer: Doctors still don’t know what really causes cancer. Scientists now have a good grip on the nature of cancers, how it grows, and have a wide array of chemicals that affect or retard the growth of cancer once it starts. But how does it come about? It remains a much debated mystery.
Truth #2 about Cancer: There’s still no cure. While scientists and researchers have made many significant discoveries concerning cancer, none have come up with the definitive preventative or cure.
Truth #3 about Cancer: Cancer behaves like a fungus. While this notion has been around for many years, it is now beginning to attract attention. The National Institute of Health has funded many research projects along these lines, meaning that even the government sees the merit in this avenue of thought.
So, what is the average cancer patient to make of this information? What is the connection between baking soda and cancer? Consider this: baking soda has long been used to combat fungal infections of all sorts. Many homeopathic doctors have been using it for years with varying degrees of success to prevent or retard the growth of certain cancers.
Most alternative medicine practitioners agree that cancer is a reaction to the body’s tendency to fight the stress factors. This causes the cells to change and become cancerous. If the conditions in the body are right, then the cancer can spread. The environment that is conducive of this growth is typically acidic in nature and identical to that causing fungal growth. Baking soda creates an alkaline environment that neutralizes the acidic components, inhibiting fungal growth. Many researchers over the years have compared cancer to a fungus – the connection can certainly not be escaped.
Baking soda and cancer have gained the attention of prestigious research universities such as Johns Hopkins University, where their newsletters now contain references to utilizing baking soda as a preventative and supportive supplement to those who are undergoing cancer treatments.
So how can the average person (whether they are dealing with cancer or not) include baking soda into the normal diet? Many alternative doctors recommend cancer patients to take a pinch of baking soda by mouth, rub it around the teeth and gums (to neutralize mouth acids), and then swallow and repeat three times a day. Another recommended option is to place a teaspoon of baking soda in a full glass of water and drinking it an hour or so before going to bed. The additional benefits of this treatment includes improvement to teeth and gum health as well as providing support to the immune system.
In the fight against cancer, baking soda is certainly becoming an interesting contender. This article does not seek to imply in any way that baking soda cures cancer, or that patients should use baking soda as a way to self-medicate themselves against cancer. The use of baking soda must be reviewed with your physician, who is hopefully open-minded to the possibilities and is caught up on the latest research.
