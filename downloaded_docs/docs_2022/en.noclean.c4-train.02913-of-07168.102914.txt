Invasive Aedes mosquitoes in San Mateo County
Invasive Aedes mosquitoes are not native to San Mateo County, California, or even North America. They do not belong in our ecosystems, and they can make people very uncomfortable because they bite during the day and even bite indoors. More importantly, they are a risk to human health because they can carry diseases that make people very sick, like Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever.

Why Control Mosquitoes?
Mosquitoes are more than a nuisance! They can carry and transmit diseases that can make people very sick. Even when they don’t transmit disease, their bites may be uncomfortable or become infected.
Controlling mosquitoes interrupts the disease transmission cycle and protects people from disease.

Mosquito-Smart Travel Tips
Even when the risk of mosquito-borne illness is low here in San Mateo County, you may be at higher risk if you travel to other areas of the state, country, or world. If you’re infected with a mosquito-borne illness while traveling, there is a risk you could pass it on to local mosquitoes once you return home, and a local outbreak could occur. These tips will help you protect yourself and others from mosquito-borne illnesses during and after travel.
