Home Remedy Tips For Treating Painful Hemorrhoids
Piles, a general alternative term for hemorrhoids, affects millions of people all over the globe annually. While the subject can be embarrassing, when you suffer with hemorrhoids, insight on how to deal with hemorrhoids is indispensable. The tips you will find below will help you do just that.
Eating a high-fiber diet is vital for long-term control over painful hemorrhoids. Examples of fiber-rich foods include pasta, oatmeal, whole grain breads and leafy green vegetables. Fiber encourages bowel movement and reduces the strain that often leads to hemorrhoids.
You can decrease the likeliness of forming external hemorrhoids by stepping up your hygiene practices in the bathroom. Use soft toilet paper that does not leave paper or residue behind, and use moist wipes after every bowel movement.
Witch Hazel
Witch hazel is very helpful for relieving discomfort, pain, and itching associated with hemorrhoids. Witch hazel is an astringent that will shrink or constrict the hemorrhoid tissue, bringing relief and healing. Put the witch hazel on a cotton ball, leaving it there for about five to ten minutes, or go with a sitz bath.
If you have hemorrhoids, avoid using hygiene products containing oils, dyes and fragrances. Exposing the hemorrhoid to these substances can lead to unbearable stinging, pain, and intensified itching and swelling sensations.
Drink plenty of water if you suffer from frequent hemorrhoids. Drinking plenty of water will soften your stools. Also, you will want to limit your consumption of caffeine products, as well as alcohol.
If you’re dealing with hemorrhoids, you shouldn’t become reliant on laxatives to make your stool softer. Such products are meant to produce just a single bowel movement. If your bowel movements make your hemorrhoid pain worse, consider changing your diet to achieve lasting effects instead.
Losing weight can make your hemorrhoid condition easier. Being overweight can exacerbate hemorrhoid problems. Excess weight can place undue strain and pressure on the veins in your rectal area. Add more fibers to your diet and start exercising to lose weight and take some pressure off. Though it may seem like an easy approach to weight loss or hemorrhoid treatment, resist the urge to excessively use laxatives.
Brisk Walk
If you feel you are having issues with constipation, then before you go to the bathroom, take a walk. A brisk walk will stimulate the systems of the body to function properly and help you go more easily. This is a good way to reduce the strain you put on your hemorrhoids. A short 10 or 15-minute brisk walk will help to get things moving.
If you consume large amounts of caffeine and spicy foods, you should decrease or eliminate them from your diet. These foods are detrimental to your hemorrhoids. Spicy foods can even inflame your hemorrhoids to the point of burning when you are not using the restroom, so steering clear can be beneficial to your system.
Don’t become dependent on laxatives. While they can certainly help those with hemorrhoid problems, they’re meant to be a one-time fix, not a cure. They will only provide temporary relief of your discomfort.
You can relieve the pain and inflammation of hemorrhoids by sitting in a tub of warm water. Sitting in about six or twelve inches of some lukewarm water can reduce discomfort and increase blood flow if you’ve got hemorrhoids. As you sit in the tub, your knees should be bent. Sit as long as you can, adding more warm water as necessary to stay comfortable.
You have read some tips on how to deal with the pain and discomfort of hemorrhoids, so it should now be easy to put them to use. Use this information to ensure that you never have to face this problem again.

Losing weight will help decrease hemorrhoid pain. Being too heavy can exacerbate the effects of hemorrhoids. Excess weight can place undue strain and pressure on the veins in your rectal area. When following a weight loss regimen, be sure to eat foods high in fiber, as this can reduce pressure. Make sure you avoid excessively using laxatives; you don’t want to hurt your body as using them too much can be very unhealthy.
That is the most likely cause, but you should be diagnosed by a doctor. Blood in the stool or bleeding from the rectum can signal a more serious illness, including cancer. Going to have it checked out will ease your anxiety about what might be wrong. If you do have hemorrhoids, your physician can provide tips on treating and managing the condition.
If you don’t consume many vegetable and fruits, take a fiber supplement daily. Scatter the supplement consumption throughout the entire day, and get enough water.
Spicy Foods
Stay far away from hot and spicy foods, as well as caffeine. They can inflame the bowel, bringing on hemorrhoids. In fact, eating spicy foods can inflame hemorrhoids to a point of painful burning, so steer clear of them if you don’t want to spend all your time in the bathroom.
If you are dealing with painful hemorrhoids, then you should think about purchasing a donut cushion. These cushions are designed to allow someone with hemorrhoids to sit comfortably. You just place it where you will sit and plop down on it. It does give relief if your hemorrhoids are very sensitive.
Hemorrhoid creams can often help, but don’t use them too often. Creams do little to alleviate the painful irritation, swelling, or bleeding associated with hemorrhoids. However, creams are useful for numbing particularly bad pain that comes along with hemorrhoid flare-ups. Read the labels on any cream or ointment you choose to use, and seek your physicians advice if you feel you will exceed the package recommendations. Do not use any products in a manner for which they were not intended. Follow all directions carefully to avoid exasperating your condition.
Almost all grownups, as we mentioned before, will have at least one hemorrhoid flare up and many suffer from recurring problems. This condition can be handled through exercise and proper diet.
