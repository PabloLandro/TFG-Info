What is vitamin C?
Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, otherwise known as ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is responsible for many functions in your body. If you consume too much Vitamin C, it may not be harmful. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin therefore excess amount is excreted in your urine. But it can develop sy…mptoms such as kidney stones and diarrhea because it is an acid. The average (nonsmoking) person should consume 60 mg of Vitamin C per day. This can be found in 3/4 cup of orange juice. People who smoke need more Vitamin C than others. Their requirement is 100 mg a day. You can obtain Vitamin C from citrus fruits such as oranges, tangerines, and grapefruits. You can also obtain a significant amount from tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, and even potatoes. Vitamin C is good for protecting your body. For vegetarians it is even healthier. When combined with iron, iron becomes more absorb-able allowing an increased iron intake. ( Full Answer )

What are the benefits of vitamin D?
Vitamin D has been a rising star in the Vitamins Hall of Fame. Recent research indicates that Vitamin D is essential not just for healthy bones and teeth, but it is good for the heart, brains and lungs. Some studies show that it plays a role in controlling pain. Vitamin D deficiencies are becoming m…ore common as most people work inside and are less exposed to the sun. Even when we do venture out in the sun, we usually apply a sunscreen lotion to prevent the sun's rays from penetrating the skin. People living in higher latitudes may not receive enough exposure to the sun. The elderly who are housebound may also suffer from deficiencies of Vitamin D. An adult would require about 800 IUs a day. We can usually get 400 IUs from diet alone, the rest can be through quality Vitamin D supplements. The hormonal functions of vitamin D include regulation of bone health, regulation of muscle health (including both skeletal and heart muscle), regulation of immune response, regulation of insulin and blood sugar, and regulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Because vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are in so many different tissue types-including your brain and skin-vitamin D deficiency may contribute to many human diseases including depression and autoimmune diseases, and may increase risks of deadly cancers, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. . Regulation of bone health, calcium, and phosphorus : Your bones comprise many different substances, including collagen proteins, keratin proteins, and the minerals silicon, boron, and magnesium. But the two most critical bone components are the minerals calcium and phosphorus, which make up over half of all bone composition. While bone health is regulated by many different substances in the body-including growth hormone, testosterone, and estrogens-the importance of calcium and phosphorus in bone health also points to the special importance of two bone health regulators: parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Your parathyroid glands secrete PTH whenever your blood calcium level gets too low. When that happens, PTH triggers release of calcium from your bones in order to boost your blood level back up to normal. PTH also triggers your kidneys to retain more calcium (keeping it available for your bloodstream) and excrete more phosphorus (thereby helping to create a more favorable ratio of calcium to phosphorus in your blood). If there is too much PTH released from your parathyroid glands, however, you may end up removing too much calcium from your bones and leaving too much in your blood, compromising both your cardiovascular health and your bone health. Vitamin D deficiency is a key risk factor for overproduction of PTH, and optimal levels of vitamin D are associated with healthy parathyroid function and desirable PTH levels. Like PTH, vitamin D helps your intestines absorb more calcium from your food, and it also helps your kidneys hang on to calcium. But unlike PTH, vitamin D also helps your kidneys retain phosphorus. The two hormones work together in order to assure proper balances of calcium and phosphorus in your bloodstream and in your bones. PTH also triggers the conversion of hydroxyvitamin D into dihydroxyvitamin D (the hormonally active form). . Regulation of immune function : Vitamin D plays a critical role in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and numerous other autoimmune conditions. There are vitamin D receptors (VDRs) on your immune system's macrophage and dendritic cells. When triggered by vitamin D, macrophage cells are capable of releasing antibacterial peptides (parts of protein) like cathelicidin, and these antibacterial proteins play a critical role in your immune system's prevention of infection, including tuberculosis and leprosy. Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for these diseases. . Regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular health : Vitamin D plays a direct role in regulating your blood pressure by inhibiting the activity of a system called the renin-angiotensin system, which helps increase your blood pressure whenever it gets too low. The renin-angiostensin system increases your blood pressure by helping your body retain sodium and water (providing more fluid in your blood vessels) and by causing your blood vessels to constrict, thereby increasing the pressure inside them. You need optimal levels of vitamin D to hold this system in check, and to prevent it from raising your blood pressure under inappropriate circumstances. Vitamin D deficiency is a significant risk factor for high blood pressure, including during pregnancy (pre-ecclampsia). When vitamin D is deficient in your body and PTH is released in inappropriately large amounts, too much calcium can accumulate in your cells. Too much calcium in your heart tissue is a problem associated with increased risk of oxidative stress and tissue damage. The ability of heart tissue to heal after an event like heart attack depends on an optimal amount of vitamin D. . Regulation of insulin and blood sugar : Vitamin D plays an important role in the regulation of insulin metabolism and blood sugar balance. Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, and vitamin D levels have been associated with insulin secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas as well as insulin activity after it's released into the bloodstream. When vitamin D deficiency leads to release of large amounts of PTH, too much calcium can accumulate in your cells. When too much calcium accumulates in fat cells, they can produce too much cortisol, a hormone that counteracts the effectiveness of insulin. Similarly, too much accumulation of calcium in your fat and muscle cells can inhibit the formation of a protein called GLUT-4, which helps carry sugar (glucose) out of your bloodstream and into your cells, whenever insulin directs it to do so. Without sufficient vitamin D, too little GLUT-4 is formed, and insulin lacks one of the tools it needs to do its job. . Regulation of muscle composition and muscle function : Vitamin D deficiency plays a key role in preventing muscle weakness and falls, especially in older adults. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with too much accumulation of fat throughout muscle tissue, in such a way that muscle strength is decreased and physical performance is compromised, independent of muscle mass. Because vitamin D is a key regulator of calcium metabolism, and calcium is known to play a key role in nerve firing and nerve triggering of muscle contraction, vitamin D may have a broader role in reducing risk of falls. . Prevention of cancer : Vitamin D regulates several genes and cellular processes related to cancer progression, and vitamin D provides powerful protection against common cancers, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and rectal cancer. About 75% of women with breast cancer are vitamin D deficient. A 2009 analysis revealed that women in the highest vitamin D range reduced their risk of breast cancer by 45%. Another 2009 review found that sufficient vitamin D levels were associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Even after diagnosis with colorectal cancer, higher vitamin D levels are associated with reduced mortality. Cancers of the prostate, pancreas, lung, and endometrium are also associated with vitamin D insufficiency. ( Full Answer )

What are the benefits of vitamin E?
Alpha-tocopherol activates an essential phase II detoxification protein and directly increases the activity of phase II detoxification enzymes. Gamma-tocopherol exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, so it may protect your heart better than the alpha-tocopherol found in most supplements. Gamma-tocopher…ol is also highly attracted to the nucleus in your cells, which is the site where mutations in your genetic code can promote the development of cancer. Gamma- and delta-tocopherol appear to kill cancer cells by interrupting the synthesis of sphingolipid, a fatty molecule in cell membranes that acts as a signaling messenger to modulate events inside the cell. Both types, as well as alpha tocopherol, are naturally present in foods rich in vitamin E, which include a number of greens (mustard greens, turnip greens, spinach, collards, and kale), sunflower seeds, and almonds. Vitamin E can: . Prevent oxidative stress : Vitamin E helps prevent oxidative stress by working together with vitamin C, glutathione, selenium, and niacin to prevent oxygen molecules from becoming too reactive. Vitamin E also maintains the integrity of cell membranes by protecting them from harmful oxygen free radicals. Vitamin E may be the most important member of this oxidative stress-preventing group. Vitamin E especially helps prevent the oxidation of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), two essential omega-3 fatty acids. It is one of the most efficient chain-breaking antioxidants available, and it is a primary defender against oxidation and lipid peroxidation, which is the creation of unstable molecules containing more oxygen than is usual. Vitamin E may protect against cardiovascular disease by defending against low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad" cholesterol) oxidation and artery-clogging plaque formation. . Support healthy skin : Vitamin E allows reactive molecules to strike your cells without causing damage. This "lightening rod" function of vitamin E is particularly apparent in your skin, because vitamin E directly protects your skin from ultraviolet radiation. Vitamin E applied to your skin can prevent UV damage. When your diet contains vitamin E-rich foods, vitamin E can travel to your skin cell membranes and exert this same protective effect. . Protect against bladder cancer : One of the benefits of making foods rich in vitamin E a part of your healthy way of eating is an up to 50% reduction in risk of developing bladder cancer. Bladder cancer, which kills 12,500 Americans annually, is the fourth leading cancer killer among men, and is four times more common in men than women. . Protect against prostate cancer : Gamma-tocopherol, particularly in combination with other forms of vitamin E such as delta-tocopherol, causes androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells to self-destruct within 3 days of treatment by interrupting sphingolipid's synthesis, while leaving healthy cells unaffected. Alpha-tocopherol alone (the kind in most supplements) did not have this effect. . Prevent Alzheimer's disease : A high intake of vitamin E from food, but not from supplements (which usually contain just alpha-tocopherol) is also inversely associated with Alzheimer's disease. . Lower cholesterol: The tocotrienols inhibit cholesterol synthesis and lower blood cholesterol. . Assist in cell signaling : Vitamin E may help transfer chemical information from one cell to another, or across different structures inside of a cell. This transfer of chemical information is referred to as "cell signaling," and many researchers believe that cell signaling cannot accurately take place without the help of vitamin E. Vitamin E in oil form used topically can aid in the prevention of scaring. It can however make skin more prone to bruising. ( Full Answer )

What are the benefits of vitamin C?
Vitamin c helps prevent colds and other infections, speeds up the healing of wounds and keeps the blood vessels, teeth and skin healthy. Vitamin C hydrates your body and increases your metabolism, leading to weight loss and healthy blood sugar levels. You need it to form bones, muscles, blood ve…ssels and other supporting cells and tissues. In fact, vitamin C so critical that almost all animals can make it in their cells. Higher-order primates (including humans), guinea pigs, most bats, and some birds and fish are some of the few animals that cannot synthesize vitamin C and need to consume it in their daily diets. Vitamin C can: . Support strong cells and tissues : Your body uses vitamin C to produce collagen. Without vitamin C, your bones, muscles, blood vessels, gums, mucous membranes, corneas, joints, and other supporting cells and tissues would be too unstable to perform their functions, and you would develop symptoms of scurvy. Nobel prize winners Linus Pauling and G. C. Willis have asserted that chronic, long-term, low blood levels of vitamin C ("chronic scurvy") is a cause of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Vitamin C also helps relieve stiff joints and promotes wound healing. . Help protect cells from free radical damage : Vitamin C protects your body by functioning as an antioxidant and preventing oxygen-based damage to your cells. It acts primarily in cellular fluid, combating free-radical formation caused by pollution and cigarette smoke. It also helps return vitamin E to its active form. Structures that contain fat (like the lipoprotein molecules that carry fat around your body) are particularly dependent on vitamin C for protection. In addition, vitamin C boosts your body's production of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant. . Lower your cancer risk : Antioxidants such as vitamin C help prevent cancer growth by neutralizing volatile oxygen free radical molecules and preventing damage to your DNA that can lead to cancer. Vitamin C also destabilizes a tumor's ability to grow under oxygen-starved conditions. High vitamin C intakes are correlated with low rates of cancer, particularly cancers of the mouth, larynx, and esophagus. . Regenerate your vitamin E supplies : Although vitamin E is an antioxidant, it can become oxidized when it interacts with a free radical, therefore creating more oxidative damage. But vitamin C can interact with oxidized vitamin E, reducing free radicals and regenerating the benefits of vitamin E. . Improve iron and calcium absorption : Vitamin C binds with plant forms of iron, increasing its stability and solubility and helping to transport it to your intestines so it can be absorbed. Non-heme iron combined with ascorbic acid is more readily absorbed through the mucus membranes of your intestines. Calcium also needs an acidic environment for absorption, and the presence of ascorbic acid helps you absorb it. . Support your immune system : A strong immune system is vital in preventing all kinds of diseases, from the common cold to cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Your immune system relies on a wide variety of mechanisms to help protect your body from infection, including white blood cells, complement proteins, and interferons, and vitamin C is especially important in the function of these immune components. Vitamin C boosts your body's production of gultathione, a powerful antioxidant that also helps create lymphocytes, the cells of your immune system, which keep your body's defenses strong and produce antibodies. Vitamin C protects your phagocytes and T-lymphocytes against free radicals formed during the interaction of these immune system cells with harmful microorganisms. The T-cells and other phagocytes engulf the microorganisms and use oxygen in the form of superoxides to destroy them. These superoxides can be harmful to the phagocytes themselves. Vitamin C protects them against the free radicals and thereby maintains the integrity of these cells. A deficiency of vitamin C hampers this immune function and results in early destruction of the T-cells and phagocytes. Vitamin C decreases the duration of the common cold and helps prevent lung infections. . Eliminate toxins : Vitamin C is critical during the first phase of your body's detoxification process, which occurs in many types of tissue, but it is especially active in your liver. When your body is exposed to toxins, vitamin C is often required for your body to begin processing the toxins for elimination. Vitamin C boosts your body's production of gultathione, a powerful antioxidant that also helps your liver eliminate toxins. . Act as an antihistamine : Vitamin C prevents histamine release and increases the detoxification of histamine. ( Full Answer )

Those you would want to take in the morning. You should also take into consideration whether you need to take your vitamins with food or on an empty stomach.
