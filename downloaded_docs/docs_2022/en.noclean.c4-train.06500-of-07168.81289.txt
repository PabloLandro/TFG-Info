Vitamin C: Can it prevent colds?
By Mayo Clinic Staff
In most cases, vitamin C supplements won't help prevent colds. However, taking vitamin C before the onset of cold symptoms may shorten the duration of symptoms. Vitamin C may provide benefit for people at high risk of colds due to frequent exposure: for example, children who attend group child care during the winter.
