Methanol (wood alcohol) is highly poisonous. Comparing to ethanol, is it more or less sedative?
more sedative
the same
less sedative
that depends on the temperature
Methanol has a much weaker sedative effect than ethanol, which leads the victim to drink more than it would normally do with ethanol. Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde and then to the poisonous formic acid in the liver.
