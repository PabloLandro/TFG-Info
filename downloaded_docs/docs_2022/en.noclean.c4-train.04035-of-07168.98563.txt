Description:
﻿A unique formula featuring Verisol® bioactive collagen peptides, hyaluronic acid, L-tryptophan, L-glutamine, vitamin C, and biotin – essential nutrients that promote healthy skin and connective tissues, reduce joint pain associated with osteoarthritis, and support lean muscle growth and recovery after a workout. Hydrolyzed collagen promotes collagen synthesis and has been shown to help reduce joint pain associated with osteoarthritis. Collagen and hyaluronic acid work together to provide structure, strength, and resilience in the body’s tissues, and are vital for maintaining hydration in the joints. This formula also supports muscle growth and recovery, helping physically active people to build lean muscle mass. Collagen can also help reduce visible signs of aging, such as wrinkles and fine lines, and together the nutrients in Total Body Collagen support wound healing, immune function, antioxidant activity, and nutrient metabolism, with benefits for skin, hair, and nails.
