GLAD IT HELPS FOR YOU, BUT IT DOES NOT DO A DARN THING FOR ME OTHER TO WASTE MY MONEY. IVE HAD 44 JOINT REPLACEMENTS, I LIVE ON MAJOR PAIN MEDS, WHICH IS WHAT GETS ME OUT OF PAIN AND IM ON RA DRUGS WHICH KEEPS THE INFLAMMATION DOWN, WHICH IS WHAT ONE NEEDS.

Wow, this is good to know. Thanks for the warning. My Mom (who is no longer with us) had OA and she tried WD 40 but it didn't help her either.

I think it would work about as well as Aspercream. I tried the Aspercream years ago when I was a teen, it did nothing except make it easier to rub down that area. At 14 I had better releif from Liquid Heet.
Be careful with some of these at home remedies. Some times they can be more dangerous then you know in the long run.

Oh yes, some of these &quot;wives tales&quot; can have side effects that might not show up until further down the track. Unless it can be proved to be safe it's &quot;buyer (in this case user) beware&quot;. I don't think I would give it a go. But then I have a lot of adverse reactions to most of the ointments and creams that are used for pain. Sigh, such is life.

BUT.... I feel like my visits are not what they use to be. He...

I gave my 2 week notice last Friday 13th. Now to join you fine people in a life of leisure and nothing else to do but to look out for myself....is it just me or does that sound pretty boring? My goal was to live to retire and I guess having to take early retirement because of health reasons wasn't exactly the way I had planned things. I just can't stay in that building that is reeking mildew...
