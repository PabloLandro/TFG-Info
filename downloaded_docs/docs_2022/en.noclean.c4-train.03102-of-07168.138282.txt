Post OP Instructions For Tooth Extractions
DO NOT DISTURB THE WOUND: In doing so you may invite irritation, infection, and/or bleeding. Be sure to chew on the opposite side for the first 24 hours.
DO NOT SMOKE FOR 12 HOURS: Smoking will promote bleeding and interfere with healing.
BRUSHING: Do not brush your teeth for the first 8 hours after the extraction. After, you may brush gently but avoid area of surgery for 24 hours.
MOUTHWASH: Avoid rinsing for 24 hours after extraction. This is to insure the formation of a healing clot which is essential to proper wound healing. Disturbance of this clot can lead to increased bleeding or the loss of the blood clot. If the clot is lost, a painful condition called a dry socket may occur. You may use warm salt water or a mild antiseptic rinse after 24 hours.
DO NOT SUCK THROUGH A STRAW: This will promote bleeding and may dislodge the blood clot causing a dry socket.
PAIN: Some discomfort is normal after a surgical extraction. Motrin is an excellent pain reliever. Prescription medication should be taken as directed. If pain continues call our office at 404-237-0497.
BLEEDING: After the extraction, a rolled up gauze pad will be placed on the extraction site and you will be asked to change the dressing every 20 minutes or so depending on the amount of bleeding that is occurring. It is normal for some blood to ooze from area of surgery. We will give you extra gauze. Should you need to use the gauze at home, remember to roll it into a ball large enough to cover the wound. Hold it firmly in place, by biting or finger pressure, for about 20-30 minutes. You can also dampen the gauze prior to placing it in your mouth making it easier to remove later. If bleeding continues, you may fold a tea bag in half and bite down on it. The Tannic acid in the tea may help reduce bleeding.
SWELLING: To prevent swelling, apply an ice pack or a cold towel to the outside of your face in the area of the extraction during the first 12 hours. Apply alternating, 20 minutes on then 20 minutes off for an hour or longer if necessary. After 2-3 days, the swelling should begin to recede.
HEAD ELEVATION: Keep your head elevated and minimize excessive motion and try to keep your heart rate at a normal level during the first 8-12 hours after extraction.
DIET: Eat normal meals as soon as you are able after surgery. Cold, soft food such as ice cream or yogurt may be most comfortable for the first day. It is also important to drink lots of fluids.
