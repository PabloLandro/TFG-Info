Cancer, sodium bicarbonate and basic pH over pH7 - the recipe - baking soda - oxygen - blood group nutrition - 10% negative - general recommendations for prevention for a pH between pH6 and pH7
by Michael Palomino (October 2017 / March 2018) - cancer is going away! - precondition: NO chemotherapy!
Michael Palomino, portrait - sodium bicarbonate - the pH-value scheme - a sugar juice, e.g. algarrobina - a cup of sodium bicarbonate with a sugar syrup, a simple, efficient, and at the same time sweet medicine
After 2 years of healing experience with sodium bicarbonate (soda) since September 2015, the following can be said:
Cancer, sodium and basic pH value over pH7: Cancer occurs when the pH value is very acidic, this means below pH6. Cancer heals with sodium bicarbonate and sugar molasses, or with maple syrup within 10 to 12 days. The sugar opens the cancer cells, because the cancer cells want the sugar. At the same time the sodium bicarbonate comes in and destroys the cancer cells because the body becomes more and more basic up to over pH7 and in a basic body cancer cells cannot live. Every 3 days, the pH increases by one point. You can go up to pH8 and cancer disappears - any cancer goes away.
The recipe: Add 1 teaspoon of soda in 1 glass of water and add the sugar molasses / maple syrup / algarrobina - take it on an empty stomach and in the evening 2 hours after the last meal. The healing rate is 90%. The pH value in the body increases (measured soberly in the morning in the urine). In the end, pH7 is exceeded, and the body becomes basic up to pH8. In a basic body cancer cannot survive. The cancer cells are reconverted into normal cells, tumors collapse and disappear. Metastases also disappear. This cure with sodium bicarbonate is lasting 10 to 12 days, not more. Cancer disappears completely, the healing rate is 90%. You should measure soberly the pH value in the urine every 2 days - test strips are available in every pharmacy. Side effects: may occur a small diarrhea at the beginning. In the end, headache can occur but does not always.
Baking soda: instead of sodium bicarbonate you can also take baking soda, because the main ingredient of baking soda is sodium bicarbonate.
Oxygen: When pH values are rising by 1 point, the oxygen in the blood is rising ten-fold. The oxygen in the blood neutralizes pollutants and toxins in the body so that blocked organs (liver, kidneys, etc.), glands (e.g., thyroid) and nerves (brain activity) will function normally again.
Blood Group Nutrition: At the same time, the blood group nutrition of Dr. D'Adamo should be introduced, so that the pH in the body never goes below pH6. In normal life the pH should be between pH6 and pH7, so that the uric acid is excreted well. A high pH (e.g. pH8) can be normalized with raw vegetables (steamed vegetables, homemade apple compote without sugar, with full grain rice without salt).
NO CHEMOTHERAPY: Precondition for a fast cure of cancer with sodium bicarbonate is: you must NOT perform any chemotherapy. Chemotherapy destroys the entire organism. A sodium bicarbonate cure of cancer AFTER chemotherapy lasts several months. In this case, sodium bicarbonate with sugar molasses / maple syrup is applied once a month, maintaining pH8 for 3 days. For the rest of the month, blood group nutrition will be applied, possibly supported by the intake of coconut oil and bitter apricot kernels. Probably some organs also need a special treatment with natural medicine.
10% negative: the healing method with sodium bicarbonate + sugar molasses or maple syrup etc. is the cheapest method. But 10% of people do not react to sodium bicarbonate, or there are negative reactions such as potbelly or severe headaches. These people can cure their cancer with other natural remedies: take bitter apricot kernels (20 daily, kills cancer cells), or cure with cannabis oil (special doctor), or with blood group nutrition from Dr. D'Adamo (pH value is rising slowly). If you have cancer and have an overweight at the same time, noni can cure its cancer (this is a fruit extract from the tropics, tastes of cheese) that simultaneously reduces overweight and appetite.
General nutrition tips for prevention for a pH value between pH6 and pH7
-- Always live according to blood group nutrition (in a healthy state the diet may contain 20% negative food)
-- It must be all whole grain (whole grain bread, whole grain rice)
-- Always chew well: 20 to 30 times (because the digestion and the intake of vitamins and minerals begins with the saliva)
-- Olive oil maintains joints and circulation: in salads, and when the dish is served: over vegetables, rice, steamed potatoes, in sauces, in soups
-- Ginger reduces internal inflammation, muscle pain, nourishes the brain, strengthens the immune system in winter
-- Eat meat at most twice a week, and fish also at most twice a week
-- Drink 1 to 2 liters of pure water per day, because water contains oxygen (variations: with lemon, lemon water, chamomile, peppermint)
-- Always cook food in the steam of a little bit of water, do not fry food in oil
-- Not use much salt, and use honey instead of refined sugar (refined sugar weakens the immune system)
-- Eat light meals in the summer, eat strong food in winter (potatoes and corn for more energy in winter)
-- NO white bread, NO white rice (because the body thinks he has eaten something, but minerals are missing, which he then gets from the bones)
-- NO tins (no vitamins, no minerals)
-- NO Lemonades (contain citric acid, is corrosive, destroys the body)
-- NO food with citric acid (is corrosive, destroys the body)
-- DO NOT eat fried food (fried oil is a heay charge for the complete body)
-- DO NOT eat too sharp food (destroys the gastrointestinal tract)
-- DO NOT eat strong food in the summer (potatoes, corn), otherwise it will become overweight.
Further data on cures with sodium are given in the data collection from the book by Dr. Sircus.
So: Everybody can heal cancer himself / herself - do not worry - and NEVER go to the hospital or to a pills doctor!
