Vaccines and Pregnancy: The Criminal Conspiracy to Create Autism
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D, CTTH The CDC has been given an annual budget of over $11 billion dollars to spend (R), which is provided under the auspices of protecting the American public from various health care threats, but are they really doing that? There’s plenty of incriminating data available to prove that they’re doing just the opposite of that. Consider the following facts: 1) Executives within the CDC, including Dr. Frank DeStefano, are alleged to have cooked research data in order to conceal a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in black children, according to Dr. William Thompson, who has been given whistleblower protection status for bringing this fact to light. The study in question was published in 2004 in the Journal of Pediatrics, and has not been retracted despite the admission by Dr. Thompson that the paper is fraudulent. This is highly important since many pro-vaccination pediatricians will point to this study as “proof” that the MMR vaccine doesn’t cause autism, and is therefore “safe and...

Inflammatory Disease Epidemic: The Convergence Point of EMF, GMOs, and Vaccines.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D, CTTH The US spends more per capita on healthcare than any other nation on the planet(R), at over $1 Trillion/year with costs growing. Over 3/4 of those costs are related to the treatment of chronic disease, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, diabetes, alzheimers, autism, cadiovascular disease, etc.(R) The rates of all such diseases are growing, not decreasing, so obviously the true causes of these problems aren’t being addressed. If you were to try and describe virtually all forms of degenerative disease with just one word, that word would be “inflammation”. (R) The research is very clear about this fact. When examining the prime factors behind the surge in inflammatory issues there are principally 3 things that stand out as different about today versus 25 years ago. Those 3 things are the widespread consumption of RoundUp laden genetically modified food and wheat (R)(R), wireless technology (R), and a surge in the number of vaccines given relative to years past (R). The biological effects of...

VERY IMPORTANT! Yet another research scientist comes forward describing the links between vaccines and chronic illness, including autism.
Around August 2014, information came out revealing that a whistleblower had proof that the CDC was actively cooking data to conceal the link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This ongoing story continues to be one of the most censored and important health stories today. I originally reported on this subject here. Now, we have another whistleblower on the scene. Dr Judy Mikovits, PhD is a Biochemist, cellular and molecular biologist with over 30 years of scientific expertise. She has directed programs on HIV, cancer, epigenetics, and neuroimmune disease, with a focus on development of novel drug and diagnostic technologies. Dr. Mikovits holds a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from George Washington University. Her dissertation was on HIV latency and mechanisms of immune activation in monocytes. Dr. Mikovits was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Molecular Virology at the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, National Cancer Institute under Dr. David Derse. Over the past 26 years, she has published 51 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, and worked as a government scientist...

Mandatory Vaccines for Californians: A Prelude To Mandatory Vaccines for ALL Americans
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D., CTTH Those who value freedom of choice and the right of self determination were dealt a major setback in California recently with the passage SB277, which awaits Governor Jerry Brown’s signature for passage. Governor Brown is expected to sign it, despite heavy opposition. SB 277 is a law that removes personal and religious exemptions from those who wish to avoid vaccinations for their children enrolled in public schools. Only MD’s may provide exemptions, and the list for who shall receive said exemptions is very limited. Proponents of the bill argue that parents will still be able to choose not to vaccinate their children, they’ll just have to homeschool or send them to private schools. Tax rebates for those who won’t be using the government services (public schools) will not be issued. How many low income families can afford not to have both parents work, or can afford to send their children to private schools? Obviously, this affects the lower income population more so than...

Rope Worm: Are Millions of People Suffering from a Parasitic Infection Unrecognized by the World of Parasitology?
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D.,CTTH Caution: Do not read this while eating a meal. Doing so may be hazardous to your digestion. In previous posts, I have discussed the problem of parasites. The key points I have raised relate to the overall imprecision of standardized parasitic testing, where research suggests that under the best of conditions seasoned parasitologists could only accurately identify relatively common parasitic infections about 60% of the time.(R) This “high” rate of accuracy was only obtained following the rarely used “gold standard” of triple stool collection analysis. Most hospitals and clinics reportedly utilize single stool collection sampling, or a swab test, which is estimated to be far less accurate than the triple stool collection. Such poor analysis does not even take into account parasites such as strongyloides stercoralis, trichinella spiralis, or other parasites which spend very little time within the lower digestive systems of those they infect, thus further decreasing the probability of finding them with a stool test.(R)(R) Even with this relatively poor rate...

Chickens Dying From Bird Flu- Is A Virus or Monsanto to Blame?
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D.,CTTH On May 1st, 2015 Iowa Governor declared a state of emergency after a number of chicken farms were experiencing an outbreak of bird flu, which led to the culling of millions of chickens as a precautionary measure to curb the outbreak. Naturally, the mainstream media is hyping a possibility of the bird flu virus jumping over and leading to a pandemic for the human population. Predictably, the same mainstream media is also crying out for the need of a “vaccine” to protect the birds. There’s a very important message here that everybody needs to understand. Noticeably absent from the reporting on the bird flu chicken farm outbreak is a characterization of the farming practices for the conventionally raised chickens, or a report of an outbreak on an organic farm. The outbreak is clearly occurring on factory farms, where the chickens live in close quarters and are fed non-organic feed that undoubtedly has Monsanto’s RoundUp residue within it (1). In case you didn’t know, the...

Melatonin: Why Supplementation May Be Essential In A Monsanto and Wireless World
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. In my previous posts (1)(2)(3) related to the inflammatory condition known as “microglial activation” I mentioned that the microglia have been found to exist primarily in two different states, “surveillance state” and “activation state”. The beneficial “surveillance mode” is where the microglia clean up debris in the nervous system, fight infections, and build neural connections. The harmful mode is where the microglia shift into an “activation” state and secrete toxic substances which break down the nervous system. Minimizing this shift into the activation mode appears to be central to preventing all forms of neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, non-situational depression, etc. It is recommended that you read my other posts on microglial activation and its relation to chronic infections, diet, and vaccines to gain a true appreciation for its significance to overall health. Research indicates that the shift from the surveillance mode into the “activation state” is dependent on the level of “glutathione” (4), which is an antioxidant that our body produces by...

200 Evidence-Based Reasons NOT To Vaccinate – FREE Research PDF Download!
Quick Download Link Here. The media, your pediatrician, politicians and health authorities like the CDC and FDA claim that vaccines are safe and effective. So why do hundreds of peer-reviewed studies indicate the opposite is true? Read, download, and share this document widely to provide the necessary evidence-based counterbalance to the pro-vaccination propaganda that has globally infected popular consciousness and discussion like an intractable disease. It is abundantly clear that if the present-day vaccine climate, namely, that everyone must comply with the CDC’s one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule or be labeled a health risk to society at large, is to succumb to open and balanced discussion, it is the peer-reviewed biomedical evidence itself that is going to pave the way towards making rational debate on the subject happen. With this aim in mind, GreenMedInfo.com has painstakingly collected over 300 pages of study abstracts culled directly from the National Library of Medicine’s pubmed.gov bibliographic database on the wide-ranging adverse health effects linked to vaccines in the today’s schedule (over 200 distinct adverse...

Measles Hysteria: How the Government Seeks Ownership of Your Children
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. “Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship to restrict the art of healing to one class of Men and deny equal privileges to others; the Constitution of the Republic should make a Special privilege for medical freedoms as well as religious freedom.” -Benjamin Rush, MD, Founding Father of America At the time of this writing there have been 100 cases of measles reported by the CDC, affecting primarily the VACCINATED population. As of January 24th, 2015 it was reported that 52 out of 80 measles outbreak cases had been vaccinated with the measles vaccine. While there is clear evidence that some of the measles virus infections are from the vaccine itself, there is still no word yet from “officialdom” on the full extent of vaccine transmitted measles virus infections from this outbreak. In a more sane world, one would expect that a careful analysis of what strain of measles virus is...

Synergistic Destruction: How Vaccines and GMOs Converge to Fuel Autism and Neurodegenerative Conditions
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. There is a lot of debate as to what is the cause, or better yet, causes of autism. This post isn’t intended to cover all of the variables which fuel autism. It is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of chief mechanisms related to how consumption of Monsanto’s RoundUp, by way of consuming genetically modified corn, soy, canola oil, sugar beets, or any other “RoundUp ready” crop, as well as vaccines may fuel microglial activation, a leading factor in all neurodegenerative conditions, including autism (1)(2)(3), Alzheimer’s(4)(5), ALS(6)(7), Parkinson’s(8)(9), non-situational depression(10)(11), and virtually all forms of chronic illness. While this post is more directed towards the discussion of autism, the reality is that all of the factors that I discuss below are unquestionably major factors of consideration in all neurodegenerative conditions. What is microglial activation? In short, the microglia are the resident immune cells within the central nervous system. They are known to exist in two different states, and while in the “surveillance...

Largest Measles Outbreak in North America Hit Quebec in 2011, where ~ 97% were “Fully Vaccinated”.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. Don’t expect to hear the mainstream media discussing this, as it exposes the failure of the vaccination policy that they love to support. Certainly, they never like to talk about how measles was disappearing prior to the introduction of the vaccine, nor do they like to discuss how the public perception of measles was prior to the vaccine propaganda kicked into high gear thanks to the total immunity that is given to vaccine manufacturers here in the United States. ‘The largest measles epidemic in North America in the last decade, occurred in 2011 in Quebec, Canada, where rates of 1- and 2-dose (MMR) vaccine coverage among children 3 years of age were 95%-97%, with 3%-5% unvaccinated.‘ Largest measles epidemic in North America in a decade–Quebec, Canada, 2011: contribution of susceptibility, serendipity, and superspreading events/PubMed Read full study here ...

Monsanto: Explaining the Autism/Parasite Connection
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. If you were to do research into alternative therapies that appear to be providing clear results to the autistic community, you’d be hard pressed to find anything as impressive as the results that people are finding in using a protocol that Kerri Rivera has put together. Kerri Rivera is the author of “Healing the Symptoms Known As Autism”, and the mother of an autistic son. A core component to her protocol, which has reportedly documented over 160 outright cures of autism in the last 3 years, is an extensive protocol for dealing with parasites. I encourage anybody interested in autism to read her book and take note of the results she has documented. In a previous blog post, I discussed the problem that parasites represent to those of us dealing with the conventional health model. When you realize that the established gold standard triple stool sample test for parasitic diagnostics fails to identify parasites better than 60% of the time, even when the parasites...

How Monsanto is Destroying the Brains and Health of Everyone.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. Interested in slowing your aging process? Take note! One of my most recent blog entries(1) summarized roughly 10 years of research related to the consequences of inflammatory processes in the periphery of the body, such as the gut, and how this was driving brain degenerative inflammatory processes within the brain. One of the key findings from that research was how pathogenic bacterial waste products known as “lipopolysaccharides” , (LPS) would trigger an immune response, and this immune response would then trigger the brains immune cells, the microglia, to become overly active and degrade brain cells. (LPS is basically small parts of the cell wall of the bad bacteria.) This response is called “microglial activation”. You’ll be hearing a lot more about it over the next 10 -20 years, because stopping this overactivation is central to correcting all degenerative neurological conditions, including Alzheimers, Autism, Anxiety, ALS, Insomnia, non-situational Depression, MS, and many endocrine system disorders including the unbiquitous adrenal and thyroid disorders that so many...

Study Shows Vaccines Increase the Rate of Death in Infancy
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. The prime argument that proponents of vaccination use it that mass vaccination prevents disease, and those who oppose vaccination are often portrayed as “unscientific” and, even worse, “unfit” to be parents by the mainstream media. Despite the many requests over the years for the CDC to perform a large scale study comparing the health status of the non-vaccinated against the vaccinated, the CDC has refused to do so. My personal belief is that they won’t do it, because they know what the results would be, and that is, the unvaccinated would be shown to have far less chronic illness than the vaccinated. Smaller studies (1), which are conveniently ignored by the mainstream media, support the notion that the unvaccinated population is a healthier population. Full exposure of this information, which would come from a large scale CDC study, would have a crushing blow on the vaccination industry. It would be a landmark study which helped shape the entire health care field, there’s...

How low grade infections fuel brain degeneration,depression, alzheimers, and more.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. If you’ve worked with me before, you know that I emphasize the need for good gut health if somebody is ever to truly be well. Chronic low grade infections which exist in all forms of chronic illness, particularly when it comes to the gut, are commonly overlooked or under-diagnosed in the general population. One of the primary reasons for this is the poor sensitivity that exists for identifying gut infections, in particular parasitic infections. As I have detailed before (1), false negatives for parasites occur at least 40% of the time when the current “gold standard” testing for gut and parasitic infections are used. That means about half the people who have obvious symptoms of parasitic infections, never get the appropriate diagnosis and treatment and are therefore ultimately directed down the broken and deadly conveyer belt of the current medical model. They ultimately end up sicker than when they started, as their bodies become increasingly damaged by the parasites and the toxic medications which...

Ebola: Strategies for Readiness
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. A number of people have been asking me for my opinion on the Ebola situation, so if you’re wondering what I think, here it is… First of all, whenever the mainstream media gets all riled up in a frenzy over a particular issue, particularly when it’s disease related, call me a cynic, but I look at the information with a great deal of skepticism. Why? Do remember the swine flu “pandemic” of 2009, where millions if not billions of people were going to die, according to the World Health Organization? What about the West Nile virus that was going to kill everybody in years past? How about SARS? It’s never ending with these people, and when you realize that vaccines represent big money for vaccine manufacturers, who are exempt from liability for harm in their products (1), you can see why they continually promote the fear in attempt to sell billions of dollars worth of vaccines. Is there any other product that exists where...

The debate is over: The MMR vaccine can cause Autism, and the CDC is engaged in a criminal conspiracy to cover up this fact.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. For years, proponents of vaccines have claimed that there was no evidence showing a direct link between vaccines and autism, despite the mountain of evidence which contradicted their claims.(1) The proponents of vaccines would cite studies published in the Journal of Pediatrics which appeared to refute any link between vaccines and autism, and even more vociferously deny any link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, ultimately ruining the career of Dr. Andrew Wakefield over his findings of a link between autism and MMR in a very heavy media smear campaign. Well, we now have proof that the chief authors of the 2004 study, including executives within the CDC, which alleged no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, conspired to cook the data, in order to deny the link. How do we know that? One of the authors, Dr. William Thompson, of the Journal of Pediatrics 2004 research paper which alleged no link between MMR and autism has come forward and...
