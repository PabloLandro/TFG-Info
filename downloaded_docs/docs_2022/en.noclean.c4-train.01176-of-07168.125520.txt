Extract of sample "Discussing the controversy of vaccines and their potential link to disease such as autism"
Download file to see previous pages This however has left a fear in parents of vaccinating their children. There has been a lot of research and information put forward since then to allay these fears. The conclusion of all the research done is that there is no empirical evidence to show a direct link between vaccine and autism. On the contrary there are more reports providing sufficient proof that vaccines are safe. It is understandable however that parents will remain skeptical and concerned.
The major ingredient in these vaccines that has been cited as a possibility for causing autism is thimerosal. Multidose vaccines posed a potential threat of contamination to children many years ago. Thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, was therefore added to vaccines at low concentrations in the 1930s to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth and to protect the immunized from infections at the site of the immunization. However it is a mercury-based preservative. But it contains ethylmercury and not methylmercury. There have been no existing guidelines for the safe amount of ethylmercury in the human body and so the guidelines for methylmercury were used on the false assumption that the body handles them both in the same way. This led to confusion, believing that ethylmercury would have the same possibly harmful effects on humans as methylmercury.
Around the same time a report from the California Department of Developmental Services indicated a rise in autism over the years which was later described as an epidemic. (Weber, 2008). This led to even firmer belief by some parents that there was a connection between the vaccines and autism, although there was still no scientific proof. As Weber states “A report in 2004 by the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no association between autism and MMR vaccine, or between autism and thimerosal” She further states that, “there is no conclusive evidence that any vaccine or vaccine additive increases the risk of ...Download file to see next pagesRead More

Refuting the Link between Autism and Vaccines
...? Refuting the Autism-Vaccine Link Amber Calixto Nevada College Refuting the Autism-Vaccine Link Vaccines containing mercury were found to have harmful effects on the human nervous system; as a result there has been constant effort to avoid using it as a preservative in vaccines for children. With this being said, there was no evidence of vaccines with mercury causing Autism or having a link with Autism until Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British Gastroenterologist, published an article in The Lancet, pointing a link between the MMR...

Vaccines
...?Vaccines A vaccine is termed as a biological preparation which helps in making immunity stronger against a certain disease or the disease-causing organism (Bona and Bonilla, 1996). Vaccines are in a way similar to the disease causing agent or micro-organism, since they are derived from killed or weakened forms of the organisms. Vaccines stimulate the immune system of the body and helps it recognize the agent as a pathogen or foreign, hence destroying it (Bona and Bonilla, 1996). Vaccines do not offer complete protection of the body against a certain disease; therefore, it is important to...

...are: “What if the risks aren't simple, immediate reactions to the vaccine, like getting a light case of the illness it's intended to prevent? What if the risks involve subtler damage to the immune or nervous system?” (Weiss and Hale) While vaccines have greatly improved the odds of human survival, risks remain: “The tetanus vaccine is known to cause severe nervous reactions in one person out of 100,000, and severe allergic reactions in one person out of each million.” (Izakson) Some of the ingredients used to make vaccines are also being looked into, for their potential to cause health problems. Early life vaccination has been correlated...

...children who are diagnosed with ASD show excellence in music, art, visual skills, and math (Folstein & Piven, 1991). This paper seeks to discuss autism. The roots of autism seem to be in the very early development of brain. However, most of the obvious autism signs and symptoms appear at the age of 2 and 3. In the United States, autism statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that 1 out of 88 children in America are on autism spectrum; this is a 10 fold increase of autism prevalence within 40 years. Further studies show that this increase can only be explained partly by...

Vaccines as possible cause for autism
...." While much of the research has focused on the GABA system, it is clear that other genes are also involved. The thinking among the experts is that as few as 10 separate genes and as many as 100 may play a role in autism. All agree, however, that the newly reported findings could advance the search for earlier diagnostic tests and autism treatments." (web page) The other controversial factor in the research of the disorder is the role of vaccines as a cause of autism. According to Rudy (2006) qtd in About.com "There are two theories that link autism and vaccines. The first theory suggests that the MMR...

...quite justify this. “Formaldehyde (used in embalming), Thimerosal (nearly 50 percent mercury), aluminum phosphate (toxic and carcinogenic), antibiotics, phenols (corrosive to tissue and neurotoxic), methanol (toxic), isopropyl (toxic), live viruses and a host of unknown components considered off limits. These are just part of the mixture.” [OMe03]. This vaccine is injected into the body of an hours old child and with a number of more visits. This is the main reason why the vaccine come as top of the list cause of autism. The continued use of thimerosal in preserving vaccines is the more reason why eye brows are raised. Mercury is believed to have a link...

...and doctors who might not wish to tarnish their public image. Reporting the serious errors made by physicians and making these reports public might have a number of economic disadvantages for hospitals and doctors who might start recording decreased numbers of persons seeking medical services from them. Government Bureaucracy: Government bureaucracy might potentially become a barrier to the elimination of some of the state mandates as the elimination of these mandates might take longer than necessary. This might potentially be based on the premise that the removal of some of these mandates might take a considerable amount of time as policymakers’ debate on them. In the resolution of the...

...as autism, diabetes, paralysis, etc., have no grounds and still need profound research. The vaccines conservatives, which could cause the increase of these diseases are no longer included into the formulations. But it is no doubt that the significant decrease of most dangerous infections has happened due to the active application of vaccines in early childhood. Of course, the question of closer control over childrens health should be discussed, as any vaccination should be preceded by the thorough examination of every child for the subject of possible allergic reactions. But the questions as for are childhood...

...of the world with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $181.3 billion, as on April, 2013 (OECD, 2013). Background Analysis Taxation in New Zealand is a vast and complex phenomenon. Since 1980, the country is going through significant tax reform programs for the purpose of restructuring its marginal tax rate system.
