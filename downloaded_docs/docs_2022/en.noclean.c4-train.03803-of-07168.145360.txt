FAQ About Morphine
Q) What is Morphine?
A) Morphine is a narcotic analgesic. Morphine was first isolated from opium in 1805 by a German pharmacist, Wilhelm Sertürner. Sertürner described it as the Principium Somniferum. He named it morphium - after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. Today morphine is isolated from opium in substantially larger quantities - over 1000 tons per year - although most commercial opium is converted into codeine by methylation. On the illicit market, opium gum is filtered into morphine base and then synthesized into heroin.
Q) How is Morphine used?
A) Morphine can be taken orally in tablet form, and can also injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; the last is the route preferred by those who are dependent on morphine.
Q) What are the side effects of Morphine?
A)
anxiety
involuntary movement of the eyeball
blurred vision / double vision
constipation
"pinpoint" pupils chills
depressed or irritable mood
itching cramps
dizziness
rash diarrhea
drowsiness
rigid muscles inability to urinate
exaggerated sense of well-being

flaccid muscles
fluid in the lungs
lowered blood pressure
"pinpoint" or dilated pupils
sleepiness
stupor
coma
slowed breathing
slow pulse rate
Q) What is Morphine addiction?
A) Morphine is highly addictive. Tolerance (the need for higher and higher doses to maintain the same effect) and physical and psychological dependence develop quickly. Withdrawal from morphine causes nausea, tearing, yawning, chills, and sweating lasting up to three days. Morphine crosses the placental barrier, and babies born to morphine-using mothers go through withdrawal.
Addictive drugs activate the brains reward systems. The promise of reward is very intense, causing the individual to crave the drug and to focus his or her activities around taking the drug. The ability of addictive drugs to strongly activate brain reward mechanisms and their ability to chemically alter the normal functioning of these systems can produce an addiction. Drugs also reduce a persons level of consciousness, harming the ability to think or be fully aware of present surroundings.
Q) What are possible drug interactions when using Morphine?
A)
Alcohol
Certain analgesics such as Talwin, Nubain, Stadol, and Buprenex
Drugs that control vomiting, such as Compazine and Tigan
Drugs classified as MAO inhibitors, such as the antidepressants Nardil and Parnate
Major tranquilizers such as Thorazine and Haldol
Muscle relaxants such as Flexeril and Valium
Sedatives such as Dalmane and Halcion
Tranquilizers such as Librium and Xanax
Water pills such as Diuril and Lasix
