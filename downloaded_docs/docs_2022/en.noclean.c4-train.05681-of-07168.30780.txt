About UTI( Urinary Tract Infection), and its Treatment Information
Urinary tract infection is caused by bacteria in one of the tracts through which urine passes. The infection can occur in the urethra, ureters, or the urinary bladder. Women are mostly affected due to UTI than men, but no specific reason has been found out till date. Men can also be affected by UTI with the infection causing greater level of discomfort. Urinary tract infections initially develop in the lower urinary tract which involves the urethra, and the urinary bladder. If UTI in the lower uriniary tract is not treated properly, then the infection can progress to the upper urinary tract which involves the ureters and kidneys.
One of the common urinary tract infections is bladder infection. Cystitis is the other name for bladder infection. Urethritis is the name of a condition when the infection occurs in the urethra. Pyelonephritis is the name of a condition when the infection occurs in the kidneys. This type of UTI requires urgent treatment, as it can lead to the malfunctioning of the kidneys and can also lead to death if not treated properly. A type of bacteria called Escherichia coli (E. coli) which normally lives in the colon, is one of the major cause of most of the urinary tract infections. Chlamydia and Mycoplasma are some of the other micro-organisms that causes UTIs in both men and women. Usually these micro-organisms cause urinary tract infections in the urethra and reproductive system only.
Some of the common symptoms of urinary tract infections include a frequent urge to urinate and a painful, burning feeling in the area of the bladder or urethra during urination. Sometimes, lotions that are used to get quick errection and better sex spermicidal condoms can lead to irritation. Also, feeling an uncomfortable pressure above the pubic bone is one of the symptoms of urinary tract infection in women. Experiencing fullness in the rectum is one of the symptoms of urinary tract infection in men. One of the other symptoms of urinary tract infection is that the urine may look milky or cloudy, and reddish at times due to the presence of blood. Fever can be one of the symptoms of urinary tract infection, when the infection affects the kidneys.
