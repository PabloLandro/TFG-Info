Can One Sugary Drink Per Day Increase Your Risk Of Developing Diabetes?
May 1, 2013 /in Family Expert /by Brian McIntyre
How much sugary soda do you drink each day? Well according to a new study, just one can of sugary soda per day may significantly increase your risk of developing diabetes later in life.
According to a story on HealthCentral.com, Researchers at the Imperial College in London, say that drinking a single 12-ounce sugar-sweetened drink every day may increase the risk of diabetes by as much as 22 percent. .
This study followed 28,000 people using data from studies across eight European countries. When total energy intake and body mass index of the people were accounted for, the figure fell from 22 percent to 18 percent increased risk.
The results indicate that risk of type 2 diabetes goes beyond simply a sugary drink’s effect on body weight. Similar studies conducted with North American subjects reflected a 25 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes for each daily soft drink consumed.
By the way, this study also looked at the effects of pure fruit juice and nectar consumption. The researchers say those beverages did not appear to lead to increased risk of diabetes.
However, they say it was difficult to say for sure, given the challenge of identifying fruit juices people drink that have added sugar, as opposed to those that are 100 percent fruit juice.
Here’s one other new research finding—but this one deals with our SPIRITUAL health. Timothy Jay, a psychology professor at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, did s study on CURSING. Dr. Jay found that wwear words make up just shy of 1% of the words an average person says in a given day.
I suppose that’s good news, but here’s the NOT so good news. He also says the average child learns his or her first swear word by age 2! Ouch!
