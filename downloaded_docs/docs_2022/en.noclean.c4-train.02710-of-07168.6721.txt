What is Crystal Healing?
Crystal Healing is a natural healing method using therapeutic crystals and gemstones. For thousands of years, many cultures have used crystals for healing. The crystals and gemstones are placed on specific energy points on the body or around the body to release negative energy, congestion and emotional tension allowing the person to heal and come back into balance. Each crystal has a unique structure and healing frequency and it’s this special resonance that gives the crystal its healing power.
What are the benefits of Crystal Healing?
When the crystal is used therapeutically with focus and intent, it can help bring the body’s energy systems back into balance and stimulates the body’s natural healing processes so that a person can heal physically, emotionally and spiritually. Crystal therapy is non-invasive, gentle and restores harmony to the body and mind and as it clears away negativity, fear, depression, and disease patterns to achieve feelings of well-being and wholeness. The first known reference to the healing powers of crystals comes from an Egyptian (African) medical papyrus dated around 1600 BCE, which gives directions for their curative use and has now been revived for assisting with modern day illnesses.
Benefits Crystals can help with:
Balancing your emotional/physical/spiritual energies
Cleansing your Aura
Healing through traumatic events; heartbreak, loss, stress, relationship issues*
Opening and balancing the Chakras
Deeply relaxing and restorative
Clear energy blocks
Soothes and heals dis-ease in the body*
How does a Crystal Healing session work?
A specific crystal grid layout will be chosen for your particular needs and placed on or around the body to stimulate healing and restore balance. The session is very soothing and deeply relaxing as the crystals do their healing work. In this deep state of relaxation, stress is released allowing you to feel rejuvenated, revitalized and completely refreshed. Crystal Healing sessions last approximately 60 mins.
​
Why should someone have a Crystal Healing session?
By cleansing the aura and balancing the chakras, we can release old debris/habits/thoughts that is no longer serving us. We can then move forward in our lives with grace and ease. We can easily shed unwanted behaviors, thought patterns, and emotions, and move into a personal place of peace and contentment. Physical diseases arise due to an imbalance of the mind, body and spirit. A Crystal Healing Session can help to us to break free from that which we no longer need and help to heal, clear, and recover our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual selves.
