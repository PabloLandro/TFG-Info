Cell phones and WiFi can cause cancer, infertility, and learning disabilities, according to a new report delivered Tuesday by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health (HESA). As a result, the microwave radiation coming from the handsets is a “serious public health issue.”
That casts some black clouds over Health Canada. According to four international experts who testified during the hearings, Health Canada is “either unwilling or not competent” enough to realize, based on scientific evidence, that cell phones and WiFi are harmful to the health of Canadians.
That’s despite growing evidence that the devices Canadians use on a daily basis are harmful, especially to children.
This Committee finally gave a voice to the scientists,” said Frank Clegg, former President of Microsoft Canada who is now CEO of Canadians for Safe Technology (C4ST).
“It reached across Party lines to tell Canadians we deserve to be protected. Health Canada has to stop hiding behind the worst countries on this issue, and instead catch up with countries like France and Belgium where you can’t market a cell phone to children anymore, or expose children to Wi-Fi in a daycare,” said Clegg.
As a first step, parents need to be educated about the risks wireless devices such as cell phones and tablets represent to ensure that they keep their families safe both at home and at school, the study recommends.
More importantly, doctors need to recognize the symptoms associated with common wireless devices.
The full report and the transcript from the hearings are available at this link.
