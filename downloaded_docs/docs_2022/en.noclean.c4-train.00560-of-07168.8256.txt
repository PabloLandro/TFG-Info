When it comes to salt, table salt is the one name that strikes our minds. Though most would think of table salt as a favouring seasoning, but it offers multiple health and beauty benefits as well. And just like table salt, nature has blessed us with different lesser known unrefined salts that are highly beneficial. And all these lesser known salts offer multiple health and beauty benefits. They are much more powerful than table salt because they are raw, pure, unadulterated and unrefined. In order words, they are untouched by human interference. Amongst many forms of such raw salts, we have handpicked 5 best underrated salts in order to help you reap maximum benefits.
Pink Salt:
Pink salt, better known as pink Himalayan salt, is an unadulterated highly nutritious salt that is loaded with the goodness of 84 natural minerals. It is a kind of rock salt that is reaped from Himalayan rocks. It is native to India and Pakistan, since it is widely formed in the Himalayan belt of these two countries. It is more like a fossil, since it isn’t found on the crust. Instead, it is produced at around 5000 feet under the Himalayan crust. It is much more than a basic salt that contains just sodium chloride. Thus, it offers numerous health and beauty benefits that you cannot even think of.
1. It Improves Bone Health:
Pink salt is exceptionally rich in calcium and potassium. Potassium is an essential mineral that increases the bone mineral density. This makes bones stronger and reduce the risk of fractures. It effectively fights against bone degenerating acids. Calcium on the other hand, increases the bone mineral density by forming a protective layer. In fact, calcium deficiency hollows the bones that result in various bone disorders. Hence, pink salt makes the bones stronger. It reduces joint inflammation and helps people suffering from arthritis, bone degeneration and osteoporosis. It is also an effective agent that reduces the risk of developing bone disorders in old age.
2. It Reduces Blood Pressure:
Pink salt is an amazing metabolic enhancer. Increased metabolism increases the blood circulation too. Pink salt is loaded with the goodness of iron. Iron is an eminent mineral that binds to red blood cells and provides oxygen to cells and tissues. Increased oxygen level cleanses the body. This results in the reduction and conversion of bad cholesterol into good cholesterol. Reduced cholesterol opens the clogged arteries and veins. This reduces the blood pressure, since the heart needs not to pump harder to supply oxygen anymore. This is because, the narrow openings become wide after accumulated cholesterol is removed from the arteries and veins. This reduces the chances of cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks and heart failure.
3. It Reduces The Risk Premature Skin Aging:
Pink salt is exceptionally rich in skin revitalizing minerals and vitamins. It increases the water level in the cell plasma that keeps the cells plump. Hence, the cells do not shrink and remain hydrated and healthy in all seasons. It also effectively cleanses the cells and reduces free radical formation and accumulation. This further reduces the toxicity. The skin becomes vibrant and the cells become healthy and tighter. Moreover, pink salt, as we know, improves the blood circulation. Increased blood circulation ensures the supply of more oxygen to the skin cells. It makes the skin wrinkle free and tighter. You can also consume it as a flavour enhancer with food. This will improve your skin’s health from inside. And you can also use it to make exfoliating scrubs and face masks to make the epidermis pure and healthy.

It is devoid of chemicals and is harvested by drying sea water under the sun. It contains more than 84 essential minerals and vitamins in their raw form. Needless to say, it offers amazing health and beauty benefits. Other than offering health and beauty benefits, Celtic salt flavours the food much better than table salt does.
5. It Reduces The Risk Of Heart Related Disorders:
Celtic salt contains potassium and sodium that work as essential electrolytes. Electrolytes are the most basic requirement of a healthy heart. This is because, electrolytic imbalance disturbs the pulse rate and heart rhythm. This either increases or decreases the heart beat per minute. Increased heart beat can result in palpitation as well as destabilize the blood pressure. Thus, celtic salt supplies the body with essential electrolytic minerals and keep the blood pressure under control. Stable blood pressure reduces the chances of heart attack and heart failure. Thus, this is a one stop salt the maintains your overall heart health.

The more pure and unadulterated the magnesium is, the better are the chances of removing kidney harming sodium. And celtic salt is one of the best sources of highly pure magnesium.
