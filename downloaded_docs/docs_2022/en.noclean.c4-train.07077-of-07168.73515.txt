(WXIA) After the tragic death of a Douglas County High School football player, some are asking is there such thing as drinking too much water?
The rule-of-thumb for an average adult is thought to be eight 8-ounce cups of water a day to maintain normal bodily functions.
According to Mayo Clinic, the amount of water an individual consumes a day depends on varying factors. If you're someone who exercises each day, is pregnant or breastfeeding or lives in a hot or humid climate, you need to consume more than eight cups per day.
Be careful, though, too much water can be a bad thing. Water intoxication (or hyponatremia), while very rare, can lead to seizures, coma and death. Water intoxication occurs when a person drinks too much water in a short period of time; so much water that other nutrients in the body, such as sodium become too diluted to function properly. Athletes and infants are most at-risk for over-hydration.
The Help Desk has compiled a few links below so you can spot the symptoms of water intoxication and learn how to prevent it.
