Garlic & Herb Roasted Carrots
Long ago, I learned that if you want healthy eyes, it’s a good idea to eat your carrots. So, I did eat carrots: sliced up for a salad, dunked in ranch dressing or steamed. I needed a new side dish for dinner, so I roasted them with coconut oil, garlic, and some herbs. I must say…they are DELICIOUS!
Carrots are great for keeping eyes healthy because they contain an abundance of the antioxidant vitamin A and carotenes, which the body converts into vitamin A. Carrots also contain a good amount of vitamin C. With so many antioxidants, this vegetable is a great way to fight off free radicals and lower your risk of eye diseases like cataracts and macular degeneration. They also help boost your immune system (especially in the winter time when everyone seems to catch the cold or flu).
With this Garlic & Herb Roasted Carrots recipe, the benefits for your eyes don’t stop there. The carrots are roasted in coconut oil which contains omega-3 fatty acids. Plus, parsley contains the antioxidants lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin C, and vitamin A. By the way, it’s also one of the richest herbal sources of vitamin K.
These roasted carrots are quick and easy to make– and quite delicious (as I’m sure I’ve made clear by now). It has a nice, subtle garlic and herb flavor. If you find you want even more flavor, just toss the carrots with a little extra garlic and herbs. For a healthy meal, you can pair this side dish with baked or grilled chicken breasts.
Ingredients: (2 to 3 servings)
1 lb carrots
1 tbsp coconut oil, melted
¼ tsp sea salt
⅛ tsp pepper
4 tsp fresh parsley, chopped
¾ tsp minced garlic
½ tsp dried oregano
Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees, and line a large cookie sheet with aluminum foil.
Cut carrots in half and then into pieces that are about 2 inches long and ½ inch wide. Place them in a medium mixing bowl with the sea salt, pepper, parsley, garlic and oregano and mix together. Last, drizzle the coconut oil across the carrots and mix them again.
Lay out carrots across the cookie sheet, and place another piece of foil on top. Roast in the oven for about 5 minutes, and then take the pan out and toss the carrots again to make sure each carrot is coated well in oil and herbs. Place back into oven and roast for another 15 to 18 minutes or until carrots reach desired softness.
Serve warm!
