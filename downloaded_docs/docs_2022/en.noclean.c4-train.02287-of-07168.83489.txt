MRI scan
2-minute read
Listen
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan takes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. It is useful for diagnosing tumours, joint or spinal injuries or diseases, soft tissue injuries or diseases of internal organs such as the brain or heart. It can show up problems in your veins and arteries without the need for surgery. It is also useful for planning some treatments of the same areas.
What is an MRI scan?
An MRI scanner uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate signals from the body. These are picked up by a radio antenna and processed by a computer to create pictures of the soft tissue inside of your body.
The benefits include:
very detailed pictures
no X-ray radiation
no pain.
When is an MRI scan used?
An MRI scan can be used to examine the:
brain and spinal cord
bones and joints
breasts
heart and blood vessels
internal organs, such as the liver, womb or prostate gland.
MRI is generally used for investigation, diagnosis and planning of treatment of:
tumours
joint injury or disease
soft tissue injury
internal organ damage.
Things to consider
Having an MRI is thought to be safe in pregnancy, but discuss this with your doctor. You must lie still in a confined space, which some people find difficult. It can last as little as 10 minutes, but most are longer. An MRI scan can last as long as two hours or more.
People with certain implants such as a pacemaker and other devices cannot have an MRI scan. Metal interacts with the magnet and can cause serious harm.
The process of having an MRI scan
Preparing for the scan:
You may need to go without food beforehand (fast).
You might or might not need to be injected with dye to help the tissues show up.
Staff will ask about metal in your body, such as pacemakers and metal plates, screws or pins.
If you might be pregnant, or have kidney troubles, or do not like closed spaces, talk to the staff beforehand.
During the scan:
You lie on a bed that is moved in and out of a cylindrical tube. You won’t feel anything.
Radiological staff sit in a different room, but you can talk to them at all times.
The MRI scanner is very noisy. You can ask for headphones or earplugs.
Young children and babies may need a general anaesthetic to keep them still.
Side-effects and complications of an MRI scan
There are no known side-effects of MRI, aside from implants or objects that must not go in the scanner.
Complications may include:
physical harm if safety procedures regarding metal are not followed
allergic reaction to the contrast dye
worsening of kidney function after contrast dye.
MRI scan alternatives
Alternatives to an MRI scan include other imaging such as X-ray, CT scan or ultrasound.

Physician use of red flags to screen for cancer in patients with new back pain | Cochrane
This review describes the understanding of a common practice for checking for spinal injuries when patients come to a family practice doctor, back pain clinic or emergency room with new back pain. Doctors usually ask a few questions and examine the back to check for the possibility of a spinal tumor. The reason for this check for tumors is that the treatment is different for common back pain and tumors. Tumors are usually diagnosed with an x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), then treated with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Common back pain is treated with exercise, spinal manipulation, and pain relievers; x-rays, CT and MRI scans are not useful for diagnosis. Tumors are rare, being the cause of back pain in approximately 1% of new back pain visits to family doctors. Only about 10% of these cancers are new cases; 90% are recurrences of cancers from other parts of the body (metastases).

Surgery for epilepsy | Cochrane
Focal epilepsies are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in specific (localised) parts of the brain. In most people the resulting epileptic seizures can be controlled with medication. In up to 30% of people these seizures are not controlled by medication. If the site of origin of these signals (the epileptogenic zone) can be located from the description of the seizures, or from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (a medical imaging scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body) and electroencephalography (EEG) findings (recording of electrical activity along the scalp) the person should be offered the chance of having the epileptogenic zone removed. We studied the factors (characteristics of the people undergoing surgery and details of surgery type) that might be linked to the best chance of surgical cure of epileptic seizures.

Interventions for improving the appropriate use of imaging in people with musculoskeletal conditions | Cochrane
Imaging is the production of a clinical image of the human body using medical techniques such as x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance (MRI). Imaging is commonly performed for musculoskeletal conditions and is an important aspect of the management of these conditions. In some instances, imaging may not be appropriate, for example x-rays for acute low back pain, and in other instances, imaging is under utilised, for example bone mineral density testing to diagnose people at risk for osteoporosis. The identification of interventions that improve the appropriate use of imaging (either decreasing inappropriate use or increasing appropriate use) for musculoskeletal conditions would be of great value, potentially resulting in improved health outcomes for patients and reduced healthcare costs. The aim of this systematic review was to identify those interventions that improve appropriate use of imaging and to quantify their effects.
