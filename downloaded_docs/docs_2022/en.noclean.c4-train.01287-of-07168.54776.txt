Hereditary Cancer
While most causes of cancer are sporadic in origin, 5-10% of cancer diagnoses are currently thought to be caused by a hereditary component. These hereditary cancer syndromes predispose individuals to an increased risk of developing cancerous tumors in a specific area or multiple areas of the body.
As the genetic etiologies of hereditary cancer syndromes significantly vary, the University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratories offers a wide spectrum of genetic tests to identify these conditions.
