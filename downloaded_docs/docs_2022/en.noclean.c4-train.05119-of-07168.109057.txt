Cataract is usually an age-related disease, characterized by clouding of the lens of the eyes. This disease of the eyes, which causes blurred vision and double vision, is not a reversible condition. Surgery is the only option available for curing the disease. However, studies have shown that with proper eye care and diet, we can reduce the risk of cataract formation in the eyes.
Regular eye check up
Although, regular eye check up could not prevent cataract, nonetheless, it can help to detect cataract at an early stage. Diagnosing and treating cataract at an early stage could prevent complications that might develop from untreated cataract. Regular eye check up, especially after 40, also helps to prevent occurrence of age related eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration.
Sun protection
To prevent cataract, you should protect your eyes from the sunlight. To block the harmful rays of the sun from damaging your eye lens, always wear sunglasses when you are outdoors during the day.
Stay away from smoke
Smoke and pollutants are harmful for the eyes. Cigarette smoking is also not good for your eye lens. To reduce the risk of cataract, stay away from smokes and quit smoking.
Diet
Increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of cataracts. Studies have shown that people who consume less that 3 Â½ servings of fruits and vegetables per day have the greatest risk of developing cataracts. Researchers believe that intake of antioxidants, such as carotenoids, vitamins C and E could delay cataract formation. Certain B vitamins, such as riboflavin, thiamine and niacin could help to prevent cataract formation.
Studies have shown that high intake of saturated fats could increase the risk of cataract formation. A low fat meal is therefore necessary for healthy eyes. However, including omega-3 fatty acids, found in cold-water fish, fish oil and flax seeds, could prevent cataract.
Controlling diabetes
To preserve your vision, you should keep your blood sugar level under control. People with elevated blood sugar level have a greater risk of cataract formation. Lifestyle modification, proper diet and regular exercise are essential for reducing the risk of cataracts.
