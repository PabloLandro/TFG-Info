Eating certain foods while you, your friends or family members are taking certain medicines can cause dangerous side effects or interfere with their effectiveness.
Certain chemotherapy and orange juice
Without a precise dose of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide, the drug may not inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Cranberry juice and orange juice can block the absorption of the drug if taken at the same time. Use a glass of water to rinse off the medicine. Then wait half an hour before taking a juice.
Antibiotics and dairy products
Antibiotics belonging to the quinolone family, such as ciprofloxacin and levaquine, bind to calcium and iron. Therefore, dairy products and iron supplements should be best avoided when taking these medicines.
By blocking the absorption of drugs, these products can make the antibiotics ineffective and leave your infection untreated.
Blood thinner and salad
Vitamin K, which is found in large quantities in foods such as kale, lettuce and broccoli, could pose a threat to those suffering from blood thinners warfarin. Fluctuations in your vitamin K level can inactivate warfarin. Eat consistent amounts of vitamin K-containing foods every week. But always ask your doctors.
Statins and grapefruit juice
Grapefruit juice inhibits the enzyme system that the body uses to metabolize statins that are cholesterol-lowering. This means the medications may not work well. It is important to avoid the juice altogether, not just at the time of taking your medication.
MAO-inhibitors and ripened cheeses
MAO inhibitors are a class of antidepressants that blocks by blocking a key enzyme that helps tyramine, an amino acid found in aged cheese, as well as very ripe bananas, beer, avocado, charcuterie and spinach.
Tyramine can increase blood pressure if it does not break down. So, if people with MAO inhibitors consume these foods, it can lead to a fatal increase in blood pressure, which can cause severe chest pain, nausea, and sweating.
Also, avoid other stimulants, such as caffeine, as they may increase the effect of the medicine. Many psychiatrists are currently refraining from prescribing MAO inhibitors, partly because of their strict dietary requirements, but some doctors use them to treat patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease.
