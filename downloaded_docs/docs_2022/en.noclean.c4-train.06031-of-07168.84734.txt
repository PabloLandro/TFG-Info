Safety concerns about skin creams that contain hydroquinone—a common treatment for discolorations such as age spots—have prompted the FDA to consider banning their sale without a prescription. In high doses, hydroquinone can produce permanent blue-black stains on the skin; it also causes cancer in rats and mice. "Evidence is accumulating that hydroquinone may be far more dangerous than previously thought," says Wiete Westerhof, a dermatology professor at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Its availability has been restricted in Europe since 2001, but many American dermatologists oppose the ban, which would also require prescription hydroquinone products to pass a new review. In 50 years, fewer than 30 cases of the skin-staining condition, ochronosis, have been reported in the United States, and hydroquinone has never been linked to cancer in people, says Pearl E. Grimes, clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California-Los Angeles, who adds that no other skin-lightening ingredient is as effective or well-researched. The ruling, expected early this year, will be announced by the FDA.
