The first characteristic of diabetes is increased sugar level in the body and intake of carbohydrate foods leads to rise in blood sugar. An association on diabetes control suggests taking whole grains like brown bread, brown rice, whole grain pasta, barley and quinoa as they are rich in fiber.
Fruits should be taken in moderate quantity as they are a rich source of carbohydrates which raises the sugar levels in the body. You can take benefits of yogurt, cream, milk and acquire the necessary calcium and phosphorus by taking low fat dairy products with non fat milk. The sugar should be very limited and depending upon your blood sugar levels it should not be more than two spoons in a day.
Alcohol intake should be limited and that too when the blood sugar level is controlled.Alcohol should be taken with food and water and not alone as taking it alone will lead to negative side effects.
It’s tempting to think you can get one of your daily fruit servings from a glass of juice, but skip the convenience of drinking it and instead eat the whole fruit, say Harvard School of Public Health (HSHP) researchers. Studies have shown that the sugar level of diabetic patients are significantly lowered when other low sugar diets are replaced with that of a dragon fruit diet.

Hi on a recent holiday to varinisi India, we were given a fruit platter which contained amongst other fruits. A couple of hours later I had an allergic reaction which needed a doctors visit and he injected me which lessened the rash and itching as quickly as it had come and we wondered what I was allergic to.
The next afternon we had a similar fruit platter which again contained dragon fruit and a couple of hours later my face swelled up as well as having a similar rash as the day before, my husband called for the doctor who came, again injecting me and then I was taken into hospital and was very ill for two days with the rash and severe itching all over my body. We returned to the UK when I was discharged and immediately saw my GP who took blood tests which came back as OK.

Eating more fruit, particularly blueberries, apples and grapes, is linked to a reduced risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. Blueberries cut the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes by 26% compared with 2% for three servings of any whole fruit – but fruit juice did not appear to have the same effect. The researchers examined food frequency questionnaires to follow up the participants every four years, asking how often, on average, they ate a standard portion of each fruit. The fruits used in the study were grapes or raisins, peaches, plums or apricots, prunes, bananas, cantaloupe, apples or pears, oranges, grapefruit, strawberries and blueberries. The researchers said this could be due to the fact these fruits contain high levels of anthocyanins, which have been shown to enhance glucose uptake in mice.
When the researchers looked at the effects of fruit juice consumption, the researchers found a slightly increased risk of Type-2 diabetes. The study calculated that replacing weekly fruit juice consumption with whole fruits could bring health benefits. For example, replacing fruit juice with blueberries could reduce the risk of contracting type-2 diabetes by 33%, with grapes and raisins by 19%, apples and pears by 13% – and with any combination of whole fruit by 7%.
Eating more whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, according to a new study led by Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) researchers.
The researchers theorize that the beneficial effects of certain individual fruits could be the result of a particular component.
Other HSPH authors include JoAnn Manson, professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology, Walter Willett, Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition Department chair, and Rob van Dam, adjunct associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology.
Support for the study came from research grants CA87969, CA17626, CA55075, CA50385, CA167552, DK58845, and DK082486 from the National Institutes of Health.

Previous studies have linked anthocyanins found in berries and grapes to lowered heart attack risk, for example. Sun was supported by a career development award R00HL098459 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
