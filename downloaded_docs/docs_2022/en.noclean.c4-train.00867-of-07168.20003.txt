Did McCain’s brain tumor have a link to cell phones?
Posted on August 28, 2018 | Leave a comment
This came in from my network. We are sorry about the passing of McCain but he died from the same tumor Kennedy had so pay attention…. you don’t want to be next!
Condolences Senator McCain’s Family-Cell Phones Can Cause Glioblastoma Brain Tumors-Time To Warn & Prevent. Our Deepest Condolences To Senator McCain’s Family. Recent Study From England Shows More Than A Doubling of Glioblastomas In The Areas Of The Brain That Receive The Most Cell Phone Radiation. The Italian Supreme Court Has Already Ruled That Cell Phone Radiation Can Cause Brain Tumors. In the US, Brain Tumors are the #1 Cancer for Children 15-19yrs.
The World Leading Researcher In Brain Cancer and Cell Phone Radiation Professor and Oncologist Lennart Hardell MD PhD Can Prove that Cell Phone Radiation Can Cause Brain Tumors and He Insists People Must Be Warned and Protected (LennartHardell). Lennart Hardell MD PHD and Leading Cancer Epidemiologist Anthony Miller MD, FRCP, FRCP(C), FFPH Along with 207 Medical Doctors and Scientists Expert in Wireless Radiation Health Effects Insist We Reduce Our Overall Exposure to Wireless RF Radiation by Stopping The Roll Out of 5G Wireless Technology Which Will Very Significantly Increase Our Exposure By Forcing A Cell Tower Transmitter Every 2-10 homes (www.5Gappeal.eu).
Unfortunately, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of brain tumors in the 3 areas of the brain which receive the most cell phone radiation: Temporal Lobe, Cerebellum, and Frontal Lobe. Most people do not know that Senator McCain was reported to have 2 cell towers on his property adding to his exposure from his cell phone. The recent $25 million US NTP Study showed an increase in brain tumors and DNA Damage from whole body cell phone radiation exposure non-thermally below current FCC safety guidelines.
Long time advisor to World Health Organization, Anthony Miller MD, FRCP, FRCP(C), FFPH, explains “Cell phone radiation can clearly cause brain tumors. With the epidemiological studies of humans and the recent findings of the US National Toxicology Program study and Ramazzini Institute Study, we have enough evidence to classify wireless Radiofrequency radiation as a Class 1 Human Carcinogen like cigarette smoke and Asbestos. Therefore, we really need to warn our citizens and reduce overall exposure, especially for children who absorb twice the amount of cell phone radiation. I am joined by my colleagues in demanding a moratorium on the roll out of new 5G wireless technology which will very significantly increase everyone’s exposure to this radiation until adequate safety testing is done and exposure safety standards are established.”

Is your pet getting sick because of your wifi?
Posted on June 25, 2018 | 1 comment
I don’t mean to harp on this subject but it needs to be said. A big article came out recently in the Innovative Veterinary Care magazine from Canada regarding the effects electro-pollution had on our pets (us too). I am taking out bits from that article.
Ionizing EMR (electromagnetic radiation) are known to cause direct damage to cells and DNA such as those from x-rays. Non-ionizing EMR is low-frequency found coming from our electronics and are thought to be safe if they don’t create heat, but studies have shown that is a fallacy. Evidence from studies and research has shown that EMR even if it doesn’t heat tissue, compromises normal physiology and intercellular communication leading to the breakdown of healthy cellular processes. If the cell deteriorates its membranes harden, free radical damage occurs, nutrients can’t find their way in and toxins can’t be removed.
Other problems occur as endocrine function is harmed and vets have seen a marked increase in endocrine disease in pets over the last 20 years. EMR radiation is a hormone disruptor and causes reduced melatonin levels which is a key hormone in keeping free radicals in check. Tests showed increases in human breast cancer cell growth when exposed to EMR. We have also seen an increase in pet cancers lately even when they are kept indoors (perhaps in a WiFi environment). As melatonin is key in suppressing the development of breast cancer, it also supports the killer lymphocytes and enhances the ability of vitamin D to inhibit tumor growth.
Many studies are also reporting the effects of EMR on wildlife with one showing when mobile phones were placed in a honey bee hive, worker bees stopped returning and honey production steadily declined. It is not only our indoor pets that we need to be concerned about. Riders on horseback who keep their phones turned on and in their back pockets are exposing the animals to high electromagnetic radiation. And remember that your dog, cat, gerbil, pet bird, and fish are tiny compared to a human. Therefore a small amount of exposure would be much more lethal as it has shown to be to a small child.
Best solution is to keep phones away from pets, to limit use of WiFi and investigate one of the subtle energy technologies, diodes and pendants you can affix to their collar or cage to harmonize the frequencies and make them less destructive to the body.

How does fiber help prevent cancer?
Posted on November 17, 2017 | 2 comments
Fiber is the super sponge in the body. When the liver processes carcinogenic toxins out of the blood they end up in the gut. In order to completely eliminate them from the body, something in the gut must absorb them. Enter: fiber!
If you eat sugar, white rice and starchy carbs you will not be able to facilitate this absorption. No sponges will be available to bind up the toxins which will then be reabsorbed. This means they will end up in circulation all over again doubling your carcinogenic exposure. Increased fiber can intercede and help remove them properly.
Fruit is a great fiber food with raspberries and pears being at the top of the list. Or you can add whole wheat pasta, barley, bran flakes and oats to your diet. Split peas, lentils and black beans are chock full of fiber as are artichokes and broccoli. Almonds are a high fiber nut and Two tablespoons of flaxseed provide about six grams of fiber and opposed to 1/4 cup of black beans to get the same amount. Women should try to eat at least 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day, while men should aim for 30 to 38 grams a day.
To facilitate a better working liver to help process those carcinogens out, you can take a potent curcumin supplement and also use milk thistle which also helps suppress the growth of blood vessels that feed cancer tumors.

Re-hydration and cancer therapy.
Posted on July 11, 2017 | 2 comments
I excerpted parts of this article with permission from the Mesothelioma info site. I felt it was really good information. Click here for the whole article
Dehydration occurs when the body is losing more fluids than it is taking in, with the result being a diminished ability for organs to carry out their normal functions. Being dehydrated means more than just losing fluid; it also means not having enough electrolytes, the minerals and ions that are carried in body fluids and that are so important for proper functioning of the body. Good hydration plays an important role in good health generally, but also in preventing cancer and in recovering comfortably from treatment for mesothelioma and other types of cancers.
Electrolytes are mineral ions, meaning minerals that have an electrical charge. They are dissolved in bodily fluids and are transported throughout the body where they play important roles in various functions of the body. Examples of electrolytes include potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. You get electrolytes from your food and some of the fluids you drink.
Dehydration can cause an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to a number of complications if not reversed. In cancer patients, a particular type of electrolyte imbalance is very serious: hypercalcemia. This is an excessive amount of calcium in the blood, and it can become an emergency situation. Hypercalcemia is a risk in cancer patients, particularly in lung cancer patients. Symptoms include vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, fatigue, lethargy, confusion, dry mouth, irregular heartbeat, and coma.
Any general type of electrolyte imbalance in cancer patients may cause symptoms such as muscle spasms, numbness, weakness, confusion and lethargy, twitching muscles, changes in blood pressure, irregular heartbeat and convulsions. It may also cause bone and nervous system disorders and seizures.

What Turns Cancer Cells On?
Posted on February 3, 2017 | Leave a comment
According to the American Cancer Society 18% of cancers are caused by infection, 23% caused by obesity, 41% environmental and only 5% because of genetics. So if our lifestyles can create the environment inside our bodies to make a happy home for cancer what can we do about it?
We have delved into this a little more on our video blog ” Click Here ” but we’ll give you a few tips here. You must detox your body, especially the colon. Certain herbs can help clean you out such as psyllium, buckthorne, slippery elm, humid acid and casgara. You can also do an olive oil lemon juice cleanse and you can search the Internet to find one of these treatment that works for you. You also must make sure you have a good supply of friendly bacteria in the colon and if you eat poorly or have had chemotherapy, many of those will have been destroyed. You need to repopulate them through a good probiotic supply that contains an assortment of the friendly critters. Our suggestion to check out is: PlusBiotic which can be found by clicking here and then click learn more and select from the product drop down menu to read about it.
Keeping the lymph clean also is a must as it is the main filter for abnormal cells. Herbs that are found in the Essiac tincture available at health food stores are a good way to do this. There are more tips for urinary cleanse and parasite cleanse on the video so check it out. www.AntiAgingLadyNews.com

Tips for cancer prevention
Posted on January 27, 2017 | Leave a comment
We are doing a video blog series on www.AntiAgingLadyNews.com about cancer prevention. This is an excerpt from the first session. There is no charge… Please visit our video blog site to access the information.
Everyone has cancer floating in their body. It’s the function of our toxic world and our lifestyles. Our body has cool cells called T-cells that take out cells that don’t look normal to them. Unfortunately sometimes they get confused by the cloaking put on by the cancer cell and don’t do their job. Cancer has main stem cells and daughter cells. If our immune system is strong we can handle the normal amount of cancer cells, but if we don’t do the right things our immune system will go on vacation and cancer will have a field day reproducing. Chemo kills the daughter cancer cells but the cancer stem cell sits there fat and healthy impervious to the drug. So – if you want to prevent the proliferation of your resident cancer cells and prevent tumors so and don’t want to get to the stage where you have to resort to chemo, you can try adding polyphenols to your diet. This interacts with the genes and works on the cancer stem cells weakening them so your immune system can find them and the T-cells can zap them. – more about what polyphenols are on our video blog.
The polyphenols are concentrated in nutritional liquid formula (Daily Metrix) that a friend introduced me to, because I don’t have to take a bazillion vitamin pills anymore… just this one ounce a day liquid gives me everything I need… enzymes, minerals, polyphenols, essential fatty acids, protein, bioflavonoids, joint helpers, heart helpers, fruit, veggies – and its non GMO! check it out: www.longlifenews.com

Milkweed kills skin cancer cells.
Posted on May 17, 2016 | Leave a comment
Research published in the Journal of British Dermatology reveals a study that showed the sap from milkweed cures non-melanoma skin cancers! The plant substance is effective because of ingenol mebutate, a compound in it that seems to destroy cancer cells. Australian scientists from many medical institutions in Brisbane tested the milkweed sap on humans and found remarkable results. The studies showed a 75% cure rate with no visible scarring.
Now we just have to hope folks don’t grab all the milkweed and leave nothing for the poor Monarch butterflies that depend on it for survival.

Things in your drinks.
Posted on February 10, 2016 | 2 comments
With many of us switching from carbonated soda pop to fruit, flavored water and tea drinks , we still have to be aware of ingredients. Some of those drinks are not organic, some may still use dyes or preservatives or sweeteners that are not good for your body even though the manufactures say they are safe in small amounts.
Coal tar derivatives used for coloring such as Red #40 and Yellow #6 can cause sensitivity to viruses and have been linked to cancer. Cochineal extract is used as a cola coloring and is basically ground up female cochineal bugs from South America. While this may not be appealing, we still don’t know if they are laden with critters or pesticides that could affect our health. Artificial sweeteners that go by several names now but started out as aspartame, when heated (like if left in your hot car in the summer) breaks down to toxic methyl alcohol. It has been implicated in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and can cause headaches and seizures in some people. AceK sounds safe enough but it has shown to cause cancer in animals. Sucralose is chlorinated sugar and has shown in studies to have a negative effect on the thymus gland, decreased red blood cell count, diarrhea among other potential conditions.
Agave is a sweetener in many natural foods drinks. The fructose content of agave syrup is much higher than that of high fructose corn syrup, which is of concern since some research has linked high fructose intake to weight gain (especially around the abdominal area), high triglycerides, heart disease and insulin resistance. And I’m sure by now you’ve read by blog posts on why to stay away from high fructose corn syrup (not the least is that it is GMO).
Chemicals such a Propylene glycol and ployethylene glycol (PEG) are sometimes added to drinks. The former has shown to be toxic and induce seizures in epileptics as well as affect the heart. It also inhibits the growth of the friendly bacteria in your intestines leading to constipation. PEG is used as a drug to induce diarrhea before surgery. Now why would you want to have that in your drink? It also has shown to interfere with blood thinners, birth control pills, and antiinflammatories.
So, the next time you pick up that sports drink, protein shake, or health drink – read the label!

Cell phones and kids
Posted on June 11, 2015 | Leave a comment
Today’s smartphones, iPads and electronic devices are relatively new, but research is raising serious concerns about their long-term health impacts. Microwave radiation at the levels we get from our cell phones is linked to damage to the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems. When parents give their infant or toddler an iPad, it is a brain stimulant, and now other nations are finding that children cannot self soothe or control impulses, with lots of data from Korea and other countries on digital dementia, etc.
There is particular concern for children, teens, and young adults, who are increasingly heavy users but whose growing bodies are also more vulnerable to the radiation. Some studies have found those who start using cell phones as teens have a greater health risk than those who started as adults.
Children are disproportionately affected by environmental exposures, including cell phone radiation. The differences in bone density and the amount of fluid in a child’s brain compared to an adult’s brain could allow children to absorb greater quantities of RF energy deeper into their brains than adults. It is essential that any new standards for cell phones or other wireless devices be based on protecting the youngest and most vulnerable populations to ensure they are safeguarded through their lifetimes.
In May 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the United Nations’ World Health Organization’s (WHO) agency promoting international cancer research collaboration, classified RF energy as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” This applies to WiFi signals too.
To protect yourself and your kids…. never carry a phone that is on in your clothes, always wear a headset or turn the speaker on and never hold it to your ear. Choose hard-wired over WiFi for your computer. The warning on the cell phone says “Body-worn SAR testing has been carried out at a separation distance of 1.0 cm. To meet RF exposure guidelines during body-worn operation, the device should be positioned at least this distance away from the body.” So take heed.
Like cancer from smoking took decades to link the two so will we see RF health effects appearing down the road. Don’t be one of those affected.

Vitamin D Increases Cancer Survival Length
Posted on April 15, 2015 | Leave a comment
A new study reported a the 2015 American Society of Cancer Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium shows that metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had high levels of vitamin D in their bloodstream prior to chemo survived longer on an average than those who did not. On the average the groups with the highest levels of vitamin D survived 33% longer and also were associated with longer time to disease progression. Previous studies already showed that vitamin D may play a role in cancer inhibition.
