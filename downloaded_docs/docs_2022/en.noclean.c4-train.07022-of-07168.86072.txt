SPARK A SMILE: Make that doctor's office a little sunnier with these festive scrub tops for women. Whether it's Christmas, Halloween, 4th of July, or Thanksgiving, you can pick between fun prints and vibrant colors to crown any of the holidays.
DESIGNED WITH CARE: You'll love the superb stitching of the prints scrubs for women that endure your busy shifts, and the high quality non-see through material that ensures total modesty as you cater to your patients.
COMFORTABLE TO WEAR: With the blend of 95% cotton and 5% spandex, you'll enjoy breathable nursing scrubs uniforms that keep you cool as you work those long hours, and a comfy stretch to fit body shapes all the way from petite to plus size.
COMPLEMENTS YOUR BODY SHAPE: We've steered away from the boxy ladies scrub tops using a slimmer design to give more shape to the uniforms. This is coupled with a cute V-neck to create one of the most flattering printed scrub tops around.
KEEP YOUR ITEMS SAFE: You can safely keep your pens, tape, scissors or cell phone in the two deep pockets without the risk of them falling out when you bend over. We've complemented this mix of functionality and quality with competitive pricing to give you the best value online. Click 'Add to Cart' now!
