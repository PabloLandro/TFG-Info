The bottom answer is not totally correct.
You must wait at least a few weeks, preferably 3 months, before getting braces in order to let the gums and the bone heal properly before putting on braces.
They can never get braces because they will irritate the damaged gums.

What activities should NOT be done after getting your wisdom teeth pulled?
My doctor told me not to do anything that would raise my blood pressure.. And . It is a good idea to avoid any kind of suction during the first two weeks following the extractions. This includes sipping through a straw and smoking. This could cause the blood clots to be dislodged from the socket…s and result in a painful condition known as a dry socket. If this happens, see your dentist ASAP. It can be treated.. Answer . No spitting or any kind of suction for 48 hours. Also no physical exercises for 48 hours.. It is a good idea not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the anethesia has completely worn off. ( Full Answer )

How long should you not smoke before getting your wisdom teeth pulled?
You can smoke right up to the time you get them pulled, but you need to wait 48hrs after getting them pulled so you won't get a dry socket.. Answer . Do not smoke for at least 48 hours after any extraction, to reduce the risk of having a dry socket.. Answer . Two days at the least, 5 to grea…tly reduce your risk of dry socket, and even then, smoke as little as possible. . Technically, I smoked the day of surgery and every day since, but I smoked very little, only a few small drags, and covered the area with wet gauze and rinsed lightly afterward.. I got all 4 wisdoms removed; although all my teeth were erupted, he had to cut out the bottom two due to age (26) since the lower jaw bone is no longer spongy and the teeth can't be pulled.. I'm on my sixth day and except for the first two days where I smoked a little more (I'm stupid, like a couple drags two or three times a day), I only have a couple drags in the morning (still with the gauze and rinse afterward - warm saltwater). I am a diehard smoker and I know I will go back to smoking once I am better healed (I see the dr. tomorrow for my check-up). While a part of me sees this as a perfect opportunity to quit and I even feel like I could, I just like smoking too much and I know that I'll start up again. We'll see. I have relied heavily on the patch and rather than focusing on how I'd like to smoke, I've just been picturing how bad it is in terms of healing to be smoking.. So far, I have not had any dry sockets, but I also heard that dry socket can occur for up to 14 days after surgery (though highly unlikely). I think I'm in the clear but at this point I just want it to heal well - even when I do step outside to smoke, it just seems not worth it since I really can't enjoy it. If i can't smoke all I want and how I want, then it's really not worth it, especially with the threat of dry socket.. I agree with everything the other person posted - smoke as little as possible and when you do, cover the holes with wet gauze (not dry or it will stick to the surgery site!!) and do not suck, place the cig in front of your mouth and just breath it in from the end without using your lips to grasp it. Drink water afterwards during the first 24 (if you stupidly decide to smoke like me), and rinse with saline solution after the first 24.. Always rinse gently and be sure to follow all of your doctor's instructions for aftercare.. I recommend getting a patch and smoking as little and as gently as possible (I would really recommend not at all, especially for the first 48, but I'm trying to be realistic). Just put on a patch (I found that it worked amazingly well) and keep your mind off of it as much as you can. I know it's hard, but it's only something you have to do for a little while and I was actually surprised at myself for being able to smoke next to nothing for the past six days.. My doctor's instructions were not to smoke for at least 48 hours, others say 72 hours, and others say at least 4 days. Dry socket typically occurs within 3 to 5 days after surgery, so I would try to smoke as little and as carefully as possible for those 5 days. They say that a week without smoking is optimal as it allows for the best healing.. Dry socket typically occurs after getting the lower wisdom teeth removed because there is poor blood circulation to that part of the mouth - smoking exacerbates this, which is why it increases your chances of dry socket, along with the toxic chemicals and smoke that can dissolve the clot and the suction from smoking.. Get the patch and try not to think about smoking - the more you think about it, the more you'll want to smoke.. Good luck!! ( Full Answer )

How long should you wait before drinking alcohol after getting your wisdom teeth pulled?
Answer You should wait for 3 - 4 days or until your dentist checks you again (whichever comes first.) Having any tooth pulled (wisdom teeth are difficult at best) tears the gums and your dentist has probably packed the gum down by the bone and stitched each one. If you are on pain killers DON'T DRI…NK! Alcohol will make you bleed more. If you don't have much pain and you aren't on pain killers then 2 days after the pullings your dentists may say it is okay to drink alcohol. Give the gums a little time to heal. ( Full Answer )

Can you drink alcohol after getting your wisdom teeth pulled?
Probably not a good idea. Problems could be: 1 - Interaction with prescription painkillers. Can cause you to slow down or stop breathing, amongst other problems. Potentially lethal. 2 - Prolongation of bleeding. Alcohol prevents clotting, which may (a) cause you to bleed uncontrollably, which …would be a bad combination with #1 above, or at least (b) cause your healing time to be prolonged. So, I'd say, find another way to take your mind off the pain! Hope this helps. ( Full Answer )

Can you brush your teeth after getting wisdom teeth pulled?
Definitely brush your teeth. The last thing you want is bacteria in an open wound. Do not gargle with mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide! But do brush gums, tongue and remaining teeth, being careful to avoid brushing the wound directly.

What to do after getting wisdom teeth pulled?
Follow the post surgical instructions given by the Oral Surgeon or Dentist who performed the procedure. The instructions may differ depending on the type of extraction, whether or not stitches are present, or the possibility of complications based on an individual's own dental history.

Can you drink from a straw after getting your wisdom teeth pulled out?
My dentist said not for three days.. \nIt is NOT advised to drink from a straw after oral or sinus surgery until you are healed to a degree that your doctor will advise.\n. \nWhy? Because your body is responding to the wound with a delicate process of wound healing that is very delicate in the ear…ly stages. It forms a clot that works as a foundation for the bleeding to stop and the healing to begin.\n. \nIf you create negative pressure (by sucking on the straw) the same action that draws liquids up from the cup, pulls on your surgical site. \nThis can pull the clot out, leaving you bleeding and further exposing your wound to all the bacteria in your mouth, which increases the chances of infection.\n. \nBe certain to follow your post operative directions VERY carefully and take fluids with a cup or spoon.

Im getting my 2 baby i teeth taking out and then getting a brace to pull down my adult teeth in there place how long will i have a gap there fore?
Answer . If you let your adult teeth come out passively, it might take a long time for them to come out. But if the dentist or orthodontist pulls on them with the braces, it might take only a few weeks or a few months at the most.

How do you drink after getting 4 wisdom teeth pulled?
First of all, DO NOT USE A STRAW....using a straw, doing any sucking, coughing, sneezing, or spitting will put you at greater risk for dry sockets or infections (which is why your oral surgeon will not pull your teeth if you have a cough or cold). The best thing to do is just drink slowly from a cup… and try to drink straight back to your throat -- don't let any shakes or anything in your mouth. And make sure that you gently rinse your mouth with warm saltwater several times a day....it's not only soothing on your achy teeth, but it also cleans out your mouth. ( Full Answer )

Smoking is generally bad for any kind of tooth extraction. It causes dry sockets which can cause problems. But if you've been smoking for years, it won't make much of a difference if you smoke the day of!

Can you smoke marijuana before getting your wisdom teeth pulled?
Yes, however getting teeth pulled is never fun so perhaps try taking some Valium an hour before the operation this will calm your nerves especially if you're just going to be under a local. I just had my wisdom teeth removed with a local (i was awake but couldn't feel it) and the Valium took the edg…e off. as for smoking(anything) AFTER, it can disrupt the healing process and increases your chance of dry sockets by about %60 (citation is from my father, an orthodontist) As for the previous answer, smoking does not 'rot' teeth it stains them yellow which can be treated effectively with teeth whitening products. I also might suggest he/she learns how to use a comma. ( Full Answer )

How long should you wait to drink after getting your teeth pulled?
About half an hour's wait should suffice before you take liquid orally, but make sure it is not hot and better still, make it cold. Hot drinks can precipitate bleeding. It would be a good idea not to wash your mouth vigorously after an extraction, lest you dislodge the blood clot.

Can the bad taste after getting wisdom teeth pulled be from stitches?
I am a surgical dental assistant who has been in the field for 6 years. Part of my job is giving post op instructions and taking calls from post op patients. The bad taste you are experiencing is normal. When wisdom teeth are extracted the surgeon does not sew up the entire extraction site. There ar…e many reasons for this, each Dr. has their own. You may not be brushing as well as you usually would which is understandable. Your mouth hurts! I know it is difficult to open as wide to get the back teeth, but you need, I mean NEED to keep the mouth clean. You may have food stuck in the socket, here is what you do. Use a salt water rinse, no mouth wash. It will burn and slow the healing. Rinse after every meal. Do you have dissolvable stitches? Sometimes they can take up to 2 weeks to dissolve. Do not try to take them out. If they are bothersome and pinching, contact your dentist and schedule a post op appointment. ( Full Answer )

Can you actually get sick from getting your wisdom teeth pulled out?
Yes, from all the drugs that are used to numb one, and cause one to go "under." This is why one cannot eat before, because even being unconscious , the drugs will still react with the body in the same way as being conscious. These drugs cause nausea and one can get sick at any point in the surgery.

NO. Tobacco retards the healing process. We don't know what you meant by "tobacco". But if you're talking about any type of tobacco that's inhaled, then no. Stay away from "it" for at least 5 days. I know --- you'll have a nicotine fit -- but do it --- or consult your oral surgeon.

It depends on the orthodontist's opinion as to the growth of the jaw and the need for space. Sometimes pulling teeth provides more room for the teeth to come in correctly.

I would avoid the intake of sugar, post-surgery. Sugar can promote bleeding. We're talking some 24 to 72 hours, post-surgery. My periodontic practioner recommeneded "biting down on luke-warm tea bags, instead of gauze" -- because warm tea bags contain tanic acid which helps heal the gum.
