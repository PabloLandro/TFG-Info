Weight-Loss Drink #4: Chai
Weight-Loss Drink #4: Chai
Because it: Stabilizes blood sugar
Chai may be among the healthiest drinks on the planet, but like so many other things in our diet, it’s been turned into a festival of sugar and artificial chemicals by our modern food industry. Chai is at its healthiest when made with fresh spices that are boiled and then steeped in tea leaves.
How to Enjoy It: While there are many different recipes and variations of chai, here’s a simple version I like: boil one cup of milk with 1 tsp each of ground cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, fennel, anise, ginger and nutmeg. Pour the boiling milk over your favorite tea leaves. The cinnamon will help stabilize blood sugar, reducing weight gain; cloves have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic benefits, while cardamom boosts circulation, helping skin to glow. Fennel, anise, ginger and nutmeg help boost chai’s digestive benefits.

Weight-Loss Drink #3: Ginger Tea
Weight-Loss Drink #3: Ginger Tea
Because it: Shrinks your belly
Ginger is a well-known digestive aid, and one secret to a flat belly is to start the morning with a cup of ginger tea to “activate” the digestive system. It is thought to help the vata and pitta doshas—the digestive and circulatory centers in the body, according to Ayurveda—thereby reducing bloating and warming up the circulatory system.
How to Enjoy It: To get the most powerful benefits, simply grate ¼- ½ tsp of raw ginger into your tea kettle. Boil for 3-5 minutes and then pour into a cup with your favorite tea bag. Add a teaspoon of honey for a sweeter taste. My friends at Eat This, Not That! love ginger tea so much, they made it part of this brand new weight-loss plan, The 7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Diet and Cleanse! Test panelists lost up to 10 pounds in just one week!

Weight-Loss Drink #2: Golden Milk
Weight-Loss Drink #2: Golden Milk
Because it: Makes you more flexible
In Ayurvedic medicine, the way one prepares milk has everything to do with how our bodies react to it. To prevent bloating and allergies and maximize the health benefits of dairy, Ayurvedic practitioners brew golden milk, a blend of milk and turmeric. Turmeric has been shown to act directly on the genes that control fat storage, while the calcium in milk is linked to lower body mass—a University of Tennessee study found that dieters who consumed between 1,200 and 1,300 mg of calcium a day (about four cups of milk) lost nearly twice as much weight as those getting less milk. Golden milk is used to in Ayurvedic medicine to improve joint pain, muscle stiffness and to boost the immune system. No wonder yogis have such amazing flexibility!
How to Enjoy It: Mix one cup of milk with ¼ tsp of turmeric, and bring to a boil. Sweeten with a touch of honey.

Weight-Loss Drink #1: Mango Lassi
Weight-Loss Drink #1: Mango Lassi
Because it: Reduces inflammation
Lassi is a popular drink from India and Pakistan, made from fermented yogurt. In Ayurvedic medicine, lassi “cools” the digestive system, aiding gut function. And from a modern medical perspective, lassi is a fermented food that contains many healthy bacteria, or probiotics, which decrease bloating and reduce inflammation—two key contributors to weight loss. While lassi can be made with any number of fruits, mango lassi is one of the easiest and most popular drinks in India.
How to Enjoy It: Simply combine in a blender one cup of plain Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp of sugar, ½ cup frozen mango chunks, and enough water to blend. Avoid the sugar-packed yogurts in the dairy aisle with this Eat This, Not That! guide to The 9 Best Brand Name Yogurts for Weight Loss!

Vertical leg crunch
Vertical leg crunch: Wondering how to lose stomach fat? Try doing vertical leg crunches. The vertical leg crunch is similar to a regular crunch. But it requires you to keep your legs straight, which makes the abs work harder and increases the workout's intensity.
-Lie down with hands behind your head
-Put your legs straight up with knees crossed
-Flex abs to lift head and shoulders off the floor
-Lay back down
-Keep legs extended in the air the whole time
-Exhale when you flex; inhale when you lay back down
-Do 1-3 sets with 12-16 repetitions
