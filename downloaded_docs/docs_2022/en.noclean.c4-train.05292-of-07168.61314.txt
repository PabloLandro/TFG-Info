Consider your lifestyle. If you’re always on the run, you’ll want a smaller vape pen. Compact vape pens are easy to conceal in your hand or pocket, making for a stealthier vaping experience when you’re in public.

On the flip, the convection vape pens blow extremely hot air through the material that turns it into vapor. A mesh screen, usually made of glass or metal is used to contain the vaping material.

“E-cigarettes are widely promoted as a smoking cessation aid, but for most people, they actually make it harder to quit smoking, so most people end up as so-called ‘dual users’ who keep smoking while using e-cigarettes,” said Stanton Glantz, lead author of the latter study, in a statement.

Most vaping hardware qualifies as “disposable,” and this includes box mods. Few are designed and manufactured to last forever in actual use. Lifespan varies wildly, from a couple months before they break or stop working to many years of faithful, dependable service.
In the case of concentrate and dry herb vape pens, a simple cleaning of the heating chamber might do the trick (as it removes the old, caked-in material). As for e-juice vape pens, the problem might be in the vape juice that’s used – try low VG juices (they are less viscous high VG juices). If the problem doesn’t go away, remember that this just happens sometimes, even with the best vape pen on the market. In order to get completely rid of the burnt taste, it’s advisable to change the atomizer completely.

That is very true. Mind you I have a sneaky suspicion that some of the people buying these cig-a-likes expect more of them, thus are disappointed and go back to analogs. I guess you have to want to quit to like vaping. If not you are going to be one of the vape-haters. Thanks for the kind words, good choice! How is it Evic VTC Mini running for you?
