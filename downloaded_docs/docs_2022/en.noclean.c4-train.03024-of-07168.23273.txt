Morphine Addiction
Drug addiction affects millions of people every year. Addiction can cause damage to individuals, families and entire communities. The rise in drug abuse and addiction is a serious cause for concern, particularly, the rapid increase prescription drug abuse throughout the nation. Morphine is just one of many drugs that are being abused at high rates.
Morphine
Morphine is the primary chemical in opium. It is an opioid pain medication that is also referred to as narcotic analgesics. The drug is used to treat moderate to severe pain. Morphine acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. It is not intended for short term use and is sold under the names of Avinza, MS Contin, Kadian, and Oramorph. On the street it is known as Morf., Mister Blue, and Dreamer.
Morphine Abuse and Addiction
Morphine is a very powerful opiate, which means it can develop into an addiction. The drug can be both physically and psychologically addictive, making it especially dangerous. Over time the body becomes comfortable with the drug, which is known as tolerance. As an individual’s tolerance builds they will require more morphine at high doses to achieve the desired effects. Reinforcing brain patterns will drive the morphine abuser to continue to use the drug and develop a dependency. The person will begin to obsess over the drug and its effects, which will result in compulsive morphine searching and consuming. Morphine addiction is similar to other prescription opiate pain killer addictions. Many users begin using the drug for completely legitimate reasons, but ultimately fall victim to addiction. Using morphine for extended periods of time can lead to addiction. Taking the drug in higher doses or more frequently than ordered by a physician can be dangers and cause dependency. Mixing morphine with other drugs can have dangerous health effects which include fatality.

Teenagers are becoming addicts before the reach the age of legal consumption of alcohol. They are developing these addictions due to the ease with which they can obtain drugs.
Prescription drug abuse in America is on the rise and is becoming real cause for concern. These candy colored and coated pills are increasingly inviting for young adults. Their ability to access the plethora of prescription drugs is even more alarming. In a past year use of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals among 12th graders, marijuana and hashish carried 36.4%; prescription drugs 32.1%, and synthetic marijuana 11.3%. Cough and cold remedies, over-the-counter drugs, are the most commonly abused drug; which is nearly 20% of all abused prescription drugs.

There are over 2 million people in the US that suffer from opioid pain reliever abuse. Death from this disorder has quadrupled over the past decade and a half. One of the many causes for this is over-prescription of pain med’s; in 2013, 207 million prescriptions were written for prescription opioid pain medications.

The government in response to these numbers has started several programs that are attempting to curb the rise in prescription drug abuse. The first level of defense is raising awareness and educated the youth. The second is developing dispensaries, where Americans can come to properly dispose of old or never used prescriptions.
