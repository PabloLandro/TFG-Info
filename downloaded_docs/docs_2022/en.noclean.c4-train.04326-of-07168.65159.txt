How Long Will It Take For My Hemorrhoids to Go Away?
Some hemorrhoids can go away in as little as a few days without any treatment at all. On the other hand, some may fester and become chronic medical conditions. They key to making your hemorrhoid go way is to act quickly.
Our feedback has shown that the combination of using all three: a hemorrhoid cream, wipe and supplement is the best option to get rid of hemorrhoids fast and without surgery.
First, it is important to realize that no two of us is exactly alike. We are all different and our anatomy differs as well.
Hemorrhoids are different too.
A hemorrhoid is an itching or painful mass of dilated veins in swollen anal tissue.
Hemorrhoids are very painful.
There are multiple types of hemorrhoids, which do you have?
Internal hemorrhoids,
External hemorrhoids,
Thrombosed hemorrhoids
Prolapsed hemorrhoids.
What Type of Hemorrhoid Do I Have?
So you have hemorrhoids, but are you sure you know what type of hemorrhoids they are?
We have included some examples of the different types of hemorrhoids to help you figure out what type you have.
The last two, thrombosed and prolapsed are usually exquisitely painful and difficult to deal with.
This is a guide on how to deal with painful hemorrhoids. The best solution currently is Amazon's top selling hemorrhoid supplement, HemRid Max. It works extremely well and currently boasts a near perfect rating on Amazon.
Internal Hemorrhoids (Inside the Anus)
Internal Hemorrhoid Pictures:
External Hemorrhoids- (around the anus - look for a bulge around the anus)
External Hemorrhoid Pictures:
Thrombosed Hemorrhoid - (contains a blood clot-look for a bluish buldge)
Thrombosed Hemorrhoid Pictures:
Prolapsed Hemorrhoid-(protrudes outside of the anus-sticking out of the anus itself)
Prolapsed Hemorrhoid Pictures:
There are also different degrees of internal hemorrhoids:
The first degree internal hemorrhoid pops into the anal canal when you pass a bowel movement.
A second degree is a prolapsed hemorrhoid that pops out of the anus during a bowel movement and retracts back into the anus on its own,
A third degree prolapsed hemorrhoid has to be manually maneuvered back in.
The fourth degree prolapsed hemorrhoid can not be manually maneuvered back in. These often require hemorrhoid surgery unless you start to see improvement.
Hopefully, now you have figured out what type of hemorrhoids you have.
External, thrombosed and prolapsed are generally more likely to require the help of a hemorrhoid doctor or physician, although all types may.
That being said, regardless of what type of hemorrhoid you have they all may get better and go away on their own. To be on the safe side, order a bottle of HemRid Max and take the supplement regularly. Once they go away, keep taking it for another week or so to make sure those nasty buggers stay away.
When in doubt about your condition, make an appointment with a proctologist.
Do Hemorrhoids Go Away After Pregnancy or Delivery?
Hemorrhoids often occur during pregnancy due to pressure placed on the anal region or as a result of straining and pressure during childbirth.
It would make sense that after birth things get back to normal a bit and that your hemorrhoid will go away.
Unfortunately, that is not always the case.
Of course, there are things you can do to help them go away after pregnancy. Instead of using over the counter drugs like Preparation H, we recommend HemRid Max which is an all natural solution that works wonders and is Amazon's Top Selling hemorrhoid supplement.
How Do I Know If My Hemorrhoids Will Go Away On Their Own?
You don’t. However, there are proven ways to help your body get rid of hemorrhoids.
Below we have listed 9 quick tips to help those hemorrhoids go away and stay away.
Remember, unless you address the causes of your hemorrhoids you won't be able to prevent them from coming back. Read on below to learn more.
How To Make Hemorrhoids Go Away Fast and Completely: 9 Quick Tips
1) Diet - It always sounds so simple doesn’t it, “just diet” when in reality it is very difficult for us as human beings to change our food consumptions habits.
The fact remains that diets high in fiber can help your hemorrhoids condition.
2) Stay Hydrated - Staying hydrated is extremely important for regular bowel movements. If you don’t stay hydrated you can become constipated which is terrible for your hemorrhoids (1).
Staying well hydrated is also import for general health.
3) Don’t Strain Too Much During Bowel Movements - Following #1 and #2 will help prevent you from straining too much. Be aware of your toilet time.
Straining on the toilet seat can cause you to increase the pressure and worsen your hemorrhoid pain (2).
You don’t want to stay on the toilet all day, yet you most certainly don’t want to overstrain and rush.
4) Use a Hemorrhoid Cream or Suppository - There are creams and suppositories that are clinically proven to improve your hemorrhoid condition, reduce swelling and shrink your hemorrhoids.
Incorporating a cream or suppository can also greatly reduce or eliminate your symptoms.
5) Use a Hemorrhoid Wipe - Why clean yourself after a bowel movement with toilet paper when you can use a wipe soaked with medicine proven to help your symptoms and give you relief? Its a no brainer.
The medicine can actually shrink your hemorrhoid, cause a cooling effect and relieve itching. A common medicine found in hemorrhoid wipes is witch hazel.
Our hemorrhoid relief guide has a lot of information on products with Witch Hazel for hemorrhoids.
Plus, it really helps you prevent your hemorrhoids from bleeding by reducing irritation, itching and burning after a bowel movement.
Occasionally a hemorrhoid bursts and bleeds. When it does, your hemorrhoid shouldn't bleed for more than 10 seconds or so.
If you experience a lot of bleeding, get to a hospital and see a doctor right away.
Less itching means less scratching and irritation, so use those wipes.
6) Use a Hemorrhoid Supplement - Add a quality hemorrhoid supplement to your plan.
They fight the hemorrhoid from the inside out and are packed with compounds (astringents) that are shown to shrink the hemorrhoid tissue and give you relief.
They contain the same medicine as the wipes but in oral form and work wonders.
Hemorrhoid Supplements are an easy and inexpensive way to get rid of your hemorrhoids and work extremely well when paired with a cream or wipe.
7 )Take Sitz Baths as Frequent As Possible - Sitz bath are fantastic for relieving hemorrhoid symptoms.
It is believed that the warm water improves circulation. Taking occasional sits baths can also improve your condition.
Plus, the water reduces your weight and the pressure on the hemorrhoid.
So, instead of sitting and watching 15 minutes of television and putting pressure on the anal region, take a load off and take a sit bath.
There isn't much clinical evidence supporting sitz baths for hemorrhoids (3). However, we have found significant social proof that sitz baths are amazing for hemorrhoids!
8) Use a Hemorrhoid Pillow - Hemorrhoid pillows are donut pillows. The cushion is in the shape of a donut and the middle is empty.
These pillows are great for relieving pressure on the anal region and allowing you to sit more comfortably.
They are usually made with premium memory foam, and come with removable, washable covers.
9) Do All Eight Not Just One - Attack those hemorrhoids from all angles. A multi pronged approach can give you a cumulative effect on your hemorrhoids.
Plus, if one of these tips does not work for you, maybe the other 7 will. Take care of those hemorrhoids so that they are a temporary issue and not a chronic problem.
Make sure to use quality proven products; some of the home remedies out there can even be harmful for your condition.
Using quality proven products like Preparation H cream, HemRid Supplement, Tucks Pads and a Kieba pillow is the smart way to go.
For your sitz bath any Epsom Salt will do.
While some recommend Fiji water, any water will do so long as you stay hydrated.
How Do You Make Hemorrhoids Go Away Fast?
The fastest solution in forcing hemorrhoids to disappear is usually with the help of the above and fiber. While it’s best to find your fiber through meals, many doctors advise their patients with hemorrhoids to add a supplement to help contribute to their daily fiber intake.
Continuing with a fiber supplement and fibrous diet will also ensure that you do not experience another hemorrhoid flare-up.
