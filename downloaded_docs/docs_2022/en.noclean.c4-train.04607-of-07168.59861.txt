Tullio Simoncini: Of Rodents, Research and Baking Soda
4 Comments Posted by beatis on August 9, 2009
In the stats of this blog I can see from which pages people clicked to get to our blog. Sometimes I take a peek at these pages, as I did last week.
It landed me in a discussion on the ‚Äòcancer therapy‚Äô of Tullio Simoncini, which included some rather opinionated proponents of our Italian friend. A blog member named Byron stated that there was no evidence to prove Simoncini wrong, so I decided to tell them that research showed that sodium bicarbonate does nothing to stop cancer growth and was found even to stimulate it, giving the relevant link on our blog.
One of the Simoncini proponents then said the following:
I replied thus:
Again I was ordered to show evidence of baking soda not being effective in humans, at which I replied:
She then ‚Äòconcluded‚Äô I did not have any evidence for my claim:
so I tried again to explain:
Now this is where it gets rather embarrassing:
I must admit this left me quite dumbfounded. What is this person thinking? Does she think that scientists go hunting for rodents ‚Äì in woods and derelict houses perhaps ‚Äì in order to find ones that have cancer, which they then lock up in their labs to test their experimental substances on, such as baking soda? Or does she perhaps think the ‚Äòtoxic corrosive chemicals‚Äô as well as the baking soda were given for the bladder cancer? Does she really have no idea at all how rodents with cancer are come by?
Well, this is how it works. The poor little things are bred in the labs and given toxic compounds so as to induce cancer in them. Then they are given the experimental drugs, like sodium bicarbonate, to assess their efficacy against cancer. This is precisely what was done in the research I linked to.
In the English language, the attitude of people like anomdenet is aptly described as arrogance of ignorance.
What can one say to something like this? Not very much I‚Äôm afraid, and that is what I did:
Needless to say, there was no reply.
It makes me laugh, it makes me sad and it worries me deeply at the same time. Their lack of knowledge is not even the biggest problem, after all, we can‚Äôt all know everything about anything.
What really worries me though is that so many people, despite their obvious unwillingness to educate themselves on a subject, apparently have no problem whatsoever with dispensing their opinionated views on it to all and sundry.
Arrogance of ignorance indeed.

It‚Äôs amazing how often the baking soda story promoted by Simoncini rears it‚Äôs ugly head somewhere on the nets.
The discussion methods of the people who are ‚Äòhyped‚Äô is a kind of ‚Äòinternational language‚Äô I suppose.

It certainly seems that way!

A few days ago I somehow ended up on the following webpage, on the ‚Äòmiracle‚Äô of (liquid) chlorophyll: http://www.energiseforlife.com/wordpress/2009/02/11/health-benefits-of-liquid-chlorophyll/
The writer bluntly states chlorophyll is ‚Äòabsolutely identical‚Äô to haemoglobin, which is an easily checkable statement; even Wikipedia will show you (within minutes) that it is actually a very wrong statement.
So this dude Ramachandra shows up and very elaborately describes the errors in the blogpost. The general reaction, as usual: ‚Äòthank you for your insights, but you sound so angry with us‚Äô. for instance:
‚ÄúMany Blessings to All‚Ä¶ and extra blessings for Ramachandra who needs peace in his/her life.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt know which problem is bigger: the arrogance or the ignorance. I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs the arrogance, since the writer of the blogpost apparently didn‚Äôt see fit to even look up the most basic of claims he is making (up). His ignorance could be cured easily even by wikipedia, but his arrogance apparently makes him unable to do so.
Indeed it is an ‚Äòinternational language‚Äô, connecting a whole lot of woo-meisters.

My internet experience says that there‚Äôs a big rate of false ignorance on this misunderstandings. Some people simply DON‚ÄôT want to understand, compulsorily, only to be against the official science.
Nothing important, i have spent my phase of ‚Äúbeing discouraged‚Äù, it‚Äôs useless, now i‚Äôm in the much interesting phase of incessant work against the quack.

Bye.
