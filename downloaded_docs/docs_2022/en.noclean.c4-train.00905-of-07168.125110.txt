Bodyweight Buster Workout
March 2, 2015 By Dennis Heenan 10 Comments
The last several weeks, my workouts have taken on a new direction with a brand new focus.
And that focus IS FOCUS.
Here‚Äôs what I mean‚Ä¶
Instead of putting strength, cardio, and high intensity training together‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve started splitting them up.
For example, the first 15-minutes of the workout is all about strength.
The next 15-minutes is all about cardio and muscular endurance (usually with Metabolic Resistance Training).
The next 5-minutes is all about intensity (some kind of finisher workout).
By doing this, my results have been better than ever.
I feel stronger, faster, fitter, leaner, etc.
So today‚Äôs workout, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be focusing on. This one is 100% bodyweight but will definitely be a tough one.
Here‚Äôs the workout‚Ä¶
Bodyweight Buster Workout
Take 15-minutes to complete the circuit below. Really focus on contracting the muscles on each rep. Don‚Äôt rush through this. The goal is to have perfect form throughout and really FEEL the muscles working. Rest as needed.
1A) Bulgarian Split Squats: 15, 12, 9, 6, 9, 12, 15 reps
1B) Dive Bomber Push-ups: 15, 12, 9, 6, 9, 12, 15 reps
Once finished, rest 2-3 minutes then complete as many rounds as possible of the exercises below in 15-minutes.
Bodyweight Squats: 15 reps
Push-ups: 15 reps
Sit-ups: 15 reps
Once finished, rest 2-3 minutes then complete the optional finisher:
20-seconds on, 10-seconds rest of sprints in place (repeat 8 rounds or 4-minutes)
As you can see, we are separating our workout into parts.
Part one is all about strength, part two is all about muscular endurance and pushing our cardio, and part three is straight up intensity.
Definitely give this a go and drop a comment below on how it went.

If you are doing them daily or even a few times per week, perhaps. However, I only do sit-ups once per week then focus on other ab exercises. In short, don‚Äôt do them all the time. Just from time-to-time üôÇ

Love these workouts! Going to do this one next workout. I‚Äôm a 55 year old chiropractor that loves these bodyweight workouts, they keep me lean and muscular. Really enjoy your Super Hero workouts, too.

I‚Äôm so sick of hearing the sit ups are bad thing. If you have a bad back and sit-ups don‚Äôt agree with you then don‚Äôt do them. If your back is healthy and you enjoy doing sit ups then do them. The return you get form sit ups may be minimal or may not be, I‚Äôve coached a lot of fighters that swear by them for example. And in my opinion the lumber spine is meant to flex (as long as no load is involved). But the thing is this, sometimes you just gotta do stuff cos you enjoy it and it makes you feel good and the minimal amount of time people spend on sit ups (usually a few at the end) isn‚Äôt really going to have a negative impact if your a healthy individual, yet it could mean that individual leaves the gym feeling great and looking forward to their next training session.

I‚Äôm with you. I don‚Äôt see sit-ups as a bad thing. I don‚Äôt recommend doing them daily by any means. I‚Äôve been using them more lately in my training and seeing great results! Appreciate the response!

Too much reps of same exercise would nt this lead to overuse injury.and dit ups are bad for the lower back vertabraes.but i think the prinviple is sound.

I‚Äôve been doing these exercises for years. If you do them every single day, it might cause overuse. I‚Äôve never had any issues though. Sit ups are different for everyone. I don‚Äôt have any issues at all with them! Thanks for the comment!
