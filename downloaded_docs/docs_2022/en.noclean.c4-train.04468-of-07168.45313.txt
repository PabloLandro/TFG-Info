Penis Pain – Warning Signs of a UTI
Men are notorious for putting off going to the doctor, but when it comes to penis pain, most men would agree that medical attention is a must. While all types of penis pain should be evaluated by the doctor, some symptoms may indicate more serious conditions than others. A urinary tract infection (UTI), which is much less common in men than women, is an often-overlooked problem that can lead to serious complications if left untreated. But because they are rare, many men may not be aware of the symptoms, thereby prolonging the illness and increasing the chance of complications.
Routine physical check-ups are necessary to keep the penis healthy. In addition to maintaining an open line of communication with a doctor, daily penis care should be exercised at home to help reduce the incidence of painful penis conditions. A healthy penis - and the perks that come with it - are important to a man’s overall health and wellness.
Signs and symptoms of a UTI
Burning during urination
Frequent urges to urinate, often passing only a small amount of urine
Cloudy, milky urine
Reddish urine or blood in the urine
Unpleasant smelling urine
Severe back pain
Fever; this is a serious warning sign that the infection may have moved into the kidneys
Nausea or vomiting, also an indication of possible kidney infection
Risk factors & causes of a UTI
A UTI is caused by bacteria entering and moving up the urinary tract, thus causing an infection. Left untreated, the infection can easily move to the bladder or kidneys. Different types of bacteria can cause infection, including E-coli --a bacteria found in human waste. Improper hygiene can lead to bacterial build up in the genital region, making infection more likely. Unprotected sex -- particularly anal sex -- also exposes the penis to a high level of bacteria, increasing the chances of contracting a UTI.
Age is a significant risk factor in this type of infection. It is less likely for men under the age of 50 with an otherwise healthy penis to be affected; however, the likelihood of a UTI drastically increases in men 60 and over. Men who suffer from kidney stones, enlarged prostates, or other abnormalities of the urinary tract are more prone to infection. Men who use a catheter are also at a higher risk of contracting a UTI. Uncircumcised men are at increased risk, as bacteria can thrive in the foreskin, making proper penis care and hygiene especially important. Finally, men who have a suppressed immune system, those who are obese, and individuals with diabetes are also found to be at higher risk of developing a UTI.
Treatment
Treatment for a UTI is relatively straightforward. Once the doctor diagnoses the infection via a simple urine screen, a round of antibiotics is typically prescribed to eliminate the infection. Drinking extra fluids, especially cranberry juice, may also help flush the toxins out of the body, speeding up the recovery time. Untreated, severe UTI’s can lead to serious complications such as septic shock, fistula formation, recurrent infection, and even renal malfunction.
Penis Care
The best way to try to avoid contracting a UTI is to eliminate as many risk factors as possible. Men should always maintain proper hygiene of the penis area by washing with soap and water every day. Wearing condoms during sex also reduces the chance of bacteria being introduced into the urethra and offers a simple way to reduce the chance of infection. In addition to these precautions, using a natural penis health formula (Most experts recommend Man 1 Man Oil) can help boost the body’s immune function, reducing the risk of infection and at the same time improving the overall look and feel of the penis.
