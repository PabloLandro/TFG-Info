Shungite – The Crystal of Life
Posted on August 11, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
Shungite is a very powerful stone that is said to be the “Miracle Stone” and/or “the Stone of Life.
Shungite is known for its incredible healing and protection properties. I like to think of Shungite as the stone of transformation, because it is the stone of superpowers, the stone of alchemy, and due to its amazing properties, it is unlike any other stone . Trust me and this got me amused that it is the only crystal on which an entire congress was held in October 1996 in Russia and the research on fullerenes in Shungite received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry It is one of the only known natural material known to contain fullerenes, which are powerful anti-oxidants known for their healing and protective abilities and may even slow the growth of cancer cells.
“Shungite cures, rescues, purifies, heals, protects, normalizes, restores and even stimulates the growth. It kills and devours anything that harms people and other living beings, and concentrates and restores all that is good. The scholars who have studied Shungite in one voice declare, it is a miracle! ” From the book by A. Doronina “Shungite – the Stone-Savior”
Shungite Uses
Powerful Protection Crystal
If you are an energy worker or have a lot of interactions during the day with people (Sales Job, Corporate HR, Doctors, Psychiatrist etc.) and especially if you belong to the healing fraternity Shungite is a must have as it can be a powerful stone to wear daily to help protect you from absorbing other’s negative energies and not allow them to suck your own energies.
Powerful protective stone – shields the wearer from negative energies of all kinds, including psychic protection
2. EMF and Radiation Protection
Being surrounded 24/7 by electromagnetic fields, WIFI, energies from others and within myself, I will gladly keep this beautiful stone around to see the magic it can bring into my life and in my health. Buy Here>>>>
3. Shungite Water
Shungite has been used in medical treatment since the early 18th-century. Peter the Great set up Russia’s first spa in Karelia to make use of the water purifying properties of shungite, which he had himself experienced. He also instigated its use in providing purified water for the Russian army. The anti-bacterial properties of shungite have been confirmed by modern testing.
Put few pieces of Shungite in filtered water overnight and observe the change , the water is activated due to the fullerenes, you can use this water to wash face , it is said that it can help heal skin conditions like eczema, acne, Cell rejuvenation. Shungite activated elixir is available at our store.
Shungite Gem Elixir Recipe
Since Shungite is non toxic, the “direct method” of immersion can be used. Before doing anything else, once you get your very own piece of Shungite home, use a mild detergent and make sure you wash and rinse the stone thoroughly (remember many people have handled it before you got it). Once you have cleaned it, place your stone in a glass or plastic bottle and fill it with 32 ounces of fresh water. Place the bottle in a window to catch the sunlight, and leave it undisturbed the rest of the day. In the morning, pour off the water into another container and drink it throughout the day. If you prefer, you can also refrigerate the water to make it more palatable and refreshing. Refill the bottle with the Shungite with more water and repeat the process.
Shungite Healing Spa Bath
Many people use Shungite to create a healing spa in the home by placing it in bath or wash water. To make larger quantities of the Shungite gem elixir, get a larger container and add more (or larger) stones and water.
4. Shungite for Stress Relief
The Shungite crystals are also very beneficial for relieving stress and anxiety, soothing insomnia and boosting your overall energy level. Wear or carry a piece of Shungite with you always and see how it enhances your welbeing. Shungite Jewellery comes in handy too.
5. Shungite Pain Relief Mats
Shungite mat size 30cm * 40cm created on demand is – an indispensable assistant for passive massage of virtually any part of the body. The mineral normalises the work of the whole organism, restores the biological field and biochemical processes, increases the rate of circulation. The mat consists of a small crumb of Shungite and Selenite which qualitatively increases the hygienic indices of the product.
Shungite is relatively a new crystal to work with for me personally and also for the world as it is discovered a few decades back. As and when I get more information and experience on Shungite I will keep updating this blog. If you have any personal experience with Shungite please do share with me I am quite excited to hear from you.

Tiger Eye – Align With The Divine Vision
Posted on June 8, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
Tiger’s Eye is a most ancient talisman, as the name suggests is a mysterious and powerful, revered and feared crystal- an “all-seeing all-knowing eye,” crystal that connects you with your divine vision. It was chosen by the Egyptians for the eyes in their deity statues to express divine vision, and was believed to provide the protection of the sun and earth.
Linked to the magical tiger, the king of beasts in Eastern mythology, Tiger’s Eye portrayed courage, integrity and right use of power.
Tiger Eye Snapshot
Chakras - Sacral Chakra, Solar Plexus Chakra
Prana - Yellow , Gold and Red
Planet – Sun
Element – Fire, Earth
Gods - Sun, Ra, Gaia, Sekhmet, Bast, Freyja
Archangel - Uriel
A stone of protection, Tiger Eye may also bring good luck to the wearer. It has the power to focus the mind, promoting mental clarity, assisting us to resolve problems objectively and unclouded by emotions. Particularly useful for healing psychosomatic illnesses, dispelling fear and anxiety. Useful for recognising one’s own needs in relation to the needs of others. Balancing yin-yang and energising the emotional body, Tiger Eye stabilises mood swings, imbues us with willpower, purpose, courage and self-confidence, and releases tension.
Tiger Eye assists in the acquisition and preservation of wealth and abundance.
Tiger eye relieves stubbornness and defiance. It stimulates the flow of life energy, relieves pain and soothes.Its golden-yellow color represents the ability of manifestation, while its brown color the energies of the Earth. Thus, tiger’s eye helps in the manifestation of ideas on the physical level.
Tiger eye is a crystal of duality a crystal for light and dark, a great stone for cutting through illusion. The illusion and self limiting belief that you are not loved and supported.
Tiger Eye Courage Ritual
Draw a square on a paper preferably use RED color to make a square.
Now with a clear quartz laser crystal activate the square imagining a red light connecting the 4 cor ners of the square
Use intention ( I live a balanced life)
Now place 4 Tiger eye crystals on the 4 corners citing the affirmation ‘I am divinely guided in taking the right decisions in my life’
Now you can write the positive outcome of the situation which needs you to be courageous and put in the center of square and put a clear quartz point on it.
Leave the grid and pray for the wish to materialise rapidly and properly.
Tiger Eye loves to be charged under the sunlight on mother earth (soil)
Tiger Eye Elixirs /Essences
You can use tiger eye crystal to create crystal elixirs:
Courage
Divine Vision
Abundance
Sharp Perception
Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.
Mark Twain

Tourmaline Your Psychic Protector
Posted on May 25, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
Everyone can benefit from using Black Tourmaline. Life’s stressful situations can put us out of balance and this crystal can help center and ground you in times of need. Black Tourmaline is an excellent protection and grounding crystal. Black tourmaline has unique properties of being pyroelectric and piezoelectric.
The best use for these beautiful single terminated black tourmalines is to create a protective grid around your home or property. This crystal is great for grounding and protection from harmful EMF.
Psychic Protection for Yourself
Powerful Psychic Protection Banding using Black Tourmaline and Golden Pyrite. A beautiful combination of protective crystals. Wear your black tourmaline in your left hand (receiving hand) to shield or protect yourself from any kind of psychic attacks and wear a golden pyrite bracelet in your right hand to give away the energies of being enough and self worth to people who need it.
Creating your personal protection grid for restful sleep
Take 4 pieces of black tourmaline (polished or natural) place one black tourmaline inside a mason jar and put some salt and water. Create 4 such mason jars. Place them in a cross pattern around your bed. One jar with piece of black tourmaline is to be put near the foot of the bed, one piece around or on the headboard. Then place one piece to the right of the bed and the other piece to the left of the bed. This sets up a grid that you should find very effective. You can enter the grid when you get into bed or exit the grid when you get up and this will not affect the grid’s properties or abilities.
Change the water every alternate day and cleanse the jar and crystal under running water. Repeat with salt water.
Sealing your room/office or home to ward off negative energy/psychic attacks with tourmaline and selenite
Take 4 pieces of black tourmaline (polished or natural) place one black tourmaline inside a mason jar and put some salt and water. Create 4 such mason jars and put on four corners of the home/office. Place selenite in between two mason jars. like the below figure.
If you feel a room needs extra protection you can also grid individual rooms. Typically with grids you would energetically link the crystals together with a wand while stating your affirmation. Instead I’d suggest placing your crystals and state your affirmation while placing them.
You can use the following affirmation “This home and everyone within are divinely protected at all times.” — You can use whatever affirmation or programming you need.
Once the crystals have been placed, sit approximately in the middle of your house so you are as close to being in the middle of your house grid as possible. Relax and focus your energy. Visualise a virtual connection between your crystals. You can visualise a brilliant white , electric violet or golden protective, energetic shield around your house that is emanating from the crystals.

Lapis Lazuli – A Crystal of Royalty
Posted on May 21, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
Turn your ideas to reality using this beautiful blue crystal Lapis Lazuli it aligns the Heart and Mind and gives expression to the sacral chakra energy.
As per the esoteric teaching Dath, the throat chakra is the abyss to higher consciousness and it is a beautiful crystal to help stimulate the third eye chakra. You can find this teachings in the Pranic Healing course Spiritual Essence of Man
The stone of the gods to create/for creation purposes/crystal grids and to turn your dreams into reality through action. An excellent crystal associated with royalty Venus, Aphrodite, ISIS, Athena ….read on
Check out our Lapis Royale Collection
To the Egyptians, lapis lazuli represented all good things. In later periods, the Egyptian word for lapis lazuli, khesbedj, became a synonym for “joy” and “delight.” In the Book of Coming Forth by Day, lapis lazuli is connected with abundance as in this passage: “O you who sweeten the state of the Two Lands, you with whom are provisions, you with whom is lapis lazuli.” Another text repeats the association then connects the deceased, “the bull of lapis lazuli,” with the Star Goddess, Sothis. “I am the bull of lapis lazuli, unique and exalted, Lord of the Field, Bull of the Gods. Sothis speaks to me in her good time.” Because of its positive associations, lapis lazuli was used in many different types of amulets, but was especially employed for the heart amulet. Egyptian judges were known to wear lapis lazuli stones about their necks inscribed with the word “truth.”
22nd dynasty; Isis and Horus protect Osiris, seated on a lapis lazuli pillar
One of the beautiful ways the Egyptians used lapis lazuli
Today, we still associate lapis lazuli with some of the same qualities that the ancient Egyptians did. We, too, associate the heaven-blue stone with the heavenly qualities of spirituality and psychism. Just as the Egyptians associated it with joy, today’s metaphysicians say that lapis lazuli helps relieve melancholy. And just as the ancient Egyptians connected lapis lazuli with fertility, regeneration, and abundance, so we understand it to give an abundant boost to creativity.(Source:https://isiopolis.com/2014/10/05/isis-with-the-lapis-lazuli-head/)
Lapis Lazuli Snapshot
Colored Prana : Blue,Gold
Element: Water
Chakra :Throat, Ajna, Crown
God:Nuit, Venus, Isis, Sin;
Angel: Sahaquiel, Michael
Planet: Venus
Magickal Uses of Lapis Lazuli
Lapis can be used to attract spiritual love and infuse fidelity in a relationship. It is also used to strengthen your inner wisdom, psychic awareness and intuition.
Lapis helps to disconnect the conscious and subconscious mind and boosts intuition. Lapis lazuli is a very protective stone.
Healing with Lapis Lazuli
Body: Lapis helps relieve headaches and migraines, eases eyestrain and calms the nervous system. It is also used to help reduce inflammation. Do not use to make a traditional elixir due to the sulfur content of the stone.
Mind: Lapis lazuli helps to relieve depression.
Care and Cleansing
Sunlight can affect the color of Lapis lazuli. Use incense or a singing bowl to cleanse and recharge by laying on a clear crystal over night under the moon.
Love and Light!

Selenite – ‘Bring In the Light’
Posted on May 18, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
I recently came across selenite and instantly fell in love with the beautiful white light that it emits. The Selenite crystal is a light bringer and can light any area within you and around you that is dark so this is a perfect crystal to keep where you want light (energy)
It is gypsum and is a sensitive crystal on a Moh’s scale it is a 2 and is easily soluble in water. This crystal does not need cleansing and energising just some light to replenish. So keep it near a window where there is plenty of sunlight. You can also put it out in a few days to let it soak the light.
The word Selena is a greek word for moon and it is just as gorgeous as the full moon. You can see the beautiful selenite in the video it feel as if you are holding the moon. The energy is cooling and calming.
Selenite is a great altar piece as it is continually clearing low vibrational energies, working in pure love & light. It increases overall clarity and worldly awareness, as it shifts your thoughts to a higher frequency.
Simple word of caution: Selenite is a high vibration crystal and you need to be prepared to work with this crystal. When I say prepared it means expect a powerful detoxification at all levels and in every area of your life.
Selenite Snapshots
Colored Prana: Brilliant White Light
Element: Water
Archangel: Uriel
Planet: Moon
Chakra: All Chakras
Selenite crystals help to remove all energy blockages in the body and also the subtle bodies. If you place a selenite wand on any area of the body that feels sore or tight, for about 20 minutes, and you will feel the difference.
Selenite is also excellent for clearing and purifying jewelry and environments. I often place my crystal healing jewelry on a Selenite charging plate over night, and in the morning, it feels light and clean.
The selenite healing properties hold the energy of the light and it feels good. When I hold Selenite wand or stone, I know I am holding a piece of Mother Nature’s most magnificent creation. One of the most beautiful displays of Selenite appears in the Naica Cave, in Mexico. The largest one weighs around 55 tons and estimated to be 50,000 years old.
Test the crystal for yourself by holding it for 11 minutes and if it feels great try sleeping with it under the pillow.
Let me know your experience.

11 Ways to Crystallify Your Life
Posted on April 12, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
Today, more people than ever before are open to using healing crystals. These gems have thousands — sometimes millions — of years of the Earth’s history stored within them that you can harness to tap into your most magnificent self. But just like with any healing practice, diet, or exercise, a crystal routine that works for one person won’t necessarily work for another.
There are countless ways to work with these amazing stones.
11 ways to Crystallify Your Life
1.Using Crystals as Healing Tools
As a Pranic Healer I was introduced to crystals in Pranic Crystal Healing course and I loved how crystal lasers, disintegrators , extractors could reduce the healing time by 1/10th or even less. Mainly we use clear quartz crystals for healing but amethyst, rose quartz , black onyx can also be used by advanced healers based upon the patient ailment.
2. Crystal Jewellery
Crystal jewellery has been around the days of the kings and queens who adorned themselves with precious and semi precious jewellery. Jewellery is an excellent way to experience the energy of these beautiful minerals and have said to be effective in raising the vibrations of the wearer. One of the best ways to wear them is in the form of bracelets, earrings and also necklaces. Ensure to cleanse and charge your jewellery regularly for maximum benefit. Check out Crystal Alchemy Jewellery which is handmade and energized so that it vibrates at the highest frequency.
3. Carry them in your purse/pocket
The magic of crystals can be felt when you are constantly in touch with them. One of the best ways is to carry a crystal in your pocket or purse and pull it out whenever you need to center yourself or bring your attention back to the intention you’re working towards. I have a bowl of crystals and based on which one attracts me on a particular day I just keep it with me and use it as a touchstone to center myself when needed.
4. Create Your Sacred Space
Sacred spaces have quickly become popular — they’re now a must have in of yoga and meditation practice spaces. Using crystals in these calming displays adds a beautiful piece of earth energy and brings a peaceful, grounding presence. The crystals also remind you to reconnect with your intention each time you revisit your space.
Amethyst is one of the most popular crystals for sacred spaces, because it emits positive energy and fosters a deeper state of meditation. Crystal points can help you set an intention in your space. Simply place one point on top of a piece of paper with your intention written on it, and the point amplifies the intention into the universe.
You can do this for your goals and wishes too we will do this in our upcoming event This Wesak Make A Wish
5. Sleep Well with your Crystals
After a tiresome day you can choose to relax with your crystals , you can put them under your bed or your side table ensure the crystals are cleansed and charged. Then place them in your hand , close your eyes and just ask for what you need. It can be clarity, rest, peace, astral travel …just be creative with crystals and you will experience their presence.
Look for crystals that are of the Earth element, these are commonly browns, earthy reds and black. Crystals that are grounding or associated with the Lower Chakras are usually very helpful (sleep is a Lower Chakra activity).
Crystals that are calming, soothing, stress reducing, comforting and cleansing. For shapes try to stick to rounded forms like Tumble Stones, Eggs and Spheres. Some of the recommended crystals are Rose Quartz, Haematite, Red Jasper, Howlite, Selenite.
6.Bring positive energy to your décor
Healing crystals have been popping up in several home décor magazines, and for good reason. Larger crystals make for jaw-dropping statement pieces that work to shift the energy of a space. Amethyst, Clear Quartz for example, dispel negative energy and emits positive vibes — it’s the perfect addition to any room.
7. Use Crystals as the DIY Spa Treatment
Crystals can infuse many self-care routines with healing properties. For a DIY crystal treatment, bring your crystals into the bath with you or let them soak in the water you use to wash your face. The crystal energy will have a peaceful and restorative affect on your at-home spa day.
You can soak your rose quartz overnight in a bowl with some jasmine fresh flowers or rose petals and use that water to wash your face myth is beautiful women like cleopatra used these too.
8. Place crystals on your body
Putting crystals on your body has a completely different effect than simply holding them. If you’re working with a specific chakra, pick a stone that corresponds to that chakra and place it on your body. This serves to stir the energy around that chakra and bring up the emotions that you need to heal.
To start, use smoky quartz to give your root chakra grounding energy or place an aventurine over your heart to open your heart chakra to giving and receiving love. You can place a quartz crystal above your head to open your crown chakra for enlightenment and guidance. Keeping a stone over your third eye during this process can help you enter a deeper state of meditation.
9. Make Your Own Beauty Elixirs
You can create your own beauty elixirs for example rose water /lavender water readily available in market can be energized by Rose Quartz and Aquamarine small soft tumbles. You can also put your beauty products on a rose quartz plate to energize them.
10. Use them in Your Meditation
It is beneficial to choose a crystal that radiates healing properties or energies that are in alignment with what you want to achieve from your meditation. Setting an intention and meditating with your crystal each morning enhances and magnifies the expected outcome. When your mind is focused on your intention from the stillness of your meditation and energy of the crystal, you will have better motivation and inspiration for achieving your goals or receiving certain energy.
11. Amplify the Energy of your Kriyashakti
After you have written your Kriyashakti /wish you can place a clear quartz pyramid, point or cluster to amplify its energy this can help you in faster materialisation of your goals.
It is an exciting world of mineral kingdom with my own experience of nearly a decade I am exploring my own ways of integrating crystals in daily life. As and when I get any new way to use them will update all of you.
Spread the crystal light!

How Does Crystal Healing Work?
Posted on April 9, 2018 by Inner Alchemy I Sargam Mishra
Standard
“Consciousness sleeps in the stone, dreams in the plant, awakes in the animal and slowly becomes aware of itself in man.” (Pythagoras)
Crystals are part of the mineral kingdom and it has its own consciousness. Its own subtle energy. In Consciousness of the Atom (COA) Alice Bailey writes on page 102 about minerals: “that they manifest signs of fatigue, and that it is possible to poison a mineral and to murder it, much as you can murder a human being.”
Most of the crystal readers will agree with the above lines, when a crystal is impregnated with dirty energy one can see the dullness in the appearance and a heaviness in the energy.
The mineral kingdom is the lowest and most dense part of the world of material forms, or “the densest expression of the life of God in substance” (Esoteric Psychology I, EP I, p. 228). Here the process of condensation or externalisation of the etheric planes takes place. Minerals are a precipitation of etheric substance.
“The goal for all mineral atomic forms is this radio-active condition, the power to pass through all limiting and environing substances. This is initiation, or the entering into a state of liberation, for all mineral appearances, and the organising of all forms in this kingdom…” (EP I, p. 197)
The secret of this kingdom is transmutation
Crystals have healing quality because of its chemical element foundation, energetic vibration (subtle energy) which adds to its colour & properties. The therapeutic qualities of minerals and crystals act on our subtle vehicles, which in turn bring changes to the physical body and the consciousness.
All energies have a twofold nature; they can be perceived as having strong vibrations, also a frequency of vibrations, and the subtle energies adhere to this ruling. If 5,500 different minerals exist, then equally 5,500 different kinds of mineral energies also exist. Each mineral creates a specific energy and all these energies differ in strength and vibrational frequency. Encoded within them is a special agent called the Element of Harmony which acts to ensure that balance and equilibrium are maintained throughout all the processes encountered by the energy.
Holistic Healing with Crystals:
The first thing to consider is when you use crystals do not expect miracles to happen , crystals are allies they are beautiful energetic tools that work with your energy and intention. Michael Gienger postulates that the power of a crystal to generate light interacts with the cells of the physical body. What is clear is that crystals have an energy field that interacts with any other energy field near it.
At the most basic level, everything is energy. How it manifests is simply a matter of vibrational frequency and the crystalline structure (organic or inorganic) that enfolds it. The human body is no exception. It is a conductive energy system with crystalline structures in and around the blood, lymph and cells and it is repaired and maintained by a complex electrochemical system.
In other words, it runs on vibrations.
Time and distance have no relevance in crystal healing. Research has shown that the brainwaves of a healer and the recipient synchronise, or entrain, no matter what the distance. The same may well be true of crystals. This is how I use programming of crystals for healing long distance.
In order to understand healing let us look at the following considerations that can give a fair idea as to how crystals help in healing.
Points to consider:
Only one thousand millionth part of our body is matter. The rest is energy
The human body is around 75-55 per cent water, and that water is found in every part of the body, water is crystalline in nature therefore the human body is crystallin
Crystals generate, store and radiate energy
Quantum physics describes energy controls matter
Fundamental particles such as electrons can influence each other at a considerable distance
Each individual crystal carries the energetic resonance of the crystal type, no matter where in the world it may be
Everything is interconnected in such a way that the smallest piece contains the properties of the whole (the holographic universe)
Based on the above what I deduce is that crystal healing works by bringing back into equilibrium all the separate elements of the body, utilising universal energetic forces that are encoded into the crystals.
The energetic (auric) field of a crystal interacts with that of a human being or a particular environment, with each part influencing the other. This can work at a distance, powered by intention and consciousness.
In other words, as Professor John Wheeler puts it, ‘In some strange sense the quantum principle tells us that we are dealing with a participatory universe.’
Happy Healing
