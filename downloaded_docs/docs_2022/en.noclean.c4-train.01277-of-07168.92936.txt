Dieting is never easy! Anyone who has tried to diet knows the struggle of letting go of their favorite go-to food and drink options; I mean how can the idea of having to stop binge eating our favorite snacks be alluring right? Most of us love coffee and its varieties but what most don’t realize is how versatile coffee can be. It’s true! Coffee helps us to reduce our weight and can be a staple in any of our diets. You probably think of any number of salad items. So, how can coffee affect fat loss? The answer is: due to its caffeine content, it can increase your metabolic rate, meaning your body will burn more calories at rest. If you don’t want to stop drinking coffee and want to know how to take it properly then this article is for you.
Which coffee is best for weight loss?
When it comes to weight loss Americano and black coffee are the most suitable and mind you, they aren’t the same thing. In this article, however, we will be concentrating on the effects of black coffee ONLY.
Is coffee a good way to lose weight?
Coffee Contains Stimulants
Caffeine is also included in most commercial fat-burning supplements today as it’s one of the few substances known to help mobilize fats from your fat tissues and increase metabolism. Many biologically active substances found in coffee beans find their way into the final drink and several of them can affect metabolism:
Caffeine: The main stimulant in coffee.
Theobromine: The main stimulant in cocoa.
Theophylline: one more stimulant found in both cocoa and coffee.
Chlorogenic acid: One of the main biologically active compounds in coffee which helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates.
The most important of these is caffeine, which works by blocking an inhibitory neurotransmitter called adenosine. By blocking adenosine, caffeine increases the firing of neurons and discharge of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. This, in turn, makes you feel more thrilled and conscious. In this way, coffee helps you stay full of zipping when you would feel lazy and it improves your performance.
Coffee Can Help Mobilize Fat from Fat Tissue
Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, which sends direct signals to the fat cells, telling them to break down fat and it does this by increasing blood levels of the hormone epinephrine. Epinephrine aka adrenaline, travels through your blood to the fat tissues, signaling them to break down fats and release them into your blood. Though you only lose fat given that you are burning more calories than you consume through your diet.
Coffee Can Increase Your Metabolic Rate
Caffeine increases your resting metabolic rate, which means it increases the number of calories you burn at rest through its effects vary with age and weight.
Can coffee burn belly fat?
Firstly you need to be able to make the coffee healthy by not adding a bunch of sugar to make it the way you want it to taste. Instead, you could use diet friendly add-ons such as:
Stevia: This is a low-calorie sweetener that has become a firm favorite amongst those on a diet.
Almond milk: This option is a great replacement for regular milk, and means you don’t have to take your coffee black just because you’re on a diet!
Butter: this is a go-to drink for those on a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Bulletproof coffee works for a diet by escalating your fats whilst providing oomph and stimulus.
Keeping all this aside, you can’t expect the ingredients in coffee to be able to help you with losing belly fat without some effort on your part. This means that you can’t just sit around drinking coffee thinking it’s going to help you lose weight so while including coffee in your diet you also need to include some sort of exercise plan along with it. In the past, those who have tried using coffee for weight loss drank a minimum of two cups of coffee containing caffeine, per day, combined with exercise got reliable results as compared to those who didn’t include coffee in their diet and exercise plan.
What is the lowest calorie coffee?
The best low-calorie coffee would be Americano with less than 15 calories per serving with absolutely no sugar but it won’t sound appealing to someone who prefers a bit more flavor if you have Milk Frother just use it to blend all the milk and sugar so that it tastes more good. Below are some good options for people willing to add ‘healthy’ coffee in their diet
Cappuccino with semi-skimmed milk = 90 calories
Flat White = 120 Calories
Caffe Latte = 150 Calories
Espresso Frappuccino = 140 Calories
Espresso = 6 Calories
Caramel Macchiato = 145 Calories
We also have a list of high-calorie coffee drinks to avoid on a diet for your awareness:
Mocha Frappuccino (20oz) = 500 Calories
Iced Caffe Vanilla Frappuccino (24oz) = 500 Calories
Salted Caramel Mocha (20oz) = 510 Calories
Peppermint Hot Chocolate (20oz) = 550 Calories
Java Chip Frappuccino (20oz) = 580 Calories
White Chocolate Mocha (20oz) = 580 Calories
It must have been sad to see your favorite drinks in the ‘not to drink’ list but health is wealth so every measure to avoid obesity must be taken wholeheartedly. One thing to keep in mind is that even though caffeine can boost your metabolism in the short term, this effect is diminished in long-term coffee drinkers as they grow tolerant to it. If you’re mainly interested in coffee for the sake of fat loss, it may be superlative to cycle your coffee drinking practice. Perhaps a cycle of two weeks on, two weeks off is best.
