It is time for the “Lava Lamps” to step aside and make space for the hip and trendy Himalayan Salt Lamp; also known as Himalayan Pink Salt Lamp, Himalayan Pink Rock Salt Lamp, HPS Lamp.
But the market for Himalayan Salt Lamps is not only targeted to people who are all about the looks. The Himalayan Salt lamps supposedly have a lot of other benefits.
If you have a thing for lamps, artificial simulator, LED strips, you must have heard of this. In case you haven’t heard of this lamp, let me enlighten you.
The Himalayan salt lamp can boost your blood flow, improve quality and duration of your sleep, leave positive effects on the serotonin level of your brain, and calm your allergy or asthma symptoms. Yes, I am still talking about the the lamp. (1)
I know what you are thinking right now. You are wondering, whether science backs all these Himalayan salt lamp benefits or these just are a placebo effect. To get the answer to that, you need to keep reading.
Going through this article will let you know:
The true origin of Himalayan Salt Lamp.
19 benefits that you can get from a Himalayan salt lamp
Frequently asked questions about the lamp.
The True Origin of Himalayan Pink Rock Salt Lamp
The concept of miners working 1500 meters (4921 feet) deep underground, beneath the Himalayan foothills to gather up the pink rock salt is genuinely thrilling. I hate to ruin this fantasy of yours, but there aren’t any salt mines in the Himalayas!!!
Pink rock salt is typically deep-mined from West Pakistan or Poland. “Himalayan” is simply a descriptor. You have to admit, “Punjabi Foothills salt lamp” doesn’t have the same appeal as “Himalayan Pink Rock Salt.” (2)
However, the pink Himalayan salt crystals are deep-mined, then hollowed out and fitted with a bulb to produce both light and warmth. Himalayan salt rock lamps also are available in baskets of crystal salt blocks with a small electric bulb beneath.
The lamps have a wide range in color from light pink to pink with an orange hue, depending on the mineral concentration.
19 Benefits of Himalayan Salt lamp

Purifying air is probably the most well-known benefit, and the reason as to why people use them. Thanks to their incredible power to get rid of dirt, pollen, cigarette smoke, and different contaminants from the air.
“But how does a lamp do this,” you ask? “It’s simply an enormous chunk of salt with a light bulb within, right?”
Well yes, but no. There’s far more to that than that.
Himalayan salt lamps purify air through the ability of hygroscope, which means that they attract water molecules from the encircling setting and then absorb those particles. (3)
In the process of doing so, the water molecule traps and carry the foreign particles into the salt crystal. (4)
When the HPS lamp warms up from the warmth created by the light bulb within, that very same water then evaporates into the air. Therefore, the trapped particles of dirt, pollen, smoke, etc. stay fastened within the chunk of salt.
2. Neutralizing electromagnetic radiation
Now I do not want to get all technical here. Simply put, all the electronic appliances we use, emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. We are mainly living in the sea of EM pulse waves.
