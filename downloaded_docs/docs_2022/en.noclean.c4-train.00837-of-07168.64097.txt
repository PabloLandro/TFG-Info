“I suffer with chronic eczema-prone skin and use Westlab Dead Sea Salt at times when it is inflamed. The relief is immediate, and one bath lasts a week or more (a high concentration of salt is used). The results I have experienced with Westlab Dead Sea Salt is noticeably better than with other products I have tried.”
Andrew, West Sussex
“I cannot thank you enough for making this product available. Whoever reads this will never know the pain I was in and to be free from that, to hold my children, to run and weight train is like a rebirth. I use a 1kg bag of salts a week, travel with it and just an hours soak guarantees me pain free. Only Westlab cures me of pain. There's something in the composition or sourcing that presents finer quality over other makes and it's cheaper. It's like using a Lazarus Pit or fountain of youth. Westlab salts far outweigh medically prescribed drugs, physiotherapy, rehabilitation for me. I've saved a fortune, I can sleep again pain free, no side effects from drugs.”
Paul, Staffordshire.
“My favourite weekly treat!”
Sue, Herts
“Softened the water beautifully and eased our itching.”
Reviewer, Babyworld
“I have been a happy Westlab customer for many years. The main benefits I've found are improved sleep, they relax aching muscles after work or exercise and also help My fluid retention (which helps keep me looking trim and healthy).”
June, Australia
“I have been using Westlab Dead Sea Salt now for a number of years and I must say the relief I get when I bathe in it is fantastic. My psoriasis feels so much better. The salt smooths the surface of my skin and lessens the redness and soreness in preparation for applying ointments.”
Steve, West Yorkshire
“I'm so lucky to have found a good supplier of Dead Sea salt as lots of companies claim that their product is good quality but I can't find any better than what westlab provides. It made such a difference and now I don't bathe without it.”
Samantha, London
“The salts work very well - half an hour's soak relaxes my painful back, neck and shoulders. This not only helps me to sleep at night, but then also means I can wake up in the morning ready for the day ahead.”
Tom, Surrey
