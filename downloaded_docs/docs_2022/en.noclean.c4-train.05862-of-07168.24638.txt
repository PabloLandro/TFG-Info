Does Chewing Gum Help You Concentrate?

We may have at times noticed our lecturers coming to the lecture halls with gums in their mouths. Better yet, we may have observed that most doctors tend to perform some of the most critical operations while chewing. This got us wondering, does chewing gum help you concentrate? Well, join me as I seek to demystify this elusive question.
Does chewing gum help you concentrate?
One bubble gum research confirms that chewing gum helps stimulate the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain responsible for alertness and reaction. For this reason, people who chew gums were found to have a higher attention span than those who do not.
Chewing gum also stimulates the areas of the brain responsible for awareness and cognitive abilities. This is especially helpful for students who may wish to get the most out of school lessons.
However, while it encourages cognitive abilities and concentration, the benefits of chewing gum in school depends upon the type of gum in question. Generally, there are different gum flavors but not all may be healthy for our children.
Parents and teachers are advised to explore the best gum for kids and ensure that even while they seek to increase their children’s attention in school. The gums for children do not lead to any adverse effects. In this regard, they should invest in the most popular chewing gum such as the Eclipse Sugar Free Gum, the Trident Sugar Free Gum, to name but a few.
What are other health benefits of chewing gum?
Apart from enhancing concentration, people who chew gums have better memories and a higher level of alertness. This is due to the fact that the act of chewing gums increases blood flow to the brain and makes it function more effectively as well as stimulating the nerves that are responsible for arousal.
Another advantage of chewing gum is that it helps reduce stress and anxiety by relieving nervous energy and making us feel calmer.
» Chewing gums greatly contribute to the lowering of the stress hormone, cortisol. Helps curb acid reflux and heartburn through the production of saliva that facilitates swallowing. »
You should also chew gums if you wish to have a fresh breath. In this regard, a sugar free chewing gum is highly recommended due to the fact that it does not lead to any addition of sugar deposits on the teeth and therefore ensure there is no room for the growth of plaque bacteria which is responsible for a wide range of dental conditions.
An alternative for a sugar free chewing gum is a fruit chewing gum as it ensures the same results as the sugar free gums. However, studies show that chewing too much gum could trigger Temporomandibular Joint Disorder, a condition of jaw muscle imbalance which could greatly hamper our feeding and swallowing capabilities.
Lastly, weight loss is also one of the effects of chewing gum. Gums help manage voracious appetites and as a result, the chewer eats less and therefore stands a higher chance of losing weight. In addition to losing weight, these gums generally help us foster healthy eating habits.
There is obviously no limit the advantages of chewing gum. As regards the question, does chewing gum help you concentrate? Well, given the various ways through which it enhances concentration, we can most certainly admit with authority that it does.
