The Top Ten Benefits of Ginger
Ginger, botanically known as Zingiber officinale, is one of the top Philippine Medicinal Plants used as a remedy for various types of digestive ailments. There are so many reasons we should eat ginger, but it’s one superfood that is often overlooked. Here are the top ten motivating reasons to start including ginger in your diet on a regular basis.
1. Ginger root stimulates digestion:
Ginger is your new best friend for supporting everything regarding digestive health. Functional dyspepsia is the clinical term used to describe upper abdominal discomfort like acid reflux that is thought to be related to the slowing down of the digestive system. Ginger has been proven to help these issues. The body needs stomach acid to digest food; ginger can easily trigger the production of stomach acid and with proper digestion, which in turn aids weight management. A ginger's various phytochemical compounds also help absorb the nutrients and minerals in other foods in the gut.
2. Regenerates muscle energy and eases joint pain:
After exercise that involves weight lifting, it is natural for the muscles to lose strength and they require time to recuperate. Ginger assists to shorten the time of recuperation if consumed regularly. It can also minimise joint pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Taking 2 grams of fresh ginger, about 1 1/2 teaspoons, per day may help you have less delayed onset muscle soreness. It has been proven that crystallized ginger has similar effects if you prefer it.
3. Improves circulation and helps with sinus congestion:
Blood circulation is important for all ages; proper blood flow means heightened energy levels and fewer feelings of fatigue and sluggishness. Ginger also clears the ‘microcirculatory channels’ of the body, including sinuses. Why not stir up some ginger into your tea to get rid of throat and nose congestion.
4. Lowers blood sugar levels:
Ginger is excellent for diabetics and hypoglycemics. Combined with some cinnamon it adds extra warming power and lowers blood sugar levels as cinnamon assists with insulin insensitivity. Cinnamon also helps the cells of the body regain their natural healthy response to insulin thereby rebalancing the sugar metabolism in our body.
5. Lowers Cholesterol
Ginger has been found to reduce cholesterol levels—specifically reducing low-density lipoproteins (LDL). According to the American Heart Association, “LDL cholesterol is called ’bad’ cholesterol, a less desirable or even lousy cholesterol because it contributes to fatty buildups in arteries.
6. Ginger May Improve Brain Function and Protect Against Alzheimer's Disease
Scientists have long considered inflammation a symptom of degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Due to ginger having such high anti-inflammatory properties, the root of the plant may help decrease inflammation and improve cognitive function.
7. Ginger Contains a Substance That May Help Prevent Cancer
Ginger Contains 6-gingerol a Substance That May Help Prevent Cancer. In a recent study ginger treatment of cultured ovarian cancer cells induced profound growth inhibition in all cell lines tested. A 2012 study published in The British Journal of Nutrition found that ginger extract was effective at blocking prostate cancer cell growth.
8. The Active Ingredient in Ginger Can Help Fight Infections
Thankfully, due to powerful anti-fungal and antimicrobial compounds, ginger has been shown to assist in fighting infections or the common cold. It has been said that a useful mixture of hot water with two tablespoons of freshly grated ginger, juice of one lemon, and half a tablespoon of honey has cold-fighting benefits.
9. Ginger Powder May Significantly Reduce Menstrual Pain
Many women know how debilitating menstrual pain can be. However, many have not thought of using ginger to relieve the pain. Due to the root of the ginger having such strong anti-inflammatory properties, it can be helpful for easing pain from menstrual cramps. One study found that ginger is as effective as ibuprofen in reducing the pain associated with dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) in women.
10. Reduces Nausea
It is not commonly known that Ginger has been shown to be an effective remedy for nausea. Ginger has also been found to reduce the amount of nausea you might otherwise experience when feeling seasick or pregnancy. After surgeries, it’s common for some people to experience nausea and vomiting. Fortunately, researchers have found ginger to be an “effective means for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting.” Not only does ginger provide relief from post-surgery nausea, but it can also help cancer patients. In a study of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments, ginger was found to be effective in providing relief from nausea.

Reviews
"After a simple brief Rathi swiftly presented options and had our trip booked with ease. She also didnâ€™t try to constantly up sell or overstretch the budget which a lot of companies do (and is why I havenâ€™t used an operator for years!). Finally all of our documents were sent together making organisation super simple."
