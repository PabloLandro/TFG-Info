The condition is diagnosed based upon the clinical history, combination of signs and symptoms, and additional tests (that may include, in some cases, radiological studies and laboratory tests)
Methanol is found in the following products:
Antifreeze
Canned heating sources
Copy machine fluids
Deicing fluid
Fuel additives (octane boosters)
Paint remover or thinner
Shellac
Varnish
Windshield wiper fluid
What are the Causes of Methanol Poisoning?

How is First Aid administered for Methanol Poisoning?
If you suspect Methanol Poisoning, call National Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222 (or your local emergency number) and provide as much information as you can; even if the person does not have any symptoms.
Call 911 (or your local emergency number) if the person is:
Unconscious
Having chest pain or breathing difficulties
Suffering from drowsiness, seizures, vomiting, or has eye injuries
Or, if you are unable to obtain any information
Until medical help arrives:
Remove any poison from the mouth of the person, if he/she has swallowed the poison
Try to identify the poison, read and follow instructions as mentioned in the container (containing the chemical substance); and call National Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222
If poison is spilled on clothing, remove the clothing and wash the skin thoroughly with water
If the individual is not breathing or not showing any signs of movement, immediately start CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation)
DO NOT induce vomiting (by using ipecac syrup)
If the individual vomits, turn them on one side to prevent from choking
Try to locate the poison (or pill) container and take it to the hospital
DO NOT give anything orally to the person
Unless directed by the physician, DO NOT give any medication
Who should administer First Aid for Methanol Poisoning?
The person himself/herself or someone nearby may begin to administer First Aid. Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately as mentioned before.
What is the Prognosis of Methanol Poisoning?
Blindness is common and frequently permanent, despite medical care
The possible recovery depends on how much poison is swallowed and how soon treatment is provided
Methanol is an extremely poisonous substance. As little as 2 tablespoons may be lethal for a child, and 2-8 ounces (56-225 grams) can be deadly for an adult
How can Methanol Poisoning be Prevented?

Keep poisonous/hazardous chemicals, medicines, and other materials out of children’s reach
Keep all poisons correctly labeled and in suitable storage locations

Periodically check and ensure smoke detectors at home are functionally fit
What are certain Crucial Steps to be followed?
Call the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222), or your local emergency number
Even though, it does NOT need to be an emergency - take the patient to the hospital immediately
The patient may receive the following treatment at the hospital for Methanol Poisoning, while vital signs are being monitored:
Dialysis
Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effects of the poison
Medicines to treat symptoms
