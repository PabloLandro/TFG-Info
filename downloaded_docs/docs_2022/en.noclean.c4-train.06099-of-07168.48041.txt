If you have one or more of the above symptoms, it may mean that you do not have sufficient nutrients to replenish your body’s daily needs for a strong body structure. If left unaddressed, it may lead to more serious issues such as Osteoarthritis, Sarcopenia or eventually immobility.
What causes your body structure to weaken?
The lack of vital daily nutrients, ageing and wear and tear may result in the weakening of our body structure which in turn leads to issues such as weakened bones, joint stiffness and pain, degeneration of muscles and skin.
1) Collagen Deficiency
Collagen is the vital building block of our body, present in the bones, joints, tendons, ligaments and skin. Ageing causes collagen level to decline, making skin less elastic, leading to wrinkles and ageing skin. Supplementing our daily collagen needs ensures the cohesion, elasticity and regenaration of all our connective tissues.
2) Wear and Tear of Connective Tissues
Connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments are responsible for protecting our bones, as well as ensuring smooth movement. They also play a vital role in holding our bones, joints and muscles in place. Degeneration of connective tissues will result in inflammation, pain and stiffness and joint-related issues such as Osteoarthritis.
3) Low Bone Density
Our bones shape the body, protect vital organs, anchor muscles and store 99% of all the calcium present in our body. Ageing and low calcium intake may cause our body to reabsorb calcium stored in the bones, making them brittle in the process. This increases the risk of developing bone conditions such as Osteoporosis, a condition that results from low bone density.
4) Muscle Loss
The muscles of the muscular system keep our bones in place. As we age, our body begins to lose muscle mass. This is called Sarcopenia, it results in an inability to support the bones and skin. Many people often feel weak; especially in the knees and elbows. In advanced stage, it can lead to immobilty.
Key Nutrients for a Strong Structure
Other than ageing wear and tear, it is also important that we consume sufficient nutrients that are vital to maintain a strong structure. An insufficient supply of nutrients not only accelerate natural ageing process, lengthen healing time of body structure injuries, decrease cell renewal and even lower immunity.

Scientifically Proven Health Benefits of FlexC PRO
FlexC PRO supports overall joint health by reducing the effects of ageing on joints, wear and tear as well as the effects of calcium and sulphur deficiency.
1.1. Relieve Joint Pain and Stiffness
Peptan® Marine Collagen Peptides and OptiMSM® are effective in reducing joint pain, improving joint stiffness and reducing joint swelling. 94 women aged 40 to 70 with knee joint problems (Osteoarthritis) were administered 8g of Peptan® or placebo daily for a period of 6 months.
118 adults with mild/moderate osteoarthritis of the knee were given 1.5 grams of MSM, daily for 12 weeks.
1.2. Improve Joint Flexibility
The Lysholm score is linked to the improvement of knee movement in everyday activities. Increased score value means improvement in the condition. Elderly women with Osteoarthritis who were given Peptan® for six months observed improvement.
1.3. Reduce Joint Inflammation
Joint inflammation is a common symptom of Osteoarthritis. In a vivo study, inflammation in the knee was significantly reduced with administration of Peptan®.
Furthermore, Peptan®-treated groups also showed significantly lower levels of TNF, a protein signalling inflammation. These studies provided compelling evidence of Peptan’s® unique capacity to reduce inflammation in joint pain.
1.4. Stimulate Production of Cartilage Cells
The key components of cartilage are collagen and aggrecan. Collagen fibres are responsible for structure and strength while aggrecan serve as a lubricant to the joint.
Peptan® Marine Collagen Peptides (Type I Collagen) had been proven to be effective in increasing aggrecan (joint lubricant) and Type ll Collagen in joint. An in vitro study showed Peptan® is able to induce the production of primary cartilage cells which were cultured in different concentrations of Peptan®.
FlexC PRO supports strong and healthy bones, as proven in multiple in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials.
2.1. Restore Bone Mineral Density and Strengthen Bone
Low bone mineral density results when bone resorption (transfer of calcium from bone tissue to the blood) exceeds bone formation. Peptan® Marine Collagen Peptides and PURACAL® Calcium Lactate work synergistically to restore bone mineral density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
2.2. Stimulate Formation of Osteoblasts (bone cells)
An in vitro study showed Peptan® treatment promoted the formation of bone-forming cells (Osteoblasts) and stimulated their activity, while bone-resorbing cells (Osteoclasts) were suppressed. The control protein (BSA) did not demonstrate the same effect.
2.3. Prevent Bone Resorption
Calcium Lactate is scientifically proven to prevent bone resorption and increase bone mineral density.
Gong et al. Wei Sheng Yan Jiu. 1998 Nov 30;27(6):402-4.
Sarcopenia – the loss of muscle mass and function is a common concern that comes with age. Strong muscles are important for supporting bones and keeping the body mass from taxing the joints. They also help to keep joints in correct alignment. FlexC PRO is beneficial for preserving lean body mass and supporting muscle tissue recovery.
3.1. Strengthen Tendon
Collagen peptides were administered daily for 8 weeks and a significant increase in collagen fibril
diameter was observed. This indicates that collagen peptides help to strengthen the Achilles tendon.
3.2. Preserve Lean Body Mass
Nitrogen balance is the key to muscle growth. Negative nitrogen balance (nitrogen loss is greater than nitrogen intake) destroys muscle, causing its degeneration.
In a double-blind, crossover trial to compare nitrogen balance in elderly women aged 65 to 85. One group had whey protein supplemented to their diet and the experimental group had collagen peptides.
Results showed collagen peptides helped maintain nitrogen balance and preserve lean body mass.
3.3. Speed up Muscle Tissue Recovery
FlexC PRO is ideal for active and sporty individuals, with OptiMSM® – a vital building block for regeneration of damaged connective tissue, it protects muscles and joints from exercise-induced injury, reduces muscle soreness and supports faster recovery.
FlexC PRO helps to counteract the effects of ageing to promote a youthful appearance by erecting and restructuring the skin’s collagen network from within.
4.1. Reverse the Signs of Ageing Skin
By boosting and reversing the structural damage of the fatigued skin, Peptan® improves the quantity of skin collagen and subsequently reduces wrinkles, fine lines and restores tone and texture.
Peptan® improves skin firmness
In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial,106 women aged 40 to 65 received 10g of Peptan® or placebo per day for a period of three months. Results demonstrated stronger collagen structure and firmer skin after the intake of Peptan®.
OptiMSM® improves skin firmness and fine lines
20 healthy females randomised to take 3g of OptiMSM® or placebo daily for 16 weeks. Significant improvements were observed in skin firmness and texture, reduction of crow’s feet.
4.2. Smooth Fine Lines and Wrinkles
The study was conducted in France to evaluate the effects of oral Peptan® Marine Collagen Peptides on cutaneous properties. 47 women aged 35 to 55 were given 10g of Peptan® powder mixed with liquids for 84 days observed showed significant decrease in the volume and depth of wrinkles.
4.3. Boost Skin Hydration Level
Peptan® in FlexC PRO replenishes the skin’s collagen reserves to keep dry skin smooth and hydrated.
In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 33 women received 10g of Peptan® or placebo per day for two months. It was found that Peptan® helps counteract the appearance of dry skin
by increasing the skin's moisture levels.
Collagen deficiency is evident in the hair and nails. Especially in the ageing years, falling hair, hair breakage and thinner nails are common problems.
Peptan® Marine Collagen Peptides and OptiMSM® help strengthen hair shaft, promote hair and nail growth, and improve the quality to reduce breakage during the lifespan of the hair. It promotes:
• Healthier, stronger and faster-growing hair and nails
• Improved thickness of nails with less splintering

Q. Why choose FlexC PRO over other bone and joint supplements?
A. Our body structure is made up primarily of joints, bones, muscles, tendons and skin. Single-ingredient supplements like calcium or collagen are single benefit specific and inadequate to help maintain a strong body structure. FlexC PRO is a multi-functional formula combining the prowess of 3 highly researched ingredients - Peptan® Marine Collagen Peptides, OptiMSM® and Puracal® Calcium Lactate to support healthy joints, bones, muscles, skin, nails and hair, all in one formula. Its high absorbability and bioavailability makes it an ideal supplement for all ages, especially those with a weak body structure.
Q. Do I need to take other supplements on top of FlexC PRO for joint and bone health?
A. Together with a healthy lifestyle and diet, one sachet of FlexC PRO is sufficient to maintain the health of your body structure. However, should you have any medical conditions, we advise that you consult your health practitioner before taking any supplements.
Q. Can I take FlexC PRO with other supplements or medications?
A. Yes. However we advise a 2 hour gap before or after medication in order for FlexC PRO to work optimally.
Q. Can I take FlexC PRO on a long-term basis?
A. Yes. Formulated in powder form, FlexC PRO is free of coating or gelatin, unlike other tablet or capsule form of collagen, MSM and calcium supplements. It is also free from additives, colouring and fat-free. As our body and joints go through wear and tear daily, taking FlexC PRO on a regular basis helps to strengthen the body ‘s physical structure with added improvement to skin, hair and nails.
Direction of use
Mix 1 sachet into 250ml of water or your favourite beverage (up to 120°C). Consume one sachet per day for at least 1 to 3 months for best results.

I started with FlexC PRO because I was having joint pain in my left knee, and I had difficulty walking the stairs, even though I am just in my mid-thirties. Initially, I visited a doctor in Polyclinic, and he said that it might be due to wear and tear because of my frequent trekking. I was being referred to a specialist in SGH to check my joints, but the appointment was 3 months away. While waiting for it, my friend introduced me to consume FlexC Pro and to my surprise, it works really well! My knee pain subsided before I get to see the specialist, and I am no longer in pain now. I still continue with this product because I love its rich calcium and collagen content, for maintenance purpose.

I don’t like the smell initially. I just share one sachet with my husband daily, we mix it in soya milk. My legs are getting stronger and skin also improved.

I find it’s a such a good buy! The Calcium supplement alone cost me 40 over bucks. High quality collagen also is expensive. This product contains collagen, MSM and calcium. So in total it saves me a lot of money and not having to buy so many different products

I came across this product in facebook and I ordered for my mother. It really works! My mum’s joint pain reduced. I am so happy to see she can now go out catching up with friends more often.

Since I started on this about 2 months ago, my knees experienced less pain when I climb up and down the stairs. I am also able to do some trekking without pain. This has helped me to keep more active.
