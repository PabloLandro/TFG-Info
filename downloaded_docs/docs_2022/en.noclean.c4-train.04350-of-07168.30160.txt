Good day Perry, I have used body creams that doesnâ€™tâ€‹ contain hydroquinone claim to lighten the skin and they have worked.. so if only hydroquinone lightens how come it works..p.s cream contains claims ingredients like sambucus Nigra flower extract, tilia tomentosa extract, glycyrrhiza glabra root extract..

Only Hydroquinone has scientific proof that it works. Other things might work and anectodally people might believe they do. I was just stating what has been proven to work.

As you said that it is only the Hudroquinone that really works in the lightning of the skin, but it is banned in some most of the coutries and is know that it is cancerous, is there any way that this ingredient can be used in a more docile manner by mixing with some other ingredients in order to get the same results but safe?
Regards.

You need to find out what the local regulations are. Hydroquinone is not completely banned. In the EU it is only available via prescription. In the US it is limited to OTC products. You can use lower amounts but that makes it work less effectively.

Interesting. The way the monograph works for acne products is that the researchers will have to show much more data to get it included as a viable active which formulators could use.

Thank you so much sir for this wealth of information. But my question is if cosmetic products cannot penetrate the stratum corneum, how then does all these skin lightening creams produce a visible result. The main claim of skin lighteners is that it reduces melanin and melanin is produced by melanocytes in the stratum basal. I would really appreciate your take on this
Reply
Perry Romanowski
Hello Anita â€“ Well, for the most part skin lighteners donâ€™t work. The only one proven to work is Hydroquinone and that ingredient is able to penetrate deep enough in the skin to affect melanin production.
