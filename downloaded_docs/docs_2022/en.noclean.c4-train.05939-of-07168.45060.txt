Chewing Gum Might Make You Reach for the Chips
A new study finds that chewing minty gum can actually lead to making poorer food choices.
By Lauren Le Vine
Mar 20, 2013
Disappointing news for dieters who chew gum to aid weight loss and the entire REDBOOK staff: A new study in the journal Eating Behaviors researched the effects of chewing gum on food intake and found that it had no effect on the amount of calories consumed (and actually increased meal size in some cases), it also may lead to making poorer food choices. Chewing mint gum before meals made participants reach for foods like chips and candy instead of fruits or vegetables. Researchers attributed this to the effect menthol (the ingredient that makes gum minty fresh) has on taste buds — think about how an orange would taste right after brushing your teeth.
There is a silver lining, though: This study only measured the effect of chewing gum before meals. Scientists wanted to debunk the pervasive and conflicting diet myths that chewing gum before a meal can either suppress your appetite or actually makes you hungrier because it gets digestive juices flowing. Chewing gum after a meal is still a satisfying way to cleanse your palate, and now we know why you won't want to eat again after your post-meal chew.
