[post_content] => If you happen to observe some loosely hanging soft pieces of flesh on the skin, they are likely going to be skin tags. Don't panic, however. The tags will not grow into anything serious.
For a condition or infection to be contagious, it has to have an identifiable cause, something like a virus or a parasite. This is not the case with skin tags. For this reason, the tags cannot be spread from one person to another or to other body parts.
Are skin tags contagious; what causes them
Going by the parts of the body that they occur most, the causes of skin tags is thought to be friction. For example, you will find them on the groin, underarms, eyelids and back of the neck.
[RELATED]
All these body parts have one thing in common. They are prone to friction, either by rubbing against other body parts or against clothes. A bit like toenail fungus, skin tags also prefer moist body areas. This again has everything to do with friction. Moist areas are likely to offer resistance to motion, which is a longer description of what causes friction.
It will not be unusual if a skin tag is to be spotted in a less obvious part such as fingers or even on the face. This is especially for smokers and people with other conditions that weaken the skin.
Why are skin tags contagious; guide information
As mentioned earlier, no microorganism or parasite is responsible for the development of skin tags. You therefore will not have them popping all over the skin or on other people around you courtesy of the initial skin tag.
However, there are some predisposing factors that encourage their development. If these factors are exacerbated, skin tags will occur more frequently. The factors include:
Use of steroids – those who use steroids for a long time have been shown to develop the tags more frequently
Age – as we age, the skin loses most of its collagen tissues. Collagen is what keeps the skin tight and free from wrinkles
Pregnancy – hormonal changes and rapid gain of weight in pregnant women encourages their development
Diabetes – lovers of sugary foods and saturated fats develop a kind of attraction to skin tags
Obesity – with all the flaps and extra skin in obese individuals, little can be done to keep skin tags from developing
Are genital skin tags contagious without treatment
Most genital infections are known to be contagious. But as we have seen, skin tags are not infections. Even if it is to occur on the penis or on the vagina, it will not be spread.
Treatment for skin tags is usually sought for aesthetic reasons.
[RELATED]
In other situations, a skin tag can sustain an injury, which will make it prone to infections. In such cases, it will get painful and open up for conditions such as skin ulcers.
Guide information; Are genital skin tags contagious and best medicine
As long as being contagious is involved, skin tags will not cause any complications. But like any other condition, they can be a nuisance and even grow to the size of a grape. No one is willing to carry a fig-sized tag somewhere near their genitals or even on other body parts.
In regards to the best treatment, the following options are available:
Clinical removal - doctors can remove skin tags pretty easily. They can freeze them, cut them off, burn them or poison them with laser. Skin tags removal cost in a clinic will increase with the number of tags to be removed.
Removal at home – remedies such as tea tree oil are very effective against skin conditions including white spots on teeth. They are even more effective when used in combinations. For example, a paste of baking soda and castor oil will get rid of pimples and skin tags in a matter of days or few weeks.
Over the counter kits – a TagBand for example is a much better version of the thread you would use to tie a skin tag with at home. Wart removal freeze kits on the other hand will also work in clearing skin tags off the skin. You can also try patches and creams containing salicylic acid.
Are skin tags contagious without ringworm medicine?
Ringworm on face is likely to spread to the hands and any other body part that comes into skin to skin contact.
If a skin tag is occurring close or on a body part with ringworm, it will not spread but will increase the chances of the ringworm spreading. This can be seen in obese individuals who have ringworm and skin tags between skin folds on the belly.
[RELATED]
During treatment for skin tags, chances are high that fluid or cotton balls you are using will touch another body part. This will be source of spread.
To prevent such cases, use remedies known to fight both bacterial and fungal infections such pas tea tree oil. Other than being effective, the oil can also be used on sensitive body parts such as removing a mole on the nipple; but not when pregnant.

[post_content] => It isn't really a matter of debate that a doctor can remove skin growths or common infections such as toenail fungus easily enough. The problem is that you will likely have to part with more than $100. Chances are high that scarring will also be left behind.
Moving away from the issue of finances, skin growths such as warts or even skin tags will keep coming back even after you have had them removed. These factors combined, over the counter options provide a more strategic option.
Do OTC wart, skin tags and moles removal products work?
Top reviewed over the counter wart removal kits and products produce effective results even for skin tags and moles as long as they are used correctly.
It is natural to be skeptical when it comes to over the counter products. Luckily, the basis on which such top reviewed products work is largely understood. You will not have to worry about hidden ingredients or wasting your money on garbage products.
Which are the best over the counter removal medications?
Creams are the most popularly used over the counter wart removal medications. The secret behind their effectiveness is a compound known as salicylic acid. When an acid is applied on the skin, it works by corroding the top layers. This can be a bit scary but only when dealing with strong acids.
[RELATED]
Salicylic acid is very mild. In fact, it is not even used in its purest forms. In regards to the best OTC removal medications for warts, go for creams or ointments containing 17% of the acid.
Some other ingredients you can look for include alcohol, ascorbic acid and castor oil. Castor oil can in fact be used with baking soda against corns and calluses.
Which over the counter wart removal cure to buy?
If you are stuck with not knowing which the best OTC freeze product to use against warts is, here are some of the features you can look for:
Ease of use
A product that that doesn’t need too many precautions and preparations is better suited. Remember that you will be using it for a couple of days or weeks.
Customer reviews
Wart Mole Vanish, Dr. Scholl’s Freeze and Compound W are good examples of top reviewed freeze compounds. You can start from there and see what other users have to say about a removal product that has your attention.
Duration taken to work
Of course you're too smart to go for a product that claims to work overnight. On the other hand, a product that requires more than 4 weeks to work may not be the one to settle for. 2-3 weeks will do.
Sensitivity
Most of the available products will are not to be applied on sensitive areas such as eyelids but will work for hands and hardy body parts.
Which is the best over the counter skin tags removal product?
OTC products used against warts also work on skin tags. However, there are additional options in the case of skin tags removal. You can choose from any of the following:
Wart removers
The same salicylic acid that corrodes warts will have the same effect on skin tags. Remember to look for products containing 17% of the acid and ones that have been top reviewed.
[RELATED]
TagBand
Since a skin tag attaches to the skin through a stalk, a string can be tied at the point of attachment to literally choke off the tag. The problem is that it can get a bit cumbersome and painful to tie the tag with a thread. The TagBand device provides a more friendly and customizable option.
Tea tree oil
Although there are other remedies that can work, tea tree oil is perhaps the best. It will neither leave scars behind nor will it irritate your skin. To add on that, the oil has been known to fight fungal infections and can be used against white spots on nails.
Homeopathic remedies
All natural removers have been included in this category. Their main selling point is based on the claim that they clear off skin tags and leave no evidence in form of a scar behind. Since there are an awful lot of them available today, the best approach is to see what previous users have to say about them. Amazon.com client reviews section can help.
Which is the best over the counter mole removal and cure?
Like warts and skin tags, there are quite a number of over the counter mole removal and cure products. We will need not repeat the main mode of action.
Unfortunately, OTC removal products for moles have not had a lot of success. This is the part that you will really need to read what previous users have to say.
Amolis is a good example of an OTC mole remover. Most of its users affirm that it really works. In fact, you can use it against the other two skin conditions that we have discussed above. The important thing is to follow guidelines provided by the producer.
[RELATED]
Another such product is Tag No More. While it has been noted to require patience before desired results can set in, a significant population of clients did find it effective enough.
You can check out reviews for other OTC mole removal products such as tea tree oil. The best place to get genuine reviews is on external sites such as Amazon. As you will find out pretty soon, testimonials on the official product websites will rarely say something negative about the product they are attempting to sell.
Other over the counter skin tag, mole and wart removal options
The products we have been discussing so far are best used for growths on hands, neck and such hardy areas. For a genital wart, mole on face or skin tag, you will have to consider twice before using such products. In any case, you don’t want some acid, however mild, finding its way to your genitals or eyes.
That brings us to freezing the skin growths at home. Over the counter, you can purchase a freeze kit that works almost similarly to liquid nitrogen used in clinics for freezing skin tags and moles.
Such freeze kits make use of butane. It comes in spray which you can apply directly on the growths. The drawback with this cure option is that it may require quite a number of applications before being effective as needed.
The nitrogen used in clinics is about 3 times colder than OTC freeze kits. This enables it to penetrate deep into the skin and produce effects faster.
So which is the best over the counter removal product?
Some people will tell you that over the counter remedies are overrated. Others will tell a tale of the many such products they have tried without success.
For instance, remedies such as castor oil are sometimes advertised as potential syringoma treatment. If you are to ask any professional, they will confirm that syringoma hasn’t shown much response to such remedies, or even to clinical medications.
[RELATED]
The point we are trying to drive home is that a product about which a few people are saying effusively nice things may not work all that well for you. However, many genuine reviews confirming that a product is actually effective can be relied on.
If you are certain that the skin condition you are aiming to treat is not a case of infection or symptoms of an underlying health condition, you can try any top rated over the counter available product. More specifically, try some of the products we have mentioned here and other top rated ones that you will come across on genuine reviews. A bit of patience is necessary and a lot of sticking to the provided guidelines by the manufacturer.
If all those fail to work, your dermatologist will provide a way forward. In any case, skin tags, moles and warts are easy to get rid of.

[post_content] => The rectal area is the region in and on the anus. Discussing skin growths or conditions affecting such an area, especially skin tags and warts, can be stigmatizing and embarrassing.
The biggest problem with rectal skin tags and warts is that they are notoriously itchy. There is no way you can ignore them or completely overcome the urge to do some scratching. If that will not be embarrassing enough, it will invite all types of issues related to hygiene on top of irritating them further.
What causes rectal skin tags?
Although some similarities are shared between rectal skin tags and skin tags on other areas, the former differ a bit. A penis skin tag will not encourage the development of another one on the rectal area even after sex. In short, they are not contagious.
[RELATED]
In regards to causes, friction and moisture occurring on the rectal area is to blame. Any of the following will encourage their development:
Hard stool – passing hard stool is mostly associated with hemorrhoids but can also produce skin tags. It is always recommended that you address any issue contributing to constipation.
Anal sex – we need not go to the details in this case. Without lubes and such things, too much friction will be experienced in the rectal area.
Pregnancy – a couple of changes that take place during and after pregnancy encourage skin tags, not only on the rectal area but also other body parts such as the groin.
Identifying rectal skin tags in pictures
It can be quite demanding if you are to identify rectal skin tags without touching them. In this case, you can try taking some pictures and compare.
On pictures, you are likely to observe a loose skin projection that takes the color of the skin. There may be several of them in a cluster or just a single one. Unlike hemorrhoids, skin tags will be on the skin and projected outwards. Think of what a skin-colored rice grain or a grape would look like.
Rectal skin tags removal
Even when on the rectal area, the tags will not be contagious or get to develop into complicated genital infections. The problem is that they may interfere with anal hygiene. They are also prone to injuries and in that case encourage genital infections. This is not even mentioning the issue of pain and itching.
Use of remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for a cold sore on chin, is definitely not an option. Even if such remedies have been known to be effective, the rectal area is far too sensitive for such products.
Using a TagBand or a dental floss to ligate the skin tags is a better option. This can be done at home, to address the issue of stigmatization.
If you are open to clinical removal, a doctor can get rid of the tag quite easily. This can be achieved through surgical removal, compounds to freeze skin tags or burning. A quick surgery is much better, since then you will not need more than one appointment.
Laser treatment can be used when the tags are not responding to other treatments or when surgery is not an option. It is more effective in demanding treatments such as syringoma removal.
What causes rectal warts?
Rectal warts are a type of genital warts. They appear on or in the anus. In initial stages, you will hardly observe any symptoms, not even pain or itchiness. In fact, you may not even notice that they are there.
[RELATED]
Without treatment, rectal warts will gain mass and may even spread to other genital areas. They will also be prone to injuries and irritation. This will end in a painful, bleeding and itchy rectal area. On pictures, large rectal warts will resemble cauliflowers. They usually form in clusters and are very soft upon touch.
Rectal warts treatment and removal
Over the counter rectal warts treatment products are not recommended. Instead, topical medications will be prescribed by a doctor to get rid of them.
Some medications will need to be applied in a clinic while others are to be taken at home. The warts usually start showing signs of healing after 2 weeks.
Large rectal warts removal surgery
If the warts have grown too large, they will rarely respond well to topical medications. This also happens for warts too deep inside the rectal area.
In such cases, a doctor will most likely opt for a surgery to remove them. Such a surgery will not take long and the patient will be released on the same day after the operation.
Other removal methods such as freezing, burning and use of laser can also be possibilities. The problem with these is that several appointments will be needed.
How to prevent rectal skin tags and warts
For skin tags, prevention revolves around avoiding causes of friction on the rectal area. Measures such as not wearing too tight clothes and taking regular showers can help.
[RELATED]
Pregnant women should ensure that delivery occurs in a clinic or under the supervision of a professional. Sudden pressure sustained during delivery encourages rectal skin tags.
Just like nail fungus and such, warts are infections. This means that their cause is identifiable. Therefore, prevention measures revolve around containing the HPV strain that causes them. Anal sex, for example, will transmit the virus.
Warts are more common in people with low immunity. This can be encouraged by diseases such as diabetes and HIV. In such cases, see your doctor for prescription medication meant to contain the virus.

[post_content] => The area around and in the anus fosters the development of several skin growths and conditions. These include warts, hemorrhoids, anal fissures and skin tags.
Any of these conditions can be confused with another. For this reason, you may need to browse through available images and pictures for comparison.
Guides and information on perianal skin tag causes
Perianal skin tag causes revolve around factors that encourage a lot of friction to the areas around the anus. Any of the following factors will encourage them:
Pregnancy – changes in hormonal levels endured during pregnancy are a common cause of skin tags. During delivery, a lot of friction and pressure will also contribute.
Anal sex – the walls of the anus are bound to endure a lot of rubbing. This will certainly create the friction we identified as the main cause of skin tags.
Constipation – just the same way it causes hemorrhoids, it will encourage tags to form on the skin of the anal walls.
Obesity – this need no explanation. It has everything to do with pressure sustained on the buttocks when siting.
Perianal skin tags removal
Perianal skin tags removal is best done in a clinic. In this case, a doctor will perform a quick surgery to cut off the tags. It is a simple operation and a patient will be given leave on the same day the operation is done. Some post care services will be needed to ensure that the area doesn’t become infected.
[RELATED]
If you are not open to surgery, the same method used to freeze off moles can be used. If all those fail, laser therapy will be considered. It is more effective for clustered skin tags and when surgery is not open to consideration.
Perianal skin tags removal at home
You may be considering options to remove perianal skin tags at home. Well, there will be difficulties in achieving that. The fact that they are perianal means that the use of over the counter creams and products is advised against. Even remedies such as tea tree oil, which show so much success in treating conditions such as cold sores in the mouth, are not encouraged.
The best option in treating such skin tags at home is to use a TagBand or a dental floss to ligate them. Since this may obviously present a challenge unless you are spectacularly flexible and have strategically placed mirrors, you can have a friend or partner help you to place the ligation. Either that, or you can go to a doctor who is not only more qualified to do this, he is likely to be less horrified by the procedure than your friend or partner.
Guides and information on Perianal warts symptoms
Perianal warts symptoms are rarely felt until the warts have grown in size or have spread. In fact, an outbreak can occur and naturally heal without you ever noticing. It is common in guys with a very active immune system.
Just like skin fungus will keep spreading without treatment, perianal warts too will appear on other body parts courtesy of the initial development.
When they occur, perianal warts symptoms and common features include:
Fleshy growths around the anus
The growths can be flat or raised
Clusters will continue to form from the initial growth
With close inspection and as seen on on images, the growths will share resemblance with tiny cauliflowers
Normally, the growths will not hurt, itch or bleed. The reverse happens when they become irritated and infected.
Perianal warts treatment and removal
Perianal warts treatment is quite demanding. The problem is that you cannot apply some essential oils or cover them with a duct tape just like that. No one is willing to try options such as a syringoma cream, which contains an active acid, on their genitals. Such attempts will invite other more serious infections of the genitals.
[RELATED]
Luckily, there are a couple of prescription medications that are quite effective for small and young warts. Some will be applied by the doctor while some are to be taken routinely at home until the warts clear off.
A doctor may choose to have the warts removed by surgery. This is the fastest and most effective method. They can also be poisoned with laser beams or frozen. Warts that do not respond to topical medications are removed this way.
Over the counter perianal warts and skin tags removal
If you are considering some over the counter removal options for perianal skin tags and warts,  very few options will be open for consideration.
Well, someone may suggest a remedy such as tea tree oil. In any case, it works perfectly on white spots on toenails or even warts on hands. These are hardy body parts however. It is not the same with the anal area.
For a penis skin tag or one on the anus, the best over the counter removal product is a TagBand device or a dental floss. You can also try a freezing kit for sole and small skin tags.
In the case of perianal warts, freezing at home will work, but only for very small warts. You can use such a method when the warts are identified in very early stages.
Other than that, just have a doctor treat them or wait for them to go away naturally. The important thing to remember is that they are very contagious, both to other people and to other genital areas.
Prevention information for perianal skin tags and warts
For skin tags, avoid habits that will encourage rubbing against the anal area. Avoid wearing tight clothes and thongs for example. You can review the causes identified above again to know what to avoid.
[RELATED]
In the case of warts, they will keep coming back even after treatment. Since the body naturally fights active HPV, measures to improve the immune system like healthy lifestyles and not smoking will help. Sex is the main way in which warts are spread. You may want to avoid that or take the necessary safety measures. The problem with warts is that they can be contracted after skin to skin contact even when sexual intimacy is not involved.
Also, it can help to get tested for warts or any related condition. In this case, a doctor may prescribe some medications that work by containing the causal organism.

[post_content] => Half an hour is usually enough for a doctor to get rid of a sickening skin tag that has been troubling you. A bit longer may be needed for a mole or for warts, especially ones occurring on the genitals and such areas. However, it is a guarantee that you will not leave a dermatologist’s clinic with a skin growth you went to get surgically removed.
But who is willing to keep going back to clinics even for small skin tags and removing moles that can be treated at home?
What is a skin tag, mole or wart removal kit?
A remover kit generally refers to a combination of tools or remedies meant to treat a certain skin growth or condition at home. They can be bought over the counter or made at home.
Buying a remover kit is a better option. This is because top reviewed kits have been tested and will almost certainly work. The problem is that you may still be needed to see a doctor for large or infected skin conditions or for ones on eyes and genitals. Removal kits are only recommendable for skin tags under arms, moles on the hand and things along these lines.

But before buying, some information on the best one to use and when to use it is of importance. This is to ensure that you don’t waste your money or end up worsening the condition.
Reviews for best skin tag removal kit
Perhaps the best way to get rid of skin tags at home is to ligate them. This involves tying them at the base with a thread. The process is however somehow cumbersome and can become painful. To avoid all that, a TagBand device is a much better option. A top reviewed TagBand device should definitely be among your top options.
Freezing is another way that skin tags can be removed at home. Although the available remover kits that work by freezing the tags are not as effective as clinical cryotherapy, they can be effective for small skin tags. Bearing in mind that skin tag removal cost depends on the number of tags removed, freezing the small ones that will respond is a cost saving move.
Finally, a remover kit may be based on creams or ointments that contain acid as the major ingredient. Natural removal kits use Thuja Occidentalis as the main ingredient. Salicylic acid works by digesting the skin growths to be removed. When considering such a remover kit, you definitely need to check reviews provided by users. Many of these kits, unfortunately, do not prove to be effective.
How a wart removal kit works according to reviews
According to reviews, a wart removal kit should work by killing the outer layers of the wart. With time, the wart will stop any further growth and ultimately die off.
For warts, removal kits that require application of an ointment or a cream on the warts are most commonly used. They will always come with full instructions and even photos to guide you on how to use them for best results.

As you may learn at some point in this process, warts can prove hard to get rid of. It is for this reason that patience and a lot of research will be needed before buying a wart remover kit. A good place to get genuine reviews by other users is on chat forums or on official websites for retailers like Amazon.com.
The other option you may find helpful is the use of a freezing kit. Freezing is supposed to deprive the wart off oxygenated blood. With time, a frozen wart will fall off the skin. This is a better plantar wart removal method than creams and ointments.
When to use a wart removal kit product
For common, flat and plantar warts, removal kits can be used. In fact, you can make your own and use it on them.
When it comes to genital and warts around the eyes, caution should be taken when using removal kits. In fact, only use freezing kits in such cases.
Large warts will rarely respond to remover products. They are also very contagious. In such case, surgery or laser therapy will be needed. Consult a doctor if remover kits are not effective enough.
Which is the Best Mole removal kit product?
Unlike skin conditions such as skin fungus, moles are not contagious. They however have been observed to be more common in those who are genetically predisposed towards them.
When it comes to buying a mole removal kit that will work, the best approach is to go with products containing 17% of salicylic acid.

Compound W Freeze and Mole & Wart vanish are good places to start with. There are of course many other related removal kits. But as we have seen, most will not work as well as you would expect. Always remember, reviews from other users and details provided on forums will help a great deal.
Caution should be taken when treating moles with remover kits. Although only about 1 in 100 moles will show signs of cancer, taking chances is unnecessary. Learn all the signs of malignant moles and consult a doctor when the signs are observed.
How to make a skin tag, mole and wart remover kit
You can easily make a removal kit at home with the following remedies:
Tea tree oil – mild but effective. Can also be used for a cold sore on the lip.
Duct tape
Apple cider vinegar
Castor oil + baking soda
Aloe Vera
Such a removal kit will be effective on small skin tags, tiny moles and warts that have just formed. Like all the other removal products mentioned so far, ones made at home should not be used on sensitive areas. This includes removing benign genital white spots and the like.

If you are absolutely sure that what you are experiencing is a skin tag, then you need not be worried. A skin tag on nipple is completely benign and not a sign of breast cancer.
Hormonal changes in pregnant women are common causes of skin tags on the nipple. They can also be encouraged by the rapid gain of weight.
As the breasts become larger, they are bound to experience friction from clothes especially with the now larger belly pushing them outwards. With time, skin tags may develop on the nipples.

Essential oils are also often used to treat skin conditions occurring on sensitive parts such as the breasts or pimples on the nipple. Such oils include coconut and lavender essential oils.

[post_content] => What are skin tags? The name comes from the fact that they are tag-like projections from the skin that have the same color as the surrounding skin. Skin tags can grow to sizes of up to 4.5 cm and connect to the skin through a thin root, or stalk. They most often are small and are unique in the fact that they usually are fleshy and soft. They should not be confused with skin fungus infections or warts. They either form as individual tags or in clusters.
You will not develop cancer from these tags, nor will they pose any major health-related risk even when left untreated. However, they can progressively develop to become a nuisance and in many cases may ruin skin texture. There are various ways of removing skin tags, most of which are discussed in this article, along with what causes skin tags.
What causes skin tags especially tags on the face?

In fact, it is almost a guarantee that you will develop a skin tag at least once if not several times in your life.

This is because overweight people have a larger likelihood of having their body parts and clothing cause friction.
Anal skin tags have been linked to a genetic disorder known as Crohn's disease. In some cases, changes in the levels of hormones in pregnant women also bring about skin tags on the nipple. At any rate, it is best that everyone learns the best treatment and skin tag removal products.

Facts about skin tags and treatment that everyone should know
It is not likely that you go through your whole life without getting skin tags. Here are the facts you should know about them and how to treat them.
Friction from other body parts and clothing are not the only causes of tags. They can also run in the family.
The risk of developing them increases with age.
They can be treated easily. Treatment can be done at home with the right remedies, or in a clinic.
The armpits, neck, genital areas, and eyelids are the most commonly affected parts of the body. However, tags can develop on any part of your body. It is just there is more susceptibility to friction and heat in the identified parts.
They are not scabies symptoms. Scabies, moles, warts are all different in their own ways. In fact, there are very many forms of skin lesions and infections, all which might be wrongly confused with one another.
Tags will not develop into cancer even when left untreated. In fact, they will not develop into anything serious even without treatment. In some cases, they can go unnoticed for a long time.
How much does treatment for skin tags cost?
Here, the cost discussed is made up of the clinical fees you will be required to pay for removing skin tags in a hospital. Of course you can remove them at home, as discussed earlier in this article. All the same, large or clustered tags should be removed in a clinic.
[RELATED]
It probably will not cost you more than $350 or less than $150 to have skin tags completely removed from your skin. You can expect to pay anything between the above quoted amounts, which will only cover doctor's fees. Additional costs may be incurred depending on the following factors:
Extra health complications might raise the cost. For example, if you have other skin infections like lesions and warts, it may force the doctor to deal with the infection first. Also, if earlier attempts to get rid of the tags have ended up complicating the issue even more, the cost for a clinical treatment may end up hiking a little bit.
Is the surgery covered by your insurance? If not, you can have your doctor write a recommendation to the insurance provider, which will have the surgery treated as a medical treatment and not as a cosmetic operation.
What is your current location? Health policies differ from place to place. You find that people in less developed areas have fewer options to choose from and may end up being charged more even for minor operations.
Some people prefer to get anesthesia administered even when getting a simple surgery. Since it is not a part of normal skin tag surgeries, it will come at an additional cost.

[post_content] => Anal warts and skin tags on the anus are common occurrences. Neither of these pose serious concerns. However, they can develop and end up being painful, or may even bleed, especially when irritated by tight underwear or rough toilet paper. These two conditions should not be confused with one another. In this article, you will find out all the facts you need about the causes and best removal options for anal warts and anal skin tags.
This type of genital wart does not grow very large. They can be found in the areas inside or around the anus. In most cases, patients do not even realize that the warts are there, until they grow too large or begin to cause constant itching. If they get irritated, especially by toilet paper, warts will bleed, a fact that makes it easier to discover their existence.
Skin tags on the other hand are small flaps of tissue that protrude from the skin. They are caused by friction, either from two body parts rubbing against each other or from clothing. They can develop on the buttocks or around the anus. In some cases, the tags develop in the rectal area. Both tags and warts are benign.
What causes external skin tags around the anus?
All types of skin tags are caused by friction. It is the manner and cause of the friction that differs.
Constipation or frequent passing of hard stools can cause a skin tag around the anus. This is especially common when you feel pain when passing stool or if you are forced to push the stool out through the rectal track.
Pregnancy and childbirth are also associated with anal skin tags. This mainly happens when there are complications during childbirth, forcing the rectal area to withstand a lot of pressure. In the first stages, the tags may start as fissures, which later develop to full blown skin tags.
They also may be caused by anal sexual intercourse. Anal sexual intercourse is associated with a lot of pressure, which in turn creates the friction that brings about the tags.
[RELATED]
Obesity is also a common cause of external skin tags on the buttocks. As may be expected, obese individuals have a larger likelihood of extra tissues rubbing against each other. All the same, unless skin tags around anus get to a point of bleeding and causing entry points for bacteria in the body, they are generally benign.
When the veins along the anal area are subjected to too much pressure, they may end up swelling and turning blue or purple. This condition is commonly referred to as hemorrhoids. They can occur externally or internally. This condition is from time to time confused with anal skin tags. Although the former can result in the latter, they are not interchangeable conditions. However, both cause irritation, nuisance and sometimes bleeding of the affected areas, but no serious health concerns.
How to remove skin tags and recovery options
Chances are high that you will develop a skin tag at some point in life. Even though they are mostly benign, it is important that you learn how to get rid of anal skin tags or even vaginal skin tags. It has been reported that a good number of people struggle with treating genital skin tags due to possible embarrassment about the mode of treatment and removal.
[RELATED]
You can choose to get remove anal skin tags yourself at home or have them removed in a clinic by a qualified doctor. The former method is less expensive but poses a couple of challenges. Below are the three most common ways on how to get rid of anal skin tags in a clinic.
Cryotherapy – This method involves freezing off the tags, using liquefied oxygen. The best thing with this method is that it causes no bleeding and has a less complicated recovery period. Have your doctor walk you through what it involves and the time it will likely take to get rid of the tags once and for all.
Excision surgery – This involves a surgical operation that cuts off the skin tag. This method is also possible for genital warts. In fact, cutting off a wart is preferable to using removal creams and similar treatments. Most health insurance covers do not cover cosmetic skin tag excision expenses. However, if the tags are the result of hemorrhoids, you can likely have the expenses covered by your insurance.
Laser treatment – This method is perfect for a perianal skin tag. However, it will cost you more to use laser treatment. This method is recommended for tags resulting from hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids are known to cause skin tags, which then bring about complications in treating the two with simple home remedies or procedures.
Recovery after removing anal skin tags
After going through a successful skin tag or wart removal procedure, successful recovery is of equal importance. Note that chances are high that scarring will occur on the spot where the skin tag was removed. Most cases take about 3 days to heal completely. The time depends on how strong your immune system is and how large the tags were.
There are remedies that can help speed up the healing process. For example, tea tree oil can shorten the period significantly and also help to avoid further infection. You can also consider getting a fully equipped removal kit or a recommended essential oil.
[RELATED]
During the recovery period, keep an eye on the spot where the tag was removed. If you notice any signs of infection, such as swelling, pus, streaking, or excessive pain and bleeding, get medical help immediately. Since most of the failed recovery cases happen in individuals who have chosen to remove skin tags at home, it is advised that you get them removed in a clinic.
How to get rid of anal warts without bleeding
At first, anal warts will appear inside the anus and then spread outside to other parts of the body. Even though they pose no serious health concerns, it is a good idea to have them removed as soon as they are discovered. Most patients experience itching on the areas around the anus. Due to irritation from toilet paper and the friction it causes, it is likely that the warts will start bleeding eventually. Below are the steps to wart removal procedures.
Topical medications are recommended for external warts. They usually come in the form of ointments, which are directly applied on the warts. It is a simple procedure, one that will not take much of your time in a clinic.
Freezing the warts with liquefied nitrogen always produces the desired results. Ensure that this procedure is carried out over the recommended amount of visits. This is to ensure that no warts have been left untreated. Freezing the warts prevents any cases of bleeding during surgical removal.
Proceed with a surgery that will have the warts removed. Surgical removal of warts is advised because it removes all the warts in a matter of minutes, and gets rid of concerns about your skin being corroded by creams or lotions. During the surgery, you will be put under anesthesia, so don’t worry about the pain. Make sure that you consult your doctor on the projected wart removal cost.
Take it upon yourself to successfully complete the recommended recovery period. This is best done through checkups. Additionally, abstain from sex for a time afterward, to reduce the likelihood of spreading the warts. Some studies have suggested that the HPV virus is responsible for this type of wart, a fact that makes it highly contagious.
Cutting off a wart on your own is not a good idea. It is only safe when a doctor does it and when the wound left behind has healed completely. The genital area is very sensitive and susceptible to all kinds of germs. It is definitely a better idea to have the wart removed in a clinic rather than trying to remove it at home.
Removal products for anal skin tags at home
A skin tag on the anus is a common occurrence. This doesn’t erase the fact that most people are embarrassed by the need to go to a clinic and have someone else remove the tags from them. Luckily, there are removal products and procedures that can be used to remove anal skin tags at home.
[RELATED]
Apple cider vinegar is a popular remedy for various kinds of skin infections. However, ensure that you have the right directions on how it should be used, especially when it comes to removing a skin tag around the anus. You should not apply pure concentrations of apple cider vinegar to skin tags around the anus directly. Rather, make use of coconut oil along with the apple cider vinegar. Otherwise, you will end up corroding instead of healing the skin near the skin tags. Other effective remedies include Australian tea tree oil, lavender oil and similar essential oils.
Other removal options at home include cutting off the skin tags with a sharp and sterile razor, and tying off the skin tag. In fact, some people even cut skin tags without knowing it when shaving.

[post_content] => The difference between a penis skin tag and a skin tag elsewhere than the genital areas is that the former is more irritating. All types of skin tags result from friction, genetic causes or hormonal imbalances. Skin tags on the penis usually occur on the scrotum, penis head or the shaft. Occurrence on the penis head is associated with a lot of irritation and always calls for treatment methods to get rid of it. Skin tags occurring on the penis are just one of the various types of genital skin tags that there are.
Skin tags of the genitals can attack the groin, vagina, penis and anus. In their first stages of development, they start as fleshly projections of the skin. They may be smooth or roughly textured. The notable feature that helps diagnose skin tags is that they are attached to the skin by a thin root, or stalk. Skin tags on genital areas are not symptoms of sexually transmitted infections nor will they develop into any serious health concerns. However, it is important to know how to remove them effectively since they can get irritated and develop into open sores under excess friction.
How to treat a penis skin tag
If a skin tag occurs anywhere other than on the penis head, you can just leave it be. However, it may be causing constant irritation or bleeding, in which case removal is of great importance. Removing skin tags that occur on the penis can be done in a clinic, at home or with over the counter remedies.
For the first option, a doctor may decide to tie off the skin tag and leave it to fall off on its own. This method takes some time but doesn’t cause bleeding. The tag can also be frozen, in a clinic that offers cryogenics. If the skin tags are large or have been infected, they can be surgically cut off or gotten rid of through a laser surgery. Note that unless the tags are resulting from hemorrhoids, most insurance covers will not cover the removal costs.
[RELATED]
Skin tags on the penis can also be removed using over the counter products. Solutions like Compound W Freeze or TagBand are accessible over the counter and are effective solutions on how to treat skin tags of the penis. The choice for the best over the counter remedy depends on the location and the intensity of the skin tag occurrence.
You also can opt to use a home remedy to get rid of a skin tag on the penis. The advantage of a home remedy over an OTC product is that the former is much safer and with fewer side effects. It also can be easily and cheaply accessed. As you will find out, most cases of skin tags on the genitals go unreported due to the stigma associated with them. Below are some of the most popular and effective home remedies:
Apple cider vinegar
Tea tree oil
Vitamins
Citric acid like in lemon juice or pineapple juice
Baking soda; it has to be mixed with castor oil for best results
Lavender oil
Frankincense oil
These remedies can also be used to remove skin tags around the anus. It is important that you find out more on how to treat penile skin tags before you use any one of these remedies. This is because some of these products might produce allergic reactions to your skin.
Don’t attempt to cut off skin tags on the shaft of the penis if you don't have the right directions on how to do so. This is because there are many blood vessels in the penile shaft and damaging any one of them can cause a lot of bleeding.
How to remove vaginal skin tags
Vaginal skin tags mainly occur during and after pregnancy. This is brought about either by hormonal imbalances or by overstretching of vaginal muscles. They are in no way contagious nor are they sexually transmitted. In fact, you can opt to leave them alone, if they are not open to irritation and friction. They may appear anywhere on the labia, vagina or the vulva.
[RELATED]
Unlike skin tags occurring on the penis, vaginal skin tags should be treated by a doctor. The same clinical medical procedures discussed above for penile skin tags can be used for skin tags on the vaginal area. In more serious cases or for skin tags occurring deep in the vagina, your doctor may opt for cauterization. This is a medical procedure that involves removing skin tags by burning them using a current carrying wire. This method is very effective and without many side effects.
Why are genital skin tags pictures useful?
Various skin infections like warts, hemorrhoids and skin bumps can be confused with genital skin tags. Here, descriptive pictures can help you to tell the difference between these conditions. For example, a wart can have the same smooth texture that a genital skin tag is likely to have. You will only know which one is which by looking at their intensity and structure. For one, skin tags hang from the skin by a root or a stalk, while warts may occur in clusters. Such differences will be clearly illustrated by searching images for skin tags occurring on the genitals.
How to treat skin tags in the genital area
Skin tags occurring in the genital area tend to scare off some people from getting the necessary medical attention. This should never be the case. Even though we have already seen that no major health concerns are posed by skin tags occurring on genitals, they can be a nuisance especially when under friction from underwear or menstrual pads.
[RELATED]
Never shy away from getting help for skin tags appearing on your genitals, especially on the vagina or labia. There are in no way different from a skin tag appearing on someone’s face. The most important thing is to have the right information on how to remove skin tags from the genital area and where you can get help should the necessity arise. Additionally, ensure that they really are tags and not tumors or other forms of genital infections.

Magnesium
Potassium
Probiotics
Acetic acid
Enzymes
These are the compounds present in apple cider that makes it so good for skin. For example, acetic acid acts as an antibiotic by killing off any harmful bacteria that might be fostering on your skin.
[RELATED]

On top of that, it also helps in the proper management of blood sugar levels in the blood and adds polyphenols to the body. All of these health benefits associated with apple cider vinegar act to help your skin in one way or another.
Remove tags with apple cider vinegar for skin tags
Ensure that you are trying to get rid of skin tags and not skin infections that have been mistaken for skin tags. Don’t mistake skin tags with other skin infections like moles or warts. Below is a step by step guide to remove tags with apple cider vinegar:
Have the skin tag checked, just to ensure that it is not a malignant tumor.
Wash clean the part of the skin to which the tag is attached. It is better that you use a form of any mild soap.
Dry off the cleaned area.
Soak a ball of cotton in a solution of apple cider vinegar. Squeeze off any excess solution, to keep it from dripping onto other unnecessary parts of the skin.

Keep repeating the process until the time that the tag withers and off falls on its own.

Wart removal with apple cider vinegar for warts
Wart removal with apple cider vinegar for warts will produce very effective results when carried out in the right manner. Below is the best wart removal procedure:
Wash clean the areas affected by warts. Use a pumice stone to file off the upper hard protective layer of the warts. Warts do not contain nerve endings, so you don't have to worry about feeling pain.
Apply Vaseline or another protective gel on the warts. This will stop any form of corrosion from apple cider vinegar used on the warts.
Soak a cotton ball with apple cider vinegar.
Cover the entire area affected by warts with the soaked cotton ball. You can use tape to hold the cotton ball in position. Let it remain in that position even when going to bed.
Repeat this process until the warts wither off completely.
Removing moles with apple cider vinegar for moles

Cutting off skin tags; how to cut a skin tag at home
When cutting off skin tags, moles or warts at home, try the following step by step guidelines:
Wash your hands with a disinfectant soap and boiled water. Leave them to air dry on their own. To make sure that no germs are left on the hands, rub some alcohol on them.
Let a pair of scissors and/or a scalpel boil in water for about 4 minutes. Another option is to pass them directly through a flame.
Find the skin tag, trace it to the root, and pull the rest out away from your skin.
Ensure that the scissors are placed at the bottom-most part of the root, or stalk. This is the place you are going to cut.
Snip it off quickly with the scissors, and then immediately apply some pressure on the part previously covered by the skin tag.
Apply an anti-bacterial lotion or cream on the spot and use a bandage to cover it. Within an average of 36 hours, it will be safe to remove the bandage.

The penile shaft, for instance, is filled with tiny blood vessels. Accidental cutting of such vessels will lead to unnecessary bleeding.
[RELATED]
Hospitals provide the best solutions for getting rid of a wart. In a hospital, a doctor will give it a more strategic approach than just literally cutting off a wart. Here, the layers of the wart will be scraped step by step, all while you are under an anesthesic.
Make no attempt to cut out a wart at home. In fact, it's a better idea to make use of OTC products and home remedies like castor oil for skin.

[post_content] => Skin tags have a tendency to appear around or under the eye, especially on the eyelid. The exact reasons as to why this is so are still unclear. For one thing, there is not usually much friction on the eyelid. It is thought that hormonal imbalances may be responsible.
There have been cases of other skin ailments like moles and warts developing on these sensitive parts of the body. Various challenges exist in removing these skin infections. All the same, skin tags on eyelids can still be easily removed either at home or in a clinic.
How to remove a skin tag on an eye lid at home
Skin tags occurring too close to the eye can turn out to be very irritating. Their causes are associated with hormonal imbalances and friction occurring in skin folds. Many options for skin tags treatment are open to choose from.
Tea tree oil is the best home treatment remedy for treating skin tags on the eyelid at home. This product is completely natural and has no corrosive side effects. It dries off the part of the skin where a tag attaches itself, making it naturally fall off with time. It also leaves no scarring afterwards.
[RELATED]
Tying tags off to remove them serves as another good treatment remedy for skin tags on eyelids. Here, it is preferable that you make use of a skin tag removal device or even a fully equipped removal kit.
Lastly, tag removal around the eyes can be done using specific creams. Since there are many creams on the market today, ensure that you only buy a cream that has been in the market for a decent length of time, and has been approved by the FDA.
How to remove moles on the eyelid
Genetic causes are largely responsible for this type of mole. Like many other types of moles, they do not pose major health concerns, but many people do not like the idea of having a mole occurring on their faces, especially not the eyelids.
It is not advisable to cut off mole at home by yourself. Have a doctor examine the causes and the type of mole it is to ensure that it is not cancerous. You can also opt to undergo surgery to get the mole removed. This method of removing a mole on the eyelid is fast but can prove a bit expensive for most people.
[RELATED]
When it comes to home remedies to get a mole on the eyelid removed, castor oil is the best option. Castor oil is used to eliminate many types of skin growths, and it works perfectly in case of moles on eyelids. You may be required to wait for a period of about 4 to six weeks before the mole goes away when using castor oil. Just keep applying this essential oil to the mole on a daily basis till it goes away.
Causes and treatments for warts on the eyelid
Warts can occur on different parts of the face. The types of warts that attack the eyelids are known as filiform warts. They are painless but can cause itching. Sometimes, they can develop to the extent of drooping and barring clear vision. They are caused by a strain of the HPV virus.

These types of warts are delicate to treat. It is best that you visit a doctor rather than attempting to remove them at home. Depending on how serious the wart is, any of the following procedures can be used:
Laser treatment; this method is preferable to many others because it is fast and leaves no scarring behind. However, it is more expensive than most of the other available wart treatment remedies.
Freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen as the remedy; freezing compounds are available over the counter. However, it is important that you get the right information on how to use them in the case of a wart occurring on the eyelid.
Burning them off, using a controlled amount of electrically generated heat.
Using medication like the gel from aloe Vera.
Using home remedies like tea tree oil.
It is not that warts cannot be removed naturally. The problem with naturally removing a wart on the eyelid is that a slight mistake may bring about unexpected problems or contamination in the eye. It is always best that you get medical advice on how to best get rid of warts.

[post_content] => Tea tree oil should not be confused with tea oil. The latter can be identified by its yellow coloring. It is extracted from the leaves of a plant known as Melaleuca alternifolia. It is a topical remedy, meaning that it should only be used externally. It has for a long time been believed to have skin healing benefits. However, few research findings are available to support these claims.
Uses of tea tree oil
It is used as an antimicrobial remedy on open and infected wounds occurring on the skin.
It is mixed with benzoyl peroxide and used as a remedy for acne.
It is used as a home remedy for treating moles, skin tags and warts.
It is used in treating fungus infections. It is mostly effective when used to treat fungus of the nails and athlete’s foot.
It can be used for cleaning off an armpit boil.
[RELATED]
Uses for this remedy should be entirely topical. If swallowed, it can cause stomach problems and even, with extreme reactions, cause hallucinations. Some users have reported allergic reactions to this product.
How to use Tea tree oil for fungus
Tea tree oil is very effective in treating toenail and fingernail fungus. Here are the steps to follow and instructions on how to use tea tree oil for fungus infections:
Use a nail cutter or clipper to get rid of the dead parts of the nail. To make the process easier, try soaking the nails in warm water for about 15 minutes.
Using a nail file, get rid of the any coarse parts of the nail. Here, make sure that you do not cut any part of your skin in attempt to get a smooth finish on your nails. If you have sensitive skin, consider using a nail brush instead of a coarse file.
Use a mild soap to clean your feet or hands thoroughly. When done, dry off your feet or hands, ensuring that not dirt has been left especially underneath your nails.
Apply the tea tree oil to the infected parts. You can apply some drops of the solution directly to the affected areas or use a cotton ball. Some people prefer soaking their feet in a water-tea tree oil solution. Either method will work. This process should be repeated until the fungus infection goes away.
You can also opt for processed creams, face wash and products that contain tea tree oil. Such creams and lotions can be accessed in CVS, Walmart, Walgreens or any credible retailing store.

It is important to note that good hygienic habits should be observed even when making use of this remedy. Keep your nails short and clean. Always wear shoes and avoid sharing socks and shoes with others.
How to use tea tree oil for warts
Tea tree oil is one of the best home remedies for treating warts, especially genital warts. However, it is important that you notify your doctor before using tea tree oil for warts. Below is a step by step guide to using it for cleaning off warts:
Thoroughly clean both your hands and the affected area. It is advisable that you let the areas dry on their own but you can dry them with a clean towel if you need to.
Apply a single drop of the pure form of tea tree oil directly on the affected areas. Only target the warts themselves. You can also opt to soak a cotton ball in the solution and squeeze it onto the warts.
Bandage the warts after this application. Some people prefer to soak the bandage with tea tree oil too. Let the bandage remain in its position overnight.
Replace the bandage in the morning and then repeat the process. It may take up to four weeks to have the warts completely cleared off using this method. If you notice irritation on the skin due to use of tea tree oil, try mixing the same with castor oil for warts.
For warts occurring on the ears and or on other sensitive parts like eyelids, refrain from attempting to heal them yourself. See a doctor for further assistance in such a case.
How to use tea tree oil for skin tags
Tea tree oil may not be such a quick skin tag removal remedy but it certainly works. Even better, it has limited side effects and leaves no scarring afterwards. In fact, it is one of the few home remedies suggested for facial skin tags removal. Here is the process for how to use tea tree oil for skin tags:
Start with cleansing the part of skin affected by the skin tags.
Soak a cotton ball in water and squeeze it dry. From there, add an average of 3 drops of the tea tree oil onto the cotton ball.
Keep massaging the areas affected by the skin tag for about 4 minutes.
Repeat this process about four times a day.
You can also opt to tape the cotton ball onto the affected areas for a few hours.
Some people prefer to use tea tree oil in its pure forms. This might work for some people but is advised against if you have over-sensitive skin.
Tea tree oil can be used alongside other remedies like olive oil or apple cider vinegar.
How to use tea tree oil for moles
A mole is a type of skin ailment that results from clumped up melanocytes. Though they manifest as small body tumors, they are not malignant. It is necessary to learn more on some of the oil tones and treatment methods for the same, especially for a mole on eyelid. Below is the guideline for how to use tea tree oil for moles:
Examine the size of the mole and get a cotton ball equating the mole in size.
Soak it in water, squeeze the water off and add about 3 drops of tea tree oil. You can opt to soak the cotton ball in the oil itself, if you do not have a sensitive skin or if the moles are mild.
Using tape, fix in place the cotton ball, in such a way that it will only cover the entire mole and not other parts of the skin.
Repeat this process until the mole is completely gone.
Stop any further use of this method if you experience skin irritation. However, you can opt to use coconut or olive oil along with tea tree oil to lessen the irritation.
The use of tea tree oil for skin infections started long ago. In fact, some people use it as a face wash remedy. As much as scientific data for how exactly it works might be limited, results have worked in favor of this remedy.

All the same, it is important that you approach a doctor if you fail to get the desired results. This also goes for skin infections occurring in a sensitive area. For example, warts of the genitals can invite cases of cervical cancer for women. In some cases, a cancerous tumor can be mistaken for a benign skin infection. All these cases will have disastrous results if tea tree oil is to be used as the only treatment remedy. All the same, tea tree oil works for most common skin ailments.

[post_content] => Freezing, also known as cryotherapy, is a medical operation which uses a cold substance to freeze off warts, skin tags and moles. It is usually done in a hospital and only takes about a minute. For cases of warts occurring in sensitive parts like warts on eyelid, this treatment method is advised. It also can be done at home with an over the counter freezing compound. For example, Compound W Freeze Off is accessible over the counter and effective in wart freezing, as well as in freezing skin tags and moles.
[RELATED]
The advantage of having your own freeze-off kit is that you can use it as per your convenience. It also is less expensive. Browse through different reviews for over the counter freeze-off remedies and kits. The good thing about reviews is that they give you a real picture of how that product works. All the same, you can opt to have skin ailments like warts treated in a hospital.
How to freeze off warts
A wart removal freeze exercise can be done at home or in a hospital. The basic thing is cutting off the supply of nutrients to the cells and the virus residing in the wart. In a hospital, a wart freeze will involve liquid nitrogen. This is a very cold substance and in most cases will cause discomfort or pain upon application. A local anesthesia may be used but is not usually necessary.
[RELATED]
There are various over the counter wart freeze-off remedies available. Contrary to the liquid nitrogen used in clinical wart remover freeze compounds, these ones use a mixture of dimethyl ether and propane. Application is not complicated. All you need is to apply the freeze compounds on the affected areas.
This method is very common in removing warts in women, since it can be used privately at home for warts occurring in embarrassing genital areas.
How to freeze away skin tags
Freezing skin tags is much easier than warts. This is because skin tags are a bit softer than warts. In fact, freezing off a skin tag may only take about half a minute.
You can freeze off skin tags at home with over the counter products or have it done in a clinic. The latter will require that the skin tags be in an accessible part of the body.
[RELATED]
When freezing skin tags at home, ensure that the sprayer nozzle specifically targets the point at which the skin tag attaches to the skin. Note that freeze compounds are for literally freezing parts of the skin tag to restrict further distribution of nutrients into the skin tag, causing it to die off.
A doctor will not do anything extra past what you would have done at home by yourself. However, he may be in a position to advise you on other skin infections and how to treat them. For example, freeze compounds can also be used to get rid of razor bumps.
How to freeze off moles
You can get rid of moles easily by freezing them off. As it is with skin tags and warts, freezing moles can be done at home or just in a hospital. Note that you will be forced to pay some extra costs like doctor consultation fees when going to the clinic to have a mole removed. Below is the procedure followed in freezing moles:
You will be talked through what the mole freeze off process involves. For example, some side effects, like swelling, may occur. You also might feel some pain or discomfort during the operation
A spray gun is used to administer liquid nitrogen to the mole. This substance is actually so cold that it will literally freeze upon contact with the skin. This cuts off blood circulation into the mole.
You may be given a painkiller to ease the discomfort. If not, you can opt to get one over the counter.
It is likely that a blister will result on the area where the liquid nitrogen was administered. The blister will go away before too long, though. Ensure that the area is always kept clean.

[post_content] => If you happen to observe some loosely hanging soft pieces of flesh on the skin, they are likely going to be skin tags. Don't panic, however. The tags will not grow into anything serious.
For a condition or infection to be contagious, it has to have an identifiable cause, something like a virus or a parasite. This is not the case with skin tags. For this reason, the tags cannot be spread from one person to another or to other body parts.
Are skin tags contagious; what causes them
Going by the parts of the body that they occur most, the causes of skin tags is thought to be friction. For example, you will find them on the groin, underarms, eyelids and back of the neck.
[RELATED]
All these body parts have one thing in common. They are prone to friction, either by rubbing against other body parts or against clothes. A bit like toenail fungus, skin tags also prefer moist body areas. This again has everything to do with friction. Moist areas are likely to offer resistance to motion, which is a longer description of what causes friction.
It will not be unusual if a skin tag is to be spotted in a less obvious part such as fingers or even on the face. This is especially for smokers and people with other conditions that weaken the skin.
Why are skin tags contagious; guide information
As mentioned earlier, no microorganism or parasite is responsible for the development of skin tags. You therefore will not have them popping all over the skin or on other people around you courtesy of the initial skin tag.
However, there are some predisposing factors that encourage their development. If these factors are exacerbated, skin tags will occur more frequently. The factors include:
Use of steroids – those who use steroids for a long time have been shown to develop the tags more frequently
Age – as we age, the skin loses most of its collagen tissues. Collagen is what keeps the skin tight and free from wrinkles
Pregnancy – hormonal changes and rapid gain of weight in pregnant women encourages their development
Diabetes – lovers of sugary foods and saturated fats develop a kind of attraction to skin tags
Obesity – with all the flaps and extra skin in obese individuals, little can be done to keep skin tags from developing
Are genital skin tags contagious without treatment
Most genital infections are known to be contagious. But as we have seen, skin tags are not infections. Even if it is to occur on the penis or on the vagina, it will not be spread.
Treatment for skin tags is usually sought for aesthetic reasons.
[RELATED]
In other situations, a skin tag can sustain an injury, which will make it prone to infections. In such cases, it will get painful and open up for conditions such as skin ulcers.
Guide information; Are genital skin tags contagious and best medicine
As long as being contagious is involved, skin tags will not cause any complications. But like any other condition, they can be a nuisance and even grow to the size of a grape. No one is willing to carry a fig-sized tag somewhere near their genitals or even on other body parts.
In regards to the best treatment, the following options are available:
Clinical removal - doctors can remove skin tags pretty easily. They can freeze them, cut them off, burn them or poison them with laser. Skin tags removal cost in a clinic will increase with the number of tags to be removed.
Removal at home – remedies such as tea tree oil are very effective against skin conditions including white spots on teeth. They are even more effective when used in combinations. For example, a paste of baking soda and castor oil will get rid of pimples and skin tags in a matter of days or few weeks.
Over the counter kits – a TagBand for example is a much better version of the thread you would use to tie a skin tag with at home. Wart removal freeze kits on the other hand will also work in clearing skin tags off the skin. You can also try patches and creams containing salicylic acid.
Are skin tags contagious without ringworm medicine?
Ringworm on face is likely to spread to the hands and any other body part that comes into skin to skin contact.
If a skin tag is occurring close or on a body part with ringworm, it will not spread but will increase the chances of the ringworm spreading. This can be seen in obese individuals who have ringworm and skin tags between skin folds on the belly.
[RELATED]
During treatment for skin tags, chances are high that fluid or cotton balls you are using will touch another body part. This will be source of spread.
To prevent such cases, use remedies known to fight both bacterial and fungal infections such pas tea tree oil. Other than being effective, the oil can also be used on sensitive body parts such as removing a mole on the nipple; but not when pregnant.
