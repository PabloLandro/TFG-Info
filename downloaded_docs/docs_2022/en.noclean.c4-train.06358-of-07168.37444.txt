A vital set of nutrients required for a healthy body are the fatty acids. These nutrients serve several functions, including the make-up of the majority of the protective membrane that surrounds every one of our cells. They are also used by the body as major building blocks for the creation of body fat, needed in appropriate amounts to cushion and protect our internal organs and keep us warm. However, not all fatty acids provide the same benefits. Scientific research has linked the consumption of saturated fatty acids, found predominantly in animal fat, with increased levels of cholesterol and a higher risk of heart attacks, while the unsaturated variety from vegetable oils do not have that effect.

Fatty acids are a vital set of nutrients required for a healthy body. These nutrients serve several functions, including the make-up of the majority of the protective membrane that surrounds every one of our cells. They are also used by the body as major building blocks for the creation of body fat, needed in appropriate amounts to cushion and protect our internal organs and keep us warm. However, not all fatty acids provide the same benefits. Scientific research has linked the consumption of saturated fatty acids, found predominantly in animal fat, with increased levels of cholesterol and a higher risk of heart attacks, while the unsaturated variety from vegetable oils do not have that effect.
Forever Living Products has formulated a superior nutritional supplement to take advantage of the latest research into this important area of nutrition. By combining Omega-3 with Omega-9, it provides a safe and balanced supplement that can favorably support healthy blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Forever Arctic-Sea Super Omega-3 is a breakthrough in terms of a balanced supplement, using both vegetable and fish oils to derive the benefit of each. Omega-3 is an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid found in salmon and other seafood. Omega-9 is the unsaturated fatty acid found in vegetable products, like olive oil.
Each capsule has an EPA content of 225 mg and 150 mg each of DHA and oleic acid, all of which are lacking in most Western diets. The benefits of EPA and DHA include supporting the circulatory system. They are needed for other functions, including the development and health of the eyes and brain, and can support proper joint function.

What is EPA and DHA?
Within the body omega-3 fatty acids are converted to DHA and EPA (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively). DHA and EPA are highly unsaturated fats that play very important roles in the vision development and brain function of infants.
One study found significantly lower amounts of EPA in the cells of patients who had attempted suicide, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may actually play a role in suicide prevention. A lack of DHA has been associated with Alzheimer disease, attention disorders, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis and other diseases. Blue green algae is a good source of EPA and DHA.
