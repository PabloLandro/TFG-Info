Hello and thank you for this informative article. It really helped me. I am not that overweight, but I still have a weight on my hips that looks ugly on a guy. I am finding a way to get rid of it.
From reading your list I can tell that I do enjoy some the activities mentioned. I do like taking coffee and was unaware that it had these kind of benefits. I also do joga, but not regularly, while I drive my bicycle to work everyday. However, my hip fat is still there due to unhealthy food I eat.
I think cutting that off will bring more benefits that I ever expected.
Do you recommend push ups as a way of loosing hip weight?
Thank you.

Thanks for this wonderful article, it is very spot on.
I having been looking to lose some weight lately especially in my hip region but haven’t been opportuned to partake in gym activities.
Was I marvelled when I landed on your post! Sure was..
But I do have to ask this, you said about taking lemon water in morning daily, and also taking coffee
my question is do we take them alongside each other or are they alternated?
Secondly, as a breastfeeding mum is it okay to have this coffee regularly as I am made to believe otherwise
will appreciate your response.
Cheers..

Really, Lemon and Coffee are more useful to lose weight, but only those two things are not more changes in your body weight. but the collection of methods are effectively supported to lose weight in your body. I recommend you to try many of them, then you can see real change in your body weight. But, breastfeeding mum is not suitable daily drink coffee. But coffee is not an unsuitable thing for them. Because coffee is dried like food when it consumes. Anyway, I really appreciate your comment and I’d like to invite you if you have a question, feel free to leave a comment here, I sure support your question as soon as possible. Thanks

Like was mentioned in this post some people really do consider some weight on their hips as a good thing. I of some cultures that actually encourages this. It is more common for women than they are for men especially after these women give birth.
I personally like my hip not to have a lot of weight and I perform some exercises that helps me maintain the right hip weight but like was said and implied by experts, there hardly is any one exercise that focuses mainly on the hip. Whatever exercise you perform that is meant for the hip would also have one effect or the other on other parts of the body.
