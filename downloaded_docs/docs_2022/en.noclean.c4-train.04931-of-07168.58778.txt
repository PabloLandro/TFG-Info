Are there 131 Papers That Support Vaccine/Autism Causation? papers 91-131 Evaluated
Logic of Science's evidence pyramid is one of the clearest I've found, so I'm sharing it here.
This is the Nth iteration of a "list of papers supporting the vaccine-autism link" that Taylor has published. I've lost count of the iterations. I first debunked Taylor's list back in August 2013, when she only had 76 papers on the list.
I used this numbering system "131 papers number: X. 124 papers number: Y. 72 papers number: Z", because Ms. Taylor likes to shuffle the order of the papers from iteration to iteration. It helps me keep clear which papers are new and which are just in a different order.

131 papers number: 91. 124 papers number: 84. 72 papers number: 0 Stajich GV, Lopez GP, Harry SW, Sexson WR. Iatrogenic exposure to mercury after hepatitis B vaccination in preterm infants. J Pediatr. 2000 May;136(5):679-81. Small, 20-subject study, with no follow-up of subjects. Thimerosal is no longer used in US pediatric vaccines and has been exonerated of causality in autism (see Hurley 2010, Price 2010, Yoshimasu 2014, Taylor 2014). Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 92. 124 papers number: 85. 72 papers number: 0 Guy A, Seaton SE, Boyle EM, Draper ES, Field DJ, Manktelow BN, Marlow N, Smith LK, Johnson S. Infants born late/moderately preterm are at increased risk for a positive autism screen at 2 years of age. J Pediatr. 2015 Feb;166(2):269-75.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.10.053. Epub 2014 Dec 2. Children born at 32-36 weeks gestation have a raised risk of autism diagnosis. No mention of vaccines. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 93. 124 papers number: 86. 72 papers number: 0 D'Onofrio BM, Class QA, Rickert ME, Larsson H, Långström N, Lichtenstein P. Preterm birth and mortality and morbidity: a population-based quasi-experimental study. JAMA Psychiatry. 2013 Nov;70(11):1231-40. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.2107. This is a very strong study from Sweden, with 3,300,708 subjects. The takeaway is that preterm birth raises the risk of autism (and other adverse outcomes), but does not analyze vaccine exposure. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 94. 124 papers number: 87. 72 papers number: 0 Shandley K, Austin DW. Ancestry of pink disease (infantile acrodynia) identified as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorders. J Toxicol Environ Health A. 2011;74(18):1185-94. doi: 10.1080/15287394.2011.590097. Calomel (mercurous chloride, Hg2Cl2) , was widely used in medicines in the late 19th and early 20th century. "Pink disease" or "acrodynia" was mercury poisoning from repeated high doses of calomel. This paper claims to test the hypothesis that survivors of acrodynia have more autistic descendants. But wait, what? If there were children subjected to high doses of mercury in the the late 19th and early 20th century, why was there not then an "epidemic of autism", if mercury exposure causes autism? Back to the study. The study recruited participants from a self-identified group of pink disease survivors, and surveyed the respondents for health status (including autism) of their children and grandchildren. However, no objective ascertainment of the diagnostic assertions of respondents' claims for descendants was made. More analysis of this footling study at LeftBrain/RightBrain Autism. Besides, Thimerosal is no longer used in US pediatric vaccines and has been exonerated of causality in autism (see Hurley 2010, Price 2010, Yoshimasu 2014, Taylor 2014). Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 95. 124 papers number: 88. 72 papers number: 0 Zhang Y, Xu Q, Liu J, Li SC, Xu X. Risk factors for autistic regression: results of an ambispective cohort study. J Child Neurol. 2012 Aug;27(8):975-81. doi: 10.1177/0883073811430163. Epub 2012 Jan 30. Cohort study on 170 autistic Chinese children. Study does not mention vaccines, focuses on febrile seizures, which are not closely correlated with vaccines. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 96. 124 papers number: 89. 72 papers number: 0 Vestergaard M, Hviid A, Madsen KM, Wohlfahrt J, Thorsen P, Schendel D, Melbye M, Olsen J. MMR vaccination and febrile seizures: evaluation of susceptible subgroups and long-term prognosis. JAMA. 2004 Jul 21;292(3):351-7. This is a very powerful Danish study: "A population-based cohort study of all children born in Denmark between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1998, who were alive at 3 months; 537,171 children were followed up until December 31, 1999, by using data from the Danish Civil Registration System and 4 other national registries." The Epilepsy Foundation says "The long-term outlook is excellent, however. The vast majority of children with febrile seizures do not have seizures without fever after age 5." The study's conclusion? "MMR vaccination was associated with a transient increased rate of febrile seizures but the risk difference was small even in high-risk children. The long-term rate of epilepsy was not increased in children who had febrile seizures following vaccination compared with children who had febrile seizures of a different etiology." Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 97. 124 papers number: 90. 72 papers number: 0 Feenstra B, Pasternak B, Geller F, Carstensen L, Wang T, Huang F, Eitson JL, Hollegaard MV, Svanström H, Vestergaard M, Hougaard DM, Schoggins JW, Jan LY, Melbye M, Hviid A. Common variants associated with general and MMR vaccine-related febrile seizures. Nat Genet. 2014 Dec;46(12):1274-82. doi: 10.1038/ng.3129. Epub 2014 Oct 26. This study was designed to look for genetic differences between "children with MMR-related febrile seizures, children with febrile seizures unrelated to vaccination and controls with no history of febrile seizures," and found significant differences. However, as we have already seen, febrile seizures are usually benign and are not connected to autism. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 98. 124 papers number: 91. 72 papers number: 60 Wilson K, Hawken S, Kwong JC, Deeks S, Crowcroft NS, Van Walraven C, Potter BK, Chakraborty P, Keelan J, Pluscauskas M, Manuel D. Adverse events following 12 and 18 month vaccinations: a population-based, self-controlled case series analysis. PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e27897. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027897. Epub 2011 Dec 12. A very robust paper with nearly 500,000 subjects, which found that ER visits for febrile seizures and/or rash increased after vaccination. However, "The findings also suggest that the reactions are not severe since acuity was not higher than the control period and furthermore, there were few hospital admissions. " The authors call for more research on controlling reactions. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 99. 124 papers number: 92. 72 papers number 0: Robertson CE, Ratai EM, Kanwisher N. Reduced GABAergic Action in the Autistic Brain. Curr Biol. 2015 Dec 16. pii: S0960-9822(15)01413-X. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.019. Autistic people report atypical sensory perception. This paper looked at a specific pathway that may affect sesory perception, and "Our findings provide evidence for an empirical link between a specific neurotransmitter measured in the brains of individuals with autism and an autistic behavioral symptom". The paper does not mention vaccination, or have any indication of causation. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.

Epub 2006 Apr 19. No mention of autism. Thimerosal is no longer used in US pediatric vaccines and has been exonerated of causality in autism (see Hurley 2010, Price 2010, Yoshimasu 2014, Taylor 2014). Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 106. 124 papers number: 99. 72 papers number 66: Sulkowski ZL, Chen T, Midha S, Zavacki AM, Sajdel-Sulkowska EM. Maternal thimerosal exposure results in aberrant cerebellar oxidative stress, thyroid hormone metabolism, and motor behavior in rat pups; sex- and strain-dependent effects. Cerebellum. 2012 Jun;11(2):575-86. This study gave pregnant and lactating rats thimerosal at an amount 100 times greater than the vaccine exposure. Thimerosal is no longer used in US pediatric vaccines and has been exonerated of causality in autism (see Hurley 2010, Price 2010, Yoshimasu 2014, Taylor 2014). Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 107. 124 papers number: 100. 72 papers number 67: Hertz-Picciotto I, Delwiche L. The rise in autism and the role of age at diagnosis. Epidemiology. 2009 Jan;20(1):84-90. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181902d15. “Autism incidence in California shows no sign yet of plateauing. Younger ages at diagnosis, differential migration, changes in diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases do not fully explain the observed increases.” Evidently, according to Taylor, that means that vaccine must account for the observed increases, while disregarding significant changes in demographic data, such as maternal and paternal age at first childbirth. The paper does not mention vaccines. It is curious that Taylor does not include the other 24 papers on autism in which Hertz-Picciotto has been a contributing author,. Also see discussion of this paper at the Natural Variation blog. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 108. 124 papers number: 101. 72 papers number 68: Khan Z, Combadière C, Authier FJ, Itier V, Lux F, Exley C, Mahrouf-Yorgov M, Decrouy X, Moretto P, Tillement O, Gherardi RK, Cadusseau J. Slow CCL2-dependent translocation of biopersistent particles from muscle to brain. BMC Med. 2013 Apr 4;11:99. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-11-99. This paper assumes that ‘Shoenfeld syndrome” or "Autoimmune (Auto-inflammatory) Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants” (ASIA) is a real condition, not an artifact found by one group of researchers. It has not yet been verified. At http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2013/08/09/antivaccinationists-against-the-hpv-vaccine-round-5000/, the blogger (a cancer researcher and surgeon) writes:
....an entity called ASIA (Autoimmune/Inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants). From what I’ve been able to tell, ASIA is basically a made-up syndrome that isn’t generally accepted....Even more dubious are the clinical criteria, four major and four minor, that are used to “diagnose” ASIA. The idea is that either two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria are required for a diagnosis of ASIA. Out of curiosity, I went back to what appears to be the original article in which ASIA was defined by Yehuda Shoenfeld, who is known for testifying for “vaccine injury” victims and running a journal sympathetic to antivaccine views, even publishing works by quacks like Mark and David Geier. The “syndrome” appears to have been made up of whole cloth based on unfounded assumptions.
Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 109. 124 papers number: 102. 72 papers number 69: Blaxill MF, Redwood L, Bernard S. Thimerosal and autism? A plausible hypothesis that should not be dismissed. Med Hypotheses. 2004;62(5):788-94. Note that this paper is from 2004. Since that time, (1) Thimerosal has been removed from all pediatric vaccines, with the exception of some flu vaccines (2) Autism has continued to rise (3)The concerns about thimerosal have been addressed with epidemiological studies, and dismissed. (4) The concerns about thimerosal have been given a thorough airing in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program legal hearings (Autism Omnibus) and have been found to be baseless. For example

131 papers number: 110. 124 papers number: 103. 72 papers number 70: Windham GC, Zhang L, Gunier R, Croen LA, Grether JK. Autism spectrum disorders in relation to distribution of hazardous air pollutants in the san francisco bay area. Environ Health Perspect. 2006 Sep;114(9):1438-44. This and other environmental studies were discussed at Association Between Autism and Environmental Mercury Exposure Disappears Once Population Density is Controlled for
My primary criticism of these types of studies is that they are attempting to find a cause for an epidemiological phenomenon that could very well not require an environmental explanation. That is, administrative data (special education data in particular) is not equipped to tell us if there are real differences in the prevalence of autism from one region to the next. No screening has ever demonstrated that substantial differences in administrative prevalence between regions are not simply diagnostic differences.
This study does not address vaccines. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 111. 124 papers number: 104. 72 papers number 23: Palmer RF, Blanchard S, Stein Z, Mandell D, Miller C. Environmental mercury release, special education rates, and autism disorder: an ecological study of Texas. Health Place. 2006 Jun;12(2):203-9. In commenting on a later Palmer study, one researcher wrote, “Dr. Palmer’s 2006 study, which was so full of holes that even antivaccinationists had a hard time defending it,” This study has nothing to do with vaccines. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 112. 124 papers number: 105. 72 papers number 0: Dickerson AS, Rahbar MH, Han I, Bakian AV, Bilder DA, Harrington RA, Pettygrove S, Durkin M, Kirby RS, Wingate MS, Tian LH, Zahorodny WM, Pearson DA, Moyé LA 3rd, Baio J.

Epub 2015 Jul 25. This paper, while interesting, does not discuss vaccines. There's no arsenic or lead in vaccines. Thimerosal is no longer used in US pediatric vaccines and has been exonerated of causality in autism (see Hurley 2010, Price 2010, Yoshimasu 2014, Taylor 2014).

Vaccine. 2011 Nov 8;29(48):8982-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.039. Epub 2011 Sep 22. Partial conclusions: "The inflammatory response elicited by vaccination is substantially milder and more transient than seen in infectious illness, arguing for the clinical value of vaccination. However, further research is needed to confirm that the mild inflammatory response elicited by vaccination is benign in pregnancy." Two subsequent studies, listed below, have confirmed the safety of trivalent influenza virus vaccines for pregnant women and the children whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy.

None of the 3 studies cited above mention autism. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 114. 124 papers number: 107. 72 papers number 72: Brown AS, Sourander A, Hinkka-Yli-Salomäki S, McKeague IW, Sundvall J, Surcel HM. Elevated maternal C-reactive protein and autism in a national birth cohort. Mol Psychiatry. 2013 Jan 22. doi: 10.1038/mp.2012.197. [Epub ahead of print] This study is part of the research coming out of the Finnish Prenatal Study of Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders (FIPS-A), "a new study designed to examine the relationship between prenatal serologic factors, mediating and moderating developmental antecedents, and risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)."" The Brown 2013 study found "In conclusion, we demonstrated that elevated maternal CRP is related to an increased risk of autism in offspring. These findings, if replicated, may have important implications for elaborating the role of immune system dysfunction in autism. Elevated maternal CRP may represent a common pathway by which infections and other inflammatory insults elevate risk for autism." Does not establish that vaccines, either pediatric or those given to the mother during pregnancy, are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 115. 124 papers number: 108. 72 papers number 0: Ewing GE. What is regressive autism and why does it occur? Is it the consequence of multi-systemic dysfunction affecting the elimination of heavy metals and the ability to regulate neural temperature? N Am J Med Sci. 2009 Jul;1(2):28-47. This is not a study or review; it's the author's (a wellness entrepreneur) opinions on the cause of autism, informed by his unscientific beliefs about autism and disease. He offers no evidence for his assertions. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 116. 124 papers number: 109. 72 papers number 0: Sienkiewicz D, Kulak W, Okurowska-Zawada B, Paszko-Patej G, Neurologic adverse events following vaccination, Prog Health Sci 2012 vol 2 no 1 The authors of this paper argue that adverse events following vaccination are common, drawing on papers reviewed in this list (the work of the Geiers, the Blaxill baby--hair paper, several Tomljenovic and Shaw papers, etc. ). Oddly, a previous Polish study had shown Lack of association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The Sienkiewicaz paper also spends time on the "vaccines didn't save us gambit"-- the ploy that "vaccine-preventable diseases were declining before immunization, so immunization is unnecessary. It's a false ploy. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 117. 124 papers number: 110. 72 papers number 0: Gesundheit B, Rosenzweig JP, Naor D, Lerer B, Zachor DA, Procházka V, Melamed M, Kristt DA, Steinberg A, Shulman C, Hwang P, Koren G, Walfisch A, Passweg JR, Snowden JA, Tamouza R, Leboyer M, Farge-Bancel D, Ashwood P. Immunological and autoimmune considerations of Autism Spectrum Disorders. J Autoimmun. 2013 Aug;44:1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2013.05.005. Epub 2013 Jul 15. This is a review paper: "We will summarize the various types of studies associating ASD with the immune system, critically evaluate the quality of these studies, and attempt to integrate them in a way that clarifies the areas of immune and autoimmune phenomena in ASD research that will be important indicators for future research." Vaccines are not mentioned. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 118. 124 papers number: 111. 72 papers number 0: Walker SJ, Fortunato J, Gonzalez LG, Krigsman A., Identification of unique gene expression profile in children with regressive autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ileocolitis. PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58058. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058058. Epub 2013 Mar 8. Why would a paper about gene expression, that doesn't have a word about vaccines, be included in a "vaccines cause autism" list? One of the authors, Arthur Krigsman, was and is a close colleague of Andrew Wakefield's from the time of retracted paper. Krigsman, who was an expert witness in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, was roundly criticized by the Special Master in the Cedillo Hearing. In any case, vaccines are not mentioned in the 2013 paper. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 119. 124 papers number: 112. 72 papers number 0: Stamova B, Green PG, Tian Y, Hertz-Picciotto I, Pessah IN, Hansen R, Yang X, Teng J, Gregg JP, Ashwood P, Van de Water J, Sharp FR. Correlations between gene expression and mercury levels in blood of boys with and without autism. Neurotox Res. 2011 Jan;19(1):31-48. doi: 10.1007/s12640-009-9137-7. Epub 2009 Nov 24. This is one of the many papers coming out of the CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment) study at the MIND (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) Institute. "Samples collected from children ages 2–5 in this study do not directly address the role of Hg as a possible causal factor for autism which likely begins in utero or shortly after birth." Vaccines are not mentioned in the study. The children in the study were born after thimerosal was removed from vaccines, so any blood mercury would have other sources. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 120. 124 papers number: 113. 72 papers number 0: Weizman A, Weizman R, Szekely GA, Wijsenbeek H, Livni E. Abnormal immune response to brain tissue antigen in the syndrome of autism. Am J Psychiatry. 1982 Nov;139(11):1462-5. A very small study with 28 subjects from 1982, in which it was found that "The results indicate the existence of a cell-mediated immune response to brain tissue in the syndrome of autism." The paper is entirely silent on the subject of vaccines. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 121. 124 papers number: 114. 72 papers number 0 Kawashima H, Mori T, Kashiwagi Y, Takekuma K, Hoshika A, Wakefield A. Detection and sequencing of measles virus from peripheral mononuclear cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and autism. Dig Dis Sci. 2000 Apr;45(4):723-9. First, observe the last author, Andrew Wakefield. Then, the date of publication, 2000. The nine tissue samples came from his laboratory. Dr. Steven Bustin, the world's authority on the type of analysis used in this paper,published Why There Is no Link Between Measles Virus and Autism. In addition, subsequent studies (Afzal 2006, Horning 2008) found Lack of Association between Measles Virus Vaccine and Autism with Enteropathy. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 122. 124 papers number: 115. 72 papers number 0 Tomljenovic L, Shaw CA. Mechanisms of aluminum adjuvant toxicity and autoimmunity in pediatric populations. Lupus 2012; 21: 223–230. This is not a research paper, it is a collection of unfounded ideas or assertions, ending with the call, "a rigorous evaluation of the vaccine-related adverse health impacts in the pediatric population is urgently needed." First, many have been done. Second, Mitkus 2011 : "We conclude that episodic exposures to vaccines that contain aluminum adjuvant continue to be extremely low risk to infants and that the benefits of using vaccines containing aluminum adjuvant outweigh any theoretical concerns." Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 123. 124 papers number: 116. 72 papers number 0 C Shaw, S Sheth, D Li, L Tomljenovic Etiology of autism spectrum disorders: Genes, environment, or both? OA Autism 2014 Jun 10;2(2):11 Another speculative paper. The essential argument of this paper is that while genetics may account for some cases of autism, it doesn't for all, and therefore an environmental component may be found. It might be thimerosal, but it might also be aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. As evidence for the latter, they cite their 2001 paper, Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism? In 2012, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety called the paper "seriously flawed". Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 124. 124 papers number: 117. 72 papers number 0 Wu X, Liang H, O'Hara KA, Yalowich JC, Hasinoff BB. Thiol-modulated mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of thimerosal and inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II alpha. Chem Res Toxicol. 2008 Feb;21(2):483-93. doi: 10.1021/tx700341n. Epub 2008 Jan 16. In vitro study of thimerosal. Thimerosal is no longer used in US pediatric vaccines and has been exonerated of causality in autism (see Hurley 2010, Price 2010, Yoshimasu 2014, Taylor 2014). Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 125. 124 papers number: 118. 72 papers number 0 King IF, Yandava CN, Mabb AM, Hsiao JS, Huang H-S, Pearson BL, Calabrese JM, Starmer J, Parker JS, Magnuson T, Chamberlain SJ, Philpot BD Topoisomerases facilitate transcription of long genes linked to autism Nature 501, 58–62 (05 September 2013) doi:10.1038/nature12504 The paper observes that "Environmental factors, including chemicals that are ingested during critical periods of brain development, can also increase autism risk." The reference is to Christiansen 2013, which found that prenatal exposure to the epilepsy drug valproate raised the risk of autism. This paper does not mention vaccines. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.
131 papers number: 126. 124 papers number: 119. 72 papers number 0 Shaw CA, Tomljenovic L, Aluminum in the central nervous system (CNS): toxicity in humans and animals, vaccine adjuvants, and autoimmunity. Immunologic Research July 2013, Volume 56, Issue 2-3, pp 304-316 A third speculative paper from Shaw and Tomljenovic.As evidence for their assertions, they cite their own papers, including the paper that the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety called the paper "seriously flawed". Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.

Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.

NA J Med Sci 2013; 6(2) Mumper is a "autism aware" pediatrician (she provides "integrative care" for autistic children) and who spaces out vaccines, and says it's resulted in fewer autism cases in her practice. (By the way, Dr. Mumper testified as an expert witness in the Omnibus Autism Hearing and it did not go well.) Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism.

In the Scribd document listing the 131 papers, much is made of subject Richard M.'s behavior following smallpox vaccination in 1940, implying that it was smallpox vaccination that caused his autism. This makes no sense. Does not establish that vaccines are causal in autism..
129 papers (two were posted twice) many having nothing to do with autism.
