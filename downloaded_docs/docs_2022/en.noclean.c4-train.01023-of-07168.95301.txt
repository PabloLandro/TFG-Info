In adults with no cognitive dysfunction, are statins associated with short-term cognitive impairment or long-term dementia?
Included studies compared any statin with control in adults with no history of cognitive dysfunction. The short-term (< 1 y after drug initiation) outcome was cognitive impairment, and the long-term (≥ 1 y after drug initiation) outcome was dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision).
MEDLINE, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, and Cochrane Central Register (all to Apr 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and, for long-term outcomes, high-quality prospective cohort studies. Reference lists were searched, and experts were consulted. 8 short-term RCTs and 8 long-term studies (mean exposure duration 3 to 25 y) met the selection criteria. Of the long-term studies, the outcome was specifically Alzheimer disease in 3 studies and dementia in 5 studies.
