Are Vaccines Safe and Effective? Points to Consider Before Vaccinating
By Jon Yaneff, CNP - March 19, 2015

Childhood vaccinations, and vaccines in general, are that hot-button topic that just won’t go away. After all, parents always want to do what is best for their families. They hear about vaccine-related injuries, possible adverse reactions, or potentially harmful ingredients, and they want to know if vaccines are really safe.
Fair enough.
Most media and doctors assure the public that the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination and others are completely safe; however, not every doctor agrees. In fact, there are books from naturopathic doctors, and even some medical doctors, that explain the adverse effects, questionable ingredients, and the many reasons people may choose an alternative vaccine schedule.
Many people question the overloaded vaccination schedule imposed upon children. According to the most recent vaccination schedule from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 11 different vaccinations are recommended in the first two years of life, including the MMR vaccinations. Following that, several vaccinations are recommended for teenagers and adults. One or two doses of the MMR are even recommended for adults between the ages of 19 and 55.
The recent measles outbreaks in the U.S. have created hysteria surrounding the anti-vaccination debate, with parents and people either against or for vaccines. As of March 6, there have been four outbreaks and 173 measles cases in 2015. Last year, there were more than 600 measles cases.
But getting back to the main question: are vaccines safe?
What’s Hiding in the MMR Vaccination?
Well, I came across an interesting study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology from 1995, which found the MMR vaccine could lead to the measles infection.
For this study, researchers analyzed urine samples from 15-month-old children and young adults who just received the MMR vaccination. The urine samples were tested using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a state-of-the-art technology designed to help with measles detection.
It was very startling what the scientists discovered. The measles virus RNA was found in 10 of 12 children within one to 14 days after vaccination in the two-week sampling period. Also, in four of the young adults, the measles virus RNA was detected one to 13 days after receiving the MMR vaccination.
When it comes to the 52 measles cases from Disneyland and other recent measles outbreaks, testing these cases with the RT-PCR could have been quite revealing. Testing with the RT-PCR would have helped determine whether the measles cases were from the vaccine strain or a wild measles strain. If the vaccine strain were responsible, that would mean that the vaccinated spread the disease.
The MMR vaccine is known to contain questionable ingredients. It does not contain the usual suspects found in most vaccinations, such as mercury, antibiotics, and formaldehyde. It does, however, contain other unusual ingredients, like cow fetus serum, chick embryo proteins, human DNA and protein fragments from fetal cells, cells from aborted human babies, and glutamate (MSG).
Is There an Autism-Vaccination Link?
There is also the question of the autism-vaccination link. A 1998 study first linked autism with vaccines; however, the research was later retracted in 2010. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed several studies in 2004 and concluded that there is no MMR vaccine and autism link. Having said that, the report also stated that the MMR vaccine contributed to autism in some children.
Some journal and news articles will claim there is no evidence that vaccines cause autism, while other evidence will support the connection.
In a epidemiological study published in the journal Translational Neurodegeneration in 2014, a researcher found that in African-American boys who received the MMR vaccine before 36 months of age, the vaccine increased the development of autism by 3.4 times. The Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to assess the autism risks among the boys.
Also, in 2012, an Italian court found a vaccine-autism link and overruled decisions from Italy’s Ministry of Health. A 15-month-old boy immediately developed eating and bowel problems and was diagnosed with autism and cognitive delay within the year. The court determined that a combination of MMR and aluminum- and mercury-containing hexavalent vaccines could contribute to the development of autism.
Other Vaccination Concerns
There are many other health risks with vaccinations. Measles-containing vaccinations are also linked with serious neurological disorders, multiple sclerosis, convulsions, ulcerative colitis, the autoimmune condition thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, panniculitis, anaphylaxis shock, pneumonia, diabetes, bowel disorders, eczema, diarrhea, irritability, and permanent immune damage.
A 2012 research paper published in the Cochrane Database Systemic Review found that the design and reporting methods in MMR vaccine safety studies are largely inadequate. Another study from 2011 found that the aluminum in some vaccines is also connected with autism. Alzheimer’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease, anemia, Parkinson’s disease, rickets, and encephalopathy are other conditions linked with aluminum excess.
What should be the important takeaway here? It is very vague when the media and government scoff at any safety issues with any type of vaccine, including MMR vaccinations, especially when evidence does suggest that there are risk and safety concerns. Before reading the headlines and taking what the media has to say at face value, get educated. Talk to a trained naturopathic doctor or homeopath who can help you determine whether or not vaccinations are safe for you or your children, perhaps even creating an alternative vaccine schedule.
The MMR vaccination is just one common vaccine that has made it into news headlines lately. Clearly, there is enough evidence to question its complete safety, so be sure to do your research before coming to your own conclusion.
