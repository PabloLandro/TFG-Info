Dr. Barrie Trower, a British physicist who was a microwave weapons expert and who worked for the Royal Navy and the British Secret Service, talks about the health effects of WiFi and other forms of microwave radiation.
Dr. Trower came out of retirement because he was concerned that the microwave frequencies and intensities to which children are exposed in schools are similar to those used for microwave weapons.

Face to Face with Dr. Magda Havas — The Dangers of Wireless Technology
Face to Face with Dr. Magda Havas -- The Dangers of Wireless Technology [30min] (Filesize: up to 85MB, depending on selected quality)
Trent University toxicologist Dr. Magda Havas is our special guest in this episode.
Dr. Havas is a leading researcher who has been studying the health effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic energy at the extremely low frequency range (50/60 Hertz) and at the radio frequency range commonly associated with wireless telecommunication. In this interview, she discusses aspects of wireless technology that the mainstream media, the telecommunications industry and Industry and Health Canada - and elsewhere - don't want you to know about.

http://www.electropollution.org
The Government insists Wi-Fi is safe, but a Panorama investigation shows that radio frequency radiation levels in some schools are up to three times the level found in the main beam of intensity from mobile phone masts.
There have been no studies on the health effects of Wi-Fi equipment, but thousands on mobile phones and masts.
The radiation Wi-Fi emits is similar to that from mobile phone masts. It is an unavoidable by-product of going wireless.
Entire cities have become what are known as wireless hotspots.

Is this the "smoking gun" that proves how dangerous Wi-Fi is? In 2004 a Swiss mobile carrier patented a router design that was intended to reduce or eliminate part of the radiation emitted by Wi-Fi routers and transmitters due to cancer concerns/DNA damage. Watch the 5 minute video.
A simple and important explanation of Wi-Fi technology for parents, teachers and administrators.
