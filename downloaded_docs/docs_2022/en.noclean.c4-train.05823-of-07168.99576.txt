24/7 Be Bright
Brighter and evenly toned skin is often an element of a fresh and rejuvenated appearance. As a result, healthy skin is considered an important attribute of beauty. Around the world, lightening products are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to fight age related hyper-pigmentation (age spots). Consumers use these products not only to correct discolorations and imperfections but also to achieve younger looking skin
Today, a growing awareness is devoted to the risks associated with specific ingredients that are often found in whitening products. Consumers want effective brightening products, without having to compromise the safety of their skin and overall health.
The 24/7 BE BRIGHT product line is based on innovative formulas comprised of the following safe and tested lightening ingredients.
Delentigo™ – Age spots are characterized by the increased production of two pigments: melanin and lipofuscin. Delentigo prevents and regulates the formation of both of these pigments, leaving the skin free of discoloration.
β White™ - As an encapsulated TGF – β Biomimic peptide, β White corrects the MITF cellular pathway to decrease various types of pigmentation, resulting in optimal whitening and lightening of the skin. The results of an in-vitro efficacy comparison study showed that β-White safely decreases Melanin Synthesis substantially more than Arbutin and Vitamin C.
Sepicalm VG – As the forerunner in its class of ingredients SEPICALM VG decreases regular pigmentation induced by inflammatory stress. It also works to decrease "Basal pigmentation" which is either caused by the skin's condition or genetic aging.
O.D.A White™ - Octadecenedioic Acid (ODA) is a skin brightening agent that acts by regulating tyrosinase within skin cells. A clinical study showed that O.D.A White lightens the skin as well as Arbutin without causing harm to the skin.
WHITENING & SAFETY
We do not use the following ingredients:
NO Hydroquinone – An ingredient that was once considered a leading bleaching agent. Now it is considered unsafe when used in cosmetic preparations. Today, the use of Hydroquinone as a bleaching ingredient is banned in many countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC: 1976.
NO Arbutin – A glucosylated Hydroquinone, which may carry similar cancer risks. Its usage is restricted in many countries as it may be hazardous.
NO Kojic Acid – An additional lightening ingredient that is restricted in many countries, due to its potential to cause sensitivity and skin irritations. The European scientific committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) suggested to limit its usage level as it may pose risk to consumers' health.
NO Hydrogen Peroxyde – a bleaching ingredient that may cause mild to severe stinging, burns and irritations.
