January 2, 2019: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are on the rise across Colorado
A recent report by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found that chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis rates have increased throughout Colorado. Untreated STIs increase a person's risk of health complications.
The report showed Broomfield's rate of chlamydia was 308 per 100,000 (210 cases) in 2017. The rate of gonorrhea was 75 per 100,000 (51 cases)--a 13% increase compared to 2016. Among the 64 Colorado counties, Broomfield County ranked 29th for chlamydia rates and 21st for gonorrhea rates.
"We encourage people to protect themselves from STIs, and we provide STI testing and treatments," said Jason Vahling, Broomfield's Public Health Director. "Our Reproductive Health Clinic offers these services and walks everyone through ways to take care of their overall well-being."
Being sexually active increases a person's risk of contracting STIs. Consistent and correct use of latex condoms can lower the chances of spreading STIs; however, the only way to completely guard against these infections is to abstain from sex.
Work with your provider by talking about sexual health and STIs; getting tested to find out if you have an STI; and getting the right treatment. It's important for people with multiple sexual partners, new partners, men who have sex with men, and people with HIV to get tested for STIs more frequently.
The statewide congenital syphilis rate--babies born with syphilis--is increasing. Pregnant women should get tested for syphilis at their first prenatal visit. Those at high risk of infection should be tested again early in the third trimester and the newborn may be screened after birth.
Broomfield's Reproductive Health Clinic offers confidential STI screening, prevention, and treatment for free or low-cost. No one is turned away for inability to pay. To make an appointment, call 720.887.2251. Visit broomfield.org/clinics to find out more about the services offered.
December 31, 2018: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment promotes new tools to help Coloradans keep their New Year's resolution to quit smoking
DENVER - Free web-based support and medications are helping Coloradans keep their New Year's resolutions to quit smoking for good.
Quitting smoking is among the most common New Year's resolutions.
"The benefits of quitting are immediate and long-lasting, from finally tasting food to shaking that persistent cough to avoiding cancer, stroke and heart disease down the road," said Dr. Tista Ghosh, interim chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
Although many Colorado smokers try to quit each year, most try to do it on their own. Research has proven that using support, such as medication or coaching, can more than double the chances of quitting.
"Most people know smoking is bad for them, but they still struggle to quit," said Ghosh. "Lots of Coloradans feel like a healthy life is out of reach, but they can quit by using free support available to them."
New online resources are available for free through the Colorado QuitLine.
Thomas Ylioja, clinical director for the Colorado QuitLine, said, "As the needs and preferences of smokers change, QuitLine services are changing to meet those demands. We've added new features such as e-coaching, where clients can chat with a coach online rather than over the phone, if that's what they'd prefer. Or, they can enroll online in a few minutes and receive coaching calls over the phone. Clients also can order nicotine patches or gum online and get it delivered to their door for free."
Coloradans wanting to make a change in 2019 now have more ways than ever before to get help. Whether they're looking for advice from a health care provider, hoping to make their own plan online, or just stopping by their local pharmacy, support to stop smoking is at their fingertips.
Quitting is hard, but Tobacco Free Colorado is here to help. The website offers free, interactive content and tips for people at every stage of the quit journey.
The Colorado QuitLine is available by phone at 1-800-QUIT-NOW or via its website where clients can enroll in just a few minutes. In addition to e-coaching, the QuitLine offers four weeks of free patches, gum or lozenges. Combining medication and coaching is the best way to quit, and now Coloradans can get free support from any phone, tablet or computer.
Members of Health First Colorado, Colorado's Medicaid Program, can access counseling and smoking cessation medications at no cost. Medicaid providers in Colorado can now also prescribe these medications without prior approval.
Pharmacists in Colorado now can prescribe smoking cessation medications to help people manage symptoms and increase chances of success. Clients 18 years of age or older can visit a participating Colorado pharmacy and request smoking cessation services. No appointment is needed.
Quitting smoking is the most important thing a smoker can do to be healthy. Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in Colorado. But with so many new ways to get support, this may be the year to keep that New Year's resolution to quit.
November 6, 2018: COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT: HEALTH ADVISORY VAPE USE AND NICOTINE ADDICTION
On Friday, Governor John Hickenlooper released the Colorado Tobacco Prevention Blueprint and recognized "Vape-Free November" to increase awareness about the dangers of e-cigarettes and vaping, and to reduce use of all tobacco products by young people.
Colorado leads the nation in youth use of vapor products, with 27 percent of teens currently vaping. In Broomfield and Boulder counties, 36 percent of teens report vaping. Broomfield Public Health and Environment staff are partnering with schools and youth-serving organizations to educate the community about the risks of vaping.
Below is a Health Advisory from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that contains information and evidence-based recommendations for addressing this emerging health issue.
If you have questions or would like to be connected with a local expert, please contact Meredith Warman at 720.887.2220 or email mwarman@broomfield.org.

Health Advisory English | En español (full text below)
November 2, 2018
The most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that Colorado leads the nation in youth use of vapor products, known as vape or e-cigarettes.(1) These products have become increasingly popular in recent years and are the second most used substance among Colorado high school students behind alcohol. One in four Colorado teens report that they vape.(2)
What our kids inhale from e-cigarettes and JUUL is not harmless water vapor.
JUUL is a new vaping device that looks like a flash drive and always contains nicotine in high dosages. Nicotine is the addictive substance found in vape and cigarettes. One small "pod" contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. JUUL has skyrocketed in popularity and is now estimated to be more than 70 percent of the US e-cigarette market.(3) The vast majority of other vapor products sold in convenience stores also contain nicotine,(4) even if the label doesn't always say so.
____________________________________________________
E-CIGARETTES ARE THE SECOND MOST TRIED SUBSTANCE AMONG COLORADO YOUTH
Have used substances at least once in their life.
Alcohol: 59%
E-cigarettes*: 44%
Marijuana: 35%
Cigarettes: 16%
*Does not include marijuana
____________________________________________________
Nicotine, the addictive substance in vape and cigarettes, affects the developing brain.
One in three Colorado high school students report using tobacco products and the vast majority of those vape.(5)
Youth who vape are at risk for long-lasting effects of exposing their developing brains to nicotine. These risks include nicotine addiction, mood disorders and permanent lowering of impulse control.(6)
Nicotine also changes the way synapses (connections between brain cells) are formed, which can harm the parts of the brain that control attention and learning.(7)
Teens who vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes or cigars(8), products that kill up to half of their users.
Kids don't realize vape products almost always contain nicotine.(9)
While nearly all teens know smoking cigarettes is unhealthy, fewer realize vape products are not good for their health.(10)
Vapor products expose bystanders to air pollutants that are not safe to breathe. These can include cancer-causing chemicals, heavy metals and nicotine.(11)
____________________________________________________
RISK PERCEPTION AND ACCESS Among all Colorado youth
DO YOUTH THINK:
Smoking is risky? 87%
It's easy to get cigarettes? 56%
Vaping is risky? 50%
It's easy to get e-cigarettes? 58%
____________________________________________________
TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS EMERGING HEALTH ISSUE
PARENTS:
Talk with your kids about the risks of using e-cigarettes. Get the facts for your conversations at www.tobaccofreeco.org/know-the-facts.
Set a smoke- and vapor-free rule for your home and car.
Although vapor products may have the potential to benefit adult smokers who switch completely from cigarettes to vapor products, they are not safe for teens to use.(12) Parents who choose to quit vaping or any other tobacco product can access free support through the Colorado QuitLine at 1-800-QUIT-NOW or coquitline.org.
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS:
Screen all youth, parents and caregivers for e-cigarette use and exposure.
Counsel children and adolescents about the harms of e-cigarette use and clearly communicate the importance of never using e-cigarettes or other nicotine products.
Refer youth to developmentally appropriate tobacco treatment, such as behavioral coaching offered through the Colorado QuitLine. The QuitLine serves clients age twelve and older.
Review the American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on e-cigarettes.
SCHOOL STAFF:
Promote your tobacco-free policy to students, parents and staff and consistently enforce it.
Use in-school alternatives to suspension such as Second Chance for youth who violate the policy.
Encourage quitting among students and staff. We recommend Smokefree Teen at teen.smokefree.gov or the Colorado QuitLine at www.coquitline.org or 1-800-QUIT-NOW.
Learn more about what schools can do to address this issue in this letter CDPHE recently sent to Colorado schools.
POLICYMAKERS:
Require retailers to obtain an annual license to sell any tobacco product, including vape products. Suspend or revoke licenses for illegal sales to minors.
Update the definition of tobacco products to include all nicotine products, including vape, to ensure these products are taxed and treated like other tobacco products.
Restrict the use of e-cigarettes in public places where cigarette and marijuana use is already prohibited.
Require age verification for the delivery of internet and mail-order tobacco and nicotine products.

October 11, 2018: Fight the flu: get vaccinated
BROOMFIELD - Flu season is on the way, and Broomfield Public Health and Environment urges people ages six months and older to get a flu vaccine.
"Getting your flu shot now is the best way to protect yourself against the flu," said Jason Vahling, public health director. "Since it takes about two weeks for the flu vaccine to protect you, the sooner you get your vaccine, the better."
Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone six months of age and older. While healthy people usually recover from the flu, getting a vaccine helps protect people at higher risk of complications, such as those 65 years and older, children younger than five, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic medical conditions. The flu shot is best to get it now, but it's not too late to get it any time. Flu season is typically October through April.
Check with your health care provider about getting vaccinated, or to find retail outlets (e.g. pharmacies) that offer flu vaccine, visit vaccinefinder.org. Broomfield Public Health and Environment offers flu shots through their Immunization Clinic. Call 720-887-2220 to make an appointment.
Common side effects from flu vaccine are soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling where the shot was given. Low-grade fever, headache and muscle aches also may occur. The body's immune response from vaccination declines over time, so an annual vaccine is needed for the best protection. Also, because flu viruses are constantly changing, the flu vaccine is updated each season.
In addition to getting vaccinated, remember:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and when you are sick, keep your distance from others.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
If you get flu and your doctor prescribes antiviral medications, take them as directed. These medicines can lessen flu symptoms and shorten the time you are sick.
To learn more about flu vaccines this year, visit the CDC flu vaccine page.

September 24: First Human Case of West Nile Virus in Broomfield County
Broomfield County, Colorado - The City and County of Broomfield Public Health and Environment Division reports its first human case of West Nile virus (WNV) for 2018. After showing symptoms, the Broomfield resident was tested for the virus but was not hospitalized.
West Nile virus is primarily a disease of birds, spread by infected mosquitoes to people; it is not transferred from person to person. Fortunately, most people infected with WNV will have no symptoms. However, those that do develop symptoms will typically have fever, headache, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or muscle and joint pain. Symptoms begin between 2 to 14 days after being bitten. People with milder symptoms typically recover on their own, although some symptoms may last for several weeks. A small number of people (less than one percent) will develop serious neurologic illnesses, such as meningitis or encephalitis. While everyone is at risk of being infected, people over 60 years of age and with certain medical conditions are at greater risk for serious illness. For more information on symptoms and those at higher risk, visit broomfield.org/westnile.
As of September 24, Colorado has reported 49 human cases of WNV. Last year, Broomfield had no reports of human cases of WNV, although there were 68 cases in Colorado. Most West Nile virus infections occur from June through September. "As summer winds down, remember that mosquito season is not yet over. Continue to make every effort to protect yourself from mosquitoes as you enjoy outdoor activities," said Broomfield Public Health Director, Jason Vahling.
Public Health officials recommend following the Four D's to prevent mosquito bites:
Drain standing water around the house since that's where mosquitoes breed. Be sure to empty old tires, cans, flower pots, clogged rain gutters, rain barrels, and toys where puddles can occur.
Dusk and dawn are when mosquitoes that carry the virus are most active, so limit outdoor activities or take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.
DEET, picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products provide the best protection. Follow label instructions.
Dress in long sleeves and pants to keep mosquitoes from biting.
For more information about WNV, visit broomfield.org/westnile or call Broomfield Public Health and Environment at 720.887.2220.
August 6: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment: First human cases of West Nile virus reported; take precautions to avoid bites
DENVER — The first two human cases of West Nile virus in Colorado in 2018 have been reported in Weld and Delta counties. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reminds people that preventing mosquito bites is the No. 1 way to avoid getting any mosquito-borne illness.
Weekly mosquito testing for West Nile virus began statewide in June. Adult mosquitoes are trapped and tested to provide an estimate of the number that are infected. The results help pinpoint the risk to humans in the area. West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes have been found in Adams, Boulder, Larimer and Weld counties this season. Not all counties and municipalities test mosquitoes, so it’s important for all Coloradans to take steps to protect themselves throughout the summer.
“When the virus is present, people are at risk,” said Jennifer House, state public health veterinarian. “Use an effective insect repellent, wear protective clothing or stay indoors when mosquitoes are active, and mosquito-proof your home.” Most human West Nile virus cases are reported in August and September.
In 2017, there were 68 human cases of West Nile virus in Colorado, including four deaths.
Most people who are infected with West Nile virus don’t have symptoms. About 20 percent have flu-like symptoms, and fewer than 1 percent develop a serious, potentially deadly illness, such as the one reported in Weld County last week. People over age 60 and those with certain medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. See a health care provider if you develop severe headaches or confusion.
To protect yourself:
Use insect repellents when you go outdoors. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products provide the best protection. Follow label instructions.
Limit outdoor activities at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus are most active.
Wear protective clothing (long pants, long-sleeved shirts and socks) in areas where mosquitoes are active. Spray clothes with insect repellent for extra protection
To mosquito-proof your home:
Drain standing water around your house often.
Empty water from tires, cans, flowerpots, clogged gutters, rain barrels, birdbaths, toys and puddles.
Install or repair screens on windows and doors.
For more information, visit the department’s West Nile virus web page. Check for human case numbers and mosquito trap results on the West Nile virus data page throughout the season.
July 2: Remember the "Four D's" during West Nile virus season
BROOMFIELD - With summer in full swing, Broomfield Public Health and Environment officials remind you to take precautions to prevent West Nile virus. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, there have been no reported human cases of West Nile virus this year. Last year, there were no reported human cases in Broomfield but the state reported 68 human cases. Cases of West Nile virus occur during mosquito season, which starts in the summer and continues through fall.
"Protecting yourself from mosquito bites is the number one way to avoid mosquito-borne illness," said Jason Vahling, Broomfield Public Health Director. "Use an effective insect repellent, wear protective clothing or stay indoors when mosquitoes are active, and mosquito-proof your home."
To protect yourself, follow the "Four D's"
Drain standing water around the house since that's where mosquitoes breed. Be sure to empty old tires, cans, flowerpots, clogged rain gutters, rain barrels, wading pools, and other toys where puddles can occur.
Dusk and Dawn are when mosquitoes that carry the virus are most active, so limit outdoor activities or take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.
DEET, picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products provide the best protection. Follow label instructions.
Dress in long sleeves and pants to keep mosquitoes from biting. Spray clothes with insect repellent for extra protection.
Most people who are infected with West Nile virus don't have symptoms. About 20 percent have flu-like symptoms, and fewer than one percent develop a serious, potentially deadly illness. People over age 60 and those with certain medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. See a health care provider if you develop severe headaches or confusion after being bitten by mosquitoes.
The City and County of Broomfield protects residents by providing mosquito control treatment that lowers the mosquito population numbers, which reduces the risk of human disease. The Mosquito Control Program is contracted through Vector Disease Control International. The company regularly monitors mosquito populations and West Nile virus activity to determine if, when, and where interventions are needed. Watch this video to learn more about the program and how to prevent West Nile virus.
For questions or concerns about mosquitoes, please call the Vector Disease Control International Mosquito Hotline at 303.428.5908 or visit broomfield.org/mosquito.
May 25: Warning: Rabies on the rise in the Front Range
Broomfield, CO - The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reports that 168 animals have tested positive for rabies in Colorado so far this year, with the vast majority from skunks. Skunks, bats, raccoons, and coyotes are the most common wildlife that can spread rabies, which can be deadly to both you and your pets if exposed.
"Due to the significant increase in rabies across the front range and a recent raccoon testing positive for rabies in Broomfield County," said Jason Vahling, public health director, "we would like to remind the public to avoid contact with wild animals and keep their pets vaccinated."
To avoid rabies:
Never touch or feed wild or stray animals, even if they appear friendly.
Never touch a bat.
Do not pick up, relocate or attempt to feed any young wild animals.
Avoid leaving food or garbage outside as it often attracts wildlife to your yard.
Leash your dog while walking and hiking.
Ensure pets, horses and livestock are current on rabies vaccinations and visit your veterinarian on a regular basis.
Recognizing sick wildlife:
Healthy wild animals normally are afraid of humans, but sick animals often do not run away from people and will display unusual, aggressive behavior.
Rabid animals may have trouble walking, flying, eating or drinking.
If an animal appears overly quiet and ill, do not bother it.
The classic sign to watch for with a rabid animal is unusual and aggressive behavior; for example, skunks that are usually only seen at night may be seen in the daytime. Please report any wild animal acting strangely to Broomfield Animal Services at 303.438.6400.
When to seek out care:
If you find a bat in a room or wake up to a bat in your bedroom, report it to Broomfield Animal Services.
Contact your veterinarian if your pet is bitten or scratched by a wild animal.
If you are bitten, scratched, or have any contact with a bat or other wild animal, contact your medical provider and notify Broomfield Public Health at 720.887.2220 as rabies post-exposure vaccinations may be needed to prevent the development of rabies.
For more information about rabies, please visit broomfield.org/rabies or call COHELP, the statewide public health information line at 1.877.462.2911.
May 24: Let's Talk Colorado Kick's Off for Mental Health Month
The Let's Talk Colorado campaign, is a community-based effort encouraging everyone to talk to someone about their own mental health. The campaign originally launched last May and is widespread throughout Colorado. This year, through a group of professionals and mental health advocates and survivors, the message was updated to benefit all Coloradans and to increase awareness.

March 7: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment says "Twenty-seven animals have tested positive for rabies"
DENVER — Twenty-seven animals have tested positive for rabies in Colorado this year, putting many pets, livestock and people at risk of exposure to the disease. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment urges people to make sure their pets are up to date on their rabies shots, avoid stray and wild animals, and take other precautions against rabies.
Rabies regularly is found in Colorado wildlife, especially skunks. While it is typical to see an increase in the number of cases as the weather warms up, it has occurred earlier than normal this year. Rabies in skunks is now found routinely along the Front Range and in metro Denver, meaning both humans and pets are at risk for this deadly disease anywhere in the eastern part of the state.
“The presence of rabid animals in densely populated areas is troubling,” said Jennifer House, public health veterinarian at the department. “Last year, two dogs in Colorado got rabies, so it’s essential to make sure your pets are up to date on their shots. This will keep them and the public safe.” In 2017, there were 165 confirmed cases of rabies in animals, including the two dogs.
Rabies spreads primarily through the bite of rabid animals. It usually is fatal in humans once symptoms appear.
People who have been bitten or scratched by an unfamiliar animal should contact their health care provider and their local public health department immediately.
If your pet has had contact with a skunk, bat, fox, raccoon or coyote, notify your veterinarian and your local health department.
To report animals acting strangely, contact the state health department or your local health department.
To avoid rabies
Never touch or feed wild or stray animals. Don’t leave pet food outdoors. If you need help with a sick or orphaned animal, don’t handle the animal; instead, contact a wildlife rehabilitator right away. Contact a nearby animal shelter if you encounter a lost or stray dog or cat.
Vaccinate your pets. Rabies shots should be given by a licensed veterinarian every one to three years. Don’t assume your pet is vaccinated; check records with your veterinary clinic.
Leash your dog while walking or hiking.
Keep all pets inside at night. Keep dogs within your sight (fenced or on leash) when they are outside during the day.
Vaccinate pastured animals annually. Have a licensed veterinarian administer an approved large-animal rabies vaccine.
Bat-proof your home.
Recognizing sick wildlife
Healthy wild animals normally are afraid of humans, but sick animals often do not run away from people.
Wildlife with rabies often will act aggressively or will violently approach people or pets.
Some rabid animals are overly quiet and passive and want to hide. Don’t bother them.
Rabid wildlife might have trouble walking, flying, eating or drinking.

March 1: Your Input Needed: Broomfield Health Priorities
The robust Community Health Assessment launches in March to ensure community members have a voice in selecting the top health priorities in Broomfield through community conversations and feedback through digital and print surveys.
"We are excited to launch this initiative with the support of partners who are committed to providing health and wellness for all Broomfield residents," said Public Health Director, Jason Vahling. "We feel it is vital to engage the community to shape the future of public health in Broomfield."
The Community Health Assessment examines the county's health every five years, with the most recent process starting in March. The effort involves working with over 20 community partners and agencies and gathers input from Broomfield residents in several ways including surveys at locations across the City and County, gathering information from the Citizen Survey, which goes out to 3,000 residents in Broomfield, an online survey, and social media surveys. The Community Health Assessment is scheduled for completion during the summer of 2018 and will lead to the development of a Public Health Improvement Plan in 2020.
For more information about the upcoming Community Health Assessment, including the online survey, visit broomfieldhealth.org.
January 24: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment promotes new tools to help Coloradans keep their New Year's resolution to quit smoking
DENVER - With new help from mobile technology, free medications and trained coaches, this could be the year you keep that New Year's resolution to quit smoking.
"Quitting the Colorado way just got easier," said Dr. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. "We're working with new technology and committed partners to break down the barriers for all Coloradans ready to quit smoking."
Although many Coloradans do not seek help to quit tobacco use, they are more likely to succeed when they do, though it may take several attempts. Research shows a combination of counseling and medication is most effective. Now, there are more options than ever for Coloradans to get help to quit smoking:
#ThisIsQuitting is a mobile quit-smoking app designed for young adults by the Truth Initiative that provides a community of support for those trying to quit. You can download it for free from Apple and Android to get peer support from real Colorado quitters; text messaging help; and activities to help you manage cravings, avoid stress and get you through the day without smoking.
The Colorado QuitLine is available by phone at 1-800-QUIT-NOW or at a new website that provides simple enrollment; a web-based quit plan with community support; and four weeks of free patches, gum or lozenges for eligible Coloradans.
Chantix, an FDA-approved prescription medication to help smokers quit, is now available for free through the Colorado QuitLine.
Health First Colorado now is providing tobacco cessation medications at local participating pharmacies and counseling for Medicaid members with no copay.
Smoking still is the leading cause of preventable death in Colorado, killing more than 5,000 each year. Tobacco use leads to cancer, heart disease, lung conditions and other chronic diseases. Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs available and is particularly damaging to young, developing brains.
While tobacco use has declined over the past decade, youth, young adults and low-income Coloradans are especially vulnerable. Young working adults are nearly three times as likely to smoke as their college-educated peers, and smoking rates among low-income Coloradans are more than double those of their higher-income neighbors.
"For many Coloradans, a healthy lifestyle can be out of reach," said Liz Whitley, director of the health department's Prevention Services Division. "These new free resources can help Coloradans who want a healthier, smoke-free life."

November 29: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment says to "Refuse the 'gift' that keeps on giving; get vaccinated to avoid flu"
DENVER- It's the season for friends, family, food -- and flu. Numerous gatherings and holiday travel mean it's an important time to get a flu vaccine if you haven't already done so this season.
Flu activity is increasing across the country and in Colorado, and most people who get the flu get sick between December and February. As long as flu viruses are circulating, it's not too late to get vaccinated.
"While it's hard to say how flu season will play out, so far, more people have been hospitalized with flu this year than at the same time in the last five seasons," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. "The annual flu vaccination is the best protection we have, so we encourage everyone age 6 months and older to get a vaccine as soon as possible."
There have been 210 Coloradans hospitalized with flu this year, compared to 64 at this time in 2016. Flu activity typically increases through February and can last through May.
"Getting vaccinated protects you and, perhaps more importantly, keeps you from spreading the virus to more vulnerable people," Herlihy said. People 65 years and older, children younger than 5, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic medical conditions are at higher risk of serious flu complications.
Check with your healthcare provider about getting vaccinated, or to find flu vaccines at retail outlets, visit vaccinefinder.org. People who need help paying for flu vaccine can contact their local public health agencies.
In addition to getting vaccinated, remember:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and when you are sick, keep your distance from others.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
If you get flu and your doctor prescribes antiviral medications, take them as directed. These medicines can lessen flu symptoms and shorten the time you are sick.
Visit the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's influenza data page to find the weekly flu report for Colorado.

November 16: Today is the Great American Smokeout
You'd like to quit tobacco, you intend to quit, but you haven't picked a day to do it.
How about today, Thursday, November 16, 2017?
That's the American Cancer Society Great American Smokeout®. You can join millions of Americans and start living tobacco-free. Research shows that if you pick a quit day that's within the next 30 days and stick to it, you'll be more likely to succeed in quitting.
Here are some ways to prepare for your quit day:
Pick the date and mark it on your calendar.
Tell friends and family about your quit day.
Visit cancer.org/smokeout for tips and tools to help you quit smoking.
Check out one of these apps to help you stay on track.
Think back to your other attempts to quit. What worked for you and what didn't?
Call the Colorado Quitline at 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) for free telephone coaching and free patches, gum, or Chantix when you enroll.
There is no one right way to quit and it takes a strong commitment over a long period of time. Remember to be patient with yourself-- quitting is a learning process! Quit smoking medications can help reduce withdrawal symptoms, but they are most effective when used as part of a plan that addresses the multiple aspects of quitting tobacco, such as using new ways to manage your stress.
Quitting isn't easy, but you can do it!

June 22: Fight the bite: Tips to protect yourself from mosquitoes this summer
With warm weather arriving, many of us will be spending more time outdoors. Insects like mosquitoes can be a nuisance and can also spread diseases like West Nile virus. While this is a great time to enjoy summer activities, please consider these safety tips to help keep you and your family healthy. Many of these problems can be prevented by basic precautions, including using insect repellent.
Do your part to “Fight the Bite” by following the Four D’s:
Dusk and Dawn are when mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus are most active, so limit outdoor activities or take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.
Defend yourself by using DEET or another effective insect repellent. Always follow label instructions carefully.
Dress in long sleeves and pants during dawn and dusk or in areas where mosquitoes are active. You can also treat outer clothing and outdoor gear with permethrin when in an area of very high risk for mosquito or tick-borne diseases.
Drain standing water around the house weekly since that's where mosquitoes lay eggs. Be sure to empty old tires, cans, flowerpots, clogged rain gutters, rain barrels, and toys where puddles can occur.
For more information about the West Nile virus, visit broomfield.org/westnile or call the Broomfield Public Health and Environment at 720-887-2220.
May 15: Broomfield Partners on New Public Health Campaign That Takes on Mental Health Stigma
The "Let's Talk Colorado" Campaign Works to Reduce the Stigma Around Mental Health so that People Who Need Care Are More Likely to Access It
Broomfield, CO - Broomfield's Public Health and Environment Division is working with a coalition of partner organizations on a new public health campaign called "Let's Talk Colorado." The campaign spotlights the stigma around mental health so that the people who need this type of help are more likely to seek it.
"Mental health challenges are very common and are similar to physical health challenges," said Jason Vahling, Public Health Director. "When someone breaks their leg we don't expect them to 'just snap out of it' or think they somehow brought it on themselves. Like physical health conditions, mental health conditions need treatment and the people who confront them need our support."
Let's Talk Colorado launched earlier this month, Mental Health Month, and urges everyone to talk openly about mental health issues and to talk with people who are impacted by mental health. One in five people struggle with a mental health condition. In fact, people with mental health challenges like anxiety, depression or eating disorders are as common as silver cars.
Let's Talk Colorado includes a web site, LetsTalkCO.org, that consists of ideas on how to talk about mental health, a toolkit of resources including a video, mental health stigma presentation, fliers and a newsletter article. The materials, created after a series of focus groups, draw from an award-winning campaign from Minnesota called MakeItOK.org.
People who need immediate support due to a mental health crisis should contact, or have a family member or friend contact, Colorado Crisis Services at 1.844.493.TALK(8255). This agency has trained counselors who are available 24/7/365 to work with persons in crisis and the people supporting them.
Start having a conversation today by visiting LetsTalkCO.org and follow us on our B Healthy Broomfield Facebook page to learn more.

May 10, 2017: Rabid skunk and bat found in Broomfield prompts warning
Broomfield, CO - On Tuesday, May 9, Broomfield Public Health and Environment confirmed two additional rabies cases in Broomfield. One case involved a rabid skunk, the other, a rabid bat. Broomfield residents called Animal Services when they noticed the wildlife appearing disoriented and active during the daytime. Normally, nocturnal wildlife such as skunks, foxes and bats are active at night.
"We are seeing a significant increase in skunk rabies throughout Colorado this year, and it is important for residents to stay away from wildlife," said Jason Vahling, Public Health Director. "If you see wildlife, including skunks, bats, raccoons, or coyotes, that look sick or are acting unusual, you should call Animal Services immediately."
Broomfield's first case of rabies occurred in a skunk back in February. This year, there have been 37 animal rabies cases in Colorado, including 34 skunks along the Front Range. Broomfield Public Health and Environment suspects there will be additional cases in the area throughout the summer and want residents to take precautions.
Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system of humans and other mammals, and is nearly always fatal without treatment. Animals with rabies can show several symptoms, including: disorientation, staggering, excessive drooling, aggressive behavior, and losing their fear of humans. All humans, pets and wildlife are susceptible to rabies from a bite, scratch, or through contact with the saliva of an infected animal. If you believe that you or your pet has come in contact with a rabid animal, contact your doctor or veterinarian for prompt medical treatment.
To prevent exposure to rabies, please take the following precautions to protect you and your family:
Avoid contact with any wild animals, especially any that appear to be acting unusual. A healthy wild animal will generally avoid human contact.
Report any wild animal acting strangely to Broomfield Animal Services at 303.438.6400.
Keep rabies vaccinations up-to-date for all pets and livestock.
Maintain control of your pets by keeping cats and ferrets indoors and keeping dogs under direct supervision and on a leash during outside activities.
Contact your veterinarian if your pet or livestock is bitten or scratched by a wild animal.
Avoid leaving food or garbage outside as it often attracts stray animals and wildlife to your yard.
Seek immediate medical attention if you are bitten or scratched by an animal, or had any contact with a wild animal, then contact Broomfield Public Health at 720.887.2220. Rabies post-exposure vaccinations may be needed immediately to prevent the development of rabies.
For more information about rabies, please visit broomfield.org/rabies or call COHELP, the statewide public health information line at 1.877.462.2911.

March 17, 2017: Plague activity found in Great Western Reservoir Open Space
On Friday, March 17, Broomfield Public Health and Environment reported plague activity near the Great Western Reservoir Open Space related to a prairie dog die off. This is the first incident of plague activity seen in Broomfield this season. The open space and nearby residential homes have been posted with signs listing precautionary measures to avoid exposure to fleas potentially infected with plague.
Plague occurs naturally in Colorado and is an infectious bacterial disease spread by fleas when they bite wild rodents and other small mammals such as squirrels, rats, prairie dogs and rabbits. Plague can also spread to humans when an infected flea bites a human. As this is the first plague activity found this season in Broomfield County, public health officials want to remind residents to protect themselves and their pets against plague.
"Plague is commonly transmitted from infected fleas and the public should take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure," says Jason Vahling, public health director. "It is important to avoid touching any sick or dead animals and taking safety measures to protect your family and pets."
Plague is easily treated in humans with antibiotics when recognized early. Typically one to six days after being infected with plague, people will become ill with the following symptoms: sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, extreme fatigue, and painful swollen lymph nodes. If you observe these symptoms in a person or pet, it is important to contact your health care provider or veterinarian immediately.
Public health officials recommend the following precautions to reduce the likelihood of being exposed to plague:
Avoid contact with any sick or dead wild animals.
Use insect repellant that contains DEET to prevent flea bites.
Tuck pant cuffs into socks to prevent flea bites.
Protect your pets by using preventive flea treatments.
Keep your dogs under direct supervision and on a leash when outside.
Contact your veterinarian if your pet becomes ill.
Prevent rodent infestations around your house by clearing away debris and trash.
Seek medical attention if you become ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.
Report any unusual wild animal activity to Broomfield Animal Services at 303.438.6400.
For more information about plague, please visit broomfield.org/plague or call COHELP, the statewide public health information line at 1.877.462.2911.

February 28, 2017: Skunk found in Broomfield tests positive for rabies
On Monday, February 27, a skunk tested positive for rabies at the Lac Amora Park area in Broomfield. A resident alerted Broomfield Animal Control after noticing a skunk roaming around during the day. This is first skunk ever to test positive for rabies in Broomfield. In 2016, 25 skunks tested positive throughout Colorado.
"Rabies, particularly in skunks, foxes, raccoons, and coyotes increases the risk of rabies exposure to pets and humans," said Jason Vahling, public health director. "If you see wildlife that looks sick or is acting unusual, you should call animal control immediately."
Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system of humans and other mammals, and is nearly always fatal without treatment. Animals with rabies can show several symptoms, including: disorientation, staggering, excessive drooling, aggressive behavior, and losing their fear of humans. The classic sign that they demonstrate is to show unusual behavior; for example, skunks that are usually only seen at night may be seen in the daytime. All humans, pets and wildlife are susceptible to rabies from a bite, scratch, or through contact with the saliva of an infected animal. If you believe that you or your pet comes in contact with a rabid animal, contact your doctor or veterinarian for prompt medical treatment.
In addition to ensuring pets are vaccinated against rabies, here are additional steps you can take to protect you and your family:
Visit your veterinarian on a regular basis and keep rabies vaccinations up-to-date for all cats, ferrets, dogs, horses, and livestock.
Avoid contact with any wild animals, especially any that appear to be acting unusual. A healthy wild animal will generally avoid human contact.
Report immediately any wild animal acting strangely to Broomfield Animal Control at 303.438.6400.
Maintain control of your pets by keeping cats and ferrets indoors and keeping dogs under direct supervision and on a leash when engaging in outside activities.
Contact your veterinarian if your dog, cat, or ferret is bitten or scratched by a wild animal.
Observe wild animals from a distance. Never feed or handle stray, wild, or unfamiliar animals even if they appear friendly.
Avoid leaving food or garbage outside as it often attracts stray dogs, cats, and wildlife to your yard.
Seek immediate medical attention if you are bitten or scratched by an animal, or had any contact with a wild animal, then contact Broomfield Public Health at 720.887.2220. Rabies post-exposure vaccinations may be needed immediately to prevent the development of rabies.

January 12, 2017: 1 Juice Drink Has the Same Amount of Sugar as 8-10 Cookies
Learn more at Hidden-Sugar.org
Many parents and caregivers are not aware of the hidden sugar in the beverages that they give to their children. That's why the Healthy Beverage Partnership is promoting a new campaign aimed at educating parents and caregivers about the harmful effects of sugar and informing them of the high sugar content in many of the beverages they may be giving to their kids.
Just one 20-ounce juice drink or one fruit punch beverage, or one soda can contain as much sugar as 8-10 chocolate chip cookies or three large donuts. By drinking just one sugary drink a day, a child has 25% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, 55% greater risk of being overweight or obese, and 150% greater risk of developing fat deposits in their liver, contributing to diabetes and heart disease. This is particularly alarming considering that one in five Colorado children has at least one sugary drink per day.
"We are coming together as a community to let people know how much sugar is in some of the beverages we drink, and offer suggestions to parents on how to choose healthier drinks for their kids," said Jason Vahling, public health director.
Through simple graphics, the Hidden Sugar campaign compares the sugar levels of sugary drinks like juice drinks, sports drinks, and soda to the sugar levels found in sugary foods and desserts, such as cookies, donuts, popsicles, and more. The campaign also promotes healthier options including tap or fruit infused water.
Details about the Hidden Sugar campaign can be found at Hidden-Sugar.org. Everyone, but especially those who make beverage decisions for children, is encouraged to visit the site, learn more about the alarming amounts of sugar hidden in juices, sports drinks, sodas and punches, and take a pledge to do without sugar-laden beverages.
About the Healthy Beverage Partnership
The Healthy Beverage Partnership is made up of six lead agencies, Boulder County Public Health, City and County of Broomfield Public Health and Environment, Denver Environmental Health, Denver Public Health, Jefferson County Public Health and Tri-County Health Department. Each county is facilitating local coalitions to engage everyone in this effort to improve dietary habits, shift norms and build healthier communities together.
In July 2015, a grant received from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment provided funds to local health departments to work on decreasing sugary beverage consumption. The grant has three components that are supported by regional and local coalitions: 1) conducting baseline assessments of food and beverage environments and policies in community institutions and settings, 2) providing technical assistance to community institutions to adopt healthy food and beverage policies, and 3) implementing an educational and public information campaign.
