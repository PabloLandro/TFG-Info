What Is Morphine?
What Is Morphine?
There has been a lot of controversy as to what morphine is, its effects, as well as its treatment. Morphine may actually come as feathery and silky crystals, crystalline powder or cubical crystals. It is white in color and dissolves well in water. It is not very soluble in alcohol. Its discovery dates back to the early 19th century. However, it was not until the discovery of a hypodermic syringe that its use became widespread.
It is important to note that morphine is in the class of opiates. It is derived from opium which is from the poppy plant. It is used in the treatment of pain, which could be from moderate to severe. However, it is important to acknowledge that the drug is addictive and, therefore, should only be taken according to a qualified medical practitioner’s instructions.
Though the drug is known to relieve pain, you need to note that it has direct effects on the central nervous system. It is known to produce euphoria and relieve anxiety as well as fear. One of its most adverse effects pertains to impairing the physical as well as mental capability of the individual. It also reduces hunger, hinders the cough reflex, reduces an individual’s sex drive and causes constipation. In women, the drug is known to interfere with their menstruation cycle.
It is important to acknowledge that the drug is highly addictive. This is especially true when the drug has been used for extended periods. Generally, when the drug has been used according to the prescriptions of a qualified medical practitioner, it would be very safe and not addictive. Continued usage, however, is known to cause physical dependency in an individual. In this case, the body becomes accustomed to having the chemicals in its system, therefore leading to intense cravings for the drug.
In addition, the body can develop a chemical tolerance in which case, the subsequent doses may not be effective in bringing about the initial results. This may lead the individual to abuse the drug by either increasing its dosage or even taking it more frequently. As much as dependency and chemical tolerance may not really point at abuse, they definitely have a bearing on the resultant addiction.
Morphine, like many narcotics, is known to activate the reward systems of the brain. With the high intensity of activation, cravings can occur, in which case the individual would concentrate all his or her efforts in acquiring and taking the drug. It strongly activates the reward mechanisms of the brain and alters their normal functioning, thus producing an addiction. This would definitely affect an individual’s consciousness level as well as his or her capacity to think straight or even their full awareness of their surroundings.
Due to its highly addictive nature, the drug can cause withdrawal if its consumption is discontinued abruptly. Some of the withdrawal symptoms include yawning, nausea, vomiting, sweating, chills, tearing, as well as constipation. The dangerous nature of taking the drug is evidenced by the fact that its effects would even be transmitted to the unborn baby in the case of pregnant mothers. It is important that an individual seeks help in a drug addition rehab center (800-303-2482) so he or she can be helped to quit the drug safely.
