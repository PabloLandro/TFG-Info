Can you become addicted to weed?

My brother smokes pot every day and has been doing so for the past year or so. He says he is not addicted and he can quit anytime but I am starting to think that he is not being honest with himself(or Me) so I was just wondering if anybody with some first hand knowledge could tell me if you can in fact become addicted to weed?

Yes, It is entirely possible that a person could become addicted to marijuana. That does not mean that everybody who uses it will, and it does not mean that even if it is an everyday thing for your brother that it could classify as an addiction. I would say it would fall more into the category of a bad habit. The only one with an answer would be your brother.

I'm sure that the scientific answer to this question is yes. However, I have never personally known a single person that has developed an addicted to marijuana in any way shape or form. Yea I know people who do it daily or even multiple times daily as it is a lifestyle choice for them but they are not addicts. If they needed to stop or even wanted to stop they could give it up without a problem(Every once in a while for personal reasons or for Jobs or really any number of reasons I have seen them quit without any blowback). So the answer is yes but the likelihood of it actually happening is low.
