Can I remove skin tags myself?
Never attempt to remove skin tags at home, regardless of instructions you may find online. Many over the counter medications are available to remove skin tags, but it is not safe to use these in an uncontrolled environment. When applied improperly, at home treatments can cause permanent skin damage and even result in painful injury. Some people attempt to cut off skin tags themselves, and this is also very dangerous. Without the proper tools and medical training, excessive bleeding, infection, and scarring can occur.
What treatments are available for skin tags at LA Laser and Skin Center?
Electrodesiccation
During treatment, an electric current is applied with a cauterizing tool to the skin tag, burning and killing the excess skin cells. The treated area will gradually heal, and any dead skin and scabs will naturally detach during the healing process. If a scar is left, it will be small and fade over time.
Cryotherapy
During treatment, liquid nitrogen is applied with a cryogun to the skin tag, freezing and killing the excess skin cells. The treated area will gradually heal, and any dead skin and scabs will naturally detach during the healing process. If a scar is left, it will be small and fade over time.
Scalpel Removal
When skin tags are a specific size and texture, a specialist may decide to remove them by using a scalpel. Depending on the size of the incision, stitches may be needed.
Laser Treatment
In some cases, a laser may be helpful in permanently removing skin tags that appear in highly cosmetic areas.
