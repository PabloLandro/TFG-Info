Are statins associated with cognitive impairment or dementia?
Included studies compared statin therapy with control in adults and evaluated cognitive function, including cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and dementia.
MEDLINE, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, and Cochrane Library (all to Oct 2012) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case–control studies, and cross-sectional studies published in English. Reference lists were searched. 57 studies met the selection criteria; 27 studies (3 RCTs, 16 cohort studies, 4 case–control studies, and 4 cross-sectional studies) were included in quantitative analyses.
