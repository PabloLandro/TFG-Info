Collagen Supplementation and Bone and Joint Health
Using a collagen supplement has been shown to provide many wonderful benefits to bone and joint health. Collagen may help to: maintain flexible and healthy joints, reduce joint pain, lubricate the joints, maintain and improve bone density, repair and maintain cartilage weakened by overuse, strengthen the membranes which hold synovial fluids between the joints, and aid in the repair of broken bones.
Many studies have concluded that hydrolyzed collagen can assist in protecting and metabolizing cartilage. Collagen has a therapeutic role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis; including increased osteoblast proliferation, mineralized bone matrix formation, bone preservation and increased bone mineral density. Collagen has also been shown to stimulate bone forming cells, protecting against excessive bone loss while improving calcium absorption which in turn helps to maintain bones (1,2,3,4,5,6,7).
Several of the amino acids in collagen help to maintain and promote bone health, for example alanine is a major component of connective tissue. Glycine may help to protect against arthritis and histidine can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The amino acid lysine supports the production of collagen which aids in the growth and maintenance of bone and connective tissues. Phenylalanine helps to reduce arthritic pain. Proline is responsible for the proper functioning of joints and is an important component of cartilage. Threonine supports the production of strong and elastic connective tissue. It also helps to build strong bones, strong tooth enamel and is required for the formation of collagen (8,9,10,11).
To summarize, supplementing with collagen may help to reduce pain from osteoarthritis, increase bone mineral density, decrease joint pain and help to maintain healthy cartilage. Research has proven that there are many benefits in using collagen for bone and joint health.

"I have been taking this supplement for a few years now
I had very painful knees and was suffering with plantar fasciitis on one foot. I initially read about it online and was convinced that I needed to give it a try. Wow, am I happy I did. It has been a life changing supplement for me and I will never be without it. I take two heaping tablespoons every morning in my coffee. It is virtually tasteless and dissolves completely and it doesn't change the consistency of my coffee. Give it a try if you have joint issues. It just might work for you too!"
