Once in Royal David's City
"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him
in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger;
because there was no room for them in the inn."
- Luke 2: 6-7
Dear Friends and Schoolmates,
I hope you're having a lovely weekend, and your lives are full and happy and bustling with excitement!
This is one of my favorite Christmas carols. It's not exciting, except in its message of joy, but it does fill my heart with a peaceful, gentle spirit of love.

From Joe Madagan ('57) of FL to Pat Beck Letzinger ('57) of VA - 12/08/06 - "Efforts to locate classmates":
Hi, Pat:
Today I received a mailing from Porter Phillips Booker with respect to the NNHS Class of 1957 Reunion to be held on September 7-9, 2007 at the Omni Hotel, Newport News, VA.
I am so excited that the plans have been formulated by the committee.
Yet, my excitement is dulled by the fact that we still have not located two classmates.
It would be most helpful if anyone could furnish me the name of the spouses, and a last known address, for Katherine ADAMS Barbrey and Eleanor SEWARD Davignon.
I have access to several powerful databases for locating person, but need the spouse's names. A last known address will be very helpful in tracking them down.
If you could appeal to our located Classmates to provide leads suggested above, it will be greatly appreciated when you sent our you next electronic newsletter for the class.
TYPHOON Regards,
Joe Madagan
Thank you, Joe! I hope someone will be able to supply that information for you!
From Glenn Dye of TX - 12/08/06 - "Some new uses for WD-40 as well as some old ones":
WD-40 Well, Who Knew...?
I had a neighbor who had bought a new pickup. I got up very early one
Sunday morning and saw that someone had spray painted red all around the
sides of this beige truck (for some unknown reason). I went over, woke him
up, and told him the bad news. He was very upset and was trying to figure
out what to do probably nothing until Monday morning, since nothing was
open. Another neighbor came out and told him to get his WD-40 and clean it
off. It removed the unwanted paint beautifully and did not harm his paint
job that was on the truck. I'm impressed! WD-40 who knew?
Water Displacement #40. The product began from a search for a rust
preventative solvent and degreaser to protect missile parts. WD-40 was
created in 1953 by three technicians at the San Diego Rocket Chemical
Company. Its name comes from the project that was to find a "water
displacement" compound. They were successful with the fortieth formulation,
thus WD-40. The Corvair Company bought it in bulk to protect their atlas
missile parts.
Ken East (one of the original founders) says there is nothing in WD-40 that
would hurt you.
When you read the "shower door" part, try it. It's the first thing that has
ever cleaned that spotty shower door. If yours is plastic, it works just as
well as glass. It's a miracle! Then try it on your stovetop... Voila! It's
now shinier than it's ever been. You'll be amazed.
Here are some of the uses:
1) Protects silver from tarnishing.
2) Removes road tar and grime from cars.
3) Cleans and lubricates guitar strings.
4) Gives floors that 'just-waxed' sheen without making it slippery.
5) Keeps flies off cows.
6) Restores and cleans chalkboards.
7) Removes lipstick stains.
8) Loosens stubborn zippers.
9) Untangles jewelry chains.
10) Removes stains from stainless steel sinks.
11) Removes dirt and grime from the barbecue grill.
12) Keeps ceramic/terra cotta garden pots from oxidizing.
13) Removes tomato stains from clothing.
14) Keeps glass shower doors free of water spots.
15) Camouflages scratches in ceramic and marble floors.
16) Keeps scissors working smoothly.
17) Lubricates noisy door hinges on vehicles and doors in homes
18) It removes black scuff marks from the kitchen floor! Use WD-40 for
those nasty tar and scuff marks on flooring. It doesn't seem to harm the
finish and you won't have to scrub nearly as hard to get them off. Just
remember to open some windows if you have a lot of marks.
19) Bug guts will eat away the finish on your car if not removed quickly!
Use WD-40!
20) Gives a children's play gym slide a shine for a super fast slide.
21) Lubricates gear shift and mower deck lever for ease of handling on
riding mowers.
22) Rids kids rocking chairs and swings of squeaky noises.
23) Lubricates tracks in sticking home windows and makes them easier to
open.
24) Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close.
25) Restores and cleans padded leather dashboards in vehicles, as well as
vinyl bumpers.
26) Restores and cleans roof racks on vehicles.
27) Lubricates and stops squeaks in electric fans.
28) Lubricates wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons, and bicycles for easy
handling.
29) Lubricates fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running
smoothly.
30) Keeps rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools.
31) Removes splattered grease on stove.
32) Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging.
33) Lubricates prosthetic limbs.
34) Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell).
35) Removes all traces of duct tape.
36) Folks even spray it on their arms, hands, and knees to relieve
arthritis pain.
37) Florida's favorite use is: "cleans and removes love bugs from grills
and bumpers."
38) The favorite use in the state of New York WD-40 protects the Statue of Liberty from the elements.
39) WD-40 attracts fish. Spray a LITTLE on live bait or lures and you will
be catching the big one in no time. Also, it's a lot cheaper than the
chemical attractants that are made for just that purpose. Keep in mind
though, using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing are not
allowed in some states.
40) Use it for fire ant bites. It takes the sting away immediately and
stops the itch.
41) WD-40 is great for removing crayon from walls. Spray on the mark and
wipe with a clean rag.
42) Also, if you've discovered that your teenage daughter has washed and
dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry, saturate the lipstick
spots with WD-40 and re-wash. Presto! Lipstick is gone!
43) If you sprayed WD-40 on the distributor cap, it would displace the
moisture and allow the car to start.
P. S. The basic ingredient is FISH OIL.
P. P. S. I keep a can of WD-40 in my kitchen cabinet over the stove. It
is good for oven burns or any other type of burn. It takes the burned
feeling away and heals with NO scarring.
WOWZERONI!!! I had no idea! Thanks, Glenn!
From My Sister, Eleanor Buckley Nowitzky of NC - 12/08/06 - "'The Starfish Story' by Loren Eiseley (3 Sep 1907 - 9 July 1977)":
Once upon a time, there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.
One day, as he was walking along the shore, he looked down the beach and saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought of someone who would dance to the day, and so, he walked faster to catch up.
As he got closer, he noticed that the figure was that of a young man, and that what he was doing was not dancing at all. The young man was reaching down to the shore, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean.
He came closer still and called out "Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?"
The young man paused, looked up, and replied "Throwing starfish into the ocean."
"I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?" asked the somewhat startled wise man.
To this, the young man replied, "The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them in, they'll die."
Upon hearing this, the wise man commented, "But, young man, do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can't possibly make a difference!"
At this, the young man bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it met the water, he said, "It made a difference for that one."
Thank you, Lady. I love that story! What a great reminder of the power we all have to make a difference - to at least once person!

Once in Royal David's City
Words by Cecil Frances Alexander (1818-1895), 1848
Music: "Irby", by Henry John Gauntlett (1805-1876)
Once in royal David's city
stood a lowly cattle shed,
where a mother laid her baby
in a manger for his bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.
He came down to earth from heaven,
who is God and Lord of all,
and his shelter was a stable,
and his cradle was a stall;
with the poor, the scorned, the lowly,
lived on earth our Savior holy.
And, through all his wondrous childhood,
he would honor and obey,
love and watch the lowly maiden
in whose gentle arms he lay:
Christian children all must be
mild, obedient, good as he.
For he is our childhood's pattern,
day by day like us he grew;
he was little, weak and helpless,
tears and smiles like us he knew.
and he feeleth for our sadness,
and he shareth in our gladness.
And our eyes at last shall see him,
through his own redeeming love;
for that Child who seemed so helpless
is our Lord in heaven above;
and he leads his children on
to the place where he is gone.
Not in that poor lowly stable,
with the oxen standing round,
we shall see him; but in heaven,
set at God's right hand on high;
when like stars his children crowned,
all in white shall wait around.
