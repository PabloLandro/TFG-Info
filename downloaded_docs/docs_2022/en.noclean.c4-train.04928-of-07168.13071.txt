Some Facts About Hemorrhoids
If you live long enough you will most likely experience the discomfort of hemorrhoids. There are two common types of hemorrhoid, external and internal. External hemorrhoids are those occurring outside the distal end of the anal canal and are sometimes painful and accompanied by swelling and itching. Internal hemorrhoids are those that occur inside the rectum and since this area does not have pain receptors these types of hemorrhoids are rarely painful and usually people don't even know they have them. This type of hemorrhoid is more prone to bleeding however and can lead to more severe forms of hemorrhoid called prolapsed and strangulated.

Hemorrhoids can be prevented with dietary adjustments such as drinking more fluids and eating more fiber as well as by participating in regular exercise, practicing better posture, and reducing strain during bowel movements. Since tight clothing can also cause irritation and contribute to poor muscle tone in the area some report that wearing no underwear or at least loose and lightweight underwear can help.
Most cookies contain high fat content Many fast foods are also rich in fats Saturated fats are not good for heart and blood vessels. Low density lipoprotein LDL is main factor which causes thickening of blood vessels so causing extra strain on blood vessels in patients of high blood pressure. The balanced high blood pressure diet should include mild amounts of saturated and trans-fats (red meat, fast food), and moderate amounts of other fats (olive oil and canola oil).
More salt intake will result in more retention of fluid by kidneys and this will lead to more preload on heart, that will result in more blood pressure. You should avoid salt in your diet if you really want to control your blood pressure. If you are already a patient of hypertension, then reduce salt in your diet as it just accentuates the problem. You can lower your blood pressure to a great extent if you reduce salt consumption in your diet. You should not have more than 6 grams (100mmol/day) of salt per day. Pizza, canned foods, frozen diners, broths, canned soups and salad dressings have high sodium so try to avoid these foods. If you are non-vegetarian then make sure you are including white meat like chicken and fish rather than red meat in your diet.
4- Caffeine Intake: The evidence from the literature is rather conflicting and the effects of caffeine seem to depend on multiple variables such as daily dose, preexisting Blood pressure and coffee drinking habits. The ingestion of 250mg of caffeine has been shown to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure ranging from 6mm of hg in normal individuals to 10 mm hg in patients with hypertension and an increase in diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm hg in normal individuals to 8.5 mm Hg in patients of hypertension.
Hemorrhoids (your grandparents probably called them piles) are swollen or inflamed veins in the area of your anus and rectum. hemorroids can be internal or external. You rarely feel internal hemoroids because nerve endings inside your rectum don't transmit pain signals. You may never realize you have internal hemroids unless you notice small amounts of blood on the toilet tissue or in the toilet water. External hemorrhoids are another story entirely. They frequently cause burning and itching sensations and can be painful enough to distract you throughout the day. You'll certainly appreciate the instant relief offered by an effective home cure for hemorrhoids.
There are some over-the-counter medications that you can use as a home cure for hemoroids, but many are really nothing more than local pain killers. If you choose to try them out, stick with the creams. Suppositories are treating the wrong area for external hemorrhoids. And none of these topical solutions are really dealing with the root cause of hemorroids.
Are you embarrassed to admit that you have hemorrhoids? Are you so embarrassed by the condition that you don't even want to discuss it with your doctor? Well, you are not alone. First of all, a remarkable number of people suffer from the itching, bleeding and pain of hemorroids. As many as 50% of people have experienced hemoroids by the time they turn 50. Some studies suggest that up to 80% of people will have hemroids at some time in their lives. The really good news is that if you are seeking a home cure for hemorrhoids, there are several highly effective steps you can take at home without discussing your condition with anyone else.
The number one cause of hemorrhoids is straining during a bowel movement. The best home cure for hemroids is anything you can do to promote soft, easy bowel movements. For most people, this can be accomplished with plenty of fluids and fiber. Drink lots of fluids throughout the day, preferable water. Increase your fiber intake by eating lots of fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Bowel movements are not supposed to be long and difficult. If you shorten the time you spend sitting on the toilet and lessen the effort it takes to finish your bowel movement, then your hemorroids will heal quickly and future hemorrhoid discomfort will be unlikely.
Many things are associated with hemorrhoids like ulcers and Crohn disease. Many women who get hemorrhoids get it because of their pregnancy, although it is undetermined why pregnant women get hemorrhoids. Believe it or not, hemorrhoids are present in healthy individuals; they are present in everyone. The only thing is that when they swell or enlarge they can become quite discomforting and painful. It is when the vascular cushions become enlarged, inflamed, or protruding when they are called hemorrhoids.
Another helpful home cure for hemorrhoids is the application of petroleum jelly. Use a cotton swab or the tip of your finger to apply petroleum jelly around your rectum and about a half inch into your anus. This treatment will help make your bowel movements easier as you're adjusting your fiber and fluid intake. One home cure that consistently receives high marks is the application of witch hazel to the affected areas. Witch hazel causes the blood vessels to shrink and contract. It's especially effective iced.
There are a few treatments on the market. For temporary relief one may use a sitz bath, suppositories or a topical analgesic.
If you're looking for an herbal home cure for hemeroids, many have reported success with stoneroot. Stoneroot can usually be found in capsule form. The application of aloe vera gel is another herbal treatment that some have found soothing.
Some of the causes for hemorrhoids include your diet. For people who have a high fiber diet, they may get hemorrhoids because of the frequency of passings. Pregnancy is another cause, but it could be the extra pressure from the added body weight. Prolonged sitting on a toilet can also be the cause for hemorrhoids. Aging also causes hemorrhoids because the tissue inside the rectum begins to deteriorate. The weakening of the tissue can start as early as thirty. Straining and constipation has also been known to be a cause for hemorrhoids.
Some natural treatments include exercising to increase muscle tone and improve posture. Taking herbs and supplements that strengthen the vein walls and eating fiber rich supplements such as plantain and psyllium will also help to remedy the situation.
Most hemorrhoids will only be treated if they cause any discomfort or pain. They will heal, but it may cause some scarring, depending on how serious your condition is. For external hemorrhoids, you may have an extra deposit of skin that will be permanent. If you feel any discomfort or pain, you should seek medical attention and consult your physician. Everyone has hemorrhoids; it's just a matter of how serious. You may need to consult your doctor if your hemorrhoids seem to be enlarged or blood is located in your stool.

The pain you may feel from internal hemorrhoids is caused by a spasm in the sphincter. Internal hemorrhoids are mostly painless and have bleeding with bowel movements. When the hemorrhoid puts pressure on the hemorrhoid veins, they tend to break and blood will appear. Internal hemorrhoids can also produce mucus that will keep the area moist and cause the anus to itch, although this is not common.
Hemorrhoids have been diagnosed for decades, but the disease is misunderstood greatly. This is because most people don't fully understand the area and the diseases that are associated with it. Over ten million people in the United States have been diagnosed with hemorrhoids. Almost a third of them seek medical treatment. The rate of serious hemorrhoids has gone done since its peak in the mid-70's. Many people who get hemorrhoids are around 45-65 years in age.
Following Foods should be avoided if you have High blood pressure: 1. Alcohol The association between alcohol and high blood pressure is well documented both in population and clinical studies. An Alcohol intake of about 80 g/day (Equivalent to four pints of beer) has been shown to raise Blood pressure particularly in patients of hypertension. Blood pressure tends to fall when alcohol is stopped or reduced and remains low in patients who continue to abstain. Patients with hypertension should avoid Alcohol. As alcohol can raise blood pressure directly, is also an important factor in damaging walls of blood vessels, which can elevate the blood pressure further and make it more difficult to treat, while at the same time increasing the risk of complications. Limit consumption of Alcohol to no more than two drinks per day in most men and one drink per day in women and lightweight men.
So what causes hemorrhoids? One of the main causes is genetics. Many people have a genetically inherited weaker rectal vein wall while other causes can be from straining during bowel movements as well as poor muscle tone. Other factors that contribute are constipation, chronic diarrhea, sitting too long (on the toilet), and pregnancy, holding in bowel movements, and not eating enough fiber. Other issues that can help cause the condition are not drinking enough water and drinking too many diuretic fluids such as coffee or colas. Another dietary habit that can cause the affliction is excessive consumption of dairy products which can result in excessive lactic acid in the stool causing irritation.
Hemorrhoids are extremely common and it is estimated that 50% of all Americans have this problem by the age of 50 although only a small number seek treatment. Only around 500,000 people are treated for hemorrhoids annually with as many as 20% needing surgery.
Regular warm baths are a highly-recommended home cure for hemroids. The warm water reduces the pain of your hemorrhoids and the increased flow of blood provides extra healing and curative powers. It may sound backwards, but the increase blood flow from a warm bath also helps shrink the affected veins.
2. Salt A restriction in dietary sodium intake can reduce the incidence of hypertension. Studies have shown that there is a clear relationship between dietary salt intake and Blood pressure and people who consume less salt have a smaller rise in Blood pressure with advancing age. Salt restriction to about 100mmol/day (2.4 gm sodium or 6 gm sodium chloride) has been shown to produce a significant reduction in systolic Blood pressure to about 8-14 mm Hg in several randomized placebo-controlled studies. In some people, eating too much salt can make blood pressure much worse and In other cases the same salt consumption may have no effect.

A home cure for hemeroids can often be very effective simply because hemroids are usually caused by existing habits and lifestyle choices. Most hemorrhoid home cures involve implementing new habits and making adjustments in your lifestyle. Yes, it's true, changing your habits and lifestyle can be painful, but at least it doesn't itch and burn like hemorrhoids.
What are the foods to be avoided in high blood pressure? This is very common question my patients often ask me. On one hand, it is exceedingly complicated and complex and has been the continued focus of research by doctors and physicians. On the other hand, the vast majority of dietary recommendations for hypertension have resemblance and similarities to general healthy diet recommendations.
3. Fats Food that is rich in fats should be avoided. Foods High in Fat are as follows Fats and oils (like margarine, vegetable oils, butter, lard, salt pork, meat drippings, gravy, and fat back)
Make sure that you clean yourself gently after a bowel movement. Although this isn't technically a home cure for hemorroids, it will help ease the pain and irritation. Use toilet paper without perfumes or dyes, and moisten it with some water before using. If you can find toilet paper that contains extra moisturizers and lotions, then buy it and use it.
Symptoms are divided into external and internal. Internal does not cause pain, but external can cause discomfort, pain, and bleeding. Protruding hemorrhoids can be itchy and bleed. They require medical attention because they are so uncomfortable. Internal hemorrhoids will cause discomfort and will make a person feel pressure around the abdomen and anus.
Cream, ice cream, Whole milk, 2% milk. Most pies, pastries, cakes. Most cheeses (like cream cheese, cheddar, American) Many snack foods (like nuts and chips)
High blood pressure if left unchecked results in increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and leads to target organ damage such as LVH, retinal changes and vascular changes. The main objective in the management of hypertension is prevention of target organ damage and reduction of cardiovascular risk. The management requires a multi-prolonged approach. Although it is widely accepted that drug therapy is essential for optimal Blood pressure control, it should not be forgotten that nonpharmocological measures are also important in the management of hypertension.
Hemorrhoids are a common, but embarrassing condition. You may be reluctant to discuss hemorroids with your doctor. A home cure for hemeroids may help you find relief without the need to endure an embarrassing consultation and examination.
