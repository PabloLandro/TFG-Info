The Rational Response Squad is a group of atheist activists who impact society by changing the way we view god belief. This site is a haven for those who are pushing back against the norm, and a place for believers of gods to have their beliefs exposed as false should they want to try their hand at confronting us.

Food Idiocy
Apparently there are people who think walnuts are good for your brain because they look like brains, tomatoes for the heart because they look like hearts and celery for the bones.... Oh yeah, they look that way because God wanted it that way.
Here is a link to this shit. This is magical thinking - and it makes me shake my head just how many stupid things people will believe.

OMG too funny, I've joked about this with some friends when I was drunk before except with nuts only. I can't believe people are taking this seriously.
BTW the list we came up with for fun based on the shape and colour of nuts:
Walnuts : womens brains;
Pecans: mens brains (cause it looks primitive)
Hazelnuts: Heart
Almonds: muscle in general
Brazil nuts: Liver
Cashews: lung or adrenal gland
Pistachios: gall bladder
Theist badge qualifier : Gnostic/Philosophical Panentheist

They kind of look like kidneys as well, although obviously if we are to go for greatest resemblance, I can't believe you missed kidney beans.
But seriously, I can't believe people take this seriously.
"Physical reality” isn’t some arbitrary demarcation. It is defined in terms of what we can systematically investigate, directly or not, by means of our senses. It is preposterous to assert that the process of systematic scientific reasoning arbitrarily excludes “non-physical explanations” because the very notion of “non-physical explanation” is contradictory.

They did say kidney beans
They did say kidney beans are good for the kidneys. I can kind of excuse people in ancient/mideval times for thinking this - but if you live in a modern, non-third world society and you believe this you are an idiot.
Carrots are good for the eyes because the slice of carrot looks like an eye (not really and carrots being good for the eyes is false - in fact it was started by the RAF in WWII as disinformation to preserve the secret of RADAR.)
Grapes are good for the heart because they grow in a heart shaped cluster. (HUH???????)

Carrots are good for the eyes since they are rich an Vitamin A, which is better known as retinol, the coenzyme in rhodopsin, which is the central light-stimulated protein controlling the signals sent from the back of the eye to the brain in the form of a G-linked protein reception complex which induces the opening of an Na+ VGIC, depolarizing the optic nerve.

*ahem*
I know I may be going out too far for even this board, but I feel the need to point out that my racist great grandmother used to call brazil nuts "nigger toes."
The implications are mind boggling.

feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but...
wasn't there a debunked "theory" of plant associations prior to the original Intelligent Design assertion that had certain plants marked for certain uses based on their appearance?

You know, our family has a small walnut farm. It's so much cooler to say that I'm a brain harvester than a walnut farmer.

If this was true, wouldn't
If this was true, wouldn't it make sense to eat nothing but animal parts? Real brains look a whole lot more like real brains than any nut does. Same deal for eyes, livers, dicks, boobs and the rest.
