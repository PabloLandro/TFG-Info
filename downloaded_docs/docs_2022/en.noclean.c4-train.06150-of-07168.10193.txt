About Himalayan Crystal Salt Lamps
Himalayan crystal salt lamps are made from blocks of crystal salt rocks mined from the ancient dried up lakes at the Himalayan foothills. They come in various shapes and sizes.
It was found that the miners doing the daily grind of mining of the Himalayan crystal salts from these ancient dried lakes though working deep down in the earth at depths of about 1500 meters surprisingly remained very healthy inspite of the extremely difficult working conditions there.

Himalayan Crystal Salt Lamps
It was believed that the reason for their good health appeared to be their close association with these salt mines they were working in. Since times immemorial salt has been used as a preservative for food. It is also known that hot water springs are full of health giving salts and rejuvenate one's body.
Since olden times people have been coming to get rejuvenated and destress themselves, in salt mines and caves and getting a natural salt therapy. It has been found that salt mines have an excess of negative ion environment. It is known now that salt ionises the air naturally with negative ions.
It has been established by way of published studies that negative ions have positive or healing effects on our body. They clean the air of pollutants and remove the positive charged ions.
Himalayan crystal salt lamps are natural lamps made of Himalayan crystal salt.

How Are Positive Ions Produced
All electronic devices like TV's computers, mobiles, PDA's, microwave ovens. etc produce severe electronic air pollution in the form of electromagnetic waves and vibrations that are positively charged ions.
Positive charged ions have been known to cause :
Increase in nervous symptoms, stress, sleeping problems, concentration issues, increase in free radicals, allergy issues etc.
It has been found that if we happen to be near a waterfall, the seashore, on a mountain top or closer to nature, we breathe much easier and experience a release of stress. This also happens after natural phenomena like rainfall and thunderstorms. the reason being that the natural production of negative ions during these natural phenomena produces negative ions which neutralise the positive ions present leading to excess of negative ions in the atmosphere and the consequent effects.
It is very easy to produce these beneficial negative ions by using Himalayan crystal salt lamps.
How The Crystal Salts Lamps Work
It is known that salt attracts moisture which condenses on the surface of the crystal salts lamp. Once the lamp is put on, the heated salt crystal causes moisture condensation on it which causes the electrically bound sodium and chloride to split into the positive sodium and negative ions. Simultaneously, the water evaporation causes it to split into 2 negative hydrogen ions and 1 positive oxygen ion.
The resultant excess is a negative ion which combines with the positive ion in the surroundings to neutralize and ultimately remove all the positive ions and make the air dense with negative ions. This is a fast and on going process.
Using Himalayan crystal salt lamps make the process of producing negative ions simple and fast.

The products may be new mrpooper but Himalayan salt has been around for ages and as per Ayurveda is the better alternative for the heavily processed, chemical laden & nutrient devoid table salt of today.

I have a salt lamp but mine is not electric. Will I still get the same benifits from it? I think you're supposed to use a candle or LED candle in it.

Before the advent of trade with India, Nepal was heavily depended on Himalayan Salt. Our family has a tradition of using Himalayan salt as medicine.
In the Himalayan regions in Nepal, people also burn salt to determine weather.
Hats off to you Ranjan. This is 'A One' class of hub.

Hi Rajan,
A friend gave me a Himalayan Salt Lamp. I have it in my bedroom but I haven't used it in awhile. She said she keeps her plugged in all the time. I found I couldn't sleep at night when it was on. I am going to move it into the living room where I have my computer and television.
Voted up and awesome
Take care :)

I had never heard of a salt lamp till reading your hub. How utterly fascinating! I had heard that electronics threw off positive ions, but didn't really pause to think about what could neutralize that. Thank you for the education and the well-written, well-researched article.
