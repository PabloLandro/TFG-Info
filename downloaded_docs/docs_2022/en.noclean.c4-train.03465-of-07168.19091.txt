Cell phones make use of electromagnetic radiation known as radio-frequency (RF) energy, a non-ionizing radiation that is also used in telecommunications like television and radio.
When studying the impact of cell phone radiation on humans, the only regularly observed effect is the heating of tissues. There have also been no notable increases in developing cancer or enhancing carcinogenic effects observed in animal studies. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) investigated the effects of cell phone radiation on rodents in a large-scale study.
