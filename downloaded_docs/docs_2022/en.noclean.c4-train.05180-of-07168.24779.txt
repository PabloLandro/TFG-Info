What to Do When Your Friends Smoke Weed
As a teenager, blending in and having lots of friends is one of the main priorities in life. Unfortunately, ensuring these things often comes with a price. Eventually, many teens are faced with the reality that their friends are smoking weed. When this happens, it's hard to know how to handle it. There will be many questions that come to mind upon realizing your friends are smoking weed.
Should I ignore it?
Could I try to talk to them about it?
Will they expect me to join in?
Can I be friends with them without it being a problem?
Do they need drug rehab in Asheville NC?
The first step towards deciding what to do is determining how serious the problem is. Are they addicted? Does it interfere with school, family life or work? Does it prevent them from doing daily activities or getting good grades?
Knowing what to do is tricky. You don't want to scare friends away. It's also important to remember that if you do talk to them about it, they'll confide in you and expect you to keep it a secret. While you might want to stay loyal to your friend, finding out how serious their smoking is should come first.
In order to get to the bottom of the situation, there are a few factors to consider. You'll need to pay close attention to the frequency of their smoking, how they act at school, around other friends and determine what their home life is like.
Is Weed Addictive?
If your friends occasionally smoke marijuana, they're not addicted to it. According to the NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse, only 9 percent of users will develop a dependence. They also state that a dependency isn't the same as an addiction, as it is less serious, clinically.
However, those who started smoking marijuana as teens are more likely to become dependent later in life. Close to 20 percent form a dependency when they begin smoking weed at a young age. So if you need help with a pot addiction, call Legacy Freedom. We can help with affordable drug rehab in Asheville NC.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Dependency or Addiction?
There are many signs and symptoms that indicate a dependency on marijuana. Below, you'll find a list of the most common ones to watch for.
Bloodshot eyes, pupils larger or smaller than usual
Change in sleeping patterns
Changes in appetite
Decline of physical appearance or personal grooming habits
Impaired coordination
Slurred speech
Sudden weight loss or weight gain
Tremors
Unusual smells on breath, body, or clothing
Deserts old friends
Doesn't want parents to meet new friends
Favorite activities, sports or hobbies are neglected
Grades are suddenly dropping
Lying about where they are
Moody, aggressive or abrupt at home, for seemingly no reason
Needs to borrow money without offering a reason why
Once you've armed yourself with knowledge and determined that smoking weed has become a problem for your friends, it's time to face them. Even adults can use the following information to confront friends who smoke too much marijuana in a way that isn't provoking or argumentative.
Call Them Out
You don’t have to be mean or rude to your friend when they’re high. But, you can acknowledge that you’re aware of their current state of mind. Point out that you can see their bloodshot eyes. Let your friend know that everyone around them can tell they’re high. Sometimes, frequent weed smokers assume that they’re good at hiding their high. Users think they can function properly without anyone knowing the truth. That’s not true. Calling them on their high will not only show that hiding it isn’t working, but also remind them they’re high. It’s possible your friend is losing track of how often they smoke. You taking the initiate to remind them of it every time you witness it will help stop the charade.
Don’t Argue
As we mentioned above, talking to your friend in a calm manner is key. Never argue or debate with them about smoking weed. Your friend, especially if they smoke frequently, might have some pretty strong ideas about how weed gets a bad name for no reason. Express your feelings without getting into an argument. Just simply point out that they’re changing and you can see it daily. Remind them of who they used to be. Talk about past times and how much fun you both had before weed was an issue.
There’s More to Life
Many smokers believe that weed makes them “better”. It calms their nerves, relieves pain and seems to be a fix-all for every situation in life. Remind your friend that there’s more to life than smoking weed. When they offer an excuse as to why they're using, come back with a reality based solution to the problem. Have a headache? Take a Tylenol and rest. Remind them that taking a recommended dose of OTC pain meds will leave them able to operate a vehicle, whereas smoking marijuana will leave them impaired and unable to legally drive.
Smoking weed can quickly go from a recreational past time to dependency quickly. If your friends starts showing any of the signs or symptoms we mentioned above, consider talking with them sooner rather than later. You might be able to talk them out of frequent use. Reminding them of responsibilities, loved ones and life before weed is vital. Remember, don't argue. Talk calmly and plainly.
Also, don't lose sight of the fact that marijuana can cause a dependency. Over 400,000 people enter a drug rehab facility each year for help with a weed problem. According to drugabuse.gov, "Research has shown that marijuana's negative effects on attention, memory, and learning can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off, depending on the user’s history with the drug."
