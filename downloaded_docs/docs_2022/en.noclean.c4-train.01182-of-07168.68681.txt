Men Get Breast Cancer, Too
Overview
There are several types of breast cancer, though some are very rare. The most common form in a woman’s lobules (the part of the breast where milk develops) or in the ducts (the tiny tubes that deliver milk to the nipple). Cancer that remains in its place of origin, either in the ducts or the lobules, is considered “in situ,” or “in place.” Invasive cancer occurs when the malignant cells break through the ducts or lobules and spread to the surrounding breast tissue and/or the lymph system and other parts of the body.

After their surgery is complete breast cancer patients face a whole range of new issues. These range from concerns about body image, to post-surgical medical care, to the need for information on products that will help lumpectomy and mastectomy patients achieve a "natural" appearance. The following articles are designed to address many of these issues.

Support for Breast Cancer Survivors
Overview
It’s important to start exercising as soon as possible, preferably before or during the course of adjuvant treatment. The sooner you start, the less likely you are to get stuck in the vicious cycle of feeling fatigued, not exercising, feeling more fatigued and even less willing to exercise, and so on. Once you start, you will probably find yourself eager and motivated to continue. Studies found that breast cancer survivors who were instructed to exercise were very motivated to do so and were able to stick with the program.

Breast cancer is no laughing matter. But it could matter if you laugh. Bill Cosby once said “Through humor, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers. And once you find laughter, no matter how painful your situation might be, you can survive it.” Women surviving breast cancer can know with comfort - life is what you make it.

Will Your Children Inherit Breast Cancer from You?
As a breast cancer survivor, you might worry about passing the disease on to your children. Will your children develop breast cancer because you’ve had it?
The answer to this question is not a clear yes or no. Having a relative with breast cancer does increase people’s (both men’s and women’s) chances of getting it. This means that your children are at a greater risk for developing breast cancer than people without a family history of the disease. However, there are many factors aside from inheritance that are equally, if not more, important in bringing about the onset of breast cancer.
Most women with breast cancer do not have a close female relative with the disease.
You may wonder exactly how breast cancer can be passed from you to your children. Genetic inheritance of diseases, or anything else, is extremely complex. In general, genetic traits, like eye color or susceptibility to certain diseases, are passed from parents to children through their DNA. DNA is a long chain of molecules containing the codes for a person’s inherited traits. Children get one set of DNA from their mother and one from their father. In the specific case of breast cancer inheritance, this means that if a person’s mother or father has breast cancer in the family, s/he is at a higher risk of getting it.
Researchers have discovered that specific genes, which are parts of the DNA chains, are linked to higher risk for breast cancer if they are altered, or damaged, in certain ways. BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 (BRCA stands for BReast CAncer) are two of these genes. Children who inherit the altered, or high-risk, variants of these genes from their parents have a higher chance of developing breast cancer than people without them. Researchers are working on finding other genes that, when altered, may be related to breast cancer.
Here are some facts about inheriting the high-risk variants of the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes:
The high-risk variants are found in less than 0.5% of the general population and account for only about 5-10% of all breast cancer cases, and possibly fewer.
A person with a family history of breast cancer has a higher chance of having a high-risk variant, but does not necessarily have one.
A woman with one of the high-risk variants has an 80% chance of developing breast cancer before age 70.
The high-risk variants are more common among Ashkenazi Jews than other populations. They are found in 2.5% of all members of this group and account for over 25% of breast cancer cases diagnosed before age 40 in the group.
Given this information, some women with a family history of breast cancer may decide to undergo genetic testing to discover whether they carry the high-risk variants of cancer-causing genes. With early discovery, a woman may be able to make lifestyle changes or undergo treatments to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer in the future.
However, the decision on whether or not to get tested for breast cancer genes is not an easy one. Getting tested, regardless of the results, may have serious consequences for a person’s ability to qualify for health and life insurance, employment and disability benefits. It can also have a negative impact on a person’s relationships and life outlook.
