First, decide what type of product you will be using and fill it inside the atomizer. Regardless whether it is e-liquid or concentrates, they can be filled easily in the atomizer. Some atomizers can be filled from the top and others can be filled from unscrewing the atomizer and inserting your choice product from the bottom. Each type of liquid uses a specific type of cartridge and wicking element that comes with the vape pen. Find out what works best for your needs!
The Joyetech ESPION is compact for such a powerful device. It fits nicely in the hand or in your tuxedo pocket. It utilizes quick 2-amp USB passthrough charging so you never have to go another minute without vaping. The mod also has a built-in clock and all the necessary safety protections.
The JUUL is a small, compact device that uses disposable pods and doesn’t support refilling. That’s perfectly understandable, seeing how JUUL pods are filled with a proprietary vape juice made with nic salts, which is far more potent than regular e-liquids. Every JUUL pod contains 0.7 ml of liquid and comes in a 50 mg/mL nicotine strength, making the JUUL a perfect substitute for regular smoking. Because of its tight draw, the JUUL also offers the most cigarette-like experience.

The mouthpiece tip allows you to draw vapor from the atomizer and can sometimes be changed with a variety of tips to fit your style of vaping. They come in all shapes in sizes. Long and narrow mouthpieces provide more flavor, but less cloud production and has a similar experience as to smoking. Short and wide mouthpieces tend to produce more clouds, but not as much flavor. Vapers often find a nice medium that suits their style.

b. Portability – the biggest advantage is that it is easy to take with you anywhere you go. Vape pens are pocket sized and lightweight, and the best vaporizer pens can be used for multiple sessions before you need to recharge.
Series 3X dry herb kit comes with an included cartridge for loose leaf, so it does not have to be ordered separately. Of course, vape juice cartridges are included with it. The entire device is beautifully designed, with magnetic clasps holding the cartridge in place and ensuring easy swapping. The chamber uses conduction heating, but it is designed in such a way that it almost guarantees that the material is not burned but vaporized instead. It also holds around 0.1 – 0.2 grams of material – easy to vape in around four minutes and requiring only one reactivation of the heating function.
A vape pen is a portable, non-combustible pen-shaped device used for inhaling a variety of e-liquids such as e-liquid (electronic liquid) and concentrates. Some also allow you to vape dry herbs as well. Vape pens are the most common type of vaporizers in the market and they come in a variety of sizes and thickness. They utilize whatever liquid or dry herb of your choosing and conducts it, heating the product inside the vape pen instead of combusting it with a flame source. This allows you to carry a discreet, all-in-one device with a pure flavor brought by conduction.
Ceramic coils are known to deliver a pure flavor although you may have to compromise somewhat on vapor quantity. The best ceramic heating chambers, such as those Mig Vapor uses, feature heating coils built into the ceramic material ensuring that there are no exposed metal coils.
My highest compliments go to the customer service team I worked with at Kandy Pens, and that includes more than just the names in this email. I really appreciate how quickly you replaced the defective unit I originally received, with no hassle to me. And you also made sure my shipping was fully refunded due to the shipper’s error, making my entire experience with your company nothing short of fantastic. The lifetime warranty is an unbeatable product feature!
On April 24, 2018, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. announced new enforcement actions to stop youth use of, and access to, JUUL and other e-cigarette products. KandyPens recognizes the important responsibility to protect youths from the risks posed from nicotine products and joins the FDA’s goal of reducing underage access to these products.
You will find some outsized pens, but usually, the smaller ones look better, are more elegant and are also concealable. Appearance usually is a matter of personal preference, and it’s up to you what you want. But at least don’t buy a pen that you will feel embarrassed to vape in front of your friends! Likewise, buying a pen that looks extremely stylish but performs poorly is nothing but a waste of your hard-earned money.
Hey guys. I’m looking to do an upgrade. I have the iStick TC40W with an Atlantis V2. The battery life sucks and I’m just not getting quite the flavor out of the combo that I was told I would get. I’m looking for something a lot better, keeping short of rebuilding coils and dripping. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
For beginners, the k anger tech subox nano is nice, it doesn’t come with a battery so be prepared for that, but 70 for a sub ohm box mod that allows temp control all the way from 0.1-50 in .1 increments really isn’t bad. It’s my first sub ohm piece I’ve owned and I’m learning on it about temps, taste, clouds and coils on it. I always used to assume a higher temp was better, now with this piece I’m finding out more of the intricacies that different temps play on your vaping experience. Personally I use Charlies chalk dust dream cream and Cut wood bird brains (fruity pebbles flavor) on my box, box vape extremely nicely and the flavors are amazing

SUB-OHM: Some devices might come with sub-ohm resistance coils. Extra safety precautions should be practiced when using a sub ohm device. Sub-ohm coils will only work on a device capable of firing sub ohm atomizers and coils. You must also ensure that your batteries can handle sub ohm atomizers and coils. Improper use can lead to damage or injury. MistHub is not responsible for any damage caused by the misuse and/or mishandling of sub-ohm devices.

Let me start off with saying “Thank you”. Thanks to everyone who was part of the making of the “K Vape” vaporizer. In all my experiences with various Portable Vapes, this is by far the best vaporizer on the market today. I have never experienced such an awesome experience in my entire years of vaping, to add I was vaping on the first level with no issues, that’s right NO ISSUES whatsoever. Regard
” check out our article on “What is a box mod?””…putting that without putting the link isn’t very helpful. Still don’t exactly what one is and don’t feel like searching this site until I find the article.
I’ve got a decent collection of these tanks and a few mods as well now. Been vaping since June and love the reviews on this site the way they’re done. Love that you test most coils and let everyone know where the flavor sweet spot is.
Warranty and quality are a big part of the reason why companies like V2 and Mig Vapor figure prominently on the list of the best vape pens. Some of the imported products don’t have warranty protection and may, in fact, be counterfeit products. When you buy directly from an American company you know you will get authentic quality.
Thank you for making one of the best electronic devices in the world. Some say the world changed after the first Nintendo was sold, I say mine change the day I got my K-Vape Micro-Dx in the mail. Thank you again!
For dry herb, the Series 3X is one of the few vape pens on the market right now that can actually vaporize without combustion. For wax, it works just as well, giving you a strong and flavorful hit. Not to mention the option of being able to vape some e-liquid too if you want. V2 proudly stands behind all of their products and provides a lifetime warranty on all purchases.
Vape pens drop. Vape batteries die out. It’s the nature of the vaporizer world. Finding a vape pen with a warranty ensures you’ll get a replacement vape if something goes wrong. Generally, the length of the vape pen warranty is telling. The longer the warranty, the more confidence the manufacturer has in their vape pen. Opt for a vape pen with a longer warranty if it’s in the budget.

The main downside comes from the fact that the tank is built into the vape, so you cannot experiment with other vape tanks. But in our opinion, this isn’t a dealbreaker and can XEO Void is still a fantastic vape pen! No leaks, easy to use, and super smooth vapor.

Further studies on how vaping affects our overall health are underway (and are still much needed) but, for now, scientists mostly agree that vaping is not as dangerous as smoking. In fact, Public Health England has concluded that ‘vaping is unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco’.
The Basal doesn’t have any complicated menus or features to learn. It is intuitive and easy to operate. The mod has a beautiful metallic finish and is available in gold, rose gold and silver. The full kit comes with a matching GS Basal tank; a slim mouth-to-lung tank that uses flavorful GS Air coils.
My order shipped 2 days ago and I just received it and am very happy with it, quality is very good, the prices are better than what I can get locally the e-cig is half what I would have paid here at home. I have nothing but high praise for everything and everyone.
Should concentrates and e-juice both be outside of your interests, there are still more options for these types of units! A small number of these devices are configured to perfectly vaporize dry herbs for a discreet, on-the-go experience. One of the most well-known vape pen configured for dry herb use is, of course, the Atmos Jump. While the Jump has all the style that you could ask for in a slim-style herbal unit, there are options that provide thicker vapor on a longer battery life. A front-runner among these options is the Quickdraw 300 DLX. It’s a very unique unit because of it’s ability to properly vaporizer herbs in addition concentrates and e-liquid, making it one of the best multi-function pen-style vapes you can buy.
The Revenger is powered by two 18650’s protected by a solid magnetized door. It puts out a serious amount of juice for some massive clouds. Other special attributes include a real time clock, firing capabilities down to 0.05 ohms and a variety of output modes and a 0.96-inch screen.

Just like with any other product, you need to consider and compare a few of the top vape pens measuring quality, durability, ease of use, and value for money. Vape pens are a unique product, and you should keep some guidelines in mind when buying one:
The Exxus Slim VV 380 mAh 510 Variable Voltage Battery by Exxus Vape is a simplistic device that is an easy companion to a number of tanks. As a variable voltage unit, its voltage can be adjusted to anywhere between 2.6V and 4V. This accommodates user’s individual preferences. The Exxus Slim VV has a 510 thread attachment that make it a near universal fit for many mods on the market. Additionally, it boasts a ten second heat up time, so it’s ready to fire fulfilling draws quickly and cleanly.
Although eGo’s and 510’s are the universal standard, you might find a vape pen that uses a different connection. Since many people were buying parts for their vape pens from various manufacturers, some companies use unique threading to prevent this from occurring.
The Source Orb XL produces huge clouds of vapor thanks to all of the space afforded by its triple-coil atomizer and variable airflow, making the price well worth it. A durable and solid vapor pen featuring atomizers that can easily accommodate a gram of your favorite concentrates. The Source Orb XL won the Best Vapor Production, Best Durability, and Best Hit awards from High Times.
The latest salvo: A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics found five cancer-causing toxins in the urine of 16-year-olds who inhaled e-cigarette vapor, and a second study found, yet again, that e-cigarettes encourage teens to begin smoking traditional cigarettes.
The Bug Rx Oil Vape Pen is a powerful, miniature 1100 Mah oil vape mod and uses the latest technology with temperature regulation and superior performance in a mini e-Cig device. The Bug comes with a top fill design that makes it much easier to refill, as well as a concealing cap. The Bug rx is reusable for ever!
I would just like to take a little time to thank you all at Kandypens! I love my new silver surfer ! And I liked it so much I took advantage of the 30% discount with the free atomizer you all emailed to me and got me another limited edition in gun metal! Thanks for making a great product with great customer service and fast shipping!!! I really do appreciate it and I will be sure to share my pen with all off my friends so they too can buy one and experience true taste!!!
So, what liquids CAN you put in a vape pen (provided we are talking about an e-juice pen)? It would be best to stick to vape juices from reputable manufacturers. If you’re having problems vaping with a particular vape juice brand, switch to another – keep in mind that high PG e-liquids are easier to vape on since they are not as viscous as high VG juices.
Finally, we will take a look at the best vape pens for dabs and waxes. This class of vape pen will vaporize dabs, waxes, concentrates, and often oils. Dabs, waxes, and concentrates all refer to a condensed form of marijuana or botanical extract that takes on a waxy composition. The composition is almost entirely comprised of the active ingredients. Vaping dabs is a very intense experience!
Source Orb Slim – At only $49.95, the Source Orb Slim is the most affordable wax vaporizers we have available. It is straightforward, simple, and just works – put your material inside the atomizer bowl, twist the top on, and you are ready to vape at the simple press of a button. The battery is no joke either – a single charge of the battery can deliver 200 puffs!
The Wismec Ravage 230 is an excellent performer. It does accurate wattage and temperature control for a dual-battery device. It provides more than enough power for any style of vaping. The mod is loaded with great features such as customizable preheat and TCR modes. It has a stunning paint job and is designed to fit nicely in your hand. The Ravage is everything the Predator wanted to be.
