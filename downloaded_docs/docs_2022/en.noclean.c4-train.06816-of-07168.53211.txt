Morphine Withdrawal Treatment & Recovery
You can get help!
Morphine is an opiate that is highly addictive and can lead to many adverse symptoms when the user abruptly quits taking the drug. Morphine withdrawal may cause tremors, pain, delusions, discomfort and a world of consequences for the user. It’s these very symptoms that cause many people to continue to take morphine despite their desire to quit using the drug.
When taken according to prescription for the treatment of pain, morphine can be very helpful and there are minimal chances for addiction to occur. Unfortunately, patients quickly develop a tolerance to the drug and often require increased doses in order to feel its pain relieving effects. In time, this tolerance can build to a point in which the morphine is no longer as powerful as it once was and the patient may take drastic measures to improve the pain relief qualities of the drug often resorting to exceeding the recommended or prescribed dose just in an attempt to feel better.
Morphine use can quickly lead to physical tolerance, dependence and addiction if the user is not careful. Taking doses that are greater than prescribed or taking morphine without a prescription is not only dangerous, the consequences could prove to be deadly. Sustained morphine use causes chemical changes in the brain that make normal functioning no longer a viable process. The morphine impairs the consciousness of the individual making it difficult for him or her to think clearly and to function properly.
Getting Off Morphine
Many people who become addicted to morphine continue to use the drug in a mere effort to prevent the withdrawal symptoms from occurring. Symptoms of morphine withdrawal can become sever and difficult to cope with which make getting off the drug a challenging process. These withdrawal symptoms can cause the user to quickly relapse back to morphine use if he or she isn’t provided with professional help. Fortunately, there are medications and treatments that can help ease the withdrawal symptoms making the process of getting off morphine a little bit easier. Kicking the habit with professional help is the best solution for most people simply because it will likely take medical care and around-the-clock monitoring to ensure safety and sobriety during this difficult time.
Why Does Morphine Withdrawal Occur?
When an individual who is addicted to morphine stops taking the drug, there are chemical changes that occur within the brain making it difficult to remain abstinent from the drug use. Cravings and urges will continue to occur sometimes for many months following the decision to quit using. The withdrawal symptoms that result when an addict stops taking morphine are the direct result of metabolites that remain in the fatty tissues providing a release in the blood even when the drug is not being used. The metabolites that continue to be released into the body can cause the individual to feel as if he or she has used morphine recently. Because of this, even many weeks after the drug use has stopped, the user could feel the symptoms of withdrawal coming on. Morphine addiction and the subsequent withdrawal symptoms that occur when an addict tries to quit can be treated—but it will likely require professional help!
