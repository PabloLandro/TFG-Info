Alzheimer’s DiseasePosted 3 years ago under Uncategorized

The "Genetics" myth
Alzheimer’s disease is caused by a loss of neurons and synapses in the brain, specifically in the cerebral cortex and certain other regions, resulting in atrophy and degeneration, even in brainstem nuclei. Alzheimer’s accounts for about 70% of all cases of dementia, and it’s chronic degeneration of the human brain comes on slowly, beginning with STML (short term memory loss) and then usually keeps getting worse over time, until the person is unable to identify members of their immediate family. Some people become violent and gradually lose control of bodily functions. The average life expectancy once Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed ranges from 3 to 9 years. The cause of Alzheimer’s is very well understood in the natural health community, but mainstream Western allopathic approaches have circumvented the truth, and the billion dollar sick care industry simply adds to the chaos of treatment and long-term, costly care.
Most cases of Alzheimer’s are caused by consuming heavy metal toxins, taking prescription drugs and receiving toxic vaccines
Western medicine doctors work hard to convince patients that nearly all disease, disorder and sickness is genetic, including Alzheimer’s, somehow inherited from our parents and passed along to the children, so the doctors are “needed” for regular checkups, regular visits, and regular chronic, costly care. Most people believe anything and everything their doctors tell them, but the truth is very far from this regarding Alzheimer’s disease–namely its root causes and the “end results.” Plaques in the brain and hardened arteries can lead to Alzheimer’s and strokes, but there is much more to the diagnoses and examinations of the brain and the pollutants that contribute to disorder and severe malfunction of cognition. (1)
The FDA and CDC are quick to explain that there “are no medications or supplements that decrease risk,” but this is simply not true. Plus, they completely fail to mention that chemical consumption is the LEADING CAUSE, and how those chemicals enter the body is the ultimate revelation of how to cure the problem–the “disease” (that you can’t catch), and the disorder of cells, neurons and misfiring synapses­–that scientists have linked to processed foods (2) and heavy metal toxins. Treatment by allopathic doctors using “antipsychotics” is common and offers little to no benefit plus increases risk of early death.
From cradle to dementia– severely impaired cognitive ability and memory recognition
The damage starts before birth, when doctors prescribe and administer statin drugs and vaccines to pregnant women, which of course, effects the unborn child, just as anything the mother consumes, puts on her skin, breathes in, or has injected into muscle tissue. The CDC actually recommends flu shots for pregnant women, and those shots contain aluminum, formaldehyde (embalming fluid) and mercury (as thimerosal). American children receive as many as 50 vaccines in their first six years of life. Prescription (statin) drugs also cause memory impairment. (3)
Research published in the open-access journal PLOS One reveals that pravastatin (Pravachol), a common statin drug used to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, impairs cognitive ability and memory recognition. Researchers at the University of Bristol (UK) tested pravastatin and “Lipitor” (atorvastatin) on lab mice for more than two weeks and watched their ability to learn simple tasks and remember how to find food deteriorated, yet as soon as the drugs were removed from the equation, the mice’ normal memory and learning capacity returned. Even their abilities to recognize previously encountered objects was affected by the statins, yet returned after removal, within one week. In fact, the pravastatin impaired the mice’s overall learning capacity AND had lasting negative impairment on their object recognition. Is this why elderly humans don’t recognize their own immediate family during the final stages of Alzheimer’s–because of overuse of statin drugs? Are we recognizing a major contributing factor, besides just aluminum in drinking water, antacids, flu shots and vaccines? What other heavy metal toxins and prescription drugs are speeding us toward dementia? Scientists and researchers around the world are figuring it out quickly.
Per the University of Bristol study: “The results suggest that chronic treatment with pravastatin impairs working and recognition memory in rodents,” … “The reversibility of the effects on stopping treatment is similar to what has been observed in patients, but the lack of effect of atorvastatin suggests that some types of statin may be more likely to cause cognitive impairment than others.”
Do these statin “Wonder Drugs” really lower cholesterol in long term? At least 15,000,000 Americans are taking statin drugs now, in 2016. Statins are a class of cholesterol lowering drugs that inhibit certain enzymes that produce it. Most doctors use statin in the early stages of CVD (cardiovascular disease). (4) Those same doctors often have zero experience or education with nutrition and offer little to no useful information regarding bad eating habits and heavy metal toxins, which are the MAIN contributors to heart disease, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, Parkinson’s and of course, Alzheimer’s. Still, the most popular statins are prescribed right and left, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin and pravastatin. Current sales average for all statins is fast-approaching $30 billion. Lipitor was the top-selling “cholesterol-lowering” drug in the world while its patent was active, up until 2011, then, the FDA issued warning statements, including MEMORY LOSS and liver damage.
Further studies needed to understand relationship between statin treatment and cognitive function
So far, studies reveal statins can lead to diabetes, muscle damage and liver disease. They also lead to increased RISK of type 2 diabetes and side effects can include not only muscle damage but muscle deterioration. Even the drugs’ ability to provide meaningful protection against heart disease has been called into question. With the use of statins there is a GREATER RISK of coronary vessels developing obstructive coronary heart disease. Ironically, according to the FDA’s own adverse event reporting system, at least 40 of every 10,000 statin reports are for interstitial lung disease. Statins prescribed to the elderly is causing a 9% increase in diabetes, early-onset cataracts and insulin resistance. Then it’s the plaque–the calcified plaque and the coronary calcium–it continues regardless of statin treatment. This is the science and research that mainstream media or WebMD blocks, bans or memory-holes, so that true health enthusiasts won’t find it. Too late. Truthwikipedia exposes the real science behind the “science.” (5)
Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Dementia and the progression of plaque
Though statins are prescribed/marketed to “lower the risk of cardiovascular disease,” they carry a strong association to the progression of coronary artery plaque “features.” A correlation between Parkinson’s disease and low cholesterol exists, implicating statin use. The statins actually do the opposite of what they are marketed to do, in that they increase the numbers of coronary vessels developing obstructive coronary artery disease. This causes more narrowing of coronary arteries, increasing the chance of heart attacks. (8) (9)
Statins WORSEN Alzheimer’s problems
University of California at San Diego (UCSD) scientists published groundbreaking findings of their study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They combined high tech methods, such as three dimensional computer simulations and cell imaging, to investigate certain peptides (nonamyloidogenic) formed by drugs being tested as Alzheimer’s “therapies.” Their goal was to pinpoint the function of these therapies. Here’s what the scientists at UCSD discovered:
“The results showed that the peptides created active ion channels that caused brain cells to take in very high levels of calcium ions, eventually killing the very neurons needed for memory.”
It turns out the peptides may be pathogenic (disease-causing) and now they must look deeper into their findings, and study whether this can also be causing Down’s Syndrome and Alzheimer’s. Bottom line: Big Pharma has made Alzheimer’s worse by manufacturing and marketing drugs that produce MORE brain-damaging peptides.
Panaceas? Actually, there’s no proof anywhere that statins work at all
According to research published in a 2008 issue of Neurology (medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology), scientists concluded that statins offer no protection against Alzheimer’s disease. The Associate Professor of the Department of Neurological Sciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, studied over 900 Catholic clergy members with average age of 75, all who agreed to have their brains autopsied after death, in an ongoing study of aging and Alzheimer’s. All the clergy were free of dementia symptoms as the research began, and they were given annual cognitive and memory tests for 12 years. All in all, over 250 brain autopsies were performed. Conclusion? Statins played NO ROLE in preventing any of the subjects from having strokes. The cholesterol-lowering drugs did not help prevent Alzheimer’s either. No such correlation was found, despite Big Pharma’s claims to the contrary and mass marketing agendas. Also, another report on the brand of statins called Vytorin reveals they may be increasing plaque buildup, the exact opposite of what they are prescribed to do.
Western Medicine’s favorite drugs for infectious diseases – vaccines – contain aluminum, and THAT causes dementia
Aluminum gels or “salts” are added to most vaccines and flu shots as “adjuvants” to help the vaccines stimulate an early and potent response. (6) For example: Diptheria, Tetanus and Polio Vaccine (DTP) (14): Five injections given between 2 and 6 years of age, plus boosters “recommended” every 10 years. Contains formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate. Another example: DTaP, IPV, HBV and Hib*: (Diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B) Given to infants 2 to 12 months with boosters less than a year later. Contains aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde, and bovine cow serum. And yet another example: Gardasil HPV: Human Papillomavirus Vaccine–Made by Merck. (12) Administered to children as young as 9 years of age for a rare sexually transmitted disease. Contains polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, aluminum, and a “denatured” (fragmented and weakened) form of the virus. FYI: Aluminum phosphate greatly increases toxicity of mercury, so caution about minimum mercury tolerance is therefore severely underestimated. (15)
Aluminum in antacids, children’s medicine, and in tap water–causes Alzheimer’s
Aluminum is found is alarming high concentration of parts per billion (and even parts per million in some cases) in aluminum lake food coloring, tap water and antacids used so commonly and haphazardly for indigestion relief from toxic foods that may also contain aluminum and heavy metal toxins. Harmful synthetic petrochemicals are carcinogens that contain petroleum, antifreeze, ammonia and aluminum, causing all kinds of adverse reactions in humans with an overload and accumulation in the body. Aluminum poisoning not only leads to central nervous system damage and disorders, but also memory impairments and mental retardation. Research shows JUST 4 PPM (parts per million) of aluminum can cause the blood to coagulate.

There are currently 35 million people worldwide suffering from AD–Alzheimer’s disease
Most Alzheimer’s kicks into full gear for people over 65 years of age, although about 5% of cases begin earlier in life. Dementia results in about half-a-million DEATHS each year and remains one of the most financially expensive diseases. There are four major stages of the disease, classified as progressive patterns of cognitive and functional impairment–pre-dementia, early, moderate and advanced.
Pre-dementia: Most people think the early symptoms are simply aging or stress-related, but detailed neuropsychological testing reveals otherwise. Cognitive difficulties that can affect complex daily living activities can begin eight years before the person fits the clinical criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Most noticeably, short term memory loss (STML), shows up quite early, where the victim can’t remember newly learned facts and has trouble acquiring new information too. Apathy has been observed at this stage and is the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the disease. Add in depression and irritability as the person advances into the early stage.
Early dementia: Often what comes next is the difficulty with language and executive functions and movements. This is more prominent than memory problems during early dementia. Older memories and implicit memory often remains in tact, here, such as telling stories of the past and still using utensils to eat. Vocabulary base often shrinks now as well as word fluency. Some people have problems communicating basic ideas at this point.
Moderate dementia: Reading, writing and word choices become quite evident at this stage and are progressively lost. Risk of falling increases with loss of complex motor sequences. Memory worsens and some fail to recognize close relatives now. Even long term memory can fade out during this third phase, or at least the ability to communicate it. Behavioral problems step up and those affected may wander and get lost, cry out loud for extended periods of time, and become aggressive–resisting care giving. At least 30% become delusional. Urinary incontinence is common. All of this makes home care next to impossible. For most people, long-term care facilities are way too costly to afford.
Advanced dementia: In the final stages, the affected is completely dependent on outside care. Many patients in stage four can’t talk at all. Extreme apathy and violence are commonplace now. Many cannot even feed themselves.
The “Genetics” myth
Currently, there is no proof Alzheimer’s is inherited, and rarely is cancer, not even breast cancer. (11) Many doctors tell patients their genes may be “more prone” if their parent’s “had it”–whatever it may be, but the fact is that more than 95% of cases of cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes and heart disease are caused by toxic food, skin care and environmental pollutants. (13) That is why the United States rarely saw a case of these PREVENTABLE diseases and disorders before WWII, when processed food and synthetic-chemical “medicine” took the stage. Many foods now imported from China are loaded with heavy metal toxins, even “certified organic” foods exported from the industrial-polluted country, into America. That includes sodium fluoride, the industrial by-product that we put in US tap water, which adds to dementia, lowered IQ and relative confusion. In fact, Alzheimer’s is caused when heavy metals, plastics, mercury, saturated fats and lab-made synthetics clog the blood (and when they cross the blood brain-barrier), damaging brain cells in the hippocampus, the frontal lobe and the medulla oblongata, the forethought and long term memory sections of the brain.
Know the difference between the terms genetic and hereditary
ALL cancers are “genetic” because they have to do with your genes and how they multiply, but rarely is cancer “inherited.” Many MDs will tell you cancer is genetic, so you must have “inherited” it from one or both of your parents. They mix the two terms with carelessness. So then why is it nearly all cancer develops after birth, through cell mutations caused by the consumption of toxic food, toxic drinks, toxic skin care products, and a lack of exercise? Is this confusion a marketing ploy to get people to accept that their brains and heart automatically deteriorate with age and that they will need to seek pharmaceutical medicines (statins) to quell the symptoms or stave off dementia a few extra years? At what price? A massive stroke that leaves you incapacitated.
A neurovascular hypothesis has been proposed which state that poor functioning of the blood brain barrier may be involved
Another hypothesis asserts the disease is caused by age-related myelin breakdown in the brain. This would mean that preservatives like sodium benzoate would contribute to Alzheimer’s disease, because while killing food mold and fungus, sodium benzoate destroys the protein layer that protects cells (and suffocates mitochondria), thus enabling mutation, suffucation, and the development of cancer and other diseases of the brain.
Neonicotinoids and GMO cause dementia in bees
In conclusion: In a 2013 study by Health Canada, 70 percent of all dead bees tested positive for exposure to neonicotinoids. (10) Numerous studies show that bees exposed to neonicotinoids experience difficulty navigating and are more likely to fail to return to their hives; plus, other bees end up having smaller colonies than the non-exposed bees. The correlation? Just as bees that touch down on toxic pesticides and fungicides lose their way and can’t find the honeycomb or the honeybee colony, humans taking statin drugs who also consume GMO and Roundup’s toxic herbicide “glyphosate” that’s used for most conventional produce “lose their way”–except with humans we call it Alzheimer’s and we say there’s no cure, because the MDs say it’s all “genetic.” Well, everything is genetic, but what’s inherited usually doesn’t kill you. Don’t be confused by the terminology of Western medicine. Do you want the most effective plan for the prevention of Alzheimer’s, dementia and Parkinson’s? Stop ingesting chemicals.
