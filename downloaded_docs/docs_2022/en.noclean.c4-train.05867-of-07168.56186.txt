Rectal Skin Tags & Warts removing: Surgery, Causes, Treatment, Recovery.
Posted in Skin Tags Warts, Reviewed & Updated on March 31, 2018
The rectal area is the region in and on the anus. Discussing skin growths or conditions affecting such an area, especially skin tags and warts, can be stigmatizing and embarrassing.
The biggest problem with rectal skin tags and warts is that they are notoriously itchy. There is no way you can ignore them or completely overcome the urge to do some scratching. If that will not be embarrassing enough, it will invite all types of issues related to hygiene on top of irritating them further.
What causes rectal skin tags?
Although some similarities are shared between rectal skin tags and skin tags on other areas, the former differ a bit. A penis skin tag will not encourage the development of another one on the rectal area even after sex. In short, they are not contagious.

In regards to causes, friction and moisture occurring on the rectal area is to blame. Any of the following will encourage their development:
Hard stool – passing hard stool is mostly associated with hemorrhoids but can also produce skin tags. It is always recommended that you address any issue contributing to constipation.
Anal sex – we need not go to the details in this case. Without lubes and such things, too much friction will be experienced in the rectal area.
Pregnancy – a couple of changes that take place during and after pregnancy encourage skin tags, not only on the rectal area but also other body parts such as the groin.
Identifying rectal skin tags in pictures
It can be quite demanding if you are to identify rectal skin tags without touching them. In this case, you can try taking some pictures and compare.
On pictures, you are likely to observe a loose skin projection that takes the color of the skin. There may be several of them in a cluster or just a single one. Unlike hemorrhoids, skin tags will be on the skin and projected outwards. Think of what a skin-colored rice grain or a grape would look like.

Even when on the rectal area, the tags will not be contagious or get to develop into complicated genital infections. The problem is that they may interfere with anal hygiene. They are also prone to injuries and in that case encourage genital infections. This is not even mentioning the issue of pain and itching.
Use of remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for a cold sore on chin, is definitely not an option. Even if such remedies have been known to be effective, the rectal area is far too sensitive for such products.
Using a TagBand or a dental floss to ligate the skin tags is a better option. This can be done at home, to address the issue of stigmatization.
If you are open to clinical removal, a doctor can get rid of the tag quite easily. This can be achieved through surgical removal, compounds to freeze skin tags or burning. A quick surgery is much better, since then you will not need more than one appointment.
Laser treatment can be used when the tags are not responding to other treatments or when surgery is not an option. It is more effective in demanding treatments such as syringoma removal.
What causes rectal warts?
Rectal warts are a type of genital warts. They appear on or in the anus. In initial stages, you will hardly observe any symptoms, not even pain or itchiness. In fact, you may not even notice that they are there.

Without treatment, rectal warts will gain mass and may even spread to other genital areas. They will also be prone to injuries and irritation. This will end in a painful, bleeding and itchy rectal area. On pictures, large rectal warts will resemble cauliflowers. They usually form in clusters and are very soft upon touch.
Rectal warts treatment and removal
Over the counter rectal warts treatment products are not recommended. Instead, topical medications will be prescribed by a doctor to get rid of them.
Some medications will need to be applied in a clinic while others are to be taken at home. The warts usually start showing signs of healing after 2 weeks.
Large rectal warts removal surgery
If the warts have grown too large, they will rarely respond well to topical medications. This also happens for warts too deep inside the rectal area.
In such cases, a doctor will most likely opt for a surgery to remove them. Such a surgery will not take long and the patient will be released on the same day after the operation.
Other removal methods such as freezing, burning and use of laser can also be possibilities. The problem with these is that several appointments will be needed.
How to prevent rectal skin tags and warts
For skin tags, prevention revolves around avoiding causes of friction on the rectal area. Measures such as not wearing too tight clothes and taking regular showers can help.

Pregnant women should ensure that delivery occurs in a clinic or under the supervision of a professional. Sudden pressure sustained during delivery encourages rectal skin tags.
Just like nail fungus and such, warts are infections. This means that their cause is identifiable. Therefore, prevention measures revolve around containing the HPV strain that causes them. Anal sex, for example, will transmit the virus.
Warts are more common in people with low immunity. This can be encouraged by diseases such as diabetes and HIV. In such cases, see your doctor for prescription medication meant to contain the virus.
