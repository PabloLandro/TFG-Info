Healing Crystals: A Guide for Beginners
Throughout the course of time, crystals have been implemented for their many healing benefits.
Although they are truly lovely when it comes to jewelry, crystals serve a much deeper and spiritual purpose in our lives.
The healing power of crystals can be defined as an ancient metaphysical art that can bring about tranquility and prosperity.
This prosperity can be found in many different forms, such as the inevitable emotional, physical, and mental components of life that we face on a daily basis.
Through vibrations, crystals can help us to heal and find solace. Each crystal contains its own unique healing properties which can be used to improve the quality of your life for the better.
Here is a beginner’s guide to the healing power of crystals.
What Are Crystals?
Believe it or not, crystals are much more than perfect items composed of atoms to place on silver or gold.
If you were to ask a geologist, a specific crystal would most likely be defined according to its shape, size, and chemical composition.
Their atomic symmetry is fascinating to geologists because the structure of a crystal is repeated in all directions.
This feature also draws jewelers and consumers alike to crystals, which is why they generally include a hefty price tag.
However, crystals are more than gorgeous works of natural art from the earth: they have true healing capabilities which are alluring to many.
Crystals can take several hundreds of thousands of years to form and grow. Some crystals even take a few million years to fully form.
They’ve been around for way longer than we have, which can be one reason why many proponents of crystal healing believe in their healing abilities.
Crystals, as magnificent and beautiful as they are, have been used for alternative medical techniques to cure various ailments and diseases. They have frequently been described as conduits of healing.
How Do Crystals Work?
For the most part, crystals function as decorative pieces used commonly for commercialized and customized jewelry. However, if you’re referring to crystals for their healing properties, they function in a much different way.
Crystals far transcend the typical use of jewelry: their assistance in healing is truly worth noting.
A very common question when first learning about the healing capabilities of crystals is how they work. Crystal healing involves placing gemstones on particular areas of the body in order to draw out negative energy associated with illness.
The theory that crystals can facilitate healing has been in place for at least six thousand years; it is believed that they were first used by the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia. Ancient Egyptians have also been referenced as relying on crystals such as lapis lazuli, carnelian, and turquoise to treat illness and ward off negative energy.
However, many Asian cultures – especially the Chinese – believe in life-energy, which is commonly referred to as “chi.” Chi is stored in the Hindu and Buddhist concepts of chakras.
When there is negative chi stored inside of the various chakras which each have their own connection to a particular area of the body, a crystal can be placed on that area to remove any harmful energy.
It’s fairly interesting to see the tremendous impact that crystals have had and continue to have on a variety of different cultures throughout the course of time.
How Do I Choose a Crystal?
If you have found that the concept of healing crystals is intriguing and you would like to get started, you will need to begin by finding a crystal.
One of the easiest ways to find a crystal is to research stores that sell them in your area and then take a visit to each location. Many crystal experts believe that a crystal finds you and that it is not the other way around.
In order to choose a crystal – or rather, let the crystal find you – it is a good idea to walk around a store full of crystals and determine which one draws you in the most.
Could it be its mesmerizing colors, or maybe its asymmetrical shape? Perhaps the crystal has a story to tell, but you can’t quite put your finger on what it is.
One thing is for sure: each crystal has its own unique energy, and whether or not that energy speaks to you is imperative.
Crystals are all incredibly breathtaking in appearance, so remember that having patience is critical when it comes to determining the correct one for your soul.
Once a crystal speaks to you, hold it in your hand and check for hot or cold sensations, pulsations, or feelings of tranquility.
If you notice any of these characteristics, then that crystal is more than likely the right fit for you and your healing intentions.
How to Use Crystals
After you have found a few crystals that you can identify with, you can begin using them for healing purposes.
To properly use them as a means of healing, make sure that you set your intention. Your intention is when you assign your crystal a job and a purpose.
After all, crystals are quite willing to work with you, but you have to let them know what goal you are attempting to achieve.
This might take a bit of soul-searching: what do you wish to accomplish in your life that can be supported with the help of crystal healing?
Maybe you are suffering from depression or anxiety and would like your selection of chosen crystals to aid in your journey to conquer these ailments.
When you connect with your crystals, make sure that your intentions are passed through their vibrations. With the help of crystals, you can profoundly improve areas of your life that had been previously unpleasant.
This includes your overall state of well-being, your career, how you relate to others through your social life, and much more.
Make sure that you confidently believe and stand by your intentions, because they work just like magnets: they attract anything and everything that can help them come true.
How to Clean Crystals
There is no doubt that crystals are composed of not only atoms but healing energy as well, which makes them highly valuable in terms of their spiritual, mental, and physical benefits.
That is why cleaning your crystals is a significant aspect of owning them. Your crystals take care of you, so you need to take care of them in turn.
Washing them by rinsing them under a faucet can work, but when it comes to providing your crystals with a true luxury cleansing, take them to the ocean.
Of course, that is only a viable option if you live near the sea. If you do, keep them safely secured so that the ocean waves do not sweep them away!
After you have rinsed your crystals with water, take them outside to soak in the sun.
The natural energy of the sun will be healing for your crystals; however, you can also let them dry in the moonlight as well.
As you set each crystal down to dry, think of at least one thing you would like to let go of.
However, do not attempt to let go of more than five things, since this can lower the vibrations of your crystals.
Now that you have found the crystals that speak directly to your soul and they have been cleansed with water, you can begin meditation.
To meditate with crystals, it is imperative that you learn how to meditate beforehand.
Meditation is not always the easiest task for the busy mind, but with practice, it can absolutely be accomplished. It is incredibly beneficial to learn meditation since it cleanses the mind, body, and spirit.
To meditate with crystals, make sure to incorporate at least one quartz stone and one selenite as well.
A quartz crystal is an excellent tool because it can be programmed to focus directly on the task of meditation.
It is used to help you uncover the clarity of your dreams.
Selenite is used for meditation to release negative energy and blockages while simultaneously cleansing your body.
As you meditate, it is a good idea to place a crystal on each chakra area. This includes the following chakra areas:
Root chakra
Sacral chakra
Solar plexus chakra
Heart chakra
Throat chakra
Third eye chakra
Crown chakra
As you meditate, allow your crystals to release any negative energy so that you can awaken the higher consciousness of your mind.
Angel Healing Crystals
If you thought that meditation with the powerful use of crystals was enough, then think again.
Angel healing crystals actually provide an even deeper level of therapeutic benefits.
With angel healing crystals, you can combine the restorative power of angels and crystals in one take.
If you have ever had any spiritual inclinations, crystals can truly expose you to an angelic realm.
Becoming closer to the angels who watch after you is possible when you employ the use of angel healing crystals.
The best crystals to use when you are connecting to your spiritual counselors are amethyst, Angelite, apophyllite, celestite, moldavite, and selenite.
Crystals can help you to awaken your heart and third eye chakras.
These chakras should be opened when you connect with angels and archangels. Thankfully, crystals contain properties that lend themselves naturally to the heart and third eye chakras.
One interesting theory about crystals is that they are the actual physical manifestation of angelic light beings. This theory was carried out by Rudolph Steiner.
There is no denying the beauty that can be found through a crystal, and if an angelic light being is manifested through the form of a crystal, then it is an even better reason to incorporate them into your healing meditation.
For over six thousand years, crystals have been trusted for their healing benefits.
Whether you wish to meditate with them or use them as a way to connect with your angels, crystals are impeccable tools for curing ailments and illnesses.
