You might have heard that eating carrots is good for your eyesight, as a commonly myth states that eating carrots will help correct a person's faulty vision or help them to see in the dark. While it is true that carrots are good for your vision, they cannot increase your visual acuity.
Carrots and Vision
While carrots cannot improve your vision, they are a good source of beta carotene, which is a form of vitamin A. A deficiency in this vitamin can lead to vision problems and eventual blindness. When a person does not consume enough vitamin A, over time, the photoreceptors in the eye begin to deteriorate, disrupting vision. This process can be reversed by restoring the amounts of vitamin A in the system through eating a healthy diet and by taking a daily multivitamin.
Other Vitamins
In addition to vitamin A, carrots contain many other nutrients that are also beneficial for the eyes. Vitamins A, C and E all help to reduce the incidence of eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts. Macular degeneration is a condition in which the center of the retina, called the macula, begins to break down, causing blurred vision or a blind spot in the center of the visual field. Cataracts, on the other hand, are a clouding of the lens of the eye, causing blurry vision and a foggy appearance to the eye.
Improving Your Eyesight
There is no magic food or supplement that can improve your eyesight. However, you can take steps to help maintain healthy vision, including eating a healthy diet. In addition to getting enough vitamin A through eating carrots and other orange vegetables, other foods can help maintain your eyesight as well. Leafy greens are full of an antioxidant called zeaxanthin, and citrus fruits and berries are full of vitamin C. Both zeaxanthin and vitamin C have been proven to slow macular degeneration and cataracts. Eggs contain zinc, and almonds are full of vitamin E. These nutrients also help to reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.
Getting Help for Vision Problems
If you suspect that you already have developed a vision problem such as macular degeneration or if your vision is becoming worse, do not attempt to self-treat the issue with diet or supplements. Instead, the best strategy is to visit an optometrist, who has several tests and advanced technologies at her disposal to diagnose a wide variety of eye problems, including vision problems caused by a vitamin A deficiency. After diagnosing the problem, she can then recommend a treatment plan designed to improve your vision or to prevent further problems from developing.
