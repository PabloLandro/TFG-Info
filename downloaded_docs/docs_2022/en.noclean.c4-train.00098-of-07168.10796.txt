An epiphany about grapefruit
by Lisa Fain
Jan 6, 2009
I have a confession to make: I don’t really like grapefruit. And this makes me sad. Don’t get me wrong—grapefruit is pleasing on many levels. It’s pleasing to the eye with its bright red color, pleasing to the nose with its clean, floral scent and pleasing to the touch with its receptive flesh. But for me, it’s not so pleasing to the taste—I find it too bitter and it makes my face contort into unattractive shapes.
I’m not completely adverse to grapefruit-flavored things. Fresca is one of my favorite soft drinks. And grapefruit bread, if done well, can be a delicious treat. But the thought of tucking my spoon into a halved grapefruit just fills me with dread. That is, unless you add sugar.
If you know me, you’ve probably heard me trumpet my lack of a sweet tooth. But I think we both know that I’m just lying to myself. And while it’s a New Year and like most people I am trying to temper some of my appetites in order to regain my pre-holiday health. I also can’t avoid that grapefruits are in season and if I’m going to get any joy out of eating them, I’m just going to have to add sugar.
When I was in Oxford, Mississippi back in October, I had the pleasure of eating breakfast a couple of times at the very fine Big Bad Breakfast—BBB for short. If you’re ever there, do yourself a favor and make a point of trying BBB’s house-smoked bacon and sausage, cheesy grits, fluffy biscuits and homemade jams. They also offer a half of grapefruit that’s been topped with a spicy sugar crust.
I didn’t order that when I was there but one of my friends did, and she got so much obvious joy out of digging her spoon through the crunchy shell into the soft fruit that it almost made me regret ordering biscuits and gravy instead of grapefruit. Almost.
When I recently got my hands on some big, juicy grapefruits, I decided that I would have to recreate that grapefruit brulée at home. I halved a grapefruit and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon over the fruit. I placed the two halves under the broiler for a few seconds and they came out a bit warm covered in glassy, shiny sugar layer. It’s sweet enough to cut back some of the grapefruit’s bitterness without the grapefruit losing its essence. And as it only takes a few minutes to make, I think I just may have my new go-to winter-morning meal.
OK, I’m lying again. I’d still rather have breakfast tacos or pancakes early in the morning. But even with the sugar, this grapefruit is healthy enough and so I might as well enjoy them while they’re in season. Heck, grapefruits could even become one of my favorite fruits.

My grandparents owned a farm (orchard) in the Rio Grande Valley (Pharr/McAllen) many years ago. They grew grapefruit among other things. I love grapefruit, and I agree with you that it can be bitter. Try it with some salt, not sugar.

I feel the same way Lisa! My dad used to get so excited when TX Grapefruits were in season. I’d wake up to find the kitchen table covered in halved grapefruits. Unfortunately, I think I ate far more sugar than actual fruit getting them down…
But this looks delicious!

Doesn’t eating copious amounts of grapefruit aidweight loss ? I seem to recall the grapefruit diet being popular a few years ago.
Nothing beats a big glass of fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice. I can motor thru 2 liters a day no problem.

One of the joys of living in Texas (for me) is grapefruit season! This Georgia girl could eat her weight in Texas Ruby Reds, and the only fruit I love more is a juicy Georgia peach in June.
I made a salad just the other night using red grapefruit:
Tear some romaine, thinly slice a quartered red onion, cut an avocado into cubes and cut that Ruby Red into supremes. Toss it all with a little raspberry walnut vinaigrette…yum.

Just like my Mama used to do. We had little edged "sporks" that we called "Grapegfruit spoons." wonder what happened to them? I should snag one for old times sake next time I visit my Mama & Daddy.
There is NO WAY I could dig into a grapefruit w/o sugar!

Another point I forgot to make.
Grapefruit juice and segments can really make a quality ceviche standout, especially scallop ceviche.

A warning about grapefruit (and juice) and medication. Grapefruit can interfere with certain medications, rendering some ineffective, and causing a toxic build-up of others. So if you’re on a medication, please consult with your physician.

Since you’re a homesick Texan, you should try a Rio Star grapefruit (a Texas-only variety). I never thought I liked grapefruit until a woman at the Texas State Fair forced me to try a piece of a Rio Star and I’ve been hooked ever since. They are deep red, very sweet with only the slightest hint of bitterness. I went from never eating grapefruit (even with sugar) to an addict in one afternoon.

This ex-pat Texan is homesick for ruby reds at this time every year. I love them plain, peeled like an orange, but when I want to gussy them up a bit, I whip up a sabayon, drizzle it over peeled grapefruit segments, and broil until the sabayon is browned. Mmmmm…

I have tears in my eyes because my grandmother, who taught me to cook and was a truly outstanding woman, used to serve broiled grapefruit as an appetizer at all her dinner parties. She had an old-fashioned stove with a separate gas broiler on top, and I remember seeing the grapefruit carmelizing under it and thinking how weird it was to be serving grapefruit for dinner. Now I think I’ll have to try it, just for the memories. Thanks for bringing it back to me!

I used to dislike grapefruit too BUT like others have said, the Star Rio Ruby Red Grapefruit changed my mind, it’s the best. The bitterness of the grapefruit tends to come from the membranes surrounding the fruit. I prepare the grapefruit by either cutting the peeling off the grapefruit so that it exposes the grapefruit. Then take the grapefruit out within the sections so that you have only grapefruit sections and no skin or membranes present. Or the other way is to peel the grapefruit like you would an orange. Break in half and then start by removing the membranes separating the segments only keeping the flesh of the grapefruit. I usually squeeze the excess juice into the bowl as well. I’ve never had a bitter one when it’s done like that. It might be a bit sour if it’s not completely ripe. If it’s ripe then you should be able to eat it without adding any sugar but if it’s a little sour we then add sugar to the grapefruit sections. My children will eat grapefruit if it’s prepared this way….give it a try…you’ll love it.

When I was a kid my mom always gave me grapefruit halves sweetened with a little drizzle of real maple syrup. It’s still my favorite way to eat them. The syrup brings sweetness, sure, but also a whiff of smokiness and other more intangible flavors that are just delicious. Grapefruit brulee is just a ridiculously awesome concept however! Happy New Year Lisa! Hope to see you soon.

O-Dub–Salt? I like that idea! I can’t wait to try it.
Kitchen Vixen–It’s a wonderful way to use them up–enjoy!
Miss Meat and Potatoes–Yep, I came from a big grapefruit-loving family, too. Half the time we didn’t even have orange juice in the house, just a big thing of Texsun grapefruit juice.
Lisa (dinner party)–It’s very simple!
Adrienne–The grapefruit doesn’t get that warm as it’s under the broiler only long enough to melt the sugar.
Gregg–Thanks!
Tommy–I’ve heard that before, too. And wow–you sure do like your grapefruit juice!
Leilani Lee–I wonder if they’ve been bred to be more sweet?
KMays–Ruby Reds are sweeter than most, but still a touch too bitter for me.
PaniniKathy–It’s such a simple recipe! Have you ever made a panini with grapefruit?
DeciverofMen–Perhaps I’ll need to order a shipment from Texas.
Mary–I love cinnamon and peanut butter, too, especially with a drizzle of honey.

I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas so I grew up eating/loving grapefruit.
My mom used to cut it in half, sprinkle sugar on the top and put it in the refrigerator overnight. We would have it for breakfast and the sugar would be hard on top but also melted into the grapefruit underneath. It was great!

Grapefruit: the perfect antidote to too much fruitcake!
I love a grapefruit in all of its tartness, but this looks like a fun recipe. (One of my grandmothers used to always smear a thick layer of white sugar on top of her grapefruit.)
Does the sugar topping prevent the grapefruit from squirting you in the eye?

Happy New Year from Houston, Texas! I’m with you I don’t like Grapefruit too much either. Even the Ruby Reds, which everyone say are sweet, aren’t to me. I’ve had broiled grapefruit with brown sugar (sounds weird) and that’s not too bad but I’m always wishing there was more sugar on top. I’m afraid I wouldn’t do too good on a Grapefruit diet. All my saved calories would be lost loading it up with sugar.

As a fellow Homesick Texan in Chicago, I love reading your blog. You must try Rio Star’s with salt. My mom grew up eating them that way and passed it onto me. Growing up in South Texas, I didn’t know any other way to do it – especially since, like you, I am not a big fan of sweets.

I actually don’t like grapefruit by itself, but I mix the juice of two ruby reds with the juice of an orange and a lemon to make my citrus lamb. The meat and the other juices cut the bitterness (plus I serve with sweet potato mash) but the grapefruit gives the whole thing zing…

I used to think that grapefruit was bitter until a friend showed me how to eat it. You peel it like an orange, and then section it, remove the clear membrane around each section, that is where all the bitterness is. It’s a little work but worth the effort.

i like to pinks ok too, usually a box of Costco rubies are so much sweeter and thin skinned than from the produce section of my safeway.
I always heat the grapefruit in the micro, after topping with organic cane sugar plus i have a handy little grapefruit knife that is double bladed, so it cuts on either side of the segments,
Salt? hmmm…can’t quite imagine it.

I grew up in Mission, TX, home of the grapefruit (Ruby Reds). I can’t get enough of them – especially now that I live in Boston! I grew up on them, usually with a bit of sugar on top, but there was a restaurant called “Ferrell’s” near our house whose specialty was Ruby Red pie. It was really incredible! I tried making it once and was disappointed that it didn’t turn out as well. It’s also a lot of work to peel all those grapefruit sections!

Thank you so much for this post! My girls are on a grapefruit kick right now and thank goodness they are so inexpensive here. When I was at A&M I'd drive down and visit my grandma in Lake Jackson, she'd ask me to drive her to the "fruit stand" so she could buy some "grapefruits from the valley". I can't look at one and not think of her.

I was always drawn to grapefruit’s tartness, so I loved just spooning out the tart and juicy sections and eating them unadorned. It wasn’t until I moved to NC, that the bruleed version of grapefruit was introduced to me. I was skeptical at first, but after tasting that hot, sticky sugar on top of the tangy grapefruit, I was a convert.

When I was younger I used to eat grapefruit with honey, but as my sweet tooth lessened with age, I found myself able to eat it plain! I was so proud of myself the first time I did it.

This may sound real basic and unsophisticated, but a real satisfying dessert can be made using ruby red grapefruit segments (pith removed) added into either orange or lemon Jello. Cut back on the water a little so the Jello:fruit ratio is about even.
Cmon, even people who say they would never eat Jello would like this one.

Here in California, I grow in my backyard “Oro Blanco” grapefruit and “chandler” pummelo. The Oro Blanco is not sour at all because it is a cross between a grapefruit and a pummelo. It has white flesh. The Chandler pummelo is sweet as well but pink flesh.
Both of these were “produced” by University of California, Riverside. It is such fun to pick your own fruit from trees in your backyard.

WOW, I used to think grapefruits were a waste of editable plants. The wife always bought 4-6 of them when she went shopping. She’s sit in a comfortable spot and just sit and enjoy them. Every time I tried one I just got that funny taste spreading around in my mouth, ugh! Yet I thought it was one of nature’s best works. It’s like designed to be a food source from start to finish.
Look at the ample size, if you want to stop after one grapefruit it’s not an issue cause you’ve had a full portion.
when you start peeling it you discover the protective padding to keeping from bruising easily.
You get it all peeled and you start to remove the excess cushion to reveal the sections. Simply take your sthumbs and seperate the halves. Now you see the grapefruit packaging design, the individual envelopes that allow you to work slowly with it and at your leisure.
Here’s the trick, Remove a section, open the envelope on one side then peel off that side. Now the magic happens when you introduce your the pulp to your pallete, simply bite a very small amount. you’ll still get the bitterness but only a small amount. your taste buds will adjust, savor that and take a slightly larger bite, finish tht section. Now you should be able to peel and consume all the other sections.
If not send them to me!

I’m already a lover of grapefruit, but your brown sugar has got to be the most exciting thing I’ve seen in a long time! It’s on my breakfast list for tomorrow!
Have you tried drinking grapefruit with a shot of tequila? It’s one of my favorite cocktail. Maybe the tequila will convince you too!

Interesting. I never understood the need to halve it and then use a spoon. I just peel the skin and then eat it section by section.

My mother used to serve a salad at dinner that was grapefruit slices, avocado slices, and catalina dressing. Have you ever had this? The flavors go together in a way that is totally unexpected – very refreshing. I have a grapefruit right now that is calling out for this treatment… assuming I can find an avocado in the city of Vancouver that is worth eating…

Wow, that looks great. I have a grapefruit tree in my back yard. I’ve always put white sugar on my grapefruit but never brown sugar. I’m going to have to go pick a grapefruit and try that.
First time reading your blog, my husband is from Texas and is always asking me to make tex-mex meals. So I am interested in getting some recipes.

FYI on the grapefruit.. a pack of splenda per side, a dash of cinnamon, 45 seconds in the microwave, and suddenly grapefruit has transformed into the most wonderful, comforting snack ever… my husbands grandmother taught me this trick… and I love it

i don’t like the ruby red grapefruit because it is bitter but last week when i passed by the farmer’s market, there was a stall selling oro blanco grapefruits and they were sweet.

I’m a Texan in upstate NY, and I was jumpin’ and shoutin’ in the aisle at Sam’s the other day. they had a shipment of Texas grown Rio Stars (sweeter than Ruby Reds). The. best. grapefruit. I may be biased. My grandfather was a friend of the man who developed/refined this strain, and I used to get them fresh from the grove. Nothing beats them, and you’ll never be able to eat any from CA or FL again, but it’s worth that. Simply amazing.

Hi Lisa,
Jennie from London, England.
Loving your blog. Your entries make my mouth water, except for this one! I find grapefruit too bitter as well. I have memories of ordering " jus de pamplemousse" on holiday in France without realising what it was. Started gulping it down and… lets just say my family found my facial expressions very amusing!
One day, I might pluck up the courage to try it grilled with sugar on top. It might not be for a while.
Take care
