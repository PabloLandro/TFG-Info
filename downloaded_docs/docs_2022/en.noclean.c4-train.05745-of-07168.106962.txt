Acusoothe Pure Copper High Quality Elegant Horse Shoe Design Wrist Cuff Bracelet Pain Relief Arthritis Therapy Aid Magnetic Designer Bangle With 6 High Power 2500 Gauss Magnets For Ladies & Men In Beautiful Velvet Pouch.
The Acusoothe Copper Magnetic Bracelets Combine Two Amazing Properties To Soothe Away Problems Such As Arthritis, Menstrual Cramps, Headaches, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome & Fatique.
Magnetic bracelets are commonly used to treat arthritic conditions. Copper has anti-inflammatory effects in the body, and may therefore have painkilling properties.
One study showed that copper from a bracelet can be absorbed into the body, and it does seem that this can offer relief from arthritic pain and joint problems.
Magnetic bracelets are commonly used to treat a range of conditions including arthritis, migraine, and even fatigue. The concept that something as simple as a magnet could relieve these and other conditions is perhaps difficult to accept. Nevertheless, there is at least some scientific evidence to support the usefulness of magnet therapy.
There are countless reports of people who have found magnet therapy has relieved a variety of conditions including arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Magnetic fields exist in all living things, including our own bodies, and some scientists believe that an imbalance in the body's field can lead to pain and disease.
It is thought that magnets may rebalance the body's energy, thereby restoring health and relieving pain. There is also some evidence that magnets may improve blood flow, helping with the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues.
Magnets worn close to the wrist, are believed to help increase blood flood to the joints, bringing healing nutrients such as iron and vitamin C, plus help to balance the bio-energy fields in wrist and surrounding tissues.
Magnets have been used in Chinese Medicine for 1000's of years and 100's in Europe for therapy and many people claim significant pain relief through the use of magnets for healing.
The combination of copper and magnets is consider to be the most effective form of bracelet for arthritis.
