How Much Water Is Too Much?
Even though it is very uncommon, you can die from drinking too much water. Yes, that’s right. In rare cases drinking too much water could kill you.
Why does this happen? Well when your kidneys can no longer remove excess water, the electrolyte (mineral) content of your blood is diluted.
The result of this is a chronically low sodium level in the blood. The medical term for this condition is called hyponatremia. In extreme cases hyponatremia can lead to death.

How Many Bottles Of Water Should I Drink a Day
As a human being you are always losing water from your body. This is typically through your sweat and urine. There are lots of different expert opinions about how much water you should be drinking each day. But the common consensus is that you should drink the right amount for your body weight and level of physical activity.
To do this you should divide your weight (in pounds) by 2. Whatever number you get, convert to ounces and et voila. That’s how much you should drink per day.
To work out how many bottles you should drink, simply work out how many bottles that number converts to. Use this water calculator to find out.

How Many Ounces Of Water Should I Drink a Day?
Now let’s move on from worrying about how much water is too much. If you can’t be bothered to start calculating your body weight to determine your daily water intake then take note of this general consumption guide.
The Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Nebraska have provided some ideas. According to them, a healthy adult should generally be drinking around approximately 3.7 – 2.7 liters a day.
Yes, that’s right. 3.7 L equals to around 15 cups and this is good for the average man. While 2.7L (11 cups) is a good amount for a healthy adult woman.
It is important to note that this guideline is related to ALL the beverages you drink in a day. Not just water.
Do NOT drink all of your water allowance in one sitting.
Spread it out across the day. Feeling thirsty or having deep yellow urine is a good indicator that you are dehydrated and should drink some water.
If you are under specific instruction from your doctor and taking medication then seek advice. There are certain conditions that affect your need for water. For instance, certain medications like diuretics or if you have a kidney condition. If you are in any doubt, you MUST seek professional medical advice before making drastic changes to your daily water intake.
Water Intake Per Day
The 3.7 – 2.7L per day figure is also supported by the Institute of Medicine. They recommend that the average woman without any health issues should consume around 91 ounces (2.7 liters) a day.
While a healthy man should consume approximately 125 ounces (which is 3.7 liters) each day. The important word used here is “consume” and not “drink”.
This is because you can consume the recommended daily amount of water from all sources. Sources including all beverages, food and water itself.
How Much Water Should I Drink To Lose Weight Fast?
An effective water diet essentially means that you add more water to your diet. A ground breaking study by Dr Amanda Daley shows that people can easily lose weight by adding an extra 500ml or 16 oz of water around 30 minutes before every meal will help you loose around 9 pounds (or 4.3 kg) over a 3 month period.
How Much Water Is Too Much? My Conclusion
How much water is too much? Well there are some easy ways to know if you are drinking too much. For instance, if you drink a lot of water and it hurts, stop drinking. If you feel discomfort in any way, stop drinking. And if you have any concerns check with a health care professional or expert.
The most important thing is that you drink the right amount of water for you. Water is so necessary to your body for its healthy normal functioning. Ideally you should drink the right amount for your specific body weight and level of physical activity. You should also take into account any health issues and medications you are taking. Some conditions like kidney diseases or medications can affect the amount of water you need to consume. As always, if you are in any sort of doubt then you must contact a professional medical expert and seek advice.
