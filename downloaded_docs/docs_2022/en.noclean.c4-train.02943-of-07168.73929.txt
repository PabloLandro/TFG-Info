Baking soda is also known as Sodium Bicarbonate is a very common substance that is used in every household for various purposes. But not everyone is aware of the fact that baking soda can be used by patients suffering from cancer as it helps to stabilize the growth of cancer cells.
While there have been many debates surrounding the same, there have also been theories that explain why baking soda or the so-called sodium bicarbonate is good for cancer patients. Let us read on to know more about it.
How does baking soda help in cancer healing?
It is a well-known fact that there is no permanent cure for cancer as it is a disease that damages the cells and tissues in the human body and this will, in turn, trigger various abnormalities. Patients who are suffering from cancer find a lot of changes that occur in the metabolic process of the body. Such unhealthy metabolic processes can be reduced by following a few natural ingredients and one such natural ingredient is baking soda.
The human body needs to have a pH level of 7.365 and one needs to regulate the pH balance to remain healthy. This can be regulated by following a proper lifestyle and a healthy diet.
Now that we know about pH levels, baking soda can be used to regulate the pH levels in the body. Baking soda also helps to increase the carbon dioxide and the oxygenation. Baking soda has the pH level of 9.0 and when taken, it can help buffer the pH level of the cells and the tissues. It also helps the body in healing from the exposure caused by radiation and also aids in the detoxification process.
A number of healthcare experts also make use of baking soda in treating a number of health ailments. Some of the common illnesses, where sodium bicarbonate is used are cold, diabetes, flu, and in various kidney diseases. There are a few healthcare practitioners who suggest the use of baking soda in the treatment of cancer. This can be used a bath soak too.
Use of baking soda to identify cancer
A number of recent studies that have been conducted have revealed that baking soda can be used to identify the cancer cell growth. As per the UK cancer research group, the acids are built up in the areas affected by cancer and bicarbonate too gets converted into carbon dioxide. Such changes can be viewed during an MRI scan.
Cancer cells tend to flourish when there is an acidic environment and such areas in the body have a low pH when compared to the other cells and tissues. To know the growth rate of the cancer cells and to know the areas that have been affected by cancer, a number of medical experts make use of sodium bicarbonate.
Does baking soda help to suppress the growth rate of cancer cells?
This is one of the most common questions asked by many. While it is known that baking soda is used in identifying cancer, many patients suffering from cancer wish to know if they can use baking soda to reduce the growth of these cancer cells. As mentioned earlier, baking soda can be used to regulate the pH of the cells and tissues that are affected by cancer and this, in turn, improves the body metabolism.
Though there are a number of theories and articles that talk about the use of baking soda in the treatment of cancer, patients should not use this therapy without having a word with the doctor. Unmonitored use of sodium bicarbonate can cause various health hazards.
