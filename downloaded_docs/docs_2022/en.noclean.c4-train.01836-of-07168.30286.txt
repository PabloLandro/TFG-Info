2016-05-12 Smeters do nothing to upgrade infrastructure — old poles, transformers, etc.
1) BC Hydro and all utilities justify the $$meters saying they are part of the upgrading of the infrastructure when, in fact, they are just meters that are supposed to gather info for billing purposes and nothing else. In this article, there is a lot about the problems with the old infrastructure that both Canada and the USA have. The smeters will not fix these problems. Of special interest is the paragraph “EMC concerns”. (EMC is the name of the company)
“For the Smart Grid to be fully operational, it must integrate many electronic systems into a grid that was never designed to accommodate current generation electronic technology such as RF and optical communications, and high-speed low-voltage digital and analog circuitry.”
http://www.ecnmag.com/news/2016/05/new-technology-confronts-old-enemy
2) Another interesting article by Dr. Goldsworthy of the UK. This one about the effect of RF and EMF on various systems that could lead to obesity, allergies, dementia, etc.
“Electromagnetic radiation, obesity and chronic fatigue
Gland cells (thyroid, adrenal etc) may be particularly sensitive to radiation because their secretions are normally produced in internal membrane systems, which can also be damaged.”
http://www.foodsmatter.com/es/health_risks/articles/goldsworthy-obesity-05-12.html
3) In the USA, phone companies are trying to get rid of landlines and make everyone use cell phones, even though this has proven to be problematic in storms, etc. People in California are fighting a proposed bill and, just recently, other states are facing the same proposals. As always, what happens there will happen here sooner or later. We should be prepared. Here are some good articles explaining why our concern about Wi-Fi isn’t the only reason to refuse to allow this to happen here. I will keep you informed about this as it develops.
“Voice-over-Internet phones can be manipulated to falsify caller ID. It’s been used in other scams too, so if you get a suspicious call, don’t assume the caller ID is real.”

http://stopsmartmeters.org/2016/04/08/urgent-action-needed-att-on-warpath-to-destroy-californias-valuable-landline-network/
4) In Michigan, many cities and municipalities are supporting an opt out, similar to our initial actions here. We had close to 70 local governments asking for a moratorium. And the Union of BC Municipalities supported this. Then Clark and Coleman said too bad, this doesn’t matter. We decide, you don’t. You might recall Coleman’s famous statement. You have 3 choices. Take the smeter. Go off the grid. Leave BC. This is when the environment of harassment began in earnest. I wish the people in Michigan better luck with their government.

5) A fun approach to the very serious topic of cybersecurity and hacking. To appreciate the final poke, you need to know that Secretary Rudd is the Energy Minister of the UK and is in charge of the $$meter program.
http://www.nickhunn.com/squirrels-grid-security-and-a-stuffed-rudd/
6) Below is a letter I sent to the HESA committee members and Prime Minister Trudeau in support of Jerry Flynn’s call for a criminal investigation of Health Canada [HC]. I hope many of you will join me in this effort to highlight the fact that HC is negligent in doing its job. A prime example is its website which supposedly allows people who have concerns to learn more about RF and wireless devices. I picked a couple of examples, but there are hundreds. Pick a page and read and you will find more – waffling, deception, just plain lying about the science that we know has been available for many years. Why does HC cherry pick studies or ignore the fact that, at the minimum, the precautionary approach should be followed. HC gives hacks like Perry Kendall the opportunity to push Wi-Fi in schools and $$meters on our homes with impunity. He hides behind HC. I’ve included an amazing list of links that were gathered by a friend in Quebec. Great for future reference.

Subject: Health Canada is misleading the public, misrepresenting facts re. wireless radiation
Dear Prime Minister Trudeau, and HESA Committee Members,
I am writing in support of Mr. Jerry Flynn’s charge that Health Canada is misusing its authority by misleading the public about the scientific evidence which shows that there is strong evidence that prolonged exposure to even small amounts of microwave radiation can cause harm, especially to children.
I charge that Health Canada provides erroneous, inaccurate and outdated information to the public, and following are just two examples from its current websites.
1) “As long as RF energy levels remain below Health Canada’s RF safety guidelines, current scientific evidence supports the assertion that RF energy emissions from Wi-Fi devices are not harmful. Health Canada’s conclusions are consistent with the findings of other international bodies and regulators, including the World Health Organization http://www.who.int/peh-emf/en/, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection http://www.icnirp.org/, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers http://www.ieee.org/index.html and the U.K. Health Protection Agency https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england.
RF energy exposure from Wi-Fi equipment in all areas accessible to the general public are required to meet Health Canada’s safety guidelines. The limits specified in the guidelines are far below the threshold for adverse health effects and are based on an ongoing review of thousands of published scientific studies on the health impacts of RF energy. The public exposure limits apply to everyone, including children, and allow for continuous, 24/7 exposure.”
http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/prod/wifi-eng.php
2) ““What does Health Canada say about the potential health risks from Wi-Fi?
Based on scientific evidence, Health Canada has determined that low-level exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy from Wi-Fi equipment is not dangerous to the public. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of other international bodies and regulators.
Should parents be concerned about Wi-Fi in schools?
No. RF energy levels from Wi-Fi equipment in all areas accessible to the general public, including school settings, are required to meet Health Canada’s exposure guidelines. The limits specified in the guidelines are based on an ongoing review of thousands of published scientific studies on the health impacts of RF energy. Levels of RF energy emitted from Wi-Fi equipment are typically well below these exposure limits. As long as exposure is below these established limits, there is no convincing scientific evidence that emissions from this equipment are dangerous to schoolchildren or to Canadians in general.”
http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/radiation/cons/wifi/faq-eng.php
Below this letter is a list of 60 links that contain information that refutes Health Canada’s assertion that wifi is safe. These contain many peer reviewed studies by world-renowned scientists, showing that the proliferation of microwave radiation must be curtailed for the sake of the health of future generations.
Parents are being misled, but, worse, provincial health authorities are, too. Provincial medical officers merely follow Health Canada’s lead and, consequently, being unaware and uneducated on the topic, are allowing wired internet access to be replaced with wireless industrial-strength modems that are exposing children and teachers to high levels of radiation all day every school day. No information is provided to parents about this health hazard, and when children become ill, parents and doctors are left trying to find the cause. When parents discover that their children are exhibiting symptoms consistent with radiation illness first diagnosed 80 years ago, the schools refuse to eliminate wifi. and tell the parents that it can’t be the wifi because Health Canada says it’s safe.
How can Health Canada defend its statement that its position is consistent will other international bodies, including the World Health Organization when it knows that in May, 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified radiation from all wireless devices in the same category as lead and DDT. This classification means IT IS NOT SAFE. I cannot paint my home with paint that has lead or spray my yard with DDT, but my grandchildren are being subjected to wireless radiation without their parents’ being informed or giving their approval. This appears to be blatant misrepresentation of the facts.
Health Canada has ignored the HESA recommendations since 2010, and unless drastic measures are taken they will continue to ignore them. I and many thousands of Canadians are outraged by this lack of due diligence on behalf of Health Canada and ask that they be held accountable for their willful blindness.
Sincerely,
Sharon Noble

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity – an increasing challenge to the medical profession
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26372109
In population-based surveys, the prevalence of EHS has ranged from 1.5% in Sweden to 13.3% in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: It seems necessary to give an International Classification of Diseases to EHS to get it accepted as EMF-related health problems. The increasing exposure to RF-EMF in schools is of great concern and needs better attention. Longer-term health effects are unknown. Parents, teachers, and school boards have the responsibility to protect children from unnecessary exposure.

Children are More Vulnerable to Wireless Radiation
http://www.parentsforsafetechnology.org/why-children-are-more-vulnerable.html
Children are more vulnerable to the damage wireless can cause. Here’s why… Children have smaller heads, thinner skulls, rapidly developing brains, a higher amount of water in their brains and bodies and have more active stem cells. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the average radio frequency radiation energy deposition for children exposed to mobile phone RF is two times higher in the brain and 10 times higher in the bone marrow of the skull, compared with mobile phone use by adults.

EMFs: sense and sensitivity
https://www.wddty.com/magazine/2016/may/emfs-sense-and-sensitivity.html
Health agencies are in denial over the existence of EHS-electromagnetic hypersensitivity-and especially that EMFs from PCs, mobile phones, Wi-Fi and power lines could be to blame. … Estimates vary for the number of people affected by EHS. Researchers have reckoned that anything from 1 to 8 per cent of a population may be so sensitive that they can’t function properly, while many more could have symptoms, such as insomnia or occasional memory lapses, but never associate them with ‘electrosmog’, as it’s called. With this build-up of evidence and recognition of EHS by some governments, one group of scientists now wants every major country to accept the dangers of EMFs and limit the exposure of people-and especially children. … Dr Mallery-Blythe describes the rise of EMFs as “the largest change to the earth’s electromagnetic environment that has ever taken place in human history”. Unless we act, she echoes the fears of experts who predict that this could become “the greatest public health disaster in planetary history”.

Children rap Wi-Fi – 594,309 cell towers blast neighborhoods – wireless burglar alarms are dangerous
https://elettrosensibili.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/children-rap-wi-fi594309-cell-towers-blast-neighborhoodswireless-burglar-alarms-are-dangerous/
(Students, among the biggest victims of excess Wi-Fi radiation, are starting to speak up. Kill Zone USA notes there are now 594,309 cell towers emitting pulsed radiation. Wireless burglar alarms are a no-no. A high school student asked the Montgomery County Board Feb. 9 how it could allow virtually every classroom to have Wi-Fi connected computers at each desk “turning the school into a giant microwave” when the wired option makes this “simply unnecessary. I feel extremely uncomfortable going to school every day, supposedly a safe haven, and seeing my friends sitting directly under the transmitters,” she said. “Renowned scientists all over the world have shown the possible side effects of radiation including brain cancer, tumors, blood/brain barrier deterioration and other effects,” she added. “It is a violation of the rights of students and teachers,” she said.)
The Elephant in the Classroom
http://haltmasmartmeters.org/the-elephant-in-the-classroom/
I am intimately familiar with this issue – and the retaliation that goes along with speaking out about it – as my own two children were irreparably harmed after industrial strength wireless networks were installed in their public charter and public district schools here in Rhode Island. These installations were accomplished without parental notification about the class 2b carcinogen (electromagnetic radiation) being emitted by the WiFi access points and other wireless devices (laptops, SmartBoards, etc.). Parents were never given the facts about these installations, and as a result it took a long time to make the connection between the progression of my children’s symptoms and the radiation being emitted by the wireless devices in their schools. Unfortunately by the time the pieces of the puzzle fit together, the damage was already done and my kids had developed what I’ve been told will be a lifelong, permanent and disabling sensitivity. (…) This denial on the part of school and state officials is happening all over the country as children and teachers continue to report they are getting sick from WiFi.

– We have never tested microwave radiating devices directly in front of the young developing eye. The absence of proof of harm at this point does not mean that we have evidence of safety. We want to know why is Google encouraging young children to employ a technology that has never been tested for their use when Samsung has a similar system that explicitly advises that no child under the age of 13 should be using it. (…) Several scientific investigations have shown that cataracts among humans and laboratory animals occur as a result of eye exposure to microwave/radiofrequency radiation. The eyes are highly vulnerable to radiation damage because they contain few blood vessels and have no way to cool off.)

“Difficult to believe that when industry has grown from 70 million to 5 billion users in 20 years, data from 0% to 90+%, smart phones from 0 to 60+% , children usage from 0% to about 100%… we still have the same regulation… thinking that the phone is on the ear at a 15 mm distance from the skull, and communication is seen as occasional once in a week voice call from grand-mom when the reality is that youngsters are participating in dozens of whats up groups, receiving data 24/7, and keeping phone under their pillow.”
