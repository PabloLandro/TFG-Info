Salt Lamp Savvy
March 7, 2018 March 9, 2018 maiaeden
Ever seen one of these before? These cool, glowy rock-looking lamps started popping on my feed all over the place last year. At first I thought they were just an ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù trend, but once my sister got one of these ‚ÄúHimalayan salt lamps‚Äù for Christmas this past year, I noticed that there might be more to these than meets the eye.

Himalayan salt lamps are more than just pretty room decorations. In fact, their name really says literally what they are: big hunks of Himalayan salt carved into lamps for your bedroom. I didn‚Äôt even know they were made of real salt until I‚Ä¶found out‚Ä¶how salty they were (don‚Äôt question my methods!!).
My curiosity piqued after discovering the saltiness (again, don‚Äôt question my methods‚Ä¶), I did a bit of research on these salty decorations and figured I‚Äôd share what I found out with you!

Himalayan salt lamps are made of ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì salt. What you might not have guessed are all of the health benefits that come along with it. Salt is antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, removes pathogens and even reduces immune system oversensitivity. It‚Äôs also great for easier breathing as it loosens mucus to clear up your sinuses‚Ä¶gross, but hey, whatever works. üòõ Apparently, Himalayan salt is even used in some inhalers for asthma relief!

One of the biggest benefits these lamps are known for is air purification, and is one of the top reasons that they‚Äôre bought in the first place. Salt naturally attracts water vapor in the air, and water vapor will often bring pollutants (think mold and bacteria) along with it. However, when the water vapor makes contact with the heated lamp, the salt traps the pollutants while releasing the water vapor back into the air. As long as the lamp is turned on and stays warm, this cycle will continue.

Some more benefits of salt lamps:
neutralize electromagnetic radiation that come from TV systems, computers, appliances, etc. (do I sound smart yet?)
boost mood and improve sleep from the calming orange glow
eases asthma and other allergy symptoms
environmentally friendly light source from natural elements and typically use low wattage or are even lit with a candle

Personally, I just think that these lamps are really pretty and taste really sa‚Äì uh, I mean, they‚Äôre just great all around. Isn‚Äôt it neat to think that a magical-looking lamp is actually really healthy? If you want to pick one up for yourself, here is the top rated (over 10,000 reviews!) Amazon‚Äôs choice Himalayan salt lamp at $18.70 (if you want to do a little more shopping around, there are a lot of other lamps at lower prices too!).
Do you own a Himalayan salt lamp? What kind do you have or like the best? Have you noticed any benefits or do you know of some more that I missed? Be sure to let me know by leaving a comment! ‚ù§
