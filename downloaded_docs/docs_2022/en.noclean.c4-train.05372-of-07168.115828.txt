[post_content] => Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the superficial skin layer and soft tissues. It is mostly caused by bacteria, but other pathogens can be responsible. Most people get cellulitis-causing bacteria through open wounds, burns, abrasions and other forms of skin injuries.
Early cellulitis symptoms appear on the skin. They include redness and swelling. Without treatment, symptoms of systematic illness usually occur. While the condition mostly occurs in the lower legs, face and arms, the breasts, stomach, back, buttocks and umbilical cord can also be affected. See what is cellulitis and what is facial cellulitis for comparison.
Patients will in most cases recover fully without complications if timely treatment is done. Without treatment, cellulitis can spread very rapidly and prove dangerous. Infection may for example spread to the lungs, blood or brain.
Cellulitis on breast causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the breast develops on the skin. Unlike most cellulitis cases, it mostly occurs as a complication of breast cancer treatments. This makes its particularly dangerous since cancer patients often have weakened immunity. Infection can also result from breast surgery.
Cellulitis occurs when bacteria reaches soft tissues of the skin. While infection develops deeper in the skin, symptoms also involve upper layers. Bacteria enter through skin injuries such as cuts and open wounds. It is also not uncommon for cellulitis to be caused by an insect bite or sting.
[RELATED]
During breast cancer treatment, it may require that several lymph nodes be removed if malignancy has spread. Lymph nodes play a crucial part in fighting infections. Their removal predisposes a patient to bacterial infections among other conditions. It is for this reason that breast cancer patients often develop cellulitis during treatment.
Bacteria can also be introduced into breast skin during surgeries to enlarge, repair or reduce breasts. It is only in rare cases that skin injuries will be responsible for breast cellulitis.
Symptoms
First symptoms show up shortly after contracting infection. Most of them are confined to skin areas surrounding a recent injury. They include:
Swelling
Redness
Pain
Warmth
Tenderness
Rash
Tightening
Hardening
Not long afterwards, other signs may appear, depending on treatment measures put in place. They include:
Red streaking
Oozing clear fluid or pus
Fever
Chills
Sudden drop in blood pressure
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Swollen lymph nodes
Darkening or red spots on swollen areas
These symptoms are signs that infection is spreading. Treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Otherwise, patients can go to shock or even succumb to complications of cellulitis, including orbital cellulitis symptoms. Note that redness, pain and swelling can also be signs of inflammatory breast cancer. It is therefore better to get medical diagnosis the moment you notice sudden changes in your breast.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is done by analyzing symptoms and patient’s medical history. If necessary, a doctor will order other tests such as blood tests and imaging tests.
Treatment is primarily done with antibiotics. Most cellulitis symptoms will have improved in 2 days. However, medications are usually prescribed for up to 10 days. This is to completely get rid of infections. Medications should be taken according to doctor’s guides even after symptoms have disappeared.
[RELATED]
Cellulitis on the breast can be prevented by keeping wounds clean, dry and bandaged. When planning for breast surgery, discuss with your doctor if you can be treated as an outpatient. This is advisable because the chances of getting infected in a hospital are higher.
Cellulitis on stomach causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the stomach occurs externally, that is, on the skin rather than in the stomach. It is a bacterial infection common in recently injured skin areas.
Causes
It is not common but it is possible to have a deep skin injury or a persistent one on the stomach. Such an injury could be accidental or a result of surgery. Sometimes, staphylococcus bacteria or other bacteria types may invade soft tissues through such injuries and cause cellulitis infection. Skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis are considered risk factors, much like athlete’s foot is a risk factor for cellulitis ankle infection.
Symptoms
Symptoms of cellulitis on the stomach mostly show up around the affected area at first. Surrounding skin swells and becomes red. Unlike a physical injury or a bruise, neither the redness nor the swelling improves with time. Shortly afterwards, affected areas will feel hot and tender. This is caused by increased level of activities in the skin as bacteria divide and immune cells fight them off. Pus is usually the end product of these activities. An abscess may form as the produced pus collects in a pocket-like cavity.
Bacteria do not stop at quickly dividing. Some release toxic substances that kill surrounding fat tissue. These are known as "flesh eating bacteria." They are the cause of skin darkening that may be noticed on severely infected areas. Other bacteria break free into circulatory system. There, they release toxins that cause wide spread blood poisoning. Severe blood poisoning can send patients to shock or cause systematic organ failure.
Symptoms that may be felt throughout above described process include:
Fever
Chills
Diarrhea
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Headaches
Confusion
Rise of body temperature
Difficulty breathing
Diagnosis and treatment
Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask for your medical history. To confirm diagnosis, blood test, fluid cultures and pictures with imaging tests may be taken.
Treatment is done with antibiotics. Most patients will be treated as outpatients. Medications are usually taken for 7-10 days. Check with your doctor if symptoms do not improve about 48 hours after the first dosage. Some cellulitis infections require IV antibiotics.
Cellulitis on back causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the back is not as common as on the lower legs or face. However, it can be hard to diagnose at home.
Causes
Both staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are common causes of cellulitis on the back. Staph infection mostly occurs around a wound or an abscess. Strep infection often develops as an extension of another infection. This is because streptococcus bacteria spread more quickly. A good example is periorbital cellulitis which is mostly caused by strep bacteria spreading from the sinuses. See what is periorbital cellulitis for details.  Sometimes, cellulitis on the back can result from an insect or animal bite.
Symptoms
Symptoms will first appear on a localized area of the skin. Without treatment, systematic symptoms will follow.
It starts with redness and swelling. Pain may be felt when the swollen areas are poked. Like most bacterial infections, affected area may feel hot and become tender. This may be accompanied by hardening and tightening. On close inspection, mild orange peeling and small blisters filled with fluid may be noticed.
Systematic symptoms start mildly but soon become severe. Fever and chills are most common. Patients may also feel generally tired, have rapid pulse rate and lose appetite. Severe symptoms such as due to blood poisoning include shock and sudden drop in blood pressure. As infection spreads to nearby lymph bodes, the nodes and lymphatic vessels will swell.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is done by analyzing symptoms and patient’s medical history. To rule out other conditions, the doctor may order a blood test or take a fluid culture.
Antibiotics are used for treatment. In most cases, oral medicines will completely get rid of the infection. This usually takes 7-10 days. Sometimes, cellulitis is caused by resistant bacteria that don’t respond to commonly used antibiotics. Patients should therefore check with their doctors if symptoms don’t improve after 2 days. IV antibiotics will be given in that case. This requires that patients be treated as inpatients for up to 3 days.
[RELATED]
At home, recovery can be sped up with topical medications and home treatments such as warm compress and tea tree oil. Home remedies are better suited in treatment for cellulitis in the leg.
Umbilical cellulitis infection causes, symptoms and treatments
Umbilical cellulitis results from an infection known as omphalitis. The infection develops on the umbilical stump. It is most common in babies and in underdeveloped areas or countries.
Causes
Staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are responsible for up to 80% of all cases. In most babies, the umbilical stump heals without complications. Bacteria picked up during delivery or when the cord is cut sometimes end up causing infection. Risk factors include:
Maternal infections
Children born with low weight
Separation of umbilical cord before or during delivery
Complicated deliveries
Symptoms
At first, typical symptoms of superficial cellulitis will develop. They include redness, swelling, tenderness and warmth. Infection may soon spread to the abdominal wall and later to rest of the body. This will result in signs of systematic illness such as fever and chills. Since immune cells in babies are yet to gain experience in fighting bacterial infections, necrotic fasciitis may occur. This is where fat tissues are destroyed by toxins produced by bacteria.
Treatment and prognosis
In babies, antibiotics are usually given intravenously. This requires hospitalization. Surgery may be done to cut out dead tissue.
Prognosis is good for umbilical cellulitis which has not spread to the abdominal wall or caused necrotic fasciitis. More than 80% of affected babies will recover fully.
Cellulitis on buttocks causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the buttocks is not uncommon. It can be a very painful infection and make sitting particularly difficult.
Causes
Bacteria are the usual causes of cellulitis on buttocks. Normally, bacteria are found throughout the skin where they rarely cause any trouble. Problems set in when an injury on skin allows the bacteria to reach soft tissues. Warm, moist and nutritious conditions in soft tissues allow for rapid bacterial growth and spread. This leads to infection, referred to as cellulitis.
Sometimes, you can get cellulitis from an insect or bug bite. One can also get cellulitis after surgery. People with weakened immune systems are more likely to contract bacterial infections.
Symptoms
Early symptoms are superficial and localized. They begin with the affected area becoming red, swollen, tender and hot. If not treated, mild orange peeling and small fluid blisters may appear. Bacteria usually spread quickly. This results in systematic symptoms such as fever, chills, loss of appetite and headaches. Red streaks and dark marks on the swollen area may form.
[RELATED]
Infection can gradually spread to cause perineal cellulitis. This is especially if strep bacteria are the cause. Strep bacteria make tissues unable to control the spread of infections.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis may be done by:
Physical exam – here, the doctor looks for typical signs of cellulitis. The patient’s medical history will be required.
Cultures – fluid or mass culture may be taken to help identify the nature of pathogen causing the infection.
Blood test – with a blood test, a doctor can document the number of white blood cells in blood. Blood tests may also be used to identify the type of bacteria being dealt with.
Imaging tests – pictures taken with x-rays, MRIs and CT scans are not always important but may be needed. They are more common before cellulitis eye treatment.
Treatment
Oral antibiotics are the primary medications of choice. For severe infections, IV antibiotics are given. Check with your doctor if the medicines don’t work for the first 2 days.
Severe infections sometimes require surgery to get rid of dead tissue. Dead tissue is caused by "flesh eating bacteria" and appears in form of dark areas on the swollen parts.

[post_content] => We are used to cellulitis developing around big wounds, deep cuts and persistent ulcers. As it happens, the condition can also result after an insect/bug sting or bite. Insect and bugs are in fact common in the etiology of cellulitis.
Cellulitis is a bacterial infection that involves the soft tissues and superficial skin. It is potentially dangerous, since without treatment complications such as sepsis, meningitis and blood poisoning may occur. A majority of cases are caused by staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria.
Early cellulitis symptoms show up on the skin shortly after catching the infection. They include redness, swelling, tenderness and warmth. If not treated, systematic symptoms such as fever, chills, general weakness and swollen lymph nodes may occur.
Cellulitis from bug bite symptoms and treatment
Bugs have to reach blood vessels to feed. The only way they can achieve this is by biting through the upper skin layers till blood vessels are reached. The epidermis is, however, quite tough. Bugs have to therefore produce some substances, carried in their saliva, that make the skin soft.
[RELATED]
Bug’s saliva in the skin is seen as an invading pathogen by immune cells. The first counter action taken by the immune system is to trigger inflammation around the bitten area. This is why bug bites are usually itchy. Scratching makes it worse.
Severe or repeated bug bites may cause a person to scratch until ulceration develops. Bacteria hiding under nail beds and on skin may soon reach soft tissues through the recently created portal of entry. Soft tissues provide most of what is needed for bacteria to divide. It is warm, nutritious and moist under the epidermis.  Bacteria will therefore start dividing and spreading to adjacent areas. This results in cellulitis.
Bugs that live on human skin are more likely to cause cellulitis. This is especially if they burrow into the skin. Scabies mites are a good example. Jiggers can also cause cellulitis big toe infection especially after surgery to remove them.
Symptoms and treatment
Cellulitis from a bug bite develops some time after a vexing itchiness and intolerable need to scratch. There may be signs of skin damage.
First symptoms appear around the itchy area. It will become red and swell. There usually are no clear margins to where redness or swelling extends. Due to increased activities by bacteria and the immune system, the affected area will feel hot and tender. Soon, patients may develop fever, chills and headaches.
Treatment is done with antibiotics such as Cephalexin for cellulitis. These are drugs that keep bacteria from growing and replicating. Depending on the severity of infection, your doctor will prescribe the best antibiotic type and dosage.
Itchiness and pain can be eased with topical medications.
Cellulitis from bee sting and its risks
Bees are adorable for a number of reasons but to be feared for the reason that they can send an intruder to their grave in a matter of minutes. The venom introduced by bee stings makes more water than necessary flow into body cells. When this occurs on a large scale such as after being attacked by a swarm, many cells in the body will explode, which will quickly prove fatal.
But that is not how cellulitis from a bee sting occurs. It is caused by an infected bee sting. Experts are still not certain as to how infected bee stings cause cellulitis. It is thought that bacteria carried in stingers reach soft tissues as the stinger continues to burrow into the skin after being introduced by a bee.
[RELATED]
Symptoms of cellulitis from a bee sting appear a few days after being stung. By then, the initial swelling and redness caused by the sting will probably have disappeared. The symptoms include:
Redness
Swelling
Tenderness
Warmth
Chills
Fever
Seek medical attention if such symptoms show up several days after being stung by a bee. Since cases of infected bee stings are few, there isn't much data to predict exactly how it will unfold.
Some people react violently to bee stings and may have signs mimicking those of an infection. See a doctor for diagnosis in such a case.
Bee stings can be treated with antihistamines. If antihistamines are able to improve the condition, infection can be ruled out. Stronger anti-inflammatory drugs and NSAIDs can be used to treat severe reactions to bee stings.
Infection caused by a bee sting is treated depending on the type of pathogen causing it. Your doctor will run some tests before treatment. Generally, antibiotics such as clindamycin for facial cellulitis treatment are used.
Infected insect bite cellulitis symptoms and treatment
Insects bite to feed or as a defense mechanism. In most cases, a swollen lump and skin redness will result. You most likely will also feel pain and itchiness. These symptoms usually improve in a matter of hours or few days.
In case of infected insect bite cellulitis, initial signs of infection will appear a few days after being bitten. The area around where you were bitten will become red and swell. A mild orange peel appearance may be noticed when the affected area is pressed, such as between two fingers. Unlike normal insect bites, these symptoms will not improve with time. The affected area will soon feel hot and become tender. Overnight, fever and chills accompanied by signs of systematic illness will develop. By then, the infection has matured and become dangerous. Medical attention is necessary.
Treatment is done according to the type of pathogen causing infection. Several tests will be run to determine the nature of pathogen making you ill. This is very important in regards to finding an effective cellulitis cure. After that, antibiotics will be given. It is not uncommon for insects or small bugs to cause swelling and redness around eyes. The problem is that the insect may be hidden under the swelling, thus delaying orbital cellulitis recovery time.
Cellulitis from spider bite symptoms and pictures
Spiders do not feed on human blood. They therefore don’t have to bite for survival like in case of bed bugs. Regardless, spider bites are very common. Mild ones can be treated with topical agents such as calamine lotion. But when cellulitis from a spider bite develops, medical attention is necessary.
[RELATED]
Spiders produce strong bites which break the skin. Victims also feel the urgent need to keep scratching, something that does little to help. Cellulitis causing bacteria can be introduced during the scratching process especially if ulceration has resulted.
Spider bites present with white, red or blue signs. Most improve gradually with medical or proper home treatment. If infected, signs of infection will show up a few days after the bite. They will present as typical signs of cellulitis. These include:
Redness
Swelling
Fever
Chills
Lethargy
Headache
Confusion
Nausea
Vomiting
Loss of appetite
Swollen lymph nodes
It is also common for bacterial infections to present with red streaking around the affected areas. The streaks are signs of inflamed lymphatic vessels. Damaged lymphatic vessels may lead to lymphedema, a main risk factor for chronic cellulitis.
Treatment is primarily done with antibiotics. A couple of tests may be required to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection.
Cellulitis from mosquito bite infection
Only female mosquitoes bite. When they do, mild inflammation and redness usually occur, and disappears shortly after. Naturally, humans emit heat and produce carbon dioxide. It is these two features that mosquitoes use to trace where you are, even in darkness. The sole purpose of a mosquito bite is to enable the insect to suck blood from a person’s blood vessels. It therefore chooses body areas with blood vessels closer to the surface. To make the tough outer skin layer soft enough for a bite, a mosquito uses its saliva, which also numbs the victim. It is the saliva that causes all the need to scratch, inflammation and redness that usually result as immune cells fight off the foreign substance from the body.
Mosquitoes are known to transmit a number of diseases. What happens is that pathogens responsible for the diseases are carried by the mosquito. They gain access into the body once the insect introduces its saliva into the skin. Mosquito bites can also be so itchy that skin damage occurs in the attempt to ease the itch through scratching. Skin damage is a main risk factor for cellulitis.
Symptoms of cellulitis from a mosquito bite present as those of cellulitis caused by skin injuries or cellulitis eye symptoms. They often show up several days after an infected mosquito bite.
[RELATED]
Note that mosquitoes can also transmit diseases like malaria and Zika virus. The main difference is that before systematic symptoms of cellulitis like fever occur, there will be a localized infection somewhere in the skin.
Treatment is done with antibiotics. Most bacteria transmitted by insects are anaerobic. They can be controlled with most antibiotics we have today.
When to see a doctor
Insect and bug bites or stings are almost inevitable. Although measures can be taken to reduce incidence rate, they will always be part of daily normal life. See a doctor if typical symptoms of cellulitis show up a few days after an insect sting or bug bite.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection. It develops beneath but may involve superficial skin. The legs, arms and face are commonly affected. In cold seasons or weather, children are more likely to develop cellulitis.
Early signs include redness and swelling in a localized area. Although cellulitis is not contagious, it rapidly spreads to adjacent areas and sometimes to distant organs. It is for this reason that periorbital cellulitis and orbital cellulitis symptoms are more common in children recently diagnosed with a sinus infection. Without treatment, sign of systematic illness such as fever, chills and swollen lymph nodes may develop.
Cellulitis in children causes, risk factors, symptoms and treatment
Causes
Children easily pick up injuries when playing. Since the whole idea of keeping wounds clean has not yet made full sense to them, bacteria may be picked from different places. This is one of the two main processes that cellulitis in children follows. Staphylococcus bacteria is usually introduced this way.
[RELATED]
Infections in the upper respiratory tract and ears can also act as a source of cellulitis bacteria. This is mostly seen in case of pneumonia and H influenzae type B bacteria. As bacteria seek to expand their colonies, they invade adjacent healthy tissues. It is through this process that eye cellulitis in kids occurs. In fact, periorbital cellulitis in adults may develop in the same fashion.
Symptoms
Symptoms begin not long after picking up the cellulitis bacteria. At first, they are confined to the affected area but soon become systematic.
The first signs to show up are redness and swelling. There usually is no defined border to where the affected area reaches. As bacteria divide and immune cells fight them off, the area feels hot and tender. There also may be a mild "orange peel" appearance.
Systematic symptoms may develop overnight. The child will develop fever, chills and probably lose appetite. They may experience increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, abnormal sweating, confusion, irritability, vomiting and swollen lymph nodes.
Treatment
Treatment is very necessary even before it comes to fever and chills. Oral antibiotics such as Keflex for cellulitis are usually prescribed although the doctor may go with hospitalization and IV antibiotics. At home care measures to keep wounds clean and to take care of the skin will greatly help. Early treatment for infections in the upper respiratory tract, ear and mouth is also important for prevention.
Prevention
Below are prevention measures that may help with cellulitis in children:
Warn your child against sharing personal items
Encourage them to regularly wash their hands
Use clean bandages to cover injured areas
Treat insect bites and bug bites with topical agents such as calamine lotion
Apply moisturizers on your child’s skin daily
See your doctor if suspicious signs of cellulitis develop
Cellulitis in babies causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention
Causes
Cellulitis in babies is mostly caused by discontinuities and injuries on the skin. These are really risk factors rather than causes however. Bacteria are the main culprits behind cellulitis in babies. Only rarely will viruses or fungi be responsible. Skin injuries only act as portals of entry through which bacteria reach soft tissues. It is in soft tissues that bacteria build their colonies and start spreading.
Risk factors
Cuts
Burns
Sores
Dry, scaly or dry skin such as caused by eczema
Chicken pox or shingles
Bug bites
Insect stings
Dog/cat scratch
Other infections, including styes, cellulitis throat infection and pneumonia
Cellulitis can also develop after surgery. This is especially when the surgery is done in a hospital. Babies with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop severe and frequent infections.
[RELATED]
Symptoms
Symptoms begin on the skin around a recent injury. Redness, swelling and warmth are usually the first to show up. To the touch, the swollen area will feel tender and sometimes hardened or tightened. Other symptoms may include:
Fever
Chills
Loss of appetite
Pain
Blurred vision
Runny nose
Vomiting
Confusion
Treatment
Early cellulitis in babies can be easily treated in a pediatric center. This is done with antibiotics. See what is the best antibiotic for cellulitis for details. Once symptoms include fever or affected vision, hospitalization and treatment with IV antibiotics may be necessary. The doctor will run a couple of tests to determine the severity of the infection. In most cases, babies are able to recover without complications.
Prevention
The following prevention measures may help prevent cellulitis in babies:
Keeping wounds clean, dry and covered
Using moisturizers and other skin care products to prevent skin damage
Washing your hands with antibacterial soap before handling injured skin area of your baby
Treating or getting vaccinated against diseases like pneumonia
Reporting suspicious signs of infection to your doctor
Cellulitis in infants causes, symptoms and treatments
Infants are particularly susceptible to cellulitis. This is owing to their yet to fully develop immune system. Harmful bacteria are something you may not want to see around an infant. Funny enough, they play an important role in the development of immune system. Once an infant is out of its mother’s womb, it comes into contact with millions of bacteria. Some will be in the birth canal, in clothing, on the mother’s hands and in the milk, and so on. This systematic introduction to pathogens works almost similarly to vaccines. It tells immune cells what is out there. This is why vaginal delivery is preferred to Caesarian section when conditions allow.
A form of cellulitis that sometimes develops in infants is known as omphalitis of a  newborn, or umbilical cellulitis. Soon after delivery, the umbilical cord is cut to separate the baby from its mother. A small chunk called a stump which is attached to the abdominal wall is left behind. Normally, it falls off within three to fifty days. This can be encouraged by allowing air to circulate around it. Bacteria sometimes grows in the stump and ends up causing infection. This form of cellulitis in infants is particularly dangerous. It can for example cause sepsis, since the young immune system of the infant is yet to learn how infections are fought. Treatment should be sought before infection reaches the abdominal wall.

First signs present as those of typical cellulitis. There will be redness and swelling. The stump may feel hot and become tender. Other symptoms may include:
Pus
Rapid heart rate
Fever
Skin yellowing
Low blood pressure
Pain
Treatment is usually done with IV antibiotics. This requires hospitalization. Serious cases require surgery to remove dead tissue caused by necrotizing fasciitis. Prognosis is poorer for infants requiring surgery as part of treatment.
Complications of cellulitis in children and babies
A localized cellulitis infection is not deadly. Problems set in once the infection spreads and becomes more mature. This leads to what are known as complications of cellulitis. They include:
Sepsis – sepsis is when chemicals sent to fight infection trigger systematic inflammation in the body. This creates a medical emergency, which if not addressed, patients can go to septic shock or die. Early symptoms include trouble breathing and drop in blood pressure.
Meningitis – meningitis is inflammation of tissues surrounding spinal cord and brain. It develops when infection reaches these organs. Meningitis can kill its victims in a matter of minutes. Signs include headache, confusion and seizure.
Lymphangitis – this is inflammation of lymphatic vessels and nodes. It is occurs when bacteria invade the lymphatic system. If not treated, it can lead to obstruction or damage to lymphatic system. This can lead to weakened immune system and lymphedema.
Gangrene – this is a where some tissue or organ is not getting any or enough blood supply. It is mostly seen in scrotal cellulitis in adults. Early signs include skin paleness and loss of sensation. Blood supply is cut by a pocket of fluid that results from a nearby cellulitis infection. This complication should be addressed immediately. Surgery or drainage with needle and syringe can be used for treatment.
There are other possible complications such as loss of vision, abscess and necrotizing fasciitis.
When to see a doctor
For some reason, your child may decide to not inform you of a wound big enough to cause infection or something like that. It therefore is important for parents to do some spying and be on the lookout for any changes in their kid’s health status. See your doctor immediately after you notice signs of cellulitis.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection that involves soft tissues and superficial skin. In a detailed cellulitis definition, it will be mentioned that the epidermis keeps bacteria from being spread around, rendering cellulitis not contagious. Most cellulitis infections develop around a recently injured area. On the face and eyes, infection can spread from sinuses or ears. See facial cellulitis pictures. Rarely will a primary infection manifest distant metastasis such as in the case of pneumonia causing scrotal cellulitis. One can also get cellulitis from mosquito bite, a cat scratch, or a dog bite.
Early signs show up on the skin. They include redness, warmth, swelling and tenderness. If not treated, systematic symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea and swollen lymph nodes soon occur. It is after this that cellulitis is considered dangerous. This is because spreading infection can cause complications such as blood poisoning, sepsis and meningitis. Scalp cellulitis causes permanent hair loss due to destruction of hair follicles.
[RELATED]
Treatment is primarily done with antibiotics. Most antibiotics are effective on a wide range of bacteria types. When they are not, tests may be needed to determine the particular strain of bacteria causing infection. Specific antibiotics will then be given. Below is a review of several commonly prescribed medicines for cellulitis.
Augmentin for cellulitis; use, dosage and side effects
What is augmentin?
Augmentin is an antibiotic. It is derived by combining two different medicines:
Amoxicillin – this is a penicillin-derived antibiotic that works by killing bacteria. Sometimes, it is used on its own to treat cellulitis.
Clavulanate potassium – this compound binds with specific proteins in bacteria. The inhibition process keeps bacteria from developing resistance to amoxicillin.
Use
Augmentin is commonly used to treat sinus infections, pneumonia, urinary tract and ear infections. It is available in the form of tablets which can be swallowed with water or chewed. It can also be taken in the form of liquid medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are pregnant or using hormone-based birth control pills. The medicine should not be taken by people with allergies to penicillin or who have been diagnosed with liver and kidney diseases.
Dosage
Augmentin for cellulitis is often prescribed in dosage measurement of 875mg, to be taken once per day. When using its liquid form, use a measuring device such as a medicine spoon or cup. Such a device usually comes with the medicine. If not, ask the pharmacist for one. Liquid medicine is to be shaken well before use.
The best way to take augmentin is with full meals and with probiotics. This helps prevent side effects such as diarrhea and nausea.
Your doctor may give different instructions as to how augmentin is to be taken. Make sure to follow the instructions. All medication for cellulitis should be finished even after symptoms have disappeared. Failure to finish medicines may encourage recurrent cellulitis.
Side effects
People allergic to penicillin should avoid this medication. It can result in hives, rash, and swelling in the tongue, face or throat.
Users usually report mild gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and nausea. There also may be itchiness in the vagina. If you have severe, bloody and watery diarrhea, call your doctor. Other side effects that require medical attention include:
Reduced urine output
Skin paleness or yellowness
Pain in upper abdomen accompanied by skin yellowness and loss of appetite
Blisters
Cephalexin for cellulitis; use, dosage and side effects
What is cephalexin?
Cephalexin goes by the brand name Keflex. It is an antibiotic that disrupts cell wall growth in bacteria. The drug is commonly used to treat infections in upper respiratory tract, ear, sinuses and skin. Generic versions are also available which are a bit less expensive.
Use
Oral capsules, which is the form that cephalexin mainly comes in, are to best swallowed with a glass of water. This also goes for oral tablets. If using suspension liquid form, use a measuring device to get the dosage measurement right.
Cephalexin for cellulitis can be taken with or without food. Heavy meals, however, reduce the amount of medicine absorbed into the body.
[RELATED]
Dosage
Cephalexin for cellulitis in adolescents and adults is prescribed at 1-4g to be taken daily but in divided doses. For example, 250mg can be taken after every 6 hours. The dosage measurement can be doubled and taken after every 12 hours.
In children, the recommended dosage is 25mg to 50mg per kg taken on daily basis. Infants are usually treated with IV antibiotics. This should be done by a doctor. In older people and those with liver or kidney diseases, a lower dosage prescribed by a doctor is to be used.
Side effects
Don’t take cephalexin if you are allergic to medicines such as Duricef, Vantin, and Ceftin. A better approach is to inform your doctor if you ever had an allergic reaction to a certain medicine. Signs of allergy include hives, rash and swelling in throat, tongue and face.
Common side effects of cephalexin include:
Nausea
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Loss of appetite
Headache
These side effects should be tolerable and with no need for pain medications. Severe side effects that require medical attention include:
Trouble breathing or swallowing
Swelling in face or throat
Bloody diarrhea
Reduced urine output
Confusion
Skin yellowing
Amoxicillin for cellulitis; use, dosage and side effects
What is amoxicillin?
Amoxicillin belongs with other antibiotics known as penicillins. It works by preventing bacteria from growing. Its brand name is Amoxil.
Use
Amoxicillin is used to treat infections in stomach, sinuses, urinary tract, skin, ears and lungs. Particularly, it effectively treats group A strep infections and group B, C, G staph infections. The drug is also regularly being used to treat mild MRSA infections.
Patients should inform their doctors if they have been diagnosed with the following conditions:
Liver disease
Kidney disease
Asthma
Mononucleosis
Pregnant women should also inform their doctors about their condition prior to taking amoxicillin. If you are allergic to penicillin, don’t take amoxicillin. It can lead to severe allergic reactions. Signs of allergic reaction include:
Hives
Severe changes on skin
Swelling in tongue, throat and face
Hives
Rash
Patients are required to take all medication as prescribed by doctor. In most cases, symptoms of cellulitis disappear before the medication course is completed. It is not safe to stop taking medicine for cellulitis once symptoms have improved. It can lead to bacterial resistance or cellulitis recurrence.
Dosage
Dosage measurement depends on the age of patients. In adults, 250-500mg dosage to be taken thrice a day is usually recommended. 500-875mg taken twice a day is another alternative.
[RELATED]
In babies, recommended dosage is 25mg/kg per day. This can be increased to 50mg/kg per day for children over 12 months old.
Side effects
Some side effects are reported in a majority of users. These are tolerable and don’t require pain medications or medical attention. They include:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Stomach upset
Vomiting
Yeast infection
Serious side effects that require immediate medical attention include:
Seizure
Hives
Rash
Lethargy
Yellowness in eyes and skin
Bloody diarrhea
Difficulty swallowing or breathing
Swelling in face or throat
Pain in upper abdomen
Cipro for cellulitis; use, dosage and side effects
What is Cipro?
Cipro is ciprofloxacin, in full. It is an antibiotic that stops bacteria from replicating. The drug is often used to treat infections in urinary tract, respiratory tract, prostate gland, testicles, skin and bones. Other uses include preventing meningitis and anthrax, curing gonorrhea and abdominal infections.
Use
Ciprofloxacin is able to control gram-negative bacteria. These are bacteria that are harder to get rid of. Doctors prescribe ciprofloxacin after medical diagnosis.
This medicine can be taken in form of oral tablets or oral liquid. Extended-release tablets are not used for cellulitis treatment.
Medicines should be used as instructed by the doctor. Most infections treated with ciprofloxacin can lead to severe complications If not fully healed. In the case of cellulitis, symptoms usually disappear within first 3 days of taking antibiotics like ciprofloxacin. Patients may therefore be tempted to stop taking their medicines. When this happens, a stronger and chronic form of cellulitis may soon develop.
Side effects
Common side effects that many users will experience include:
diarrhea
stomach upset
feeling sick
These are usually tolerable and do not call for medical attention. Severe side effects that should be addressed by a doctor include:
bloody diarrhea
severe headache
muscle and joint aches
hives
swelling in tongue, throat, or face
severe rash
agitation
yeast infection
pain in upper abdomen accompanied by skin yellowness
Other medicines for cellulitis
Many antibiotics with the ability to cure cellulitis have been developed. Most of them focus on killing bacteria responsible for infection. While some are available over the counter, the best approach is to have your doctor run some tests and prescribe the best antibiotic for you.
[RELATED]
Cellulitis home treatment may aid in faster recovery as well as in preventing recurring cellulitis. Patients should focus on keeping bacteria off a wound. This can be achieved by keeping wounds dry, clean and covered. Warm compressing, resting and elevating the affected area above the heart may also help.
Always seek medical help in the advent of cellulitis symptoms. While most start around a recently injured area, some can spread from adjacent or distant infections. Cellulitis can be identified from symptoms such as skin redness, swelling, warmth and tenderness. Pain may or may not be present. For example, orbital cellulitis symptoms include pain in eye while periorbital is not painful. See what is cellulitis of the eye for details. Systematic symptoms include fever, chills, lethargy and swollen lymph nodes. It is also common for bacterial infections to produce red streaks around the affected area.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is the term used to describe a common infection of superficial and underlying skin layers. Infection is usually acute, without involving death of fat tissue. If that happens, it is referred to as necrotizing fasciitis.
Bacteria strains are the common causes of cellulitis. But not all bacteria cause this condition. In fact, treatment sometimes depends on the bacteria strain being dealt with. Most cellulitis infections, however, respond to commonly prescribed antibiotics. See what is the best antibiotic for cellulitis for details.
Cellulitis pathophysiology and how it develops
Cellulitis pathophysiology is not very complicated. Many bacteria can be found on the skin at any given time. As they are, they rarely are problematic. This is because conditions on the skin do not favor bacterial growth and spread. For that to happen, requirements such as moisture, nutrition and warmth must be present. As it happens, the soft tissues below the epidermis provide all three requirements.
It is through injuries and discontinuities in skin that pathogens reach soft tissues. There, they rapidly divide. Soon, the body is able to detect this abnormal activity. The immediate reaction is to set off inflammation. Immune cells are sent to the affected area in large numbers. Many activities have to inevitably take place almost concurrently as bacteria divide and immune cells fight them off. As a result, the affected area swells, reddens, becomes tender and feels hot. Sometimes, immune cells are able to fight off all invading bacteria. If not, infection reaches adjacent areas and the blood. It is from then on that cellulitis is considered dangerous.
[RELATED]
It is not obvious that cellulitis will develop around a recently injured area. Insect bites/stings, animal/human bites and foreign objects such as piercing can also introduce cellulitis infection. Some patients develop cellulitis after surgery.
In some cases, infection can result from metastasis in a local infection. This is common in cellulitis ear infection where it spreads to the eye. Distant metastasis is not common, however. This is where an infection like pneumonia acts as a source of bacteria for an infection elsewhere in the body, such as cellulitis in the scrotum. The more familiar case is when infection in the upper respiratory tract causes orbital cellulitis symptoms.
Cellulitis etiology; what bacteria cause cellulitis?
What causes cellulitis infection? Many types of bacteria are identifiable in the etiology of cellulitis. In people not diagnosed with any disease or condition that may compromise their immune systems, the common cellulitis bacteria type that causes infection is streptococci group A and staphylococcus aureus.
When cellulitis develops due to complications in the lymphatic system caused by an infection, groups G, C and B streptococci are usually responsible. These bacteria enter the lymphatic system as a complication of untreated infection. There, they may damage lymphatic vessels or block lymph fluid from circulating.
The results are that lymphatic fluid accumulates in some areas of the body, mostly the lower legs, arms, head and chest. Without the lymphatic system, infections will rarely go away without medical treatment.
Children are susceptible to Haemophilus influenza type B and S pneumoniae bacteria. These are the causes of facial cellulitis common in children. Incidence rate has dropped in the recent times due to availability of vaccines. Another common infection in children is streptococcus cellulitis. This affects infants before their immune systems are strong enough to fight off bacteria, usually before age of six months. Cellulitis on stomach or umbilical cellulitis can for example develop in an infant. Medical treatment is very necessary in this case. This is because infections in infants can trigger widespread inflammation in the body, causing systematic organ failure.
Pneumonia bacteria can cause severe cellulitis, which produces widespread spread symptoms even in its initial stages. Most cases are reported in diabetic individuals where cellulitis develops in the lower legs or arms. Symptoms may also mimic those of lupus, where systematic inflammation occurs mostly in head and neck areas. This form of cellulitis is quite dangerous and spreads rapidly.
MRSA or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria type responsible for severe cellulitis, which is particularly hard to treat.
[RELATED]
Cellulitis bacteria can be picked up in hospitals such as after surgery. When this happens, crepitus or cracking sounds may originate in affected area.
There are some factors and conditions that make some people more susceptible to cellulitis infection than others.
Patients undergoing cancer treatment sometimes get several of their lymph nodes removed. This plus other treatment methods often weaken their immune systems. As a result, bacterial infections like cellulitis often develop and even become chronic. The process of immune systems being weakened by diseases is not uncommon. It is also seen in HIV, diabetes, liver disease and kidney disease patients.
Not having a strong immune system makes one susceptible to some gram negative bacteria types not commonly diagnosed in cellulitis infections. In fact, other pathogens such as fungi and viruses can cause cellulitis in such individuals. This is especially after a herpes or athlete’s foot positive diagnosis.
MRSA cellulitis infection
Most of us have used antibiotics, whether in oral, topical or intravenous forms. Not many people understand how these medications work however. It is not that everyone is supposed to know how they work. The problem is that total ignorance predisposes people to infections caused by bacteria which are very hard to treat.
Success of antibiotics is based on the fact that one antibiotic can kill a range of bacteria types. In recent days, it has been noted that some bacteria have developed mechanisms to avoid being killed with antibiotics. What this means is that we may be heading back to the era before penicillin, where a simple cut could easily leave you in the grave. A good example of a simple infection that may soon become untreatable is MRSA cellulitis.
MRSA is not new to scientists. For the last 50 years, it has been cultured and only appeared in hospitals. Patients could catch it when hospitalized but rarely in the outside world. This has drastically changed in recent years. Cases of cellulitis being caused by MRSA are on the rise.
[RELATED]
The problem with MRSA is that it doesn’t respond to commonly prescribed antibiotics. This means that infection may continue to spread and wreck havoc even after medical treatment. Even worse, cultures that may help doctors identify the bacteria often are with disappointing results. It is for this reason that patients are advised to check with their doctor should symptoms of cellulitis not improve in 48 hours after first dosage. MRSA cellulitis may require IV antibiotics. This means that patients will be hospitalized with and probably require cellulitis nursing diagnosis.
Some MRSA cellulitis infections are community-acquired. The bacteria can also be picked in hospitals such as during dialysis or surgery but especially with long-term IV medications use.
Complications of cellulitis
More than 90% of all cellulitis patients recover without complications. This is as long as treatment is done timely and in the right fashion. In view of failure with that, complications of cellulitis may occur. These include:
Abscess – an abscess is what a large boil could be. It is a pocket of pus formed deep in the skin. Abscess is a common sign of MRSA cellulitis infection. Surgery is required for treatment. Without facial cellulitis treatment, an abscess in the eye can cause total blindness.
Lymphangitis – lymphangitis is when lymphatic vessels become inflamed after they are exposed to bacteria. This is usually seen as red streaks that develop from the site of local infection towards the heart. Nearby lymph nodes may swell and become painful. If not treated, lymphangitis can lead to lymphedema and consequently symptoms of cellulitis in leg.
Osteomyelitis – osteomyelitis is the clinical term for bone infection. It occurs when infection reaches deep enough to invade bones. Pain is usually present accompanied by swelling and redness.
Sepsis – sepsis is a deadly complication of infections that can cause systematic organ failure in a matter of minutes. When bacteria release toxins into the blood, they trigger production of chemicals meant to fight the bacteria and stop blood poisoning. The chemicals can, however, trigger systematic inflammation all over the body, sending patients into septic shock if not treated immediately.
Meningitis – the reason as to why eye cellulitis is sometimes thought as contagious is because it can easily spread to the brain and spinal cord. This is not to mention the fact that most eye cellulitis cases are complications of untreated upper respiratory infections. Once bacterial infection reaches the brain and spinal cord, membranes surrounding these organs swell. What results is a series of actions that are life threatening.
Gangrene – gangrene as a complication of cellulitis is best seen in case of scrotal cellulitis. Fluid accumulates between two skin tissues, making it impossible for blood to be supplied in one of the tissues. Without blood circulating in an organ, cells and tissues die.
Necrotizing fasciitis – this is a condition caused by "flesh eating bacteria." The bacteria do not necessarily eat flesh as the name suggests. What they do is produce toxins that poison adjacent fat tissue.
Is cellulitis contagious?
Cellulitis develops in soft tissues. Above these tissues is epidermis, the uppermost layer of skin. Epidermis keeps cellulitis bacteria from being passed around during direct skin to skin contact. For this reason, cellulitis is not contagious.
[RELATED]
It should be noted that cellulitis does spread to adjacent areas and circulatory system even though not contagious. Cellulitis home treatment options such as use of topical agents, use of home remedies and keeping wounds clean may help reduce rate of spread.
MRSA has been noted to be notorious in more than one way. Some experts believe that sharing personal hygiene items can transfer the bacteria. The common manner in which MRSA becomes contagious is by being shared during IV drugs use. This is especially true in people with compromised immune systems.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a potentially dangerous common bacterial infection that develops in the tissues beneath the epidermis. Bacteria often takes advantage of skin injuries to reach soft tissues. In some cases, infection spreads from elsewhere in the body. The epidermis bars bacteria from being passed through direct skin contact. This is why cellulitis is not contagious. However, it quickly invades other body areas, especially adjacent tissues.
Symptoms of cellulitis make it easy to diagnose even at home. At first, affected areas become red and swollen. This is accompanied by warmth and tenderness. Not long afterwards, patients may develop fever, chills, lethargy and nausea. This means that the infection is becoming severe. Extreme complications include shock and systematic organ failure. You can find more on what is cellulitis online.
Most patients who get early treatment recover without complications. Antibiotics prescribed by a doctor are usually used for treatment.
Cellulitis rash early and later stages
Early stages
In the beginning stages, cellulitis is characterized by skin redness and swelling. A mild "orange peel" appearance may be noticed if the swollen area is lightly pressed. These features are caused by increased level of activities in the affected tissues. Once bacteria have settled in an environment conducive for growth, they rapidly divide. More bacteria call for more space to colonize. They therefore keep spreading, looking for healthier areas.
[RELATED]
The body is able to recognize pathogens. Immune cells are at once sent to fight off the invading bacteria. The resulting commotion plus bacterial activities still going on irritate the skin, causing inflammation and redness.
Middle stages
Not long after, a cellulitis rash will feel hot and tender. Affected areas may also tighten and harden. Warmth is a direct consequence of more cellular activities taking place beneath the dermis. Tenderness is a result of fluids and pus that soon forms around a bacterial infection.
Later stages
Bacteria do not only divide and spread. They also release toxins. When ‘flesh eating bacteria’ are involved, the toxins end up poisoning most of cells in adjacent fat tissues. This results in death of the tissue. As a result, dark marks may be seen throughout a cellulitis rash. See cellulitis infection pictures for illustrations. It is also common for a cellulitis rash to appear irregular and deformed as fat deposits form all over. Signs of spread can also be seen in form of red streaks that spread towards the heart.
It is in later stages that symptoms of systematic illness show up. They may include:
Fever
Chills
Lethargy
Vomiting
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Headaches
Confusion
Sudden drop in blood pressure
Increased heart rate
Swollen lymph nodes
By the time these symptoms develop, some bacteria have broken from local infection, entered circulatory system and reached other body parts. It is then that the cellulitis rash becomes particularly dangerous. Oral antibiotics may even not be able to treat the infection. If so, your doctor will use IV antibiotics. Cellulitis in children is also commonly treated intravenously.
What causes cellulitis rash on arms, face and lower legs
Cellulitis rash on arms, face and lower legs accounts for about 80% of all cases. So what makes it so common in these areas?
The main reason is because staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the common causal pathogens. Staph infections usually start around an injured area. Injuries are very common on lower legs and arms. On top of that, these areas are usually exposed to the environment. This means that bacteria from different sources are most likely to land on them during contamination. See what causes cellulitis of the leg for more details.
Another reason is that insect bites/stings and animal/human bites can also cause cellulitis rash. These are more common on lower legs, arms and face.
One type of cellulitis on face which is also common is orbital and periorbital cellulitis. This type develops in eyes. While skin injuries may be responsible, extended infection from upper respiratory tract is the most common cause. Strep bacteria are responsible in this case.
[RELATED]
There are some factors that make cellulitis rash develop more occasionally in some people. These are known as risk factors. They don't necessarily cause cellulitis. The factors include:
Recent skin injury
Diabetes
HIV
Leukemia
Medications for chronic diseases
Skin conditions such as eczema and chicken pox
Use of intravenous drugs
Liver diseases
Obesity
Chronic swelling in legs
Vascular disorders
Some people develop cellulitis after surgery. Many different types of bacteria are found in hospitals. Doctors do their best to ensure that transfer of pathogens is prevented. However, pathogens sometimes get past input measures. It is for example not uncommon for patients undergoing cancer treatment to contract cellulitis infection. This is especially if treatment has involved getting rid of several lymph nodes. Ask your doctor if there is need to take antibiotics before or after a surgery.
Is cellulitis itchy, contagious or painful?
Is cellulitis itchy? A common skin condition that is notoriously itchy is scabies. Eczema is also quite itchy. What is common in these two skin conditions is the fact that they develop on upper skin layers. It is a common characteristic in most itchy skin conditions. Cellulitis is sometimes itchy but very mildly. Rather than itchiness, patients will most likely feel a burning sensation.
Cellulitis infection is considered non-contagious. This is because bacteria are kept from the skin surface by epidermis. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA has recently been noted to occasionally pass from one person to another. This is especially when personal hygiene items are shared. MRSA is not only notorious in terms of jumping around but also in resisting treatment.  Doctors have to use specific antibiotics to cure cellulitis caused by MRSA, especially in cellulitis eye treatment where bacteria can easily spread to brain. In recent years, different types of bacteria that do not respond to antibiotics have been found. Experts are warning against unnecessary or undiagnosed use of antibiotics. The more we use these drugs for no good reason, the more bacteria get a chance to understand how antibiotics work and consequently how to resist them.
Cellulitis doesn’t in most cases cause widespread pain. Pain may only be felt when affected area is pressed or touched. There also may be pain if ulceration is present or abscess has formed. This is not to mention that wounds deep enough to cause cellulitis are most likely painful. Some body areas can be awfully painful when affected by cellulitis. Good examples are orbital cellulitis and umbilical cellulitis in children. Cellulitis pain can be relieved with pain medications.
Cellulitis healing stages; how long does it take to heal
There are no formal or specific cellulitis healing stages. In most cases, symptoms will completely have disappeared after 7-10 days of taking antibiotics used for cellulitis as prescribed by a doctor. It is common for redness to suddenly worsen after first medicines. This actually is a good sign, for it means that the medicines are working. If the condition doesn’t improve after 2 days, check with your doctor.
There are several things that may encourage faster recovery. They include:
Opt for prescription antibiotics
Oral antibiotics such as Doxycycline for cellulitis are the best defense we have against cellulitis. Mild infections will be gone before a week is over once you are on antibiotics. Even severe infections rarely persist for more than 3 weeks. The important part of taking prescription antibiotics is that a doctor will first do diagnosis. This is to rule out other conditions that can be confused with cellulitis. Diagnosis may also reveal the type of pathogen causing infection. This is particularly important when dealing with cellulitis that doesn’t respond to common antibiotics. Remember to take all medications even when symptoms have disappeared. This is mostly because patients will be treated as outpatients unless IV antibiotics are required.
Keep warm compressing
Warm compress is one of the most popular home treatments for many conditions. It expands blood vessels, allowing for more blood flow. The treatment may also draw pus towards the surface where it can drain. This home treatment is safe to use even for orbital cellulitis treatment unlike most home remedies which require direct application.
Use topical agents
Antibiotic creams are available over the counter and may help fasten recovery. They may not completely remove infection but will certainly keep bacteria from dividing or spreading fast. Neosporin is a good example.
Reduce pain with medications
Cellulitis is sometimes intolerably painful. Pain can always be reduced with medications bought over the counter or prescribed by a doctor. If you are on other medications for chronic diseases, check with your doctor before using over the counter drugs. For example, aspirin is an effective pain reliever but may cause unwanted blood thinning.
Try home remedies
There are a number of home remedies touted as helpful in cellulitis treatment. Tea tree oil, for example, is good for cellulitis big toe infection. You can try such remedies at home. Be sure to get complete guides on how to use a particular one of choice.

Cellulitis is fairly common. It also may keep recurring. Being equipped with knowledge on how to treat and prevent it at home may prove of some help.
Treatment
Apply tea tree oil:
Tea tree oil is known as an anti-inflammatory remedy. This means that it may reduce swelling caused by cellulitis. Other than being an anti-inflammatory, tea tree oil excels in fighting bacteria. You can use the oil on its own or in a combination with manuka honey and aloe vera. It is not advisable to directly apply tea tree oil on sensitive areas, particularly in the eye when treating periorbital cellulitis. See what is periorbital cellulitis for more details.
Moisturize with coconut oil:
Coconut oil may prove an excellent solution in prevent recurrent cellulitis caused by skin dryness and conditions like eczema. Apart from that, the oil contains lauric acid which makes it unfavorable for bacterial growth. Coconut oil is very mild and can be applied on sensitive body areas.
Take turmeric:
Turmeric is a strong anti-inflammatory remedy. It can be applied directly in a mixture with water. The better way to use it is adding 1 tablespoon to a glass of milk you are about to drink. This way, you can deal with widespread inflammation as well as bacterial infections in different body areas.
Prevention:
Keep wounds clean, dry and covered.
By keeping wounds clean, covered and dry, you will not only be reducing the number of cellulitis bacteria that may reach soft tissues but you will also be making conditions unfavorable for bacterial growth.

Keep your skin healthy.
This can be achieved with baths, moisturizers and such measures. For long-term, measures such as including vitamins and minerals in your diets may help.
Recurrent cellulitis in long-term recovery stages
Recurrent cellulitis can be troubling issue in later recovery stages. It is a common problem, especially for cellulitis in lower legs.
Causes
Possible causes of recurring cellulitis include:
Skin conditions – skin conditions that result in skin damage and take long to heal predisposes one to cellulitis recurrent infection. Eczema is a good example. In the feet and ankles, recurrence can be caused by athlete’s foot.
Lymphedema – lymphedema occasionally causes bursts and cracks on skin. These provide bacteria with entry points to soft tissues. Covering the ulcerated area with bandages may help.
Foreign objects – foreign objects, whether serving a cosmetic or medical purpose may constantly trigger cellulitis infections.
Circulatory disorders – blood and lymphatic fluid play important roles in recovery from infections and diseases. When there are impairments in these systems, patients recover poorly. Infections may keep recurring as bacteria regroup and launch another invasion.
Weak immune system – without the immune system, a common disease such as common cold can send a person to the grave. Immune cells succeed in fighting off pathogens from the body. Diseases such as HIV, diabetes and cancer weaken this system, making it possible for even small numbers of bacteria to cause cellulitis.
Treatment:
Treatment is done with antibiotics. Once infection has been controlled, your doctor will propose measures to deal with the factors encouraging recurrence.
What causes chronic cellulitis?
Chronic cellulitis is much like recurrent cellulitis. It goes away with antibiotics but keeps coming back months or years later.
One thing that may be making the infection chronic is poor circulation. Blood is among other things tasked with helping in removing pathogens from the body. Other than blood, lymphatic fluid is also very essential in regards to fighting pathogens. Fluids generally flow less vigorously when the object they are contained in is at rest. This means that spending most of your time at rest may reduce your body’s efficiency to fight possible cases of cellulitis.
Another issue is having high blood sugar levels. Every cell in the body requires a source of energy. In blood, sugar, in form of glucose, plays that part. Blood sugar is maintained at certain levels which should not increase or decrease overmuch. Increase causes inflammation in different parts of the body. This significantly reduces the body’s ability to fight infections.
Chronic cellulitis is often seen in people who are obese. Obesity makes it hard for provisions to be made throughout the body. Provisions in this context include getting rid of waste materials and filtering pathogens.
Cellulitis sepsis complications
Sometimes, the body violently reacts to infections, injuries or medications used to treat some diseases. This is condition is known as sepsis. It is very dangerous since patients can suddenly go to shock.
Sepsis is characterized by inflammation all over the body. During an infection, the body releases certain chemicals meant to counter invading pathogens. These chemicals may trigger widespread inflammation which causes systematic organ failure. If not treated early, septic shock can lead to death.
Causes
If cellulitis is not treated, some bacteria break free into bloodstream. This triggers production and release of chemicals meant to fight the bacteria. Older people and those with weakened immune systems are predisposed to cellulitis sepsis. Bacteria that do not respond to commonly prescribed antibiotics are also known to trigger sepsis.
[RELATED]
Symptoms
In its early stages, sepsis causes a rapid rise in heart rate, reaching up to 90 beats per minute. This is accompanied by rapid breathing and a hike in body temperature. Treatment may improve these symptoms. If not, patients may experience reduction in number of platelets, pain in abdomen, difficulty breathing, confusion and decrease in urine output. Past this stage, septic shock occurs. This is where blood pressure is dangerously low.
Treatment
Treatment is initially done with antibiotics. Since patients require urgent treatment, different types of antibiotics will be given before diagnosis reports come in. A specific antibiotic will be switched to once the actual pathogen responsible for infection has been identified.
To correct blood pressure, patients are given intravenous fluids. This usually works for patients yet to go to septic shock. Medications which work by narrowing blood vessels are given to patients with much lower blood pressure.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is an infection caused by bacteria in soft tissues beneath superficial skin. Staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the main culprits behind cellulitis infections. While the condition is relatively common, most patients are able to recover without complications.
Any detailed cellulitis definition will tell you that the condition is not contagious. This however doesn’t mean that a localized infection will not keep spreading. In fact, spreading is what makes cellulitis potentially dangerous. Cellulitis throat infection for example is a considered a risk factor for scrotal cellulitis. Strep throat or pneumonia in kids soon spreads to the eyes.
The first signs present as reddened and swollen areas. Like most bacterial infections, affected areas may become hot and tender. Systematic symptoms of illness such as chills, fever and swollen lymph nodes soon develop.
Early treatment is important to prevent cellulitis complications and improve nursing diagnosis for cellulitis.
Cellulitis after surgery infection
Cellulitis after surgery is not uncommon. The many incision sites in surgery patients readily act as entry points for bacteria. There are many bacteria that harmless live on human skin. Once there is an opening on skin, these bacteria can reach soft tissues where they divide and cause infection. This is what happens during surgery.
[RELATED]
Commonly affected areas are the buttocks and breasts. Cellulitis on buttocks may for example develop after reduction or increment surgery. On the breasts, surgery to treat cancer, reduce, enlarge or correct breasts may be the cause.
Not always will surgery patients develop cellulitis. There are certain factors that make some patients more susceptible than others. These include:
Cancer treatments
Diabetes
HIV
Poor wound care
Multiple surgeries
Intravenous drugs use
Signs and symptoms begin in a localized area, around where bacteria entered. Redness and swelling appear first. They are a result of body’s natural reaction to pathogens. In most cases, inflammation occurs around a site where foreign substances have been introduced in the body. This is what happens in case of early cellulitis.
With increased activity as immune cells fight bacteria and as bacteria rapidly divide, the affected area feels hot and tender. This may be accompanied by tightening and hardening. In most cases, immune cells will not be able to contain invading bacteria. The bacteria will therefore spread, first to adjacent tissues, then to blood and later perhaps distant organs. Systematic symptoms such as fever and chills will show up soon after infection has started spreading.
Treatment is done with antibiotics. A couple of tests will be required to confirm the nature of pathogen causing infection. This is particularly because MRSA is common in hospital premises and may be responsible for cellulitis after surgery. You can ask your doctor about taking antibiotics before and after surgery.
Cellulitis abscess pictures, causes and treatments
Boils, abscesses and cellulitis can mimic each other. Boils develop when hair follicles get blocked and infected with bacteria. Presence of bacteria causes pus formation which collects under the skin. Boils are usually painful, tender and feel hot. An abscess is what a large boil could actually be. It develops much deeper in the skin. Affected areas are redder and more swollen. Cellulitis is an infection that develops beneath the dermis. Sometimes, cellulitis results in abscess as commonly seen with MRSA infections.
Cellulitis abscess makes the condition more painful. Doctors are sometimes able to recognize its symptoms during physical examination. Imaging tests are required in most cases, however. This is especially true when dealing with abscess in the mouth or abscess on the face. Orbital cellulitis also requires imaging tests to check for abscesses.
Surgery is usually required to completely remove cellulitis abscess. Incision surgery is more preferable, although draining can be done with a needle and syringe. This however may encourage recurring cellulitis. Antibiotics are given afterwards to ensure complete removal of infection.
[RELATED]
Although cellulitis is often painful, formation of an abscess makes the pain worse. Patients should consult their doctors immediately when this happens. This is mostly because the infection may be resulting from MRSA. MRSA doesn’t readily respond to treatment with commonly prescribed antibiotics. Even worse, tests to check for this bacteria type often bring disappointing results.
Complications of cellulitis infection
Some complications of cellulitis can be very severe while others are manageable even at home. They include:
Sepsis
Cellulitis sepsis is one of the deadly complications. When infection reaches the circulatory system, certain chemicals are released to fight off the invading pathogens. These chemicals sometimes trigger inflammation throughout the body. When severe, this leads to systematic organ failure, sending the victim to septic shock and probable death.
Signs of early sepsis include difficult breathing, confusion, fever and increased heart rate. Drop in blood pressure indicate advancing sepsis.
Treatment is done with antibiotics. Patients are also given IV fluids to raise blood pressure. When too low, medications that constrict blood vessels are used to raise blood pressure.
Meningitis
The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by membranes. As mentioned earlier, tissues usually get inflamed when invaded by a pathogen. Infection in the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord undergo the same inflammation process once infection reaches them. This leads to the dangerous condition known as meningitis. Victims can die within minutes.
Signs and symptoms include severe headache, high fever, seizures and stiffness in the neck. Meningitis is more likely to develop as a complication of facial, orbital or periorbital cellulitis where no cellulitis cure has been given. See periorbital cellulitis pictures for illustrations.
[RELATED]
Lymphangitis
Lymph nodes are connected with lymphatic vessels which transport lymphatic fluid. Together, they make up the lymphatic system. This is a very important part of our immune system. Bacteria from a localized infection often spreads to the lymphatic system. There, it may cause obstruction or damage to lymphatic vessels. This leads to a weakened immune system and more notably lymphedema. Lymphedema is where some parts of the body mostly lower legs swell due to retention of lymphatic fluid. Lymphedema cellulitis is common in people with chronic legs swelling. Symptoms of cellulitis in leg may appear after sores or cracks caused by swelling.
Treatment is done with antibiotics. Since lymphedema is not curable, measures such as massage, compression garments and short walks help.
Gangrene
Gangrene is usually a complication of cellulitis abscess. An abscess may develop between two skin layers or in pathways of blood vessels. This may cut blood supply to some tissues or organs. As a result, most of the tissue’s cells will die due to lack of nourishment. Gangrene is said to have occurred when this happens. It is very common in scrotal cellulitis.
Early signs include skin paleness and loss of sensation. Treatment is done with surgery or needle and syringe to drain the accumulated fluid.
Other complications such as loss of vision and necrotizing fasciitis may also occur.
Nursing diagnosis for cellulitis
After treatment, nursing diagnosis for cellulitis is important to check the progress of the patient. The diagnosis may focus on the following:
Pain
A wound deep enough to result in cellulitis can be quite painful. The problem is that as long as the wound is not yet healed, cellulitis may remain a recurring problem. Pain can also result from cases such as cellulitis in nose and cellulitis eye symptoms.
[RELATED]
Physical changes
Surgery to remove dead tissue or drain abscesses can result in some physical changes. Sometimes, grafting may even be required. It is important to check how patients are dealing with that. Complications such as gangrene can also lead to major changes on the skin.
Prevention
Cellulitis is cannot develop unless bacteria reaches the soft tissues. But not everyone knows that. Also, factors such as having a weakened immune system and having chronic leg swelling can make cellulitis a recurring problem. It is important that patients be armed with such knowledge during recovery. In addition, patients may find it helpful to learn about home treatments or a cellulitis home remedy such as tea tree oil.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection that develops in the soft tissues but also involves the superficial skin layer. It is mostly caused by bacteria of strep and staph strains. If a staph infection, cellulitis will begin around a recently injured skin area. If a strep infection, there may be signs of infection elsewhere in the body such as tonsillitis, strep throat or pneumonia. See what is cellulitis infection for more details.
Like other bacterial infections, antibiotics are the main treatment options used for cellulitis. Antibiotics are particularly important for serious infections like ones caused by MRSA. Such infections can be noted by formation of red spots on the swollen areas.
Mild cellulitis or recurring cases can be treated without antibiotics. This should however be done with caution. If not properly treated, cellulitis can become a dangerous problem as a well as a vexing chronic one.
How to use tea tree oil for cellulitis
What is tea tree oil?
Tea tree oil is an essential oil. It traditionally has been used to treat wounds, cuts, bruises and common infections. The healing ability of tea tree oil lies in its ability to reduce inflammations and fight off microbes.
[RELATED]
Although tea tree oil’s effectiveness cannot be compared to that of antibiotics such as clindamycin and Bactrim for cellulitis, it comes with a couple of advantages over such drugs. For one, patients don’t risk allergic reactions and other side effects such as diarrhea and headaches. This is because tea tree oil is applied directly and not ingested. Another advantage is that tea tree oil has not been seen to trigger bacterial antibiotic resistance.
How to use
This remedy can be used as an antiseptic and as an antimicrobial.
Clean an injured skin area with soap and water
Pat dry or leave to air dry
Soak a cotton swab in diluted tea tree oil
Apply directly all over and around affected area
Rinse with water after 15 minutes
As an antimicrobial:
Wash clean the cellulitis-affected area
Pat dry or wait to air dry
Soak a cotton swab and apply the oil directly
Rinse with water after few hours
Repeat this treatment 2 times in a day until infection is gone
Better results can be achieved by mixing tea tree oil with some drops of aloe vera and a tablespoon of manuka honey. Honey reduces skin redness while aloe vera soothes irritated skin and may be able to stop bacterial growth. Such a combination may be more effective in treatment for cellulitis in the leg.
Precautions
Tea tree oil may irritate sensitive skin when used in its undiluted form. To avoid this, use carrier oil such as olive oil or avocado oil to dilute it.
Don’t ingest even small amounts of this oil. It can cause terrible side effects including severe diarrhea and shock.
Best essential oils for cellulitis
Essential oils are best known for their ability to moisturize the skin. They also may aid in keeping bacteria from the skin, especially away from an injured area. When using essential oils for cellulitis, remember to dilute with carrier oil. This is because some may be harsh to tender or sensitive skin. Good examples of carrier oils are olive oil, clove oil and virgin coconut oil. Below are some essential oils that may help with cellulitis treatment:
Lavender oil
Lavender oil is associated with benefits such as the ability to reduce pain, improve circulation, disinfect skin and improve nerve coordination. It is best applied directly to affected areas with a cotton swab. Lavender oil is also nice smelling, something that makes it a considerable option for cellulitis in kids treatment.
Chamomile oil
The best known ability of chamomile oil is to induce a relaxation effect. This allows the immune system to work at its best when fighting infection. Apart from that, chamomile oil is a potential antibiotic and antiseptic. It can be applied directly to either prevent or naturally cure infection.
[RELATED]
Coconut oil
Coconut oil is considered an essential oil as well as carrier oil. It is particularly known for its ability to reduce skin dryness, treating conditions such as eczema in the process. But how do you treat cellulitis with coconut oil? The best way is to apply it directly. You can leave it for a few hours before rinsing or overnight.
Oregano essential oil
Also referred to as oil of oregano, it is a quite effective natural cellulitis treatment. It fights both bacteria and fungi. This means that it can be used to treat cellulitis big toe or foot infection brought on by athlete’s foot. Like other essential oils in this list, the best way to use is by applying directly to affected areas.
Other natural cures for cellulitis
Turmeric
Turmeric’s anti-inflammatory properties are so powerful that it is listed as one of the foods that may help prevent cancer. The properties are contained in curcumin. Turmeric for cellulitis can be used in two ways:
Boil a glass of milk
To it, add a teaspoon of turmeric powder
Add some honey to make it sweet
Wait for the mixture to cool down a bit before drinking
Repeat twice a day
This oral administration can be particularly helpful in case of cellulitis on breast during breast cancer treatment.
Alternatively:
Make a paste with tea tree oil and turmeric powder
Apply the paste directly to affected areas
Rinse after 15 minutes
Repeat once a day
Garlic
For those who can stand the taste of garlic, chewing several cloves in a day may help with cellulitis. Garlic contains compounds that may reduce swelling and promote skin rejuvenation. Most people use it by applying directly rather than chewing.
Crush several cloves
Fry them with coconut oil
Once cooled, strain to extract some fluid
Apply directly and rinse after few hours
Repeat once daily
Honey
Honey has for long been known to promote healing of burns and cuts. It has strong antibacterial properties and also promotes skin recovery. Research has mostly been done on manuka honey. It is thought to be the most beneficial. Raw honey can however be used for the same benefits.
Apply a thin layer of honey all over the affected area
Leave for few hours before rinsing off
Repeat once daily
Activated charcoal
You may have heard that charcoal is used in gas masks to filter harmful particles from air. It achieves this due to the presence of many tiny holes in its surface. Activated charcoal is best used for such purposes.
[RELATED]
It is said that it can draw the chemicals responsible for swelling and infection out of a cellulitis affected area. To make a natural cure for cellulitis, follow the following steps:
Prepare 1 tablespoon of activated charcoal and equal measure of flaxseed oil
Mix the two to make a paste. you can add some water to make the paste less thick
Use a paper towel to make a poultice out of the paste
Apply directly and hold it to place with a plastic and ducting tape
Rinse few hours after
How do you cure cellulitis at home?
Other than natural cures that require direct application or ingestion, there are several cellulitis home treatments that may help prevent and cure cellulitis. They include:
Warm compressing – warm compressing literally means pressing a warm piece of cloth on affected areas. It is quite effective, not in treating but in improving symptoms such as pain and swelling caused by cellulitis.
Resting – when you are resting, available resources are directed towards fighting invading pathogens responsible for cellulitis. Resting, however, doesn’t translate to sitting all day long. For example, people with a tendency to swell in lower legs after sitting for a long time can find it helpful to take short walks.
Hygiene – hygiene in this context means keeping injured areas clean, dry and covered. Although cellulitis is considered not contagious, bacteria can be picked up from almost anywhere.
Systematic treatment – people with weakened immune system are more likely to get severe and recurring cellulitis. This can be avoided by treating or managing diseases such as HIV and diabetes that may weaken the immune system. People with chronic leg swelling caused by lymphedema can also successfully manage the condition. Your doctor will be in the best position to provide specific guidelines.
Losing weight – being obese comes with a list of disadvantages. One of them is that blood and lymphatic fluid are not able to circulate efficiently. As a result, infections take longer to completely go away.
All in all, medical treatment is almost always necessary. The problem with treating cellulitis at home is that you can’t tell if the infection is gone for good. This is not to mention the fact that complicated cases like scrotal cellulitis require immediate surgery to fully be cured. It is a good idea to consult a professional prior to using natural cures to treat cellulitis.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the superficial layer of the skin and soft tissues beneath. A variety of bacteria can cause the infection but staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the common culprits. It is through skin injuries such as cuts, wounds and ulcers that bacteria reach soft tissues. At other times, pathogens can spread from a primary infection such as strep throat to elsewhere in the body. This is mostly seen in infections caused by strep bacteria. See cellulitis eye pictures for details. Other sources of infection include surgeries, insect stings/bites, animal/human bites and foreign objects such as piercings.
Antibiotics are the main medications used to treat cellulitis. The medications are usually to be taken by mouth but can also be given intravenously. It depends on where the infection is located and how severe it is. Some commonly prescribed antibiotics have been reviewed below.
Doxycycline for cellulitis; use, dosage, side effects
What is doxycycline?
Doxycycline falls in the class of tetracycline antibiotics. It is able to control many types of bacteria. For this reason, doxycycline for cellulitis is just one of its uses.
Use
Respiratory infections like pneumonia are often treated with doxycycline. The drug is also used to treat infections of the urinary tract, genitals and lymphatic system. Since it is able to control different bacteria types, doxycycline may also be used against infections resulting from insect or bug bites, exposure to contaminated water, infected water and cellulitis jaw symptoms caused by swollen lymph nodes.
[RELATED]
Doxycycline comes in tabs, capsules and in liquid form. Tabs or capsules can be taken with a glass of milk or water on an empty stomach. If there is a possibility of getting stomach upset, the drug can be taken with food. Heavy meals with a lot of fat decrease the efficiency of drugs. To avoid this, the tabs can be broken up and swallowed in form of powder. Make sure to drink at least a full glass of water afterwards. When using the liquid form, use a measuring device to get the dosage right.
Doxycycline is effective on MRSA, the cellulitis bacteria often responsible for abscesses. It, however, may not effectively treat infections caused by strep bacteria. In this case, a combination with other antibiotics such as cephalexin is preferred.
Dosage
The correct dosage is 100 mg, to be taken two times a day for ten days. Specific instructions will be provided by your doctor. All medications should be taken as instructed even after cellulitis symptoms have vanished. It is common for symptoms of cellulitis such as redness to worsen shortly after the first dosage. This should improve within 24-48 hours. If not, check with your doctor.
Both doxycycline monohydrate and hyclate are effective. The latter, however, has a longer half-life and may cause less severe stomach upset. You can ask your doctor about that if you are prone to gastrointestinal problems.
Side effects
The most severe potential side effect of doxycycline is allergic reaction. Inform your doctor if you have a history of allergic reactions to medications. Stop taking the medicines when hives, swelling in the tongue or throat or sudden facial cellulitis symptoms develop. Other side effects that require medical attention include:
sore throat
nausea
diarrhea
loss of appetite
vomiting
itchiness in the genital area
pain in the back
mouth dryness
swelling of the tongue
skin or eye color change
blurry vision
hives
rash
swollen lymph glands
Check with your doctor if any of the above persists for more than 2 days after the first dosage. It could be a side effect or sign of resistant bacteria.
Keflex for cellulitis; use, dosage and side effects
Keflex falls in the class of antibiotics known as beta-lactams. It is mostly used for uncomplicated cellulitis symptoms caused by strep bacteria.
Use
Common use of Keflex is in treatment of infections in the ear and respiratory tract. It is also used to treat infections resulting from strep infections that have spread. A good example is cellulitis which appears some time after being diagnosed with an infection such as strep throat or pneumonia.
Dosage
Correct dosage depends on age of the patient. In periorbital cellulitis in adults for example, 500mg to be taken once a day is usually prescribed. This dosage can be divided into two equal parts to be taken twice a day or after every 6 hours. Most patients recover within 7-10 days. Depending on diagnosis reports, your doctor may prescribe higher dosages. This is especially if infection is severe.
Children are given lower dosage measurements such as when treating umbilical cellulitis. For example, 2g of Keflex for cellulitis can be divided into 4 doses to be taken after every six hours. Recommended Keflex for cellulitis dosage is 25mg per kg per day for children and 50mg per kg per day for adolescents.
[RELATED]
Your doctor will provide specific instructions. It is important that medications be taken as instructed. Cellulitis symptoms usually disappear about 3 days after starting treatment. Treatment duration often is 7 days but can extend up to 21 days for severe infections. Check with your doctor if there are no improvements by the second day.
Side effects
Some people are allergic to Keflex. Signs of allergic reaction include:
Hives
Swelling
Difficulty breathing
Skin redness and inflammation
Rash
If any of the following side effects occur, seek medical attention immediately:
Bleeding
Blistering
Diarrhea
Seizures
Confusion
Skin paleness
Lower production of urine
Lethargy
Nausea
Vomiting
These may be signs of unresponsive cellulitis or abnormal interactions. Whichever case, medical attention is necessary. Call your doctor if they persist for more than 2 days or get intolerably severe. Sometimes, antibiotics produce a somewhat severe reaction after the first dosage. This may appear in the form of more reddened skin. It should improve with time.
Bactrim for cellulitis; use dosage and side effects
Bactrim is among what are known as sulfa drugs. It is used to treat different bacterial infections such as in urinary tract, respiratory tract and ear. People with a history of liver or kidney diseases should not take sulfa drugs.
Use
Bactrim comes in liquid form. It should be shaken well before use. To ensure that dosage measurement is gotten right, a measuring device should be used.
The drug should be used as prescribed by a doctor. Before prescription, diagnosis will be done. This is not only to determine the nature of pathogen causing infection but also prevent cases of extreme reaction to bactrim.
Drugs in the same class as bactrim may cause kidney disorders such as kidney stones. Drinking plenty of fluids will help avoid this complication.
Dosage
A daily supply of bactrim is prescribed to be taken 2 times in a day. Your doctor will provide special instructions where necessary.
[RELATED]
Side effects
Patients allergic to bactrim may experience signs such as swelling in the throat, tongue and face, difficulty breathing and hives. These should be addressed by a doctor immediately. Stop taking any more medication until you check with your doctor. Other side effects that require medical attention include:
Diarrhea
Generally feeling tired
Signs of systematic illness
Pain in upper abdomen accompanied by yellowness on skin
Skin paleness
Headache
Vomiting
Fever
Generally, check with your doctor if any suspicious reaction occurs after taking bactrim for cellulitis. It is common for patients to experience mild gastrointestinal problems such as nausea and loss of appetite. A mild rash accompanied by mild itchiness may also develop. These should not be intolerable.
Clindamycin for cellulitis; use, dosage and side effects
Clindamycin is an antibiotic. Unlike others in this list, it also works for MRSA or bacteria that do not respond to commonly used antibiotics. The drug is, for this reason, reserved for serious infections.
Use
Clindamycin comes in form of capsules and in oral liquid. Capsules are best taken with a glass of water. Oral forms come with a measuring syringe to be used to get dosage measurement right. It can also be provided in the pharmacy from where you are buying the drug.
Sometimes, clindamycin is given intravenously. This requires hospitalization since IV antibiotics are only supposed to be given by a doctor. Some clinicians start treatment with IV antibiotics and later follow it up with oral medications.
Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Avoid skipping doses for it may increase the probability of recurrent cellulitis.  Don’t combine two doses to compensate for a missed one.
Dosage
Clindamycin comes in 150mg and 300mg capsules. Mostly prescribed clindamycin for cellulitis dosage is 300mg capsules to be taken 4 times a day. If being given intravenously, up to 4.8g may be used. 600mg given after every 6 hours is the common IV dosage.
Side effects
Inform your doctor if you have a history of allergic reactions to medications especially antibiotics. Also inform about possible cases of liver, kidney and intestinal disorders or asthma. Stop taking the drug if signs of allergic reaction develop. Such include hives, rash and swelling in tongue, face and throat. Other side effects that require medical attention include:
Yellowing of the skin
Difficulty breathing
Fever
Drop in blood pressure
Difficulty swallowing
Persistent gastrointestinal problems, especially when treating perineal cellulitis
It is common for antibiotics to cause tolerable side effects such as mild hives and mild nausea or vomiting. This should however not reach a point of causing signs of systematic illness. If that happens, stop using the medication and seek medical attention.
Other medications used for cellulitis treatment
Antibiotics are also available in creams and ointments for direct application. Examples include bacitracin and neomycin. Sometimes, several antibiotics are combined in the same cream to make them more effective. Necessary precautions should be taken before using topical antibiotics. For example, neomycin may irritate sensitive skin if used for long. Bacitracin may not be effective on cellulitis strong enough to cause abscesses.

There are many other types of oral antibiotics, some which may be given intravenously initially. Doctors choose the particular type to chose based on factors such as severity of infection, age of patient, type of bacteria and health status of patient. It is for this reason that patients are urged not to use antibiotics without clinical diagnosis.
Home treatments such as warm compress, elevation and use of home remedies may be of some help in cases such as cellulitis big toe infection treatment. They however should not replace medical treatment. You can ask your doctor about using home treatments. Other than home treatments, recurrent and chronic cellulitis can be avoided with measures such as keeping wounds clean, treating lymphedema, losing weight and encouraging blood/lymphatic fluid circulation. Not finishing medications as instructed can also encourage cellulitis recurrence.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a disease in its own rights, but is mostly described as a skin condition. Two main strains of bacteria usually cause the disease, although a variety of bacteria strains can also cause it. The disease usually develops in the layers of the skin beneath the epidermis. These are known as the soft tissues, mostly consisting of the dermis and the subcutaneous layer. However, it can also occur on the upper skin layer. Without treatment, this bacterial infection can spread to the circulatory and lymphatic system. Cellulitis is considered dangerous in a such case.
The bacteria that cause cellulitis live harmlessly on the skin. When a fault such as an ulcer develops, the bacteria gain entry into the skin and this results in infection. The infection causes the affected areas to become red, warm, painful and swollen. In most cases, the lower legs are affected although any part of the skin can become infected.
Bacterial infections are usually not hard to treat, especially when caught early. However reassuring this may sound, this type of infections is potentially very dangerous when left without treatment or when misdiagnosed. Cellulitis, for example, can spread to vital organs in a matter of days. The good thing is that various forms of treatment are available, mostly the use of antibiotics.
What is cellulitis and its medical definition
So what is cellulitis? The simple cellulitis definition is that it is a bacterial infection that develops in the skin, and a potentially dangerous one. Medical definition usually includes the two bacteria that mostly cause the disease. These are staph and strep bacteria. Once the disease is past incubation stage, any "purulent" definition may include the fact that pus discharge is a potential sign.
[RELATED]
It is very common to sustain a form of injury that will leave a part of the skin open. Common skin injuries include burns, cuts and ulcerations. Injuries can also come from being scratched by a pet or being bitten by an animal. If the injury has been sustained while working outdoors, such as on a farm, there are more chances of developing cellulitis.
First signs can appear around the injured area or somewhere different. It is however important to note that a number of other skin conditions can mimic cellulitis. For example, poor blood circulation in the lower legs causes swelling, pain and reddening.
The main difference is that cellulitis doesn’t cause scaling. It is also necessary that an opening be present somewhere on the skin for cellulitis to develop. The opening will act as an entry point for causal bacteria. Since the incubation period is usually not long, early signs will appear shortly after an injury.
Unlike most infections, cellulitis is rarely passed from one person to another. This is because causal bacteria are under the epidermis.
What does it mean to have cellulitis?
The difference between viruses and bacteria is that the latter can be permanently eradicated from the body after positive diagnosis. Once you have been diagnosed with cellulitis, it mostly indicates an urgent need to get antibiotics and keep more bacteria from entering the skin.
At times, cellulitis can arise as if from nowhere. This may be a sign that the patient is suffering from a chronic condition such as lymphedema or compromised immunity.
What causes cellulitis and how do you get it?
So far, cellulitis has been identified as a common infection caused by bacteria. But how do you get it? Bacteria are one of the most prolific living things. They live just about everywhere and in everything. Surprisingly, only a very small percent is actually harmful.
The skin among other things acts as a protective cover which keeps internal organs from harmful agents such as bacteria. Once the barrier is broken, cellulitis bacteria can freely invade the soft tissues of the skin and rapidly spread. Soft tissues are warm, rich with nutrients and moist, conditions that make it very convenient for bacteria to multiply quickly. While anyone can get cellulitis, there are several risk factors that may heighten the possibility of getting the infection. They include:
Skin injuries – broken skin regions are the leading causes of cellulitis. It is not always necessary that an injury be serious enough as to bleed or be an open wound. It can be something as seemingly not harmful as a cat scratch or an insect bite. You can for example get cellulitis from bee sting.
Some skin conditions – conditions such as athlete’s foot and eczema - cause tiny breaks in the skin. Such may allow bacteria to enter the skin. This is especially when the conditions are left without treatment. The disadvantage is that patients may mistake cellulitis signs with effects of the primary condition.
Weak immunity – the body naturally recognizes harmful bacteria and fights them off. In people with conditions or taking medications which may compromise the immune system, it will be hard for this natural defense mechanism to be effective. Immune-compromising conditions include HIV, diabetes and cancer. Some medications such as corticosteroids and drugs used in chemotherapy may also compromise the immune system.
Vascular defects – blood vessels and lymphatic vessels are responsible for efficient circulation of fluids in the body. When there are defects in these systems, the extremities are usually affected. Such defects result in swelling in lower legs which may also cause pain and reddening. Being obese is a major contributing factor. Sometimes, a chronic condition known as lymphedema develops. It is caused by poor drainage of lymphatic fluid in lower legs. Excess swelling in affected legs may lead to cracking and hence entry points for bacteria. Lymphedema cellulitis is a bit harder to treat.
Drug abuse – use of drugs that require injections is an efficient method of introducing bacteria into the skin. This is especially when needles are shared.
Previous cellulitis infection – previous infections, mostly ones occurring on lower legs heighten the chances of a recurring infection.
UV radiation – light skinned people are prone to sunburns and other forms of skin damage caused by UV radiation. Bacteria can take advantage of the resulting damage as entry points into the skin.
Other risk factors include surgeries, presence of foreign materials or objects in the skin and chronic wounds or bone infections. Note that risk factors do not necessarily cause a disease. Having a risk factor does not guarantee that a disease will certainly occur. It only increases the chances of the disease occurring.
Cellulitis symptoms and early signs
Early cellulitis symptoms begin shortly after infection. Some bacteria strains produce early signs within 24 hours. The symptoms usually appear around the infected region but may also occur somewhere else on the skin. Apart of the skin may:
Become red and inflamed
Be painful and feel tender
Develop a rapidly spreading cellulitis rash
Feel warm
Become firm and appear swollen
Sometimes, other signs of infection will be present. Such include presence of red streaks, formation of pus which may ooze, inflammation of local lymph nodes and fever. These signs indicate a spreading cellulitis which is potentially dangerous. Medical attention is necessary in the advent of such signs. A doctor should also be consulted if the area feels numb, hardened or when signs such as vomiting and high fever set in.
What does it look like?
If you were to look at pictures of a skin condition known as stasis dermatitis, you will notice their resemblance with those of cellulitis. In fact, symptoms of cellulitis in leg can easily be taken for those of dermatitis.
[RELATED]
The main difference is that cellulitis tends to spread fast, is painful, and doesn’t itch. Affected areas also don’t become scaly like in the case of dermatitis. Dermatitis is the same condition known as eczema. It is common in people with dry skins. First signs include itchiness, mild pain, slight inflammation and formation of red scaly patches on the skin. When it occurs in the lower legs, the ankles and shin are mostly affected. Dermatitis also not contagious and doesn’t spread.
There are many cellulitis infection pictures online that may help identify the condition. If doubts are to persist, you can always consult your doctor for a medical diagnosis.
How is cellulitis diagnosed?
Diagnosis is usually very important to rule out other conditions with almost identical first signs. Most doctors will recognize cellulitis after a physical examination. Available nursing diagnosis for cellulitis tests include:
Physical examination
The doctor will look for signs and symptoms such as a swollen red area. The patient will be required to provide details on the timeline of the symptoms and a brief medical history. It may therefore be helpful to come up with a list of the symptoms you have been experiencing when preparing for an appointment.
Blood test
It is through blood that most substances, including immune system cells, are transported. By checking the number of white blood cells in the blood, a doctor will be able to predict the presence of bacteria. More white blood cells mean that there are harmful microbes in the blood.
Culture test
Tissue cells and bacteria can be put in conditions that allow them to proceed normal growth outside the body. This is done under controlled conditions in the lab. In case of cellulitis, fluid is drawn from the affected area and cultured.
Imaging tests
A chronic wound or infection can be caused by an object that has accidentally been trapped under the skin. It is through imaging tests that such an object can be traced and marked for removal. X-rays are usually used.
Medical cellulitis treatment
Medical cellulitis treatment is almost wholly done with antibiotics. Your doctor may however include treatment measures meant to reduce pain or manage the primary cause of cellulitis such as diabetes. In rare cases, a form of surgical operation will be performed even for cellulitis eye treatment.
Use of antibiotics
Antibiotics are very powerful drugs when used against bacteria. In most cases, cellulitis will completely be gone in 10 day duration of taking antibiotics. This, however, depends on the severity of the infection. Some patients are required to take antibiotics for 3 weeks while others only have to take them for about 10 days. Most symptoms will be gone or will have improved in the first 3 days. If this happens, patients should continue taking the prescribed drugs as instructed. Symptoms that don’t respond to antibiotics in the first 3 days should be reported to a doctor. Penicillin and Cephalexin for cellulitis are examples of antibiotics that can be used.
Pain management
Doctors usually prescribe pain relievers as part of cellulitis treatment. Even when this is not the case, patients can always purchase pain medications over the counter. It is very important that pain medications not be taken as the only form of treatment for cellulitis.
[RELATED]
Managing pre-existing conditions
Sometimes, cellulitis occurs as a complication of conditions such as obesity, diabetes and use of medications. This means that the primary cause must be addressed if the resulting cellulitis is to be effectively treated. The doctor will still treat the cellulitis however. Often, treatment will be done in the hospital under a doctor’s supervision.
Surgery
Not often is surgery used for cellulitis removal. When used, it is mainly to get rid of the collected fluid or pus that may be causing symptoms such as warmth and pain. Surgery can also be done to remove surrounding tissue that has died due to infection.
When to see a doctor
Severe cellulitis can lead to death, however mild early signs may be. While a patient may get good results from over the counter medications or even some home remedies, medical attention is always the better choice. See your doctor if:
Symptoms don’t improve in the first 3 days of taking antibiotics
You are experiencing high fevers or increased blood pressure
Infection starts or spreads to the neck and head areas. Cellulitis lip infection can, for example, rapidly spread to the brain.
The cellulitis is possibly resulting from a pre-existing condition
Unexplained swelling starts in lower legs and doesn’t go away
You have sustained a deep injury, a severe bite or blistering in an existing wound
An open skin area comes into contact with dirt or sea water
An elderly person or a child has been infected
You have tonsillar cellulitis
Possible complications
In most cases, early signs of a disease are not ones posing the greatest risk. Cellulitis can for example lead to the following if not treated:
Abscess
An abscess is a swollen body area that contains pus and usually very painful. It resembles a large boil. Abscesses are caused by bacterial accumulation.
MRSA
This is an acronym for a bacterium that doesn’t respond to some antibiotics. Scientists are warning of potential global medical crisis, where most bacteria will become resistance to antibiotics. If this happens, common diseases such as TB will return to the top killing menaces they used to be. One way to stop this rising resistance is to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics, and getting medical help for common infections such as cellulitis.
Blood poisoning
All living organisms produce waste products. When bacteria are inside the body, their waste products are emptied into the blood system of the host. This may lead to a condition known as septicemia, which usually drives patients to shock.
[RELATED]
Flesh-eating disease
Its medical name is necrotizing fasciitis. It is a bacterial infection complication that causes death to soft tissues.
Like most infections, cellulitis can lead to death if not treated.
Cellulitis treatment at home and prevention
Cellulitis is one of the most common infections. It may be helpful to learn how to treat it at home or basically how to avoid the infection.
Home treatment
Elevation – fluids, especially blood, flow away from the heart with more pressure than when going back to the heart. When cellulitis occurs in lower legs for example, you can improve its symptoms by keeping the affected leg elevated above the heart. This allows for more blood flow away from the leg.
Hygiene – practicing good hygiene is both preventive and curative. By keeping an injured skin area clean, you will be ensuring that no bacteria enter the skin. The few that may enter will possibly be fought off by the immune cells. It is also helpful to bandage the injured area.
Use warm compress – warm compress is perhaps the most widely used home treatment for many skin conditions. It works by encouraging dilation in blood vessels, which in turn allows for more efficient blood flow. This reduces inflammation. Warm compressing is also known to draw pus towards the surface where it can drain. To use a warm compress, soak a thick wash cloth in warm water, squeeze it to get rid of running water and press it on the affected part for 5-15 minutes. Repeat this twice a day.
Try natural products – tea tree oil is a good example of natural products hailed for their abilities to reduce inflammation and fight off bacterial infections. Essential oils, on the other hand, excel in soothing irritated skin. When using tea tree oil for cellulitis, it is important that it be diluted with carrier oil such as coconut oil to avoid skin irritation. Take caution when using natural products before consulting a doctor. This is especially for periorbital cellulitis treatment.
Prevention
Once you have sustained a form of injury that leaves the skin broken, there are a number of precautions you should consider taking:
Avoid direct contact – there are more bacteria on our skins than we can count. In fact, staph bacteria, the strain mostly responsible for cellulitis lives on human skin. Exposing an injured skin area to these bacteria is almost guaranteed to end up in an infection.
Avoid exposure – bacteria can only cause cellulitis once inside the skin. By keeping an injured area protected, you will largely keep the harmful microbes from entering. This is especially when preventing or dealing with cellulitis on finger, hands or feet.
Always remember to clean – the simple form of bacteria allows them to multiply in numbers in a very short duration. This makes it necessary to keep cleaning an injured skin area, preferably with an anti-bacterial soap or agent.
Keep from contaminated surfaces – overcrowded places are usually very contaminated. Not only can you pick different types of microbes from surfaces but also from direct skin to skin contact. When such places and surfaces cannot be avoided, other measures such as covering the injured area will help.
Other practices that may help include:
Keeping the affected organ active to keep it from getting stiff
Managing the pain with over the counter pain medications
Avoiding tight clothing
Keeping the skin well moisturized to avoid conditions such as eczema and psoriasis
Wearing gloves especially when working outdoors or indoors with harsh chemicals
Wearing socks and well-fitting footwear

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a potentially dangerous bacterial infection that affects superficial and soft tissues of skin. It mostly is caused by staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria. Both males and females can be affected. In most cases, the infection develops in the lower legs, face and arms. Scrotal, lymphedema and perineal cellulitis can also occur.
Symptoms appear superficially and systematically. They begin with the affected skin becoming red and swollen. If not treated, general signs of spreading infection may manifest. Such signs include fever and chills.
A localized cellulitis infection is not that dangerous. It becomes deadly once infection has spread into the blood and other body parts, or causes necrosis. The good thing is that treatment options are available. In fact, more than 90% of all patients recover fully without complications of cellulitis. This is as long as treatment is done early enough and in the right manner.
Scrotal cellulitis causes, symptoms and treatments
Scrotal cellulitis is usually very painful and may spread to the penis or perirectal area. It often spreads fast.
Causes
Cellulitis of the scrotum is often caused by streptococcus bacteria. Unlike staphylococcus, these bacteria do not require a broken part of skin to reach soft skin tissues. They travel through blood from other infected areas. Common infections caused by hemolytic bacteria responsible for scrotal cellulitis include tonsillopharyngitis, pneumonia and otitis media. In most cases, infections in the upper respiratory tract cause orbital cellulitis symptoms, or cellulitis lip/facial infections.
[RELATED]
Regardless, cellulitis on the scrotum can also result from a wound, ulcer or any other form of skin injury. Insect bites/stings and surgery are other examples of bacteria sources.
Symptoms
Swelling is the main sign of cellulitis, including scrotal cellulitis. It is caused by accumulation of fluid between skin layers located at the root of penis. The swelling is so intense that it blocks blood supply to penile and scrotal skin. This can lead to death of the affected skin or gangrene.
There also will be signs of redness, warmth and tenderness. The problem is that these signs may not be easily noticeable due to location of infection. Without treatment, systematic symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches and diarrhea may develop.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is often required to rule out other possible causes of infection. It also helps confirm the nature of pathogen causing infection. Diagnosis can be done by physically examining the patient, taking blood test, using mass /fluid cultures or with imaging tests. Pictures taken with imaging tests such as MRIs are particularly important before removing collected fluid.
Treatment is done with surgery and antibiotics. Surgical incision is done to drain accumulated fluid. This is very important if gangrene is to be prevented. A needle and syringe may used as an alternative.
Antibiotics are medications that fight bacteria. Amoxicillin for cellulitis is a good example. Strep bacteria have a tendency to spread very rapidly. If not treated with antibiotics, they may cause death to fat tissue on the scrotum. Oral medicines are used in most cases. If the infection is unresponsive, IV antibiotics will be given.
Lymphedema cellulitis causes, symptoms, treatments and prevention
Lymphedema cellulitis occurs when severe cellulitis infection causes damage to the lymphatic system. This results in the condition known as lymphedema.
What is lymphedema?
Lymphedema is derived from two words, lymph and edema. Lymph fluid is the fluid that circulates throughout the body, picking waste materials and pathogens. These are then filtered by the lymph nodes and removed appropriately. Like blood, lymph fluid circulates through vessels. Obstruction or damage to these vessels may make it difficult for lymph fluid to circulate normally. This leads to accumulation of the fluid mostly in lower legs due to gravity. Edema is the clinical term for swelling.
Cellulitis and lymphedema
Cellulitis develops in tissues of skin located beneath the epidermis. It is for this reason that cellulitis is not contagious like other bacterial conditions. So is cellulitis contagious? Since the epidermis sits on top of the bacteria colony causing infection, the condition cannot be passed through direct contact. As a localized infection confined to the skin, cellulitis doesn’t cause or encourage lymphedema. Problems set in when infection spreads to the lymphatic system.
[RELATED]
As mentioned earlier, it is the work of the lymphatic system to collect pathogens from their colonies and direct them to lymph nodes where they can be eliminated. But it doesn’t always work that easily. Infection can develop in the lymphatic nodes or vessels themselves. Resulting necrosis can severely damage the system such that it is unable to efficiently circulate lymph fluid throughout the body. When that happens, lymphedema will have developed.
Symptoms
Lymphedema is characterized by chronic swelling. The swelling is usually more noticeable on the lower legs. It may also occur in the arms, chest and head.
Cellulitis is characterized by swelling and redness. Mostly, there will be evidence of a recent injury on the skin. This is however not always the case. Strep bacteria can travel through blood to different parts of the body. This is commonly seen in orbital cellulitis where a sinus infection extends to eyes.
Once infection has spread to the lymphatic system, symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, diarrhea, headaches may develop. Swollen areas may also develop dark marks which indicate necrosis.
Treatment
Lymphedema is not curable. Like other such conditions, treatment aims at managing the condition rather than curing it. Treatment options include:
Exercises – light exercises encourage circulation of lymph fluid that has accumulated in certain body areas. Strenuous activities such as walking for long should be avoided since they increase swelling.
Massage – there are some massage techniques that may succeed in moving lymphatic fluid towards lymph nodes. A massage therapist specialized in these techniques can be approached for help.
Bandaging – compressing muscles around swollen areas may help reduce the swelling. This can be done with special types of bandages or with tight clothing. A professional should be approached before application.
Surgery – surgery doesn’t produce very good results. Nowadays, doctors are using surgery to remove some fat in severely swollen areas.
Cellulitis treatment is done with antibiotics. In most cases, oral medicines to be taken for 7-10 days are given. Severe infections may require IV antibiotics. In this case, patients will be treated in the hospital for few days.
Prevention measures for cellulitis revolve around keeping wounds from becoming infected. Unless bacteria reach soft tissues, cellulitis cannot develop. Open wounds should be kept clean, dry and bandaged. You can also try home treatments such as elevating areas above the heart to encourage lymphatic fluid flow. Other home treatments that may help include warm compress, resting and use of remedies like tea tree oil. Home remedies are particularly helpful in treatment for cellulitis in the leg.
Perineal cellulitis causes, symptoms and treatments
Perineal cellulitis is an infection that causes inflammation in fat tissue of the skin between the pubic arch and tail bone. It can be localized or extend from perianal cellulitis. This type of cellulitis can be a source of much discomfort and pain.
Causes
The main cause of perineal cellulitis is bacteria. Sources of bacteria include:
Other infections
Skin injuries
Insect bites/stings
Surgeries
For bacteria to cause cellulitis, they have to reach the soft tissues of the skin. It is for this reason that signs of cellulitis first show up around a recently injured area of the skin. However, some bacteria types can spread from other infections. This means that cellulitis can develop with signs of recent injury. This type of cellulitis spreads much more quickly.
[RELATED]
Factors such as poor hygiene, a weak immune system, humid weather and skin conditions like eczema are considered risk factors. Risk factors do not necessarily cause a disease but make it more likely to develop.
Symptoms
Early symptoms occur on the perineal area. They include redness, warmth, swelling and tenderness. The area may also feel tightened and hardened. Sometimes, patients will experience signs of infections such as sore throat or tonsillitis prior to a perineal infection. In this case, there will be no injured skin area.
Due to accumulation of fluid in a pocket between skin layers in the perineal area, patients may experience signs of gangrene. This is where some muscles or tissues don’t get enough blood supply. This results in color changes, numbness and death of tissue.
If infection extends to the anus, symptoms may include:
Blood stained stool
Itchiness
Pain during bowel movements
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is done by reviewing the patient’s medical history and symptoms. For confirmation, the following tests may be ordered:
Blood test – reveals the number of white blood cells in blood. During infections, more white blood cells are produced.
Cultures – mass or fluid cultures may be taken. They help rule out conditions such as eczema, psoriasis and yeast infections. All of these are not bacterial.
Imaging tests – pictures may be taken with x-rays, MRIs or CT scans. This is especially if surgery is required during treatment. Pictures may also be used to rule out physical injuries, such as cases of cellulitis elbow.
To remove accumulated fluid and any dead tissue, surgery has to be done. Doctors sometimes drain accumulated fluid with a needle and syringe.
Cellulitis requires treatment with antibiotics. Most patients are treated with oral medicines, to be taken for 7-10 days. For severe infections, antibiotics will be given intravenously. Follow-up is necessary during treatment period. Sometimes, complications such as cellulitis sepsis can occur. This is where medications meant to treat cellulitis trigger inflammation all over the body.
When to see a doctor for cellulitis treatment
Removing cellulitis completely can be disappointingly hard. This is especially if the infection has spread. Use of topical agents and home treatments may mitigate symptoms but will not completely remove infection.
[RELATED]
See your doctor if you suspect that you have contracted cellulitis. Patients who receive early treatment recover by the second day of using antibiotics such as Keflex for cellulitis. Regardless, medications should be taken according to guides provided by a doctor.
A potential cellulitis home remedy like tea tree oil or coconut oil may help but should not be used for complete treatment.
Note that cellulitis doesn’t always develop after a recent skin injury. It is for example possible for a tonsillar infection to spread to the lower body and cause scrotal cellulitis.

[post_content] => Warts on the genital region and skin tags are among the most common skin conditions today. It is unlikely that you will go your whole life without experiencing a single one of them.
There quite a number of differences that can be identified when comparing these conditions. This should not fool you however. In fact, most untrained persons can't successfully tell one from the other.
Before we get down to examining the most common differences, it is important to point out that pictures and images are a great tool that can help you tell one from the other.
What is the difference between genital warts and skin tags?
The main difference between genital warts and skin tags revolves around the cause and appearance. All warts are caused by HPV virus. This is not the same virus that causes herpes on the penis and genitals. Skin tags, on the other hand, arise when two body parts are in contact with one another and produce friction. This includes friction felt during sexual intercourse. It is a main cause of skin tags on the genitals. Any factor that will contribute to these causes will definitely result in either warts or skin tags.
[RELATED]
When it comes to appearance, skin tags are more like projections which are connected to the skin by a skinny stalk. This stalk can be easily cut with a razor or a pair of scissors. They take the color of the skin. Warts on the other hand are not projections but skin growths. Their mass is evenly distributed. While some may appear a bit raised, most are flattened on the part of skin they occur. Upon touch, they feel very soft and fleshly. Warts too are skin-colored.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; what causes them
Sexual intercourse is the main mode of transmission when it comes to genital warts. An infected person can pass the virus even when they don't show the symptoms. Since it is a viral infection, wart removal can only be done to get rid of the symptoms, namely the the skin growths, but not the virus. In fact, recurrent attacks will continue to occur throughout one’s life.
Skin tags are not typical infections. They in fact will not cause swollen lymph nodes or even pain unless physically injured. When frequent friction is sustained on a part of the body such as the buttocks, inner thighs, under arm and such, a projection will form. It can continue getting bigger with time.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; identifying them in pictures
If you are to take close-up pictures, genital warts will resemble cauliflowers and should not be confused with genital pimples. Areas around the anus, on the penis shaft, vaginal walls, vulva and penis tip are the most probable areas to find them.
[RELATED]
Although they may occur on the cervix, chances are high that they will then spread to the outside of the vagina.
Skin tags are unpredictable in regards to where they will occur. In pictures, they should resemble a literal skin-colored tag.
How to treat skin tags and genital warts
While some treatment methods can be used for both, genital warts may need medically prescribed medications to fight the virus.
Treatments for genital warts aim to inhibit the spread of the causal virus and at the same time get rid of the skin growths themselves.
Skin tags treatment methods only aim to get rid of the growths and not the cause. In both cases, clinical treatment may be necessary where home remedies have failed to work.
[RELATED]
Remedies such as tea tree oil can be tried on both. They are effective especially for skin tags on the face and other sensitive areas. There also are over the counter removal kits which can be used for the same removal purpose.
Are skin tags and genital warts contagious?
Skin tags do not pass from one person to another. They also do not spread to other body parts courtesy of an initial infection.
Genital warts are, on the other hand, very contagious. They can spread to other people or to other body parts. Just like with herpes, the virus takes advantage of open sores or cracks on the skin for entry points. It is for this reason that it is possible to contract herpes on the leg and other unlikely parts such as the shoulders.

[post_content] => In normal cases, warts and skin tags will take on the color of the skin. Moles, on the other hand, can appear black, tan, pink or even red. The important thing is to keep checking that a certain skin growth doesn’t continually change its appearance.
It occasionally happens that moles, skin tags or warts may turn black, with or without treatment. Most people start to worry when that happens, and for a good reason. Skin growths turning black can be a sign of serious problems such as melanoma, a deadly skin cancer. But they can also be indications that a skin growth is finally dying off.
Remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for canker sore treatment, can be used to hasten the healing process and inhibit spread.
What does it mean when a wart turns black?
Pictures and images show that a wart or warts in a cluster can turn black. Here, the entire wart or the whole area covered by a cluster of the warts will also turn black. Basically, it will appear as a large darkened spot or patch.
So what does it mean when a wart turns black? In most cases, it is an indication that a wart has reached its final stages and is finally dying off. This can happen naturally or after treatment.
[RELATED]
Normally, warts last between 6 months and 2 years without treatment to get rid of warts. In that time, the immune system will fight off the virus and cause a natural demise to the warts. Before they are shed from the body, the warts will turn black and fall off the skin.
Plantar warts often turn black before healing. Since plantar warts mostly appear inside the skin of the sole, much like a callus, they will leave a hole behind once healed. It is very important that treatment is continued even after warts have turned black and no longer hurt. Until they have fallen off the skin, they still can be spread.
If a wart turns black and continues to be painful for more than 2 weeks, have a doctor check the same. It could be an infection of some kind.
Note that there is a difference between herpes sores and warts. For example, herpes on the face will form open sores and may not persist longer than warts.
What is the meaning of a skin tag turning black overnight?
You might wake up one day to a skin tag turned black overnight. It shouldn't be something to keep you up at night, though.
For example, the same thing that causes hemorrhoids can turn skin tags black. Body parts prone to a lot of friction such as the anal region are susceptible to black skin tags. As friction and pressure are exerted on the tags, blood vessels are likely to become constricted, leading to blood clots.
Treatment options such as laser, cryotherapy and remedies used against genital skin tags can also cause skin tags to turn black. In fact, any treatment method that works by cutting off blood supply into the skin tag will turn it black.
[RELATED]
Basically, skin tags turning black is an indication that the tag is healed and will fall off the skin in due time. It is not an absolute must that it turns completely black. Some will merely turn reddish before detaching from the skin.
In two weeks or less, a black skin tag should fall off the skin. If that period is exceeded, blackened skin tags can be an indication of some infection. A doctor or a dermatologist should be consulted in that case.
Important information on a mole turned black
Some moles are black from the very beginning. Some may turn black afterwards. Depending on other factors that we will discuss here, a mole that has turned black can be normal or a sign of melanoma.
The initial cause that resulted in the formation of a black mole can encourage it to turn even darker. For example, continued exposure to UV rays can make moles more darkly pigmented or lead to the formation of other dark moles.
Some moles naturally change color or are multi-colored. Whatever the case, changes should not be frequent or rapid.
Some infections or infestations may cause scarring on the moles and turn them black. For example, scabies in humans is likely to cause some forms of scarring. If they attack a spot where a mole is located, they can contribute to it turning black.
Signs that a mole that has turned black is cancerous
It is important that you get information on the signs that will indicate a mole that has turned black is cancerous. In fact, you might want to compare before and after images/pictures of your moles to identify any observable changes.
[RELATED]
For best results, use a full mirror every day after your bath to examine your moles.
Here are the common signs that a mole that turned black is cancerous:
It is not symmetrical. The mole will have two unequal halves
The edges or borders are irregular. Normally, a mole will be circular with well defined borders
Keeps changing color or has multiple colors. Although some normal moles will appear in different colors, they should be consistent and not appear overnight or in patches
Large sized spots than measure more than 6 mm in diameter. If you notice any increment in size and mass, see a doctor immediately. Rapid growth is a common feature in cancerous skin growths
Lastly, a mole should maintain appearance, shape and size for significantly long enough. You should not wake up one morning to find that your mole has suddenly changed in size or color.
How to treat a mole, skin tag or wart that has turned black
It is likely that you are already under some treatment if any of the above named skin growths were to turn black. If not, you may not even need to start treatment.
For skin tags, they are not contagious. If they are not painful or infected, you can leave them to fall off the skin. Remedies such as tea tree oil and castor oil can hasten this process. For warts, you will need to continue treatment even when they have turned black. This is mainly meant to avoid spread. For moles, if you are not certain that they are not cancerous, treatment should be done by a qualified doctor in a clinic after diagnosis.

[post_content] => Common skin growths such as moles, skin tags and warts usually heal on their own even without clinical treatment. Just like canker sores, waiting for them to heal naturally can take longer than you are willing to wait. This is bearing in mind that they can be a source of both discomfort and embarrassment.
Doctors will usually diagnose a skin growth after a physical examination. For moles and warts, a shave biopsy may be needed to affirm that they are not cancerous or infected.
The actual cost of treatment will depend on the location and number of skin growths to be treated. Doctors will discuss the same before going ahead with removal. It is important that you check and see if your insurance plan will cover the cost. Most skin growth removal treatments are considered aesthetic and are not covered by insurance plans.
How do doctors remove moles; what type of doctor removes moles
Even a regular doctor can remove or diagnose cancerous moles. You can consider calling and ask if a certain hospital or clinic offers the removal procedures for moles.
However, a certified dermatologist is the best doctor to see for mole removal. They can remove moles on any part of the body and also advise what to do in case of cancerous moles.
[RELATED]
And how do doctors remove moles? There are about 3 main methods that doctors use to remove moles. They include:
Burning – this is not the literal burning you may be thinking of. Here, a current is run through a wire and used to generate heat. The wire is then used to burn off the top layers of the mole.
Incision – a minor surgery is carried out to shave the moles. Since some moles may be rooted deep into the skin, the doctor may need to remove some surrounding skin. The surgery requires use of a local anesthetic.
Freezing them off – this is a very popular removal technique. It is also used to get rid of warts and skin tags at home. Here, a very cold substance is used to kill the moles off, and they will then detach from the skin with time.
A doctor may also suggest some creams or home remedies such as used for herpes throat treatment to speed up mole removal.
How do doctors remove skin tags; what kind of doctor to see?
Skin tags are easy to remove. In fact, you can do it at home with remedies such as tea tree oil. In case of infected or very large skin tags, you may need to see a doctor for removal.
Skin tags can be removed in general hospitals or private clinics. However, a dermatologist will likely get the job done more effectively, as they are specialists. This is especially true for skin tags occurring on the face or for infected red skin tags.
So, how do doctors remove skin tags? Like moles, skin tags can be removed by cutting them off, burning them, freezing and use of laser therapy. Laser therapy sees the stalk on which the tags attach on the skin poisoned and killed off. With time, the tags will fall off the skin.
[RELATED]
Some doctors will use a combination of removal options for better results. For example, a doctor can freeze the skin tags using liquid nitrogen. After that, they will prescribe a cream, gel or pad containing a corrosive agent. Salicylic acid is a good example of corrosive agents used in such gels and creams.
Clinical methods to remove skin tags fast usually leave a scar. Incision and burning for example will almost guarantee scarring. It is for this reason that freezing and use of salicylic acid is generally preferred.
How do doctors remove warts; genital warts removal in a doctor’s office
If you are certain that it is warts you are dealing with, you may want to visit a doctor’s office for strategic treatment methods. You can succeed in removing even genital warts at home. The problem is that they will keep coming back if the root cause is not addressed.
A doctor will most likely choose to freeze warts, just the same way it is done in skin tags and moles. Laser therapy and burning can also be used but not commonly. Rarely will the warts be surgically cut off, especially in the case of genital warts.
Since the virus that causes warts hides in the body even when there are no symptoms, medications to avoid recurrent outbreaks are usually given in a clinic.
You will also be given some medications or guidelines to ensure that you do not spread the warts to healthy people near you. Unlike skin tags and moles, warts are very contagious.
During treatment, warts will turn black and fall off the body. Even when that happens, medications and treatment should not be stopped until the warts fall off the body completely. It is the same thing that happens when taking medicine for ringworm. You have to keep taking it until the prescribed period is over.
How do doctors remove genital warts?
Unlike plantar warts on the foot, genital warts can be a bit difficult to treat. This is on top of the fact that most people are not willing to get clinical treatment for the same, due to embarrassment.
[RELATED]
Depending on what kind of doctor you have visited, the warts can be burned, frozen, poisoned with laser or trimmed with a scalpel.
You can also be given prescribed medications to fasten the healing process or control spread. Except for in the case of cutting them off, most wart removal methods will require more than one application.
How do doctors freeze remove warts?
To freeze warts, liquid nitrogen is used. Since the substance is extremely cold, it kills off most of the warts and their blood vessels.
There are some kits available that you can use to freeze warts at home. They are not as effective as the procedure done in a doctor’s office.
How do doctors remove moles, skin tags and warts; cost in a doctor’s office
Depending on what type of doctor or clinic you are having the skin growths removed, the cost will vary. On average, the removal cost falls anywhere between $100 and $300.
You can always have the doctor discuss the cost during consultation and after examination.

[post_content] => A mole, skin tag or even a wart appearing anywhere on the skin should generally be painless. Different causes and predisposing factors are responsible for these skin conditions. However, similar causes can turn them painful or make them change in color and shape.
Skin tags will rarely turn into cancer even when painful. Painful or injured warts will increase the chances of spreading but also will rarely end up in cancer. Moles are different. If they become painful and experience sudden and persistent changes in growth, they really should be checked in a doctor's office.
Treatments done at home can be effective but in some cases will end up in painful sores that call for even more medical attention. For people with conditions such as diabetes and hemophilia, practices such as cutting off skin growths should not be done at home. They can lead to excess bleeding or skin ulcers.
What does a painful mole on the back and other body parts mean
A mole is formed when melanocytes bundle in a single spot. Melanocytes are the cells that make the skin appear the way it does in regards to color. Factors such as too many UV rays can force the cells to spread and possibly accumulate in a single spot. When this happens, the affected spot will have a darker pigmentation. That is what a mole is. Other factors such as accumulated blood vessels in a single spot can still result in a red mole.
[RELATED]
Like any other part of the skin, moles can sustain injuries. They have blood vessels and nerve endings. Therefore, any injury sustained on them will cause pain in the mole. Injuries can be caused by cuts when shaving or any external trauma of that kind. Such injuries should heal in 2 weeks or less.
A painful mole can still be a sign of melanoma. This is a type of cancer of the skin that is most deadly. Although only 1 in every 10 or more moles will end up in such cancer, chances should not be taken. Following are the characteristics of normal moles that can help you identify a cancerous mole before it develops into later stages:
Measures less than quarter of an inch
It should have regularly defined edges
Most are round
It should be evenly colored
Some are raised while some appear flat on the skin
Any of the above features should be maintained for a significant period of time. Although most moles keep evolving, there should never come a time that too many changes occur in a very short duration of time.
See a doctor should a painful mole persist more than 14 days.
Can a painful skin tag on buttocks be treated?
It is common for a painful skin tag to appear on the buttocks and other areas where constant friction or pressure is sustained. The same can happen to skin tags on the finger or on the thumb. Such skin tags are prone to picking, catching, and other sources of trauma.
A painful skin tag can also appear to darken overnight. This is mainly caused by clotted blood inside the skin tags. The condition can be painful and worrying. If left untreated, the tag will run out of blood supply and will fall off in less than 2 weeks. It is not a sign of cancer at all.
[RELATED]
When it comes to treatment, the best way to remove a painful skin tag on the buttocks or related areas is incision. Here, the tag will be surgically removed by a doctor, using a scalpel. A doctor may also decide to use a combination of removal techniques such as cryotherapy and burning. All of these options will depend on the location and the size of the tag.
At home, the same can be removed with over the counter kits used for wart removal or with home remedies. The most important thing is to ensure that the injured or painful skin tag does not act as an entry point for bacteria and other infections such as herpes.
What causes a painful wart after treatment?
Warts form when HPV virus is active. They appear as soft raised or flat growths on the affected parts of the body. Without treatment, it can take between 6 months and 2 years for the immune system to fight them off the body.
In normal conditions, warts should not cause pain but are often itchy. In fact, it is the urge to keep scratching them that will ultimately lead to a painful wart.
A wart can also get painful after treatment. Since they are generally very soft, treatment methods can cause slight injuries to the warts. As it is with any other body part, injuries will be felt as pain.
A doctor will most likely choose to freeze the painful wart. This kills both the blood vessels and nerve endings on the wart. Practically speaking, the wart will then be dead and will fall off in a matter of days or a few weeks.
What is the best treatment for genital warts and painful sores?
Since warts are viral, it is practically a guarantee that they will re-appear even after treatment. Most of the available treatment options mainly focus on getting rid of the visible warts but not the cause. The problem is that viral infections never clear out of the body completely after the initial infection.
[RELATED]
Nowadays, doctors are making use of treatment drugs that boost the immune system and in the process may eradicate genital warts and painful sores. For example, Dermisil is gaining a lot of popularity as an immune strengthener. You can ask your doctor for such medications. They generally give you the ability to resist re-current wart attacks and also reduce the chances of developing painful infected warts.
Chances are high that a painful genital wart will be spread to sexual partners. In fact, it is not even necessarily a key factor that you engage in active sexual intercourse to pass the HPV virus, if you or your partner has open wart sores.
Can a painful wart on foot be spread on thumb or finger?
A wart on the foot is referred to as a plantar wart. A painful wart on the foot is referred to as a verruca. As you may suspect, the pain is usually caused by injuries sustained in parts of the feet that the warts appear on.
A plantar wart on the heel is almost guaranteed to be painful, especially when walking. Rather than being raised, such a wart will appear pressed into the skin of the sole and appear more like a scar than a skin growth. With time, it will feel like a cyst and may even alter both posture and gait.
A painful wart on the foot can spread and appear on the thumb or hands. If, for example, you are to walk barefooted in the bathroom or a wet floor, anyone with open sores or cracks in their feet who walks the floor after you will catch the virus upon contact.
The warts can also appear on the fingers after frequenting picking and scratching. Any cracks or openings on the finger will certainly act as entry points for the causal virus for the warts.
You are advised to maintain hygienic practices such as washing your hands with antiseptic soaps after touching or picking at warts. In fact, avoid any chances of touching open warts sores. They are most contagious when infected.
Home remedies to treat painful plantar warts and warts on the finger
Home remedies are a great option, both to treat and to curb the spread of a painful plantar wart. Apple cider vinegar for skin tags for example has antiviral properties. It can be used to stop the spread of the wart virus. Caution should be taken when using this remedy, for it can irritate and cause a lot of pain on open sores.
[RELATED]
Castor oil can also be used with baking soda to keep the warts from spreading. Of all remedies to be used at home, tea tree oil is perhaps the best to use against warts. It is very gentle on the skin but still has the antiviral and anti-inflammation properties.
Aloe Vera is a common ingredient in ringworm medications. It can be applied on painful warts to reduce the chances of spread and infections. You may  that remedies to be used at home work best when used in combinations. For example, you can use essential oils together with cold compress or over the counter removal kits.

[post_content] => Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the superficial skin layer and soft tissues. It is mostly caused by bacteria, but other pathogens can be responsible. Most people get cellulitis-causing bacteria through open wounds, burns, abrasions and other forms of skin injuries.
Early cellulitis symptoms appear on the skin. They include redness and swelling. Without treatment, symptoms of systematic illness usually occur. While the condition mostly occurs in the lower legs, face and arms, the breasts, stomach, back, buttocks and umbilical cord can also be affected. See what is cellulitis and what is facial cellulitis for comparison.
Patients will in most cases recover fully without complications if timely treatment is done. Without treatment, cellulitis can spread very rapidly and prove dangerous. Infection may for example spread to the lungs, blood or brain.
Cellulitis on breast causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the breast develops on the skin. Unlike most cellulitis cases, it mostly occurs as a complication of breast cancer treatments. This makes its particularly dangerous since cancer patients often have weakened immunity. Infection can also result from breast surgery.
Cellulitis occurs when bacteria reaches soft tissues of the skin. While infection develops deeper in the skin, symptoms also involve upper layers. Bacteria enter through skin injuries such as cuts and open wounds. It is also not uncommon for cellulitis to be caused by an insect bite or sting.
[RELATED]
During breast cancer treatment, it may require that several lymph nodes be removed if malignancy has spread. Lymph nodes play a crucial part in fighting infections. Their removal predisposes a patient to bacterial infections among other conditions. It is for this reason that breast cancer patients often develop cellulitis during treatment.
Bacteria can also be introduced into breast skin during surgeries to enlarge, repair or reduce breasts. It is only in rare cases that skin injuries will be responsible for breast cellulitis.
Symptoms
First symptoms show up shortly after contracting infection. Most of them are confined to skin areas surrounding a recent injury. They include:
Swelling
Redness
Pain
Warmth
Tenderness
Rash
Tightening
Hardening
Not long afterwards, other signs may appear, depending on treatment measures put in place. They include:
Red streaking
Oozing clear fluid or pus
Fever
Chills
Sudden drop in blood pressure
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Swollen lymph nodes
Darkening or red spots on swollen areas
These symptoms are signs that infection is spreading. Treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Otherwise, patients can go to shock or even succumb to complications of cellulitis, including orbital cellulitis symptoms. Note that redness, pain and swelling can also be signs of inflammatory breast cancer. It is therefore better to get medical diagnosis the moment you notice sudden changes in your breast.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is done by analyzing symptoms and patient’s medical history. If necessary, a doctor will order other tests such as blood tests and imaging tests.
Treatment is primarily done with antibiotics. Most cellulitis symptoms will have improved in 2 days. However, medications are usually prescribed for up to 10 days. This is to completely get rid of infections. Medications should be taken according to doctor’s guides even after symptoms have disappeared.
[RELATED]
Cellulitis on the breast can be prevented by keeping wounds clean, dry and bandaged. When planning for breast surgery, discuss with your doctor if you can be treated as an outpatient. This is advisable because the chances of getting infected in a hospital are higher.
Cellulitis on stomach causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the stomach occurs externally, that is, on the skin rather than in the stomach. It is a bacterial infection common in recently injured skin areas.
Causes
It is not common but it is possible to have a deep skin injury or a persistent one on the stomach. Such an injury could be accidental or a result of surgery. Sometimes, staphylococcus bacteria or other bacteria types may invade soft tissues through such injuries and cause cellulitis infection. Skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis are considered risk factors, much like athlete’s foot is a risk factor for cellulitis ankle infection.
Symptoms
Symptoms of cellulitis on the stomach mostly show up around the affected area at first. Surrounding skin swells and becomes red. Unlike a physical injury or a bruise, neither the redness nor the swelling improves with time. Shortly afterwards, affected areas will feel hot and tender. This is caused by increased level of activities in the skin as bacteria divide and immune cells fight them off. Pus is usually the end product of these activities. An abscess may form as the produced pus collects in a pocket-like cavity.
Bacteria do not stop at quickly dividing. Some release toxic substances that kill surrounding fat tissue. These are known as "flesh eating bacteria." They are the cause of skin darkening that may be noticed on severely infected areas. Other bacteria break free into circulatory system. There, they release toxins that cause wide spread blood poisoning. Severe blood poisoning can send patients to shock or cause systematic organ failure.
Symptoms that may be felt throughout above described process include:
Fever
Chills
Diarrhea
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Headaches
Confusion
Rise of body temperature
Difficulty breathing
Diagnosis and treatment
Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask for your medical history. To confirm diagnosis, blood test, fluid cultures and pictures with imaging tests may be taken.
Treatment is done with antibiotics. Most patients will be treated as outpatients. Medications are usually taken for 7-10 days. Check with your doctor if symptoms do not improve about 48 hours after the first dosage. Some cellulitis infections require IV antibiotics.
Cellulitis on back causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the back is not as common as on the lower legs or face. However, it can be hard to diagnose at home.
Causes
Both staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are common causes of cellulitis on the back. Staph infection mostly occurs around a wound or an abscess. Strep infection often develops as an extension of another infection. This is because streptococcus bacteria spread more quickly. A good example is periorbital cellulitis which is mostly caused by strep bacteria spreading from the sinuses. See what is periorbital cellulitis for details.  Sometimes, cellulitis on the back can result from an insect or animal bite.
Symptoms
Symptoms will first appear on a localized area of the skin. Without treatment, systematic symptoms will follow.
It starts with redness and swelling. Pain may be felt when the swollen areas are poked. Like most bacterial infections, affected area may feel hot and become tender. This may be accompanied by hardening and tightening. On close inspection, mild orange peeling and small blisters filled with fluid may be noticed.
Systematic symptoms start mildly but soon become severe. Fever and chills are most common. Patients may also feel generally tired, have rapid pulse rate and lose appetite. Severe symptoms such as due to blood poisoning include shock and sudden drop in blood pressure. As infection spreads to nearby lymph bodes, the nodes and lymphatic vessels will swell.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is done by analyzing symptoms and patient’s medical history. To rule out other conditions, the doctor may order a blood test or take a fluid culture.
Antibiotics are used for treatment. In most cases, oral medicines will completely get rid of the infection. This usually takes 7-10 days. Sometimes, cellulitis is caused by resistant bacteria that don’t respond to commonly used antibiotics. Patients should therefore check with their doctors if symptoms don’t improve after 2 days. IV antibiotics will be given in that case. This requires that patients be treated as inpatients for up to 3 days.
[RELATED]
At home, recovery can be sped up with topical medications and home treatments such as warm compress and tea tree oil. Home remedies are better suited in treatment for cellulitis in the leg.
Umbilical cellulitis infection causes, symptoms and treatments
Umbilical cellulitis results from an infection known as omphalitis. The infection develops on the umbilical stump. It is most common in babies and in underdeveloped areas or countries.
Causes
Staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are responsible for up to 80% of all cases. In most babies, the umbilical stump heals without complications. Bacteria picked up during delivery or when the cord is cut sometimes end up causing infection. Risk factors include:
Maternal infections
Children born with low weight
Separation of umbilical cord before or during delivery
Complicated deliveries
Symptoms
At first, typical symptoms of superficial cellulitis will develop. They include redness, swelling, tenderness and warmth. Infection may soon spread to the abdominal wall and later to rest of the body. This will result in signs of systematic illness such as fever and chills. Since immune cells in babies are yet to gain experience in fighting bacterial infections, necrotic fasciitis may occur. This is where fat tissues are destroyed by toxins produced by bacteria.
Treatment and prognosis
In babies, antibiotics are usually given intravenously. This requires hospitalization. Surgery may be done to cut out dead tissue.
Prognosis is good for umbilical cellulitis which has not spread to the abdominal wall or caused necrotic fasciitis. More than 80% of affected babies will recover fully.
Cellulitis on buttocks causes, symptoms and treatments
Cellulitis on the buttocks is not uncommon. It can be a very painful infection and make sitting particularly difficult.
Causes
Bacteria are the usual causes of cellulitis on buttocks. Normally, bacteria are found throughout the skin where they rarely cause any trouble. Problems set in when an injury on skin allows the bacteria to reach soft tissues. Warm, moist and nutritious conditions in soft tissues allow for rapid bacterial growth and spread. This leads to infection, referred to as cellulitis.
Sometimes, you can get cellulitis from an insect or bug bite. One can also get cellulitis after surgery. People with weakened immune systems are more likely to contract bacterial infections.
Symptoms
Early symptoms are superficial and localized. They begin with the affected area becoming red, swollen, tender and hot. If not treated, mild orange peeling and small fluid blisters may appear. Bacteria usually spread quickly. This results in systematic symptoms such as fever, chills, loss of appetite and headaches. Red streaks and dark marks on the swollen area may form.
[RELATED]
Infection can gradually spread to cause perineal cellulitis. This is especially if strep bacteria are the cause. Strep bacteria make tissues unable to control the spread of infections.
Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis may be done by:
Physical exam – here, the doctor looks for typical signs of cellulitis. The patient’s medical history will be required.
Cultures – fluid or mass culture may be taken to help identify the nature of pathogen causing the infection.
Blood test – with a blood test, a doctor can document the number of white blood cells in blood. Blood tests may also be used to identify the type of bacteria being dealt with.
