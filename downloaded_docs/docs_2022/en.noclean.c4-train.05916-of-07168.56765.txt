How is HIV transmitted?
There are only a few ways HIV can be transmitted. In New Zealand, almost all HIV transmission occurs through unprotected sexual contact. There are very low rates of transmission from direct contact with blood and from mother to baby transmission.
HIV must be present in large quantities in the following bodily fluids to be infectious:
semen
mucous found in the rectum
pre-cum (the fluid that the penis produces before ejaculation)
vaginal fluids, including menstrual blood (a woman’s period)
breast milk
blood
These fluids can transmit HIV through:
unprotected sexual intercourse
from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth or
from breastfeeding, i.e., antenatal transmission or vertical transmission
from blood to blood contact, e.g., sharing injection needles while using drugs or in medical settings
HIV is not airborne and can’t be transmitted through:
Skin to skin contact, e.g., hugging
Kissing
Sharing cups, drink bottles or utensils
Other body fluids like saliva, sweat, or urine because they do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person
Because the HIV virus cannot pass through intact latex, the best way to protect yourself from HIV transmission during sexual intercourse is to wear a condom.
