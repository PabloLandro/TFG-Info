Autism Speaks founder Bob Wright’s opinion is more important than science
24 Sep
Last year the Chief Science Officer of Autism Speaks made a simple and clear statement
“Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.”
It was nice to finally see someone from Autism Speaks make a clear statement without a lot of equivocation and “leave the door open” language.
But what I think is nice and what Bob Wright, the founder of Autism Speaks, thinks is nice are two different things. The Wright family is, at least, sympathetic to the idea that vaccines cause autism (and, in at least one case, very outspoken on the idea.) So perhaps I should have been surprised when Autism Speaks put on their website Rob Ring’s statement together with a statement by Bob Wright.
Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.
Rob Ring
Chief Science Officer, Autism Speaks
Over the last two decades extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccines and autism. Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines. Vaccines are very important. Parents must make the decision whether to vaccinate their children. Efforts must be continually made to educate parents about vaccine safety. If parents decide not to vaccinate they must be aware of the consequences in their community and their local schools.
Bob Wright
Co-founder, Autism Speaks
Because why should we let the Chief Science Officer have the actual word on what Autism Speaks thinks about an issue of science? Why let a clear statement stand alone when one can leave the door open with “Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines.”
And that was sad. A sad move by Autism Speaks. A sad move by Bob Wright.
But I’ve already written about that. Why bring it up again now? Well, because a reader here alerted me to the fact that Bob Wright and Autism Speaks have expunged the statement by their science officer. If one now goes to https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/policy-statements/information-about-vaccines-and-autism, one finds only Bob Wright’s statement:
I so want Autism Speaks to be an organization I could support. And sometimes they seem to be moving in that direction. But, in the end, they are still clinging to ideas like “vaccines cause autism”, ideas that cause a lot of harm within the autism communities. And they also take a very stigmatizing approach to the discussion of autism, but that is another discussion.
Autism Speaks pretends to be a science driven organization, but they just aren’t. The founder is the founder and his opinion means more than the results of scientific studies as expressed by their own Chief Science Officer.

Autism Speaks: The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism…but doesn’t let that statement stand alone.
26 Mar
Autism Speaks has come out with some very strong statements about autism and vaccines. And the back peddled.
First, here is a statement by Robert Ring, Chief Science Officer:
Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.
Rob Ring
Chief Science Officer, Autism Speaks
In the past Autism Speaks had been sympathetic towards the idea that vaccines cause autism. More than sympathetic, some would say. Such a clear statement as above would have been unthinkable from Autism Speaks only a few years ago.
I wish they had made these statements earlier, but I am glad they are making these statements now. The vaccine hypothesis has been the most damaging idea in autism since the refrigerator mother theory. With Autism Speaks position as a well known autism organization, perhaps even fewer families will get caught in the vaccines-cause-autism trap in the future.Here’s the way the Autism Speaks vaccines and autism page looked just last year. It includes many problematic statements and concludes: “A list of publications that used VAERS information to study associations with autism can be found here“. “Here” is a link to pubmed with the search terms “vaers” and “autism”. No surprise, it’s a list that is padded out by works by Mark and David Geier. The Geiers have been performing poor research for years and have been discussed here at Left Brain/Right Brain many times.
The above statement by Mr. Ring was picked up by the press in February as it was so clear.
Next, Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks:
Over the last two decades extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccines and autism. Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines. Vaccines are very important. Parents must make the decision whether to vaccinate their children. Efforts must be continually made to educate parents about vaccine safety. If parents decide not to vaccinate they must be aware of the consequences in their community and their local schools.
Bob Wright
Co-founder, Autism Speaks
It’s a fairly stilted paragraph in my read. It comes across as though Mr. Wright is trying to appear to ride the fence while at the same time pulling back dramatically from the clear statement by Mr. Ring. Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines?
Even with that, I can’t imagine that admitting that vaccines are “important” will go over well in some circles. Close circles. Even “important” is to positive a word for some. But, seriously, here we have an invention that has saved more lives that possibly any other in medical history and we get “important”?
Yes, Mr. Wright, efforts must be made to educate parents about vaccine safety. That’s what your chief science officer did. Sadly, you can’t let Autism Speaks be a science led organization.

What Autism Awareness Means
We are often told to be “aware” of autism. But what does that do, really? With awareness comes acceptance. And for my son acceptance means being able to live his life. A few years ago, I took my son for a walk to our local shopping center. We have done this every weekend day since […]

Anti vaccine activists are angry about a new study…and they didn’t even bother to read it
This is a big piece of what the “vaccines-cause-autism” idea is built on. Really bad analyses. Another study shows up showing that vaccines don’t cause autism. People immediately jump to give talking points to their community: “ignore this study! In fact, it’s just another conspiracy to defraud you!!!!!”* But they know from history, their community […]
