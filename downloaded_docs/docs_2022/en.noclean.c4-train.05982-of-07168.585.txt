Essential Sunglasses – Beyond the Cool Factor
Audrey Hepburn Breakfast at Tiffany’s
Why do we wear sunglasses? According to a 2012 survey, nearly 90% of people believe that protecting their eyes is key to overall health. But most people who choose to wear sunglasses do so only to cut down on the sun???s glare.
There are many reasons for wearing sunglasses more often, especially when you???re enjoying the outdoors during the summer. Keep reading and we’ll breakdown why you should remember those shades.
Start at a Young Age
“Sunglasses are especially important for children,” says Dr. Stacey Filippo Tyran, optometrist at Wink Optical in Jenkintown. ???UV eye damage is cumulative over a lifetime,??? Dr. Filippo Tyran added, ???so it???s important to make wearing sunglasses a habit early in life. What???s more, children???s eyes are especially vulnerable because they???re still developing.???
??Prevent Sun-Related Health Problems
Our eyes are sensitive. Prolonged exposure to sun can lead to a variety of ailments. Some are simply painful or irritating, others can be deadly serious. Remembering to wear a pair of high quality sunglasses can help to keep you safe from the sun???s damaging rays.
Let’s start by defining what we mean by high-quality??sunglasses. Start by looking for sunglasses with 100% UVA and UVB protection. This provides full protection against the sun???s ultraviolet rays. Polarized sunglasses can reduce glare, which is nice if you???re spending a lot of time on the water. Also look for sunglasses that fully cover your eyes.
Wrap-around lenses are even better because they block out light and glare from the side, as well as the front. Besides, big sunnies are all the rage.
Now let???s look at diseases and health complications that sunglasses can help protect against.
Skin Cancer
The skin around your eyes, including your eyelids is very sensitive to sunlight. And nearly 10% of skin cancers are found near the eyes. Wearing UV-protective wraparound sunglasses with large lenses can not only protect your eyes, but they???ll protect your skin, too.
Cataracts & Glaucoma
Cataracts are cloudy areas on the eye???s lens. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, prolonged and long term exposure to the sun???s UV rays contribute to cataracts. UV exposure may also worsen the symptoms of Glaucoma, another serious eye condition that can result in blindness. Sunglasses with complete UV protection can help reduce your risk of cataracts or complications from glaucoma.
Macular Degeneration
Macular Degeneration is a condition where part of the retina, called the macula, deteriorates, causing impaired vision and in many cases, eventual blindness. Certain types of UV radiation can speed up this process, so wearing sunglasses may help protect you.
Pteryguim
Also known as surfer???s eye, pterygium is a growth on the eyeball itself. It???s usually not serious, but it can be painful and annoying. Eye drops, steroids and surgery (in advanced cases) are the most common treatments. ??But the best treatment, of course, is prevention. Doctors recommend wraparound sunglasses with UV protection, especially on cloudy days when the sun isn???t visible but its UV rays can still damage the eyes.
Protection From the Elements
The sun isn???t the only thing that can damage your eyes. Spending time outdoors, puts you at additional risk of damage from sand, dust, wind and even snow.
Snow
You might be surprised to know that spending time in the snow can be very damaging to your eyes. Snow reflects 80% of UV rays from the sun and can cause a condition known as snow blindness, where glare from the sun actually burns the cornea.??If you???re skiing, climbing snowy mountains or spending time in the snow (at any time of year), wear sunglasses. Make sure they cover and protect the bottom of your eyes, because of the reflective nature of the snow.
Sand
Getting sand in your eyes can be very painful and dangerous. Tiny grains of sand can actually scratch your eye and can cause permanent damage. Sunglasses that fully cover your eyes are a great way to keep sand out.
Wind & Dust
Spending a lot of time in windy, dusty areas can irritate and damage your eyes. Again, the best way to protect yourself is by wearing sunglasses that keep your eyes safe from the elements.
Promote Healing & Recovery??
If you???ve hadsurgery to correct your vision, you should be extra sure to wear sunglasses. Your doctor may recommend a pair for you to wear immediately after the procedure, but continuing to wear sunglasses can protect your eyes as they heal and as you adjust to your new vision. ??If you???ve had cataract surgery, eyelid repair, or another procedure to correct your vision, you???ll also benefit from wearing protective sunglasses. Ask your Philadelphia Eyeglass Labs optometrist for their opinion and recommendations.
See More & Enjoy Nature??
As important as protecting your health is, there are more good reasons to wear sunglasses more often. If you???re spending time outdoors, you???ll really benefit from wearing your sunglasses. With polarized sunglasses they’re sharper, there???s less glare, and the colors and contrast are improved.??If you enjoy fishing or spending time on the water, with polarized sunglasses you???ll be able to see through the glare on top of the water and notice fish and aquatic life that you never even knew were there!
Fewer Headaches & You’ll be More Comfortable
Bright sunlight can be a trigger for migraines and bad headaches. Wearing sunglasses can help reduce both the frequency and intensity of these painful occurrences. And even if you???re not a headache or migraine sufferer, wearing sunglasses when out in the sun can help reduce eyestrain and fatigue, meaning that you???ll just be more comfortable and enjoy your time outdoors even more.
Safe Driving & Recovery
Do sunglasses help when driving in the rain? This is a hotly debated issue, but the consensus seems to be that in light rain, during the day, the right sunglasses can improve your vision and help you to drive safer. And of course when driving into bright sunlight, sunglasses can definitely help you see better and drive more comfortably. Just make sure you don???t wear sunglasses when driving at night??? that???s not recommended and it???s not safe.
Finally. The Cool Factor
Now the fun reason. Sunglasses today have been rated the number one fashion accessory!?? Aviators, mirrored lenses, retro round, double wire, geeky and big bigger biggest have been sported by celebrities and featured on runways. ??You can even have different sunglasses for different activities, or to coordinate with different outfits. Express yourself.
Round wire frames straight from the flower-power 70’s were featured at the Spring fashion shows and are a favorite of ??models.
One of our favorite things to recommend is matching sunglasses to a protective sun hat. Your extra protected from the sun???s rays and stay cool and comfortable, all while looking fashion-forward.

Healthy Eyes for the New Year
Jeepers creepers where’d ya get those healthy peepers?
Flip the calendar, turn the page, wipe the slate clean, start fresh ??? dozens of expressions have been coined to celebrate the feeling of starting something new. You have your eyes for a lifetime. Start following these 7 simple tips in the new year and maintain healthy eyes well into your golden years.
Have an annual eye exam.??Eyes aren’t like teeth ??? there’s usually no pain if something is wrong. Many common eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic eye disease and age-related macular degeneration often have no warning signs. A dilated eye exam is the only way to detect these diseases in their early??stages.
Be cool and wear your shades. Sunglasses are a great fashion accessory – but their most important job is to protect your eyes from the sun???s ultraviolet rays. When getting sunglasses look for ones that block out 99 to 100 percent of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.
??Quit smoking or never start. Smoking is as bad for your eyes as it is for the rest of your body. Research has linked smoking to an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, cataract and optic nerve damage, all of which can lead to blindness.
Protect those peepers. Wear protective eyewear when playing sports and doing activities around the home. Employers are required to provide a safe work environment. If protective eyewear is required as a part of your job make a habit of wearing it at all times.
??Know your family???s eye health history.?? Talk to family members about their eye health history – it???s important to know if anyone has been diagnosed with an eye condition. ??Since many are hereditary this will help your optometrist determine if you are at higher risk for developing an eye disease.
??Wash, wash, wash your hands.??Prevent eye infections by washing your hands before touching ??eyes and before handling contact lenses. Teach children to avoid touching their eyes without washing their hands first. ??If you are near someone with red eye, avoid contact around your own eyes until you wash your hands first. You can minimize the likelihood of catching common bacterial or viral eye infections by using anti-infective sprays and cleansers in public areas.
??Have an eye doctor who knows you and the history of your eyes to ensure you get the right care at the right time. Stop by soon and get to know our team of on-site optometrists at Wink – your Neighborhood Optical Center.
