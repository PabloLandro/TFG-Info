Manage Your High Cholesterol with These Moves
So, you’ve been told to get your cholesterol levels back on a healthy track. You know you need to make some lifestyle changes, and perhaps you’ve even started eating different foods. But when it comes to exercise, you might be feeling lost.
Don’t sweat it--save that part for the gym. Exercise does have the power to lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol. Just remember this equation: aerobic activity + resistance training = boosted heart rate and better cholesterol levels.
Need some examples of exercise that will get your ticker pumping and kick that high cholesterol out the door? Try these:
Brisk walking: Power walking will boost your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and strengthen your heart. It can also significantly reduce your risk for stroke--more so as you pick up the pace.
High-intensity interval training: Also known as HIIT, this type of workout requires intense periods of exercise for up to eight minutes. But then you get a recovery period that lasts just as long. (Phew.) The workout continues for up to an hour. HIIT can improve aerobic fitness and cholesterol profiles, and can be modified for all fitness levels. You can even practice HIIT while cycling, swimming, or using an elliptical.
Weight lifting: It’s time to pump you up! Research suggests resistance training can improve cholesterol levels, so don’t shy away from the weight room during your next gym visit.
Healthy Change
A primary care provider (PCP) can help you make healthy changes in your life, whether you’re trying to lower your cholesterol or run your next marathon. Find out more.
