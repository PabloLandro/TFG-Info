How do I Lower Cholesterol Naturally?

Lower cholesterol plays a key role in healthful living. An excess of cholesterol in the blood can cause the arteries to clot. And this clotting of the arteries may lead to a disease known as atherosclerosis. If this continues, the blood vessel becomes diminutive to the point that it could affect the flow of the blood through the veins, thereby resulting in heart attack or stroke. Furthermore, greater damage can be experienced if you have other ailments like obesity, hypertensions, and diabetes.

And you can reduce cholesterol by cooking your food by grilling, steaming, boiling, poaching or in a microwave oven. Try to resist deep-frying foods in lard or oil. If you are serious about a diet that will reduce cholesterol levels, use canola or olive oil instead and in only small quantities.
