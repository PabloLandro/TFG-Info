Indoor Cycling Tips For Beginners
Guys…I seriously am obsessed with my cycling classes. Before I start, apparently they aren’t actually called “spin” classes because that is trademarked. So from here on out, I’ll refer to it as cycling (or try to remember to refer to it as cycling).
But anyway, I have been loving taking cycling classes at Ride + Reflect in Bernardsville, NJ. I remember taking cycling classes before and counting down the minutes until it was over (mainly because it was so hard for me), but these classes fly by. The instructors are great and push you hard, the playlists pump you up, and before you know it, the workout is over.
I’ll admit, that first class I took (and it was only a 30 min. class) was hard. I was like, “how will I survive 45 minutes of this??” But, as with any exercise such as running or lifting weights for the first time, the first day will always be hard. Once you get over that hump, you’ll feel great and get stronger each class.
While I’m obviously no expert (this is only me second month of classes at Ride + Reflect), I wanted to write a few tips for those who might want to start cycling or tried it but didn’t love it at first. If you’re a runner, check out my previous post about how cycling can make you faster.
Dress Appropriately
You will be sweating a lot. I need 2 towels on the handlebars to wipe my sweat (but I also sweat more than the average person…or at least I think so). You definitely want to be wearing a sweat wicking shirt as opposed to cotton. Go for capris or longer shorts too. I wore shorter spandex shorts once and they were riding up the whole time and distracting. I love UnderArmour and Nike tops for any workout. My favorite is actually Coach Marc’s TrainWithMarc team shirts (by Nike). I swear I sweat buckets and that shirt stays dry(ish). He sells tanks too.
Ask For Help
Don’t be afraid to tell the instructor it’s your first class. In fact, do it! The instructor will help you set up your bike specifically to your height and other factors. The great thing about Ride + Reflect is that they write down your specifications, so whenever you walk into the class, your bike is already set up for you. I know many places don’t do that, so write down your numbers or keep it in a note on your phone so that you remember. Having the right seat height is really important, especially to prevent knee strain. Same with handlebar placement and seat placement (forward or back). Also, by telling the instructor, they will give you tips on the class, fill you in on the link (position 2, position 3, etc.), and make you feel more comfortable.
Cycling Terminology
Let’s talk more about the terminology I used above…though if you don’t remember this, no worries, your instructor will fill you in. Here are a few different things you might hear:
Position 2: This means you’re out of the saddle (aka standing up) with your hands on the handlebars closest to you.
Position 3: Out of the saddle with your hands farthest away from you on the handlebars. Back is flat, hips are back.
RPMS: Rotations per minute. If your bike has a screen, it will flash RPMs. Usually instructors give you a range, like, “Ok you want to be around 90-100 RPMs.” Don’t worry if you can’t hit their numbers, I sometimes can’t either, but it gives you a goal to work towards.
Resistance: Cycling bikes come with a knob or lever to increase resistance, or how hard your legs have to work to turn the wheel. Instructors will tell you to increase resistance to go “up a hill” or increase resistance and keep the same RPMs. The higher the resistance, the harder your will be working, and the more your quads will be burning! If you can’t keep a resistance at a certain level, don’t be afraid to take a break, pedal easy for a minute or so, and then get back into it.
Here’s a handy little image I found showing hand positioning on the handlebars:

Sit In The Front
Remember in college when professors or advisors would tell you to sit in the front of the class to get better grades? Cycling is similar. Don’t be afraid to sit in the front even if you’re a beginner! By sitting in the front you will see and hear the instructor better, which is very important if it’s your first class. If you’re not comfortable with that, sit in the second row and keep your eye on other spinners to check your form or get cues from them. I usually like to sit in the front row of one of the side seats, so I don’t make awkward eye contact with the instructor lol (I hate awkward eye contact).
Go At Your Own Pace
You might be competitive by nature, like I am, but you always want to make sure you’re going at your own pace. And the great thing about cycling classes is that no one has to know what that is! No one knows what resistance you’re at or your RPMs (unless they are peeking at your monitor I suppose). Everyone is focused on themselves and their own ride. I take classes regularly with this instructor who is an avid cyclist and obviously WAY more in shape than I am. He’s like, “ok let’s crank out 120 RPMs!” and I’m pedaling all out at 100. Go at your own pace, and work your way up. Each class I’m able to add RPMs and total mileage. Just like with running, start slow and you will improve. One day you can barely run 1 mile, then you’re able to run 6 miles no problem. Cycling is the same thing.
So hopefully these tips are helpful! If you haven’t yet tried a cycling class I highly recommend it. It’s a great way to exercise indoors when the weather isn’t the best, and also a good cross-training choice for athletes. The first few classes will be challenging, but once you get into the groove of things, you will feel fit and strong.

Let’s Catch Up
I love reading the coffee date link up posts hosted by a few of my fellow fitness bloggers (find more info here). So I wanted to write my own fun little Friday post to catch you up on what’s been going on with me. If you care…keep reading, if not, no worries!
Graduation
Yesterday my little brother graduated from high school! He’s the last of us to graduate high school and will be attending our local community college (where I also work and coach) in the fall to play soccer. I love graduations. I love feeling the excitement, which is especially high at high school graduations.
Remember that feeling of being done and being so ready to head to college? Being excited to receive your orientation packets and class info…if I could go back in time and start again from any point in my life, I think it would be senior year of high school. Freshman year of college was the best year, and obviously college in general was a blast. Not a care in the world for my brother and the rest of his peers who graduated yesterday. Just ready to enjoy summer and go to college…must be nice!

Running
I had a great run on Wednesday. But Tuesday was a different story. It was 87 degrees and 80% humidity. It was drizzly when I was about to start running, then of course it stopped and the sun came out as I started which made everything hot and muggy. I could barely finish 3 miles, and ended up walking most of the last half mile. Aren’t those runs the worst? You just feel defeated and wondering “why is this so hard?”
The next day I had a tough workout on my schedule from Coach Marc: 1.5 mile warmup, 5×5 minutes at 5K effort with 1 min. break in between, 1.5 mile cooldown. Do you ever get nervous before workouts? Because I was nervous before this one. Before starting instead of visualizing running strong, I was already thinking about how the last 2-3 reps I would probably slow down and be struggling. Clearly, I really need to work on my mental game…this is a common issue. Any book recommendations or something?
Anyway, my mom and I crushed the workout! I ended up feeling great the whole run (thankfully it was a cloudy day, low humidity, slight breeze), and we completed 6 miles for the day. I love when you have a run where everything clicks, especially after a run that was really bad.
Yoga
My sister and I had the opportunity to attend a yoga class thanks to ShoeBuy this week. I will write a longer post about the event next week, but all in all it was pretty cool.
A photo posted by pattyrivas13 (@pattyrivas13) on Jun 16, 2015 at 7:11am PDT
It was supposed to be a rooftop class but since it was rainy, we went indoors. The class was led by a Pure Yoga instructor, and I thought it was tough! Mainly all the balancing poses. The next day my hamstrings were really sore from stretching them so much…is that common?
Anyway, it reminded me of how I really want to do more yoga, but I just don’t know how to fit it in my running schedule. I don’t want to do 30-45 minutes of yoga after long runs. Should I do it in the mornings? Yogis, do you find that yoga really does help with building core srength/strength in general? I know my core strength needs a lot of work since I could barely do boat pose
I also got to meet Toni from RunningLovingLiving! Always fun to meet bloggers in real life.
A photo posted by Toni (@runninglovingliving) on Jun 17, 2015 at 3:09am PDT
Any fun events for you this past week or coming up?
If you could go back in time and start your life over again from a certain point, what age would you choose?

“My Knees Hurt When I Squat”
“My knees hurt when I squat.” This is a common complaint, and one I have heard many times as a personal trainer. Because their knees hurt, people end up not doing squats at all, when in fact, squats can help you get stronger and actually decrease knee pain!
Today we are going to talk about why your knees hurt when you squat, and what you can do to fix it.
Okay, if you’ve had a knee injury in the past, then yeah, that might be contributing to your knee pain (and you should see your PT or doctor to discuss whether you should or should not do certain exercises). However, most people have muscle imbalances and weaknesses that are causing this knee pain.
One of the main culprits is not engaging the core (or simply not having core strength) during the squatting motion. As you squat, you should be hinging at the hips and moving backwards as if sitting into a chair. If you don’t, your torso will lean forward, and your knees will be at an awkward angle, causing most of the load to be on your quads…which leads to the knee pain.
Here’s great info from trainer Kevin Yates:
When you lack proper core and hip strength muscle imbalances often result in the quadriceps and lower back over working. This is one of the main reasons for knee pain during squatting.
Movements like squatting and lunging are not bad for your knees and they don’t cause injuries.
Muscle imbalances are the real problem.
One of my favorite trainers, Tony Gentilcore, has a great post about fixing your squat and avoiding knee pain. His tip, box squats, was something I practiced regularly with my clients.
Basically, you set up a box or bench behind you in the squat rack. Your goal is to squat back and touch the box with your butt before coming back up (do not actually sit on the box and then come up, you are just tapping the box).
Tapping a box or bench helps you with that movement of sitting backwards. Your weight should be on your heels and not your toes during a squat. I’ve talked about squat tips in the past, and how you can improve your form. I’ve mentioned putting a plate under your heels. Why? Because if you have a muscle imbalance or tightness, your heels might be coming up during the squat movement. Elevating your heels a bit helps you get deeper and keep the weight in your heels.
From Tony Gentilcore:
If squatting hurts your knees—and you’re not suffering from an injury—it’s because you’re making your knees do more of the work than the hips. Learning how to utilize the hips during a squat is important if you want to make them more joint-friendly. Box squats can do that.
Squats and lunges are not bad for your knees! That’s a myth similar to that of running being bad for your knees and cracking your knuckles leading to arthritis. Squats and lunges, if anything, help improve your knee health. Start working on your core strength to take the pressure off your quads and knees.
One more thing before I move on to talking about your quads…if you’re having trouble sitting back into your squat, try doing front squats and goblet squats. Since the weight is in front of your body as opposed to on your back, it will make it a bit easier for you to sit back into the squat. I talked about that in this post about squatting tips.
Moving on…another thing that might be causing your knee pain is quad weakness. If your knees hurt during walking lunges or after running, this might be why. In order to fix this, you just need to work your quad muscles a bit. Focus on exercises like the split squat, and progress to a reverse lunge. Avoid doing any forward movements like (duh) forward lunges or walking lunges…just until you build up your strength.
Here’s one of my first YouTube videos showing the split squat.
Similar with the squat, you should be going straight down NOT forward. If you are moving forward as you’re performing this you will probably feel that knee pain. Cues to repeat to yourself are: chest up, shoulders back. Your front heel should stay planted on the floor – if you come up on your toes, step your back leg further back/away from your front leg.
My dad had knee pain during running and leg exercises, but once he started doing more split squats, his knee pain disappeared. He now runs 3 miles most days! Progression ideas for this exercise (once you master the split squat) would be: reverse lunge, front foot elevated split squat, rear foot elevated split squat, step-ups, and walking lunges.
***Remember though, please talk to your PT or doctor if knee pain is something you have regularly dealt with. Of course there could be some underlying issue that is not as simple as a muscle imbalance or lack of strength.***
Do you squat regularly? Have you ever felt knee pain?

Things I’m Loving Lately
TGIF! I figured I’d do a quick and fun post about what I’m loving lately. I’ve recently discovered all of these things within the past month or so and now have been using them on a daily basis. Let’s start with some beauty products:
Lush Cosmetics
How did I not try this sooner? I had heard about Lush but only thought they made those bath bomb things. I got the Braziliant shampoo (pictured above) from them last week (for shine and moisturizing) and absolutely love it. My hair has been super dry recently and this has been helping. A shampoo bar supposedly gets about 80-100 washes, which is equivalent to 4-5 shampoo bottles, according to Lush. My mom has also tried their all-natural face masks and liked them a lot as well.
Maybelline Fit Me Foundation
I usually don’t wear foundation, but I wanted one that wasn’t super expensive, and that looked natural, especially for nights out/special occasions. This one definitely fits the bill. It matches perfectly with my skin tone, and it’s only 8 bucks! Before this I had bought one from MAC for $30, and it just didn’t match my skin tone. Why pay more than double the cost when I can get a good drugstore foundation? I also love the Revlon foundations!
Too Faced Better Than False Lashes Mascara
Obsessed with this right now. I have lashes that go straight down, so I always have to curl them. This is an issue also because I can never wear fake lashes. The fake ones who up and curl nicely, and then you can see my own lashes jutting out. This was the perfect solution. I had heard a lot about the Younique Mascara, and then found this in Sephora. You put on the black coat first, then the white one (which is this cotton-y material), and then the black coat on again. It really elongates your lashes, and no joke it does almost look like fake lashes. Try it!
Okay now let’s look at health/fitness related items:
Don Lee Farms Veggie Patties from Costco
These are so delicious. I’ve been trying to eat more meatless lately, and have been eating these for lunch some days. I usually have it with salad…which I’ll get to in my next item…
Costco Sweet Kale Vegetable Salad Kit from Costco
I couldn’t find an image that’s current and looks like the bag I buy but you can read about it through the link above. This is more of a crunchy salad, which I like. And it includes kale, broccoli, brussel sprouts, green cabbage, chicory, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. I pair this with the veggie burgers above and it is a filling and delicious salad. I usually add some honey mustard dressing on it. I eat this with lunch and dinner most days!
Tiux Compression Socks
The people at Tiux sent me a pair to try out and they’re awesome. You can pre-order one of the three socks above now and receive them this spring. I think these are a little thicker than other compression socks, which I like. I need thicker socks to run. Stay tuned for a review on these socks next week!
I like reading things people are loving at the moment, so I thought I’d write up my own post. Let me know if you have a question about any of these!
What are you loving at the moment?
What’s one makeup item you can’t live without? (Mine’s definitely eyeliner)

Week 9/52 of Training – 2015 + Workout Playlist 14
Last week’s training wasn’t the best so I’m not even going to go through day by day haha. I ran twice. It was just a busy week and the weekend was also packed, so it just didn’t happen. Oh well, this week will be better!
I did a track workout (well, on the treadmill) Tuesday, which was 6×400 meters at 8.2 (7:19 pace). This is slowly getting a bit easier…it’s still super challenging but the weird thing is that now when I run at my 5K race pace (8:20ish) that feels so much slower! I guess that’s a good thing I’m running a 5K on March 14 so we’ll see what kind of shape I’m in.
I also did a tempo workout on Thursday for 5 miles. I’ll be sharing that treadmill workout this week because it really helps the time go by faster. It’s a mix of intervals and hill runs.
Anyway, today I wanted to share a new workout playlist! I’ve been obsessed with “Honey, I’m Good” by Andy Grammer. I probably play it once every day lol. Listen to it! It’s so catchy. The rest of my picks are typical top 40 songs, but those are the ones that pump me up the most during runs.
Check out this dance crew dancing to 7/11. I wish I had moves like that! One of my 2015 goals is to take a hip hop dance class…we’ll see how that turns out
What songs are on your current playlist? Please share in the comments so I can add it to mine!

Here are some links for you to catch up on today!
Featured: Tangy Crockpot Turkey Meatballs (SlimSanity)
How good do those look? I love any kind of meatballs, and the fact that you can make it in the crockpot is even better. I’ve been meaning to use my crockpot more but just haven’t found more recipes to try (I’m sick of the ones I make over and over again), so I’ll definitely have to try this one out! Yes, I’ve been trying to eat more meatless, but about 1-2 times a week I do eat some sort of meat. I’ll make an exception for this one
Game Day Veggie Burgers (Her Heartland Soul) – I used to think veggie burgers would taste gross, but I really enjoy them now. My favorite are the chickpea burgers from Morning Star. This recipe looks delicious!
5 Healthy Sandwich Swaps (Mom to Mom Nutrition) – Sandwiches are my favorite lunch, and these are all great ideas. Recently I’ve started swapping out turkey for more veggies, like chickpea salad. Though my favorite will always be melted cheese on turkey and toasted bread.

Health & Fitness Links To Get You Through The Day
Well, talk about an overhyped storm! For the past few days the media had been talking about this HISTORIC blizzard of 2015…we were going to get 25-30 inches! I think we ended up getting a total of 6ish haha. I don’t think it’s the meteorologists fault. Many are complaining about them and how they overhyped it, but I think it’s the media. The media was all over this storm and telling people to prepare, get their gas cans ready if needed, etc. etc. You’d think it was the apocalypse bu how they reported it. But whatever…I was just happy to get 2 snow days out of it
Okay so let’s get into this week’s links! Some of the businesses I work with through my business are health & wellness related, so it’s fun perusing blogs and websites each day to curate content. Found a lot of great stuff over the past few days!
Featured: Vanilla Overnight Oats (24 Carrot Life)
I’ve actually never made overnight oats but keep meaning to. I am all about easy, on-the-go breakfasts. My usual is 2 hard boiled eggs that I eat in my car because I give myself just enough time in the morning to get ready and get out. Sleep > sit down breakfast Will definitely be trying this one soon!
7 Habits of Highly Fit People (Run To The Finish) – I’m all about my sleep, so at least I got that down!
Health & Family Friendly Casseroles (Kate Moving Forward) – I love casseroles and am always looking for new recipes.
Strawberry Protein Faux-Yo Recipe (Fit Views) – Doesn’t this look like the real thing?? Definitely trying this week…I always have sweet cravings after dinner.
50 Easy Healthy Meatless Pasta Recipes (Jeannette’s Healthy Living) – As I mentioned last week, I’m trying to go meatless more often…so this will definitely come in handy.
Top 5 Marathon Mistakes & How To Avoid Them (Live From La Quinta) – Who’s running a marathon in 2015?? Read this, and her other posts for great running tips.
I’ve been trying a lot of new recipes lately, experimenting with meatless ones. So if you have any favorite meatless recipes, please leave a link in the comments – I’d love to try it!
Do you already have races planned for 2015? Which ones? I haven’t made a race calendar yet.

Health & Fitness Links To Get You Through The Day
Have you ever tried a new workout and a few days later you’re STILL sore?? I started a new plan Monday and still can’t walk right! It’s more focused on time than sets and reps (aka you’re out of breath the whole time), so we’ll see how it goes. I’ll keep you posted!
I haven’t done a link roundup in a few weeks…I got all discombobulated with the holidays so let’s get back into it.
Featured: Apple Cinnamon Blender Waffles (The Lean Green Bean)
How amazing do those look? I have been wanting a waffle maker for a while…I seriously need to get one. This recipe is so simple and quick…perfect for those lazy weekend mornings.
2 Steps To Make Healthy Eating A Reality (Love Live Surf) – Two great tips here. I need to do better with meal prep. Mainly lunches. Do any of you prepare all your meals ahead of time?
Hip Hugger Lower Body Burner (Running Escapades) – Definitely need to add this to my routine once I start running more. But anyone can benefit…strong hips = strong core!
Italian Chickpea Casserole (Strength & Sunshine) – This looks delicious and like the perfect meatless dish if you’re looking for one. I will be trying this for sure, especially now that Dan’s resolution is to eat healthier/more veggies
Make Your Gym Habits Stick (Dare You To…) – Did you make a New Year’s Resolution? These tips will help! I always prepare my gym clothes and bag the night before. Even though I’m not a morning exerciser, it’s right by the door so I don’t forget anything in that morning rush, and have it all ready to go for my workout later in the day.
Grocery Shopping On A Budget For One (Lake Shore Runner) – I’ve found that now that I’m mainly buying groceries for myself, it’s a totally different experience in terms of weekly budgeting, buying things that won’t go bad, etc. Question: If you live alone or with a roommate, how do you buy salad in the bags and have it not go bad??? Happens to me every week.
How do you prevent your groceries and veggies from going bad? Do you have a weekly grocery budget?
