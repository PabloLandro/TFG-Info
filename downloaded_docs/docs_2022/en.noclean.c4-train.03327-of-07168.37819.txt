@themusclephd - 💥 Many think that stretching before a workout can help prevent injuries. However, very little data exists to support this opinion. Stretching can, in certain cases, increase injury risk and will more than likely impair performance when done before a workout. Keep your warm-ups to dynamic movements like plyometrics, jogging, or any other form of warm-up that gets a light sweat going. If you still want to stretch, do so after your workout.

💥 A recent review by Konopka and Harber (2014) stated that aerobic training can cause similar muscle growth as resistance training. If you read between the lines, however, this benefit is only true for older (65+) or very sedentary individuals. Young, healthy, and active people will get much better growth effects from resistance training. Always make sure to read past the abstract when reading scientific papers!

What SCIENCE says about stretching, flexibility, and a word that's really popular in the workout culture right now... mobility.

@Regrann de @themusclephd - 💥 O ZMA tem sido frequentemente apresentado como um impulsionador de testosterona, e embora essa alegação nem sempre tenha sido comprovada, o ZMA tem vários outros benefícios que podem impulsionar a recuperação e a função imunológica de atletas e fisiculturistas.

More people need to realise the scientific facts of stretching. I see too many people spend hours stretching before workouts not knowing there's more effective ways of warming up and getting ready for a workout.
If you are still sceptic about this, just go read up about the Golgi tendon reflex and muscle spindles.
Do activation work before you start your workouts. .

Alongar... PODE Prevenir Lesões?? -
1 - Alongamento pode ajudar na flexibilidade más não na mobilidade.
2 - Mobilidade é a capacidade de uma articulação está forte e estável durante a amplitude de movimento.
3 - Adicionar amplitude de movimento sem força ou estabilidade pode aumentar o risco de lesão.
4 - Alongar antes do treino pode prejudicar a performance como diminuir a força máxima nas articulações e ativação muscular.

Flexibility is the ability of a muscle to stretch.
Mobility is the ability of a joint to move.

I've been saying this for a while. It's pretty common sense. I hardly stretch because I perform functional compound movement workouts and keep myself well balanced. I only stretch when I need to. You will hardly see me doing isolated movements anymore.

Posted @withrepost • @themusclephd 💥 A common thought in the health and fitness industry is that deep squats are bad for your knees. However, virtually no research supports this theory. The anatomy of the knee joint helps stabilize the knee during deep squats and the connective tissue of the knee is rarely challenged past 50% of its peak tensile strength. Keep in mind, however, that any exercise can cause pain or injury when done wrong, so always make sure your form is perfect and use appropriate weights. Check out our article on my website for more details!

Está mais que comprovado através de vários estudos que a velocidade de execução não interfere nos ganhos na musculação. Deixe a forma correta de execução, estabelecer a velocidade da execução (cadencia). 1 - Cargas mais elevada vai mover mais devagar do que carga mais leve. 2 - A fadiga no treino vai interferir na velocidade da execução. Referencia: Estudo de @bradschoenfeldphd Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, abaixo. Thanks @themusclephd Dr. Jacob Wilson.

💥 Many trainers advocate for using slow and controlled lifting tempos as they believe this will lead to greater growth. However, this review found that lifting tempo has no effect on muscle growth. Furthermore, extremely slow tempos were actually less effective for growth than fast tempos. Let the weight, fatigue level, and lifting form dictate your lifting tempo while training.

Pretty cool reference 😎

💥 A common thought in the health and fitness industry is that deep squats are bad for your knees. However, virtually no research supports this theory. The anatomy of the knee joint helps stabilize the knee during deep squats and the connective tissue of the knee is rarely challenged past 50% of its peak tensile strength. Keep in mind, however, that any exercise can cause pain or injury when done wrong, so always make sure your form is perfect and use appropriate weights. Check out our article on my website for more details!

🔷 Even if you don't always believe in yourself, believe in what you're doing. Trust the process, keep working hard, and great things will happen. It worked out pretty well for Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin...

🔖 Estudo: Quantidade de proteína após o treinamento
—-
📌 O estudo mostrou que 20 - 40g de proteína após o treinamento foi mais efetivo na síntese proteica (ganho de força e recuperação) quando comparados com 0 - 10g. Algo importante! O estudo foi feito com atletas/indivíduos treinados.
.
.
📌 A correção na ingestão da proteína é um passo importantíssimo quando falamos de ganho de força e recuperação muscular. Não é necessário superdosagem de proteína se os outros macronutrientes (carboidratos e gorduras) estão adequadas.
.
📌 Quer saber mais sobre o estudo? Arraste para o lado!
.
📌 Respeite sua individualidade biológica. Nutrição inteligente, sempre!

Yall know I'm all about the science. Looks like we are doing tongue curls for our next strength cycle ;) Reposted from @themusclephd - 💥In this ground-breaking study, it was found that pressing your tongue into the roof of your mouth increased power production on isolation exercises significantly more than other tongue positions in the mouth. This may be due to a unique interaction between the tongue and CNS. This also may only work on isolation exercises, more research definitely needs to be done to see if the effect carries over into compound movements. Try it out and let me know what you think!

💥 ZMA has often been purported as a testosterone booster, and while that claim hasn’t always been proven, ZMA has several other benefits that may boost recovery and immune function for athletes and bodybuilders. Pick a formulation that has at least 30mg zinc, 500mg magnesium, and 10mg vitamin B6. Some individuals will find it most useful to use this supplement before bed as it may improve sleep quality!

I always get asked “why are you in love with fitness”, here is your answer: Fitness shows the discipline and drive you have in your body. Whatever you want to accomplish in fitness is all on your willingness to push past your limits even when you dont want to. 👿👏🏽
So my favorite word for clients is : “PUSH” 🗣 because I WILL instill my drive and discipline into their little bodies. 🏆💪🏽🔥 you with me? #instafit #fitnessjourney #fitnessmotivation #forwardthinking #themusclephd #Beast #GymTime #GymMotivation #StrongNotSkinny #StrongBody #nasm #nasmcertified

💥 The amino sulfonic acid, taurine, is one of the most abundant chemicals in the body. Taurine has been shown to act as an antioxidant and can improve endurance performance and increase repetitions to failure during strength training. However, antioxidants have been shown to impair muscle growth, so bodybuilders may not want to take taurine in high dosages or around their workouts. Endurance athletes will garner the most benefits from taurine supplementation.

So yeah, this just happened. A lot of people will talk the talk, but never walk the walk. One of my Goals for the end of this year was to become a Certified Personal Trainer by the most recognized accredited institution; NASM. Fast forward 4 months in, got it done. Thank you to all my mentors who guided me through this, but aye; I’m not done. This is just one accomplishment. Stay tuned for the next one 🥇🏆 #nasm #certifiedpersonaltrainer #themusclephd

💥Tappped out💥 😬About 90% of the time I I hold back and don’t train til failure as people may assume. This allows me to make it to the gym day after day without falling victim to overtraining/fatigue/over stressed. Recovery is just/more important than training. 🥵But about 10% of the time I just go all out and push myself pass failure. This allows me to remind myself what pain and discomfort feels like.
Shout out to the boys and catch them Saturdays at 10am 🔥🔥 @kvofportsity @knottychristian @noshirtmario

@themusclephd - 💥 This study compared the effects of consuming 25g of protein to 25g of protein plus alcohol after a workout. It was found that consuming alcohol after a workout severely impaired post-workout muscle protein synthesis. If your goal is to gain muscle, avoid alcohol after your workout and consume alcohol in moderation when you do drink. Have fun but take care of your gains!
