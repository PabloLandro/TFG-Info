About Himalayan Salt Lamps
Perhaps you have seen lamps that look like “glowing rock lamps”? Well, Himalayan Salt Lamps are most likely what you saw. But those enchanting glowing rock lamps are actually made of Genuine Himalayan Pink Salt crystals!
This special salt gets its color from the minerals contained in the salt, which also make it a very tasty, and nutritional gourmet seasoning for your food!
The minerals are present because millions of years ago, an ancient sea dried up in the area of the Himalayan foothills, leaving behind the rich, peachy-pink colored salt these lamps are created from.
Today the salt bed lies deep beneath this region which we now know as Pakistan. The salt is carefully hand-mined, as it has been by the indigenous people of the area for centuries, to bring you the benefits of the salt. And the minerals contained within this all natural, organic sea salt are the key components that make these crystal lamps so delightful!
How Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Work?
As the bulb or candle warms the Himalayan Salt Rock Lamp or Candle Holder from the inside, negative ions are released into the air. These negative ions make harmful particles in the air clump together so that they fall to the ground. This cleansing process rids the air of allergens, dust, and other particles that can irritate the respiratory system.
The beneficial effects of negative ions are scientifically proven, and are present everywhere in nature. Produced when water molecules become agitated by movement, negative ions cleanse the air at the beach, in a forest after a good rainfall, and around waterfalls, creating the naturally tranquil atmospheres that relax our minds and bodies.
Himalayan Salt Lamps are said to have various beneficial health effects including:
Aid in relief of symptoms caused by Asthma, nasal conditions such as Sinusitis, and common allergies.
Provide relief from migraines and headaches.
Enhance serotonin levels in the blood stream; a lack of which could contribute to depression and anxiety.
Reduce symptoms of irritability and depression.
Enhance and reinforces the immune system.
Diminish susceptibility to colds and the flu.
Due to their reputed ability to improve concentration, promote feelings of well-being , and more, the effects of Himalayan Salt Lamps have also been noted in the treatment of ADD, as well as other various anxiety issues and disorders of the mind in other countries of the world.
Other Features:
Salt Lamps are completely quiet, unlike traditional Air Ionizers/Purifiers, so you can sleep while the lamp helps to purify the air.
Salt lamps emit a warm, tranquil glow that helps to aid emotional well-being by adding enchanting, soft light to your home.
Each lamp is hand crafted to retain the salt’s unique, natural look and the beauty of the salt crystals, so no two salt lamps are alike, producing a unique, functional work of art.
All of our lamps are UL Recognized/Listed.
Entirely Unique in Color, Shape, Weight & Dimension
We guarantee that each and every salt lamp in our collection is one of a kind! In fact, due to the nature of these organic works of art, it is impossible to ensure exact color, shape, weight, and dimension. So your Salt Lamp WILL be entirely unique.
Color: Himalayan Salt Lamps contain natural veins, cracks and striations, with colors ranging from light peach/pink, to orange and dark red, characteristics which, in part, allow for the unique appearance of each lamp.
Weight: The weight of the lamps vary from item to item; the lamp you receive will possess a weight within the given range listed in the item description.
Dimensions: The dimensions stated in the salt lamp item information are approximations based on averages, and are intended to give a general idea of the size of the lamps. The actual lamp you receive may vary slightly.
Shape: Hand crafted from individual, natural salt crystals, the exact shape of each lamp will vary from piece to piece, and from the image depicting the item, adding to the unique quality of each lamp.
