The V2 Series 3 is a vape pen starter kit that uses three different cartridges that can be attached easily by just popping them in. They have one for dry herb, one for waxy concentrates and last but not least one for e-liquid. They also make a Series 7 which is a more powerful version of this.
The Linx Hypnos Zero provides excellent vapor from the very first hit. It’s built well and compactly, making it an excellent portable pen vape. With its airflow produced by the unique ceramic chamber and its glass mouthpiece, the vapor tastes fantastic, earning it the awards Best Taste, Best Value, and Best Portability from High Times.

E-liquid vape pens, or e-cigarettes, are the most common and basic type of vape pens. They consist of a battery, an e-liquid tank, and atomizer coil. The atomizer coils will need to be replaced every week to three weeks depending on how much you vape. You manually fill the e-liquid tank with e-juice.
The first vaporizer pens looked more like a cigarette. They are often referred to as cigalikes or e-cigarettes. Eventually, manufacturers started making these devices bigger to incorporate more powerful batteries and eventually they looked more like pens than cigarettes. Vapor pens are used for vaporizing vape juice, wax and dry herb.
Last week, a study of nearly 70,000 people found that daily e-cigarette use can double the risk for heart attack. If the user continues to smoke regular cigarettes each day along with e-cigarettes, the combined risk goes up five times.
Although eGo’s and 510’s are the universal standard, you might find a vape pen that uses a different connection. Since many people were buying parts for their vape pens from various manufacturers, some companies use unique threading to prevent this from occurring.

Just wanted to say thank you. I was having problems with a order that i placed last Friday. But your customer service did e mail me back and did offer to fix the problem and offered a 100ml juice as well for the inconvenience. Again i appreciate it and will continue to do business with Vapes.
If the vapor produced by a vape pen tastes burnt, the most likely problem is the temperature setting. If the temperature is too high, it will burn the vaping material (and cotton, in the case of an e-juice vape pen), producing a foul-tasting flavor. Lower the temperature on your vape pen and test it again. If the problem persists, check the heating chamber.
But their use has been surrounded by debate, focusing on the lack of evidence regarding the harms associated with their long-term use, as well as their potential to act as a gateway into smoking among teens.
Best concentrate vape pens are filled in much the same way. When it comes to dry herb pens, however, the procedure is a bit different. First, the mouthpiece needs to be unscrewed and the chamber taken out. After grinding your loose leaf, fill the chamber gently (don’t overfill) and re-assemble the pen.
Using the AS chipset, the Blade pushes out over 200 watts of power and fires down to 0.005 Ohms. The chip is extremely responsive and fires instantaneously when activated. It also does temperature control and has a bypass mode. This is a versatile mod suitable for just about every style of vaping.
So theoretically you could but most regulated box mods have a minimum ohm safety feature. In reality you could do it on an unregulated boxmod but would put undue strain on the batteries unless you are using new 35 amp cells
On the flip, the convection vape pens blow extremely hot air through the material that turns it into vapor. A mesh screen, usually made of glass or metal is used to contain the vaping material. The convection style vape pens usually offer better flavor and taste. However, they can be more expensive and take longer to heat up.
Two years ago, Boulder surveyed its students and found that 45 percent of high school students had used e-cigarettes, with 30 percent as current users. Officials say they expect the most recent survey, taken last year, to show about 45 percent of middle school students have used e-cigarettes.
Even cannabis users have been switching over to vaping to avoid the harmful side-effects of combustion. Today they have vaporizer pens made for wax and dry herb. The dry herb vape pens utilize a heating chamber to vaporize your herb.
I am trying to do the same thing….. I was told that SMOK subtank needs WAY more power than then the KBOX mini can deliver. I can’t decide between the Snow Wolf 200w, Sigelei 150 TCS or the SMOK X cube 2. If anyone has opinions
Made with a patented coil system allowing a 1.2 ohm coil to be used with a 4.2 volt, Mig 21 Super Battery. This slim Design is a powerhouse of energy to make sure your concentrate oils are sucked and vaped to the last drop. No waste vape pen. There is no other device on the market that will perform like this device.
E-cigarettes deliver nicotine through a liquid that is heated into vapor and inhaled, cutting out the cancer-causing tar of combustible cigarettes. But vaping liquids contain additives such as propylene glycol and glycerol that can form carcinogenic compounds when they are heated. Diacetyl, a chemical used to flavor some vape “juice,” has been linked to so-called popcorn lung, the scarring and obstruction of the lungs’ smallest airways. A study published in the journal Pediatrics in March found substantially increased levels of five carcinogenic compounds in the urine of teenagers who vape.
So I’m lookin for a box mod with variable voltage/wattage for my wife. I have the ipv4 and she loves it but she thinks its to ugly.. She wants a girly one. Like pink or purple. Anyone know of one?? Thanks guys!
There are a couple of very cool things going on with the MIVA. For starters, it has a 2200 mAh LiPo battery. How they packed in 2200 mAh in such a small package is impressive to say the least. You are also getting a ceramic heating chamber for crisp, pure flavor. There is precision temperature control from 300 F to 435 F. Finally; the MIVA is a true convection heating vape pen that evenly distributes heat in the chamber.
The Series 3X is available in three different colors – gunmetal, red, and charcoal. Don’t let its minimalistic design confuse you; this is a top-notch dry herb vape pen, one of the best on the market. The flavor is spot on, and the buzz it delivers is pretty much unrivaled when it comes to portable loose leaf pens.
Source Orb 4 – The Source Orb 4 is THE concentrate pen to beat. With 6 different atomizers and 8 voltage settings available, this titanium and quartz unit is insanely versatile. No matter who the user is, the Source Orb 4 has a setting aimed to please. A unique quality of this unit, though, are the 10 air vents it utilizes to keep air resistance noticeably lower and more comfortable to use than the vast majority of pens. At a price under $100, this fantastic titan of a vaporizer is not only gorgeous and powerful, but also boasts a 2.5 hour battery life.
If by kbox mini you are referring to the Kanger Subox, then yes I would say it is a decent little box mod that will fire up to 50W! Also check out the Innokin Disrupter as that is also a good 50W box. Need to add that one to this list!
The Series 3X is everything you need to start vaping, whether you are just quitting cigarettes or want a new way to enjoy your dry herb or wax. This powerful and versatile vape pen allows you to switch between all three easily and quickly by utilizing a secure magnetic connection.
Size matters when it comes to atomizers. Deep dish atomizers are for people who vape throughout the day and want to minimize loading, or those who like extended sessions. Shallow atomizers are better for moderate use.
We made sure to include the best starter vape pens in this list so that even beginners can pick one up confidently and run with it. That’s because there’s no steep learning curve and all that’s necessary is to load up the material, press the fire button, and inhale. Piece of cake, really.
Vape pens that can be charged via USB are obviously a better choice than the ones that require a unique adapter. Some vape pens also come with a car charger in addition to the wall adapter, which is an added convenience.
“We saw the same thing from Philip Morris with the We Card program, and the evaluation was that those things don’t work,” Jennifer Kovarik, who runs tobacco prevention programs for Boulder County, Colo., said of the company’s efforts to keep their products away from teenagers. “If they didn’t want youth to use it, it would be sold in 18-and-over-only establishments. It’s available at Circle K’s across the country.”
A vape mod is a power source, essentially a case that contains one or more rechargeable batteries, that supplies electricity to a vaping atomizer. They are also referred to as “vapor mods”. The term “mod” has its origins in the early years of e-cigs, where hobbyist vapers “modified” existing electrical hardware (cases, batteries, wiring, etc.) for custom use as vaping hardware.
