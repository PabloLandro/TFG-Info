Vitamin C and the Common Cold
Whitney Ahneman
January 22, 2013
Since I've been getting a lot of questions on the topic recently, I wanted to clarify a few things using the evidence... Does taking Vitamin C in fact help prevent a cold or decrease the impact of a cold?
Vitamin C does bolster the immune system by enabling the body to make white blood cells. These are immune-modulating cells that help fight off infection. So while Vitamin C is important to the immune system and total health, studies have consistently shown that additional supplementation of Vitamin C in the diet does not prevent a cold or reduce the duration of a cold.
This myth started in the 1970s when scientist Linus Pauling theorized that taking 1000 mg of Vitamin C daily would prevent the common cold. He was starting to learn more and more about the role of vitamins and minerals in the diet, and wanted to take the knowledge base and study it. The 1000 mg dosage level was developed for his hypothesis but has since stuck with the public.
Dietary sources of Vitamin C include citrus fruits, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, broccoli, and cantaloupe.

About the blog
While originally a tool for me to hone my writing voice and stay well-read on health and nutrition, my attention has turned to my career full-time so I apologize for the sporadic nature of the blog. I still enjoy commenting on things such as policy, healthcare, nutrition trends, and the diet-du-jour in this space but for more immediate interaction, please reach out on any social media platform.
