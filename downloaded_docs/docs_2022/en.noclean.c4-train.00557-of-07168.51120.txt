Tooth Paste
RECIPE:
- 2 tablespoon baking soda [Bob's Red Mill] as a natural safe abrasive for cleaning teeth, more so than commercial toothpastethat uses silica!!
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil as an antibacterial
- 1/2 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide
- optional: 5 drops of essential oil - e.g., Peppermint? Clove?
(Caution using Wintergreen essential oil! It can kill your cat! I don't like cats but I don't wish them death even though they would eat my face.)
Store in a small glass jar w/ a cover. This should last a week or more. Don't forget to clean your toothbrush! Maybe keep the brush in a small jar of hydrogen peroxide?
Homemade toothpaste contains NO Flouride, Sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates, Artificial sweeteners or FD&C Blue No. 1
You don't need any sweetener. If your kids refuse to brush their teeth as a result send them to Mr. Fong over there to the right.

Healing Cavities/Remineralization with Oil Pulling
Did you know that "inactive" cavities can be healed or remineralized? Yup. The dentin can be regrown even stronger than the enamel that may have been eaten away. Consider looking into "oil pulling" to help with repairing inactive cavities. It involves swishing an oil through your teeth for about 5 minutes. They always say 20 minutes but that is overkill methinks. Try coconut oil. You could use olive oil but ick. Other than that there are some simple dietary measures you can make to get the proper nutrients for dental health. Check out the following informative links:
