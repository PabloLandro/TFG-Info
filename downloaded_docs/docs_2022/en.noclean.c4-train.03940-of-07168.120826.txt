What is the relationship between the intake of added sugars and the risk of type 2 diabetes?
Conclusion Statement: Strong evidence shows that higher consumption of added sugars, especially sugar-sweetened beverages, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes among adults and this relationship is not fully explained by body weight.
DGAC Grade: Strong
Review of Evidence
Evidence for this question and conclusion came from five SRs and MA published between January 2010 and August 2014.1 2 3 4 5 Four of the reviews focused on sugar-sweetened beverages1 2 3 5 and one review examined sugar intake.4 Combined, a total of 17 articles were considered in these reviews, of which nine were included in two or more reviews. Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was consistently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Pooled estimated relative risks ranged from 1.20 to 1.28, and included 1.20 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.29)/330 ml/day of sugar-sweetened soft drinks;1 1.26 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.41) for sugar-sweetened beverages,3 and 1.28 (95% CI = 1.04 to 1.59) for sugar-sweetened fruit juices.5 Comparably, a hazard ratio of 1.29 (1.02, 1.63) was identified for sugar-sweetened beverages.2 These consistently positive associations between sugar-sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes were attenuated, but still existed, after adjustment for BMI, suggesting that body weight only partly explains the deleterious effects of sugar-sweetened beverages on type 2 diabetes. Although the studies were highly heterogeneous, findings from the MA by Malik et al. tentatively showed that consumption of more than one 12-ounce serving per day of sugar-sweetened beverage increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 26 percent, compared to consuming less than one serving per month. Insufficient high-quality data are available to determine a dose-response line or curve between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and type 2 diabetes risk.
The issue of generalizability, whether the participants included in this body of evidence are representative of the general U.S. population, was not specifically addressed in the literature reviewed, but the large sample sizes of the pooled data (several hundred thousand subjects from different populations) are noteworthy.

Greenwood, 2014
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
AMSTAR: 8/11
Sugar-sweetened beverages (carbonated, sugar-sweetened colas and soft drinks, total fruit punch, non-diet soda, full-energy sweetened soft drinks)
Incidence of T2D
1990 to Nov 2009, with an update in June 2013
PCSs; English language; original research article; at least 3 yr duration; differentiated between sugar and artificially sweetened beverages; participants from a generally healthy population
11 publications from 9 cohorts (5 publications from 6 cohorts used in meta-analysis of SSBs)
Conclusion:
The included studies were observational, so their results should be interpreted cautiously, but findings indicate a positive association between sugar-sweetened soft drink intake and T2D risk, attenuated by adjustment for BMI.
Main Results:
The summary relative risk for sugar-sweetened soft drinks was 1.20/330 ml per d. The association with sugar-sweetened soft drinks was slightly lower in studies adjusting for BMI, consistent with BMI being involved in the causal pathway.
Romaguera, 2013 (Note: Included in Greenwood, 2014)
Meta-Analysis of eight cohorts from the EPIC study
AMSTAR: N/A
Sweet beverages (juices [either from 100% fruit and vegetables or concentrates], nectars [juices with up to 20% added sugar], and total soft drinks [sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened])
Incidence of T2D
N/A
Excluded those with evidence of T2D and those within the lowest and highest 1% of the cohort distribution of the ratio of reported total energy intake: energy requirement and those with missing information on diet, physical activity, level of education, smoking status, or BMI
Eight cohorts of the EPIC study
Conclusion:
This study corroborates the association between increased incidence of T2D and high consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks in European adults.
Main Results:
In adjusted models, one 336 g (12 oz) daily increment in sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with HR for T2D of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.38). After further adjustment for energy intake and BMI, the association of sugar-sweetened soft drinks with T2D persisted (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.32). Juice and nectar consumption was not associated with T2D incidence.
Malik, 2010
Meta-Analysis
AMSTAR: 8/11
Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, carbonated soft drinks, fruitades, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy and vitamin water drinks, sweetened iced tea, punch, cordials, squashes, and lemonade)
Incidence of T2D
1966 to May 2010
PCSs; English language; presentation of relative risk and associated measure of variance; definition and metric for SSB intake; adults
8 PCSs
Conclusion:
Higher consumption of SSBs is associated with development of T2D.
Main Results:
Individuals in the highest quantile of SSB intake (most often 12, 12-oz servings/day) had a 26% greater risk of developing T2D than those in the lowest quantile (none or <1 serving/month) (RR=1.26).
Sonestedt, 2012
Systematic Review
AMSTAR: 9/11
Sugar intake (intrinsic, added, and total sugar intake from sugar-sweetened beverages, sugars, sucrose, and fructose)
Incidence of T2D (also searched for impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity)
2000 to 2010, with update through Dec 2011
PCSs with 4 or more yrs of follow-up; RCTs with at least 4 wks duration, drop-out rate <50%, and replacement of sugars with corresponding amount of CHO; English or Nordic language; generally healthy populations
9 PCSs (4 on total sugars, sucrose, or fructose and 6 reported on SSBs)
Conclusion:
Data from PCSs suggest that SSBs probably increase the risk of T2D. The results were limited or inconsistent on the adverse effect of intake of total sugars, glucose, or fructose on the incidence of T2D.
Main Results:
The results from the 4 studies on the association between intake of total sugars, sucrose, or fructose and T2D were inconclusive, with studies showing positive, negative, and no association. The 6 studies reporting on SSBs were more conclusive, with 4 reporting a positive association, and a fifth reporting a positive association in the model not adjusting for BMI.
Xi, 2014
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
AMSTAR: 10/11
Sugar-sweetened fruit juice and 100% fruit juice
Incidence of T2D
Up to Dec 2013
PCSs; English language; reported covariate adjusted RRs or HRs with 95% CIs for highest vs. lowest category of fruit juice intake; for multiple articles from same cohort, selected only the study with the largest sample size
4 PCSs examined sugar-sweetened fruit juice and 4 PCSs examined 100% fruit juice
Conclusion:
The findings support dietary recommendations to limit SSBs, such as fruit juice with added sugar, to prevent the development of T2D.
Main Results:
A higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice was significantly associated with risk of T2D (RR = 1.28), while intake of 100% fruit juice was not associated with risk of developing T2D (RR = 1.03).
