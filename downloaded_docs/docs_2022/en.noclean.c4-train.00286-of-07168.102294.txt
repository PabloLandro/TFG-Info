Aids for Daily Living is proud to support arthritis australia
About Arthritis Australia
Nearly one in five Australians - that's 3.85 million people - has arthritis. Arthritis Australia is a charitable not-for-profit organisation, and is the peak arthritis body in Australia. It is supported by affiliate offices in ACT, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia.
Arthritis Australia's Vision is:
“To bring quality of life to all people with arthritis and eliminate their suffering.”
Arthritis Australia’s Mission is to:
Provide support and information to people with arthritis as well as their families and friends
Promote awareness of the challenges facing people with arthritis across the community, and to leaders in business, industry, and government
Fund research into potential causes and possible cures as well as better ways to live with arthritis
Keep health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and community nurses informed.
Partnership with Aids for Daily Living:
In support of the Vision and Mission, Aids for Daily Living is proud to be a partner of Arthritis Australia and for every purchase made via Arthritis Australia and its affiliates, Aids for Daily Living will donate a percentage of the sales to assist in the long term achievement of these national aims. At Aids for Daily Living we know how age, disability, injury, and chronic illness can affect the quality of day-to-day life. Our aim is to help people live their life to the fullest, with fewer restrictions. We are an Australian owned and managed company dedicated to finding solutions that support those with physical limitations and help them maintain their independence, making day-to-day life easier. Our customers have told us that they need products that are high quality yet affordable. So we specialise in cost-effective, innovative aids with the specific goal of making common daily tasks easier for those who need the support. In addition, Aids for Daily Living also offers a 100% “no questions asked” money back guarantee. If for any reason you need to return the products you have purchased, you can do so within the first 90 days for a full refund.

General Advice
Before relying on any material located on the Aids for Daily Living website, users should carefully evaluate its accuracy, currency, completeness and relevance for their purposes, and should obtain any appropriate professional advice relevant to their particular circumstances. This material is general in nature. It is made available on the understanding that Aids for Daily Living is not thereby engaged in rendering professional advice.
Alternative therapy products
Aids for Daily Living provide several alternative health products. These include detoxing products and items that refer to the benefits of magnets on pain relief and inflammation. Scientific evidence does not support any claim for the use of magnets with providing pain relief or reducing inflammation. Do not use magnets as a replacement for conventional medical treatment or as a reason to postpone seeing your health care provider about any health problem. There is no scientific evidence supporting the use of detox pads on drawing impurities from the human body. Magnets may not be safe for some people, such as those who use pacemakers or insulin pumps, as they may interfere with these devices. Tell all your health care providers about any alternative health approaches you use. It is not safe to replace conventional medical treatment with magnetic therapy. Further information on magnetic therapy can be viewed here.
