Getting Strong 101: The Squat
Posted on November 25, 2014 July 24, 2015
Squats are awesome. Period. ‘Nuff said!
If you’re not squatting you need to be. It doesn’t matter what your training goal is, whether it’s fat loss, building muscle and strength or improving performance, squatting will get you there.
The squat is a compound, full-body exercise. It starts by bending through your hips and knees until your hips come lower than your knees. Yes, they need to break parallel and no, it is not bad for you!
Squatting works the whole body. It’s often thought of only as a leg exercise that trains the quads and posterior chain; hamstrings, glutes and groin. But when you squat, you’re also working your core and back muscles. Even your arms and shoulders are working when loaded to keep the bar where it’s supposed to be. Your whole body from head-to-toe benefits when you squat.
And it only makes sense that it would as it’s one the most natural movements we do. Have you ever seen a baby squat? It’s usually with perfect form. My daughter sits and does her homework while squatting. It amazes me that she can sit like that for hours!
Squats build muscle and they help strengthen your bones. When you squat, because you’re working your entire body as one and not in isolation, you get a larger hormonal response, more so than any other exercise. This is exactly what is needed to build muscle and promote fat loss.
It also requires the most amount of energy since you’re using your largest muscles and most of the muscles in the body. Fat is stored energy in the body. More muscles used, more energy needed, more fat burned. This can also carry over outside the gym for up to 24 hours post workout, so you end up burning fat outside the gym as well. Win-win.
How to Squat
The first squat you need to master is the bodyweight squat with proper form, especially if you haven’t squatted before.
Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, heel-to-heel and slightly point your toes out at about a 25-30 degree angle.
The safest way to squat is with your knees tracking your toes. This means when you set up your stance your knees should be pointing in the same direction as your toes.
Remember to keep your back straight or in neutral position. Do not round your back. As you begin to squat, you can hold your arms up at shoulder level or hold them out in front of you. Keep your chest up and look at the ground about 4 to 5 feet ahead.
To initiate the movement, take a breath, unlock your hips and push your butt back. Squat pushing your knees out to the sides and your hips back and down until you break parallel. Your hip crease (not your thighs) must go below the top of your knee. If you’re unable to get below parallel widen your stance a bit, still keeping your toes at 30 degrees and your knees tracking your toes.
On the way up, lead with your hips, drive through your heels and keep off of your toes. Push your knees out to walls on each side, your chest up and your core tight.
Lock your hips and knees at the top squeezing your butt.
Here’s a video of me doing a bodyweight squat. Notice how my hips fall just below the top of my knees on each rep.
Adding weight
Once you’ve nailed the proper form on the bodyweight squat; breaking parallel, neutral spine, knees out and driving through the hips and heels, you’re ready to add some weight.
Squatting with a heavier weight can be a bit more difficult when trying to get below parallel. It’s more important that you stick to a lower weight and squat deeper than adding more weight and not break parallel. You will get stronger this way.
The Barbell Squat
There are so many variations of the barbell squat that you can do. There’s the low bar back squat, high bar back squat, front squat, goblet squat, overhead squat, box squat, zercher squat to name just a few. The main difference between all is bar placement and muscle recruitment.
If you’ve never squatted before starting with the traditional and most common variation, the low bar back squat will be the safest and quickest way to build your strength. It focuses on recruiting the posterior chain; the major players and using your hips as drivers. Performing it with the correct technique is key.
Set up. The bar height should be set between your the center of your chest and your collarbone.
Always start with an empty bar at first. Grab it with a thumbless grip. You don’t want to wrap your fingers around the bar. You want your wrists to be in line with your forearms. Your grip width will vary based on shoulder width and flexibility. A narrower grip will allow for better support of the bar, keeping it on the shoulder muscles instead of the bones on your back.
Step under the bar and place it between your traps and your shoulder muscles, right beneath the bone you feel at the top of your shoulder blades. It should feel as though you’ve placed the bar on a shelf on your back, under your traps and on your shoulder muscles (rear deltoids) for support.
Remove the bar from the rack by squatting it up. Keeping a tight core, take one step back from the bar.
Set up the squat as you would for the bodyweight squat. Your heels should be shoulder width apart, toes slightly pointed out at a 25 to 35 degree angle, knees aligned with the toes, back straight, chest up and gaze should be on the floor about 5 feet ahead of you, not up.
Take a breath, hold it and squat down pushing your knees out until you break parallel. The movement is initiated at the hip. Stick your butt back first instead of shooting your knees forward. This puts less stress on the knees and better activation of the glutes and hamstrings.
Drive up with your hips keeping your back straight, chest up and knees out.
Most Common Squat Mistakes
Even though this movement is one of the most primal and natural ones to the human body, it is often executed incorrectly.
Here are a few common mistakes and how to fix them:
1. Not going deep enough
Some people who come into the gym are just not able to squat below parallel. Depending on your training history, athletic background , injury history and mobility issues, you may only be able to reach parallel or above.
In this case you’ll have to work hard to get back that squat you had when you were a toddler. If this is you, improving ankle flexibility and hip mobility can help to clean up your squat. Also if you’re having trouble breaking parallel try slightly widening your stance. It will engage more muscle groups and help keep balance.
“But squats are bad for my knees!”
No they’re not. They are the best thing you can do for your knees. You’ve probably been told that squatting deep is not good for knees. However, this has not been proven to be true. When performed correctly the squat is one of the safest and best exercises for the knees; it strengthen the knees. Bad form is bad for the knees.
The squat is a hip movement, not a knee movement, so the majority of the force should be placed on the hips. When you squat above parallel you’re stressing the knees by allowing the majority of the load to travel to the knees instead of the hips. You’re also not fully engaging your posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings etc.) which causes imbalances. Your quads end up doing all the work yet the hamstrings are imperative for knee safety.
2. Knees caving in on the way up
When you squat, you want your knees in line with both your ankles and your toes. Your thighs need to match the direction of your feet. Knees tend to collapse in most trainees on the way up. Focus on keeping your feet planted and pushing your knees out to the sides. If you feel it in your groin, you’re doing it right.
3. The body leans too far forward
The weight of your body should always be placed on the middle to the heels of the foot. You need to drive from your heels as you raise yourself up from the squat which means they need to stay on the ground the whole time.
You never want any weight placed on your toes. You should be able to wiggle your toes with the balls of your feet still planted on the ground.
4. Head position
Forget what your high school gym teacher told you about staring up at the ceiling when you’re squatting, or the bad habit of looking at yourself in the mirror while you squat. If you are not looking down, you’re not engaging hip drive. You want to maintain a neutral position with your neck. (Imagine placing a tennis ball between your chin and your neck, neutral position.) To do so you keep your gaze in front of you keeping your eyes on a spot where the wall meets the floor, ideally about 4-to-5 feet in front.
If you’ve never trained the squat before, now is the time to start. Start with bodyweight and perfect your technique and form. Once that’s perfected, add weight. There isn’t a better exercise that will help you lose weight, build muscle and get strong!
