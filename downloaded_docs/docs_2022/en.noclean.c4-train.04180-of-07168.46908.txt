Even though the role of caffeine in a weight loss program is heavily debated, there are a few tips that can help you lose weight with coffee.
Like everyone else, you may want to lose some weight as fast as possible. And there are people suggesting that coffee can help you lose weight faster.
But the role of caffeine in a weight loss program is heavily debated. So let’s see what are its benefits and how could drinking coffee help you burn fat quicker.
All the places to get coffee on the south beach are crowded with people who want to jump-start their mornings. I’m one of those people, but I never realized how many benefits caffeine has:
Makes you smarter;
Reduces the risk of Parkinson’s disease;
Boosts your workout;
Lowers the risk of diabetes;
Improves your reaction time;
Fights against hair loss;
Lowers the risk of certain cancers.
As a plus, drinking coffee regularly may help you drop a few pounds or even prevent weight gain, but it can’t do it just by itself.
If you need to lose significant weight and want to keep it off permanently, then consider following a healthy diet and a workout schedule along with your daily cup of coffee.
How To Lose Weight With Coffee
Here are a few changes you need to do in your lifestyle in order to lose weight with coffee:
1. Drink Coffee Moderately
You should drink no more than 4 cups of coffee per day; that’s 400 mg of caffeine, maximum safe quantity for an adult. We do recommend drinking only 3 cups of coffee per day: one in the morning, one at lunch and one in the afternoon.
2. Space Out Your Coffee Time
The best way to drink coffee for weight loss is to spread it throughout the entire day. Caffeine can suppress your appetite, so having a sip of coffee from time to time during the day can be a big plus for your belly.
Also, you should consider drinking a lot of water during the day too. It’s essential to stay hydrated, and water can aid in appetite suppression too.
3. Drink Coffee Before Working Out
Dr. Mike Roussell recommends a cup of coffee right before your morning workout to boost your fat burning process during and after the workout is done.
Just pay attention if you’re working out before going to sleep. Caffeine might keep you awake more than you’d actually want.
4. Avoid Fancy And Sugary Coffee
Anything you put in your cup beside coffee, be it cream, milk or sugar, will increase the number of calories you consume. And you definitely don’t want that if your goal is to lose weight with coffee.
A healthy cup of coffee should contain just water and coffee. But if you’re really into those big, fancy cups of caffeinated drinks, try these low-calorie Starbucks drinks.
5. Avoid Drinking Coffee Late At Night
Sleep is important in any fitness process. Whether you want to lose weight with coffee, gain a few pounds, or maintain your silhouette, your body needs about 8 hours of sleep every night.
So drink your coffee during the day, and let the night be your resting and regenerating time, as it is supposed to be. From our experience, the last cup of coffee of the day should be consumed before 7 PM.
Now, these tips may help you drink coffee moderately, at the right time, with the right ingredients and frequency.
If you’re thinking about starting a diet revolving around coffee, making sure you have the tastiest coffee possible is extremely important. Kimbo coffee is one of the best-tasting coffees on the market.
Also, in order to lose weight with coffee, you need some extra ingredients. And they’re even more important than what you’re pouring in your coffee cup:
Regular Workout
We have a huge collection of workouts on Fitneass, and the internet is full of them. Choose your favorite exercises and do at least 45 minutes of physical activity every day.
The more you work out, the more fat you burn, the more fit you get.
Proper Diet
This is simple: no sweets, no alcohol, no fatty foods, no fast-foods, and no processed foods. Choose organic foods, drink only water and eat in moderation.
It might seem hard at the beginning, but once you get used to it, you’ll wish you’d started earlier.
Although some might consider coffee unhealthy, I am a regular drinker who starts the morning with a hot cup of coffee. And it feels great!
