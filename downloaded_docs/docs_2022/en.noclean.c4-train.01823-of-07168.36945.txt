Effective 7/1/17 the California Board of Equalization requires the provision of a 65.08% tobacco excise tax on the wholesale cost of all tobacco products sold in California. As a result, for those California purchasers, there will be an additional tax of only 20% added to the sales tax portion of each sale, to account for this tobacco excise tax.

Vape pens can feature a variety of atomizers that vaporize material using a heat element, which is usually a rod with coils wrapped around it. The atomizer acts as the vape pen heating chamber, which features a single rod, double rod, triple rod, or a bucket-like coilless design. Vaporizer pen atomizers can heat up rapidly, which is ideal for vaping on-the-go. To load a pen vaporizer, material is dabbed into the chamber, where it sits directly on the coils. In other words, most vapor pens are conduction vaporizers, rather than convection units.
The pen features a 360 mAh battery that fully charges in 60 minutes but can last for a lengthy vaping session. What makes it perfect for dabs is its ability to go above 455°F with a two-second heat-up time, which is all the more remarkable in a device measuring only 0.75 x 4.5 inches.
If you like big, tasty hits that are consistent throughout your session, you’ll love this vape pen. The Cloud Pen 3.0 uses its double coil and bigger size to produce big clouds and feels sturdy in the hand. This vape pen won the Best Vapor Production award from High Times.
Some vaporizer pens are also capable of vaping dry herbs. The first dry herb vape pens were extremely ineffective. However, these days there are a few weed vape pens on the market that perform close to that of an actual cannabis vaporizer.
The Exxus Slim VV 380 mAh 510 Variable Voltage Battery by Exxus Vape is a simplistic device that is an easy companion to a number of tanks. As a variable voltage unit, its voltage can be adjusted to anywhere between 2.6V and 4V. This accommodates user’s individual preferences. The Exxus Slim VV has a 510 thread attachment that make it a near universal fit for many mods on the market. Additionally, it boasts a ten second heat up time, so it’s ready to fire fulfilling draws quickly and cleanly.
Power button – The power button, also called the fire button, is used to engage the atomizer. It is typically also used to turn the battery on and off by pressing it five times. Some batteries also allow the user to adjust their voltage by pressing the Power button three times.
The G Pen Elite Portable Dry Vaporizer is a compact unit that’s made by the team at Grenco Science. The device can work well for dry herbs. Some highlights of this vaporizer are a deep and sizable filling chamber, complete temperature control and LED (light emitting diode) display. Fans of aromatherapy can enjoy this convection vaporizer’s streamlined and ergonomic setup. Its filling chamber is made entirely of ceramic. It takes just 30 seconds for this vaporizer to heat up.

Just like with any other product, you need to consider and compare a few of the top vape pens measuring quality, durability, ease of use, and value for money. Vape pens are a unique product, and you should keep some guidelines in mind when buying one:
Size is a large factor in purchasing a vape pen. Think about your lifestyle. If you are a construction worker, you probably want to consider a larger device that is durable and will last the duration of your work day and possibly more. If you are a student and always on the go, you will want a smaller device that can fit safely in a pants pocket or small book bag pocket. If you are looking for a stealthy device, the smaller vape pens will accommodate your needs. Larger vape pens are usually saved for at-home vaping, but will provide lots of power and battery life as well.

As Alex mentioned, we had a massive site re-design recently which took two months to complete, so things were quite quiet during that time. We are tying to get more reviewers in place to make sure we cover more products, but unfortunately due to the market moving so quickly it is very hard to cover even a fraction of the new products coming out and some things just get missed. We are doing our best, so bare with us! Over the last month we have published around 20 reviews, which I don’t think is too shabby. We have to make sure we appeal to all types of vapers with our reviews, so that means providing a mix of products and not just box mods.
Let me start off with saying “Thank you”. Thanks to everyone who was part of the making of the “K Vape” vaporizer. In all my experiences with various Portable Vapes, this is by far the best vaporizer on the market today. I have never experienced such an awesome experience in my entire years of vaping, to add I was vaping on the first level with no issues, that’s right NO ISSUES whatsoever. Regard

TEMPERATURE CONTROL: Temperature control devices require the use of nickel, titanium or stainless steel wire. Temperature control coils are designed specifically for use only with devices equipped with circuit boards capable of controlling coil temperature. Do NOT use temperature control coils with any device that is not equipped to handle temperature control. MistHub is not responsible for any damage caused by the misuse and/or mishandling of temperature control devices. If you would like to learn more about Temperature Control, please check out our Temperature Control Tutorial!
There’s no sense in insisting on the fact that vaping is healthy – inhaling anything other than pure air into the lungs definitely isn’t. However, research (Cochrane Review) has shown that vaping doesn’t seem to have any negative short-term health consequences.
Ceramic coils are known to deliver a pure flavor although you may have to compromise somewhat on vapor quantity. The best ceramic heating chambers, such as those Mig Vapor uses, feature heating coils built into the ceramic material ensuring that there are no exposed metal coils.
Mods come in different shapes and sizes, box mods and flask mods are very popular. Some vape mods have “built-in” batteries; others allow you to remove and replace individual batteries yourself. Handy if you want to keep a number of charged batteries on you, ready to use.
Flavor Type: Inhale the icy freshness of menthol with a delicious blueberry note Every pod pack Includes 2 Cartridge Refills My. VON ERL Liquidpods are pre-filled cartridges exclusively for your My Von Erl E-Cigarette Starter Kit Please select your nicotine strength!
Finally, we will take a look at the best vape pens for dabs and waxes. This class of vape pen will vaporize dabs, waxes, concentrates, and often oils. Dabs, waxes, and concentrates all refer to a condensed form of marijuana or botanical extract that takes on a waxy composition. The composition is almost entirely comprised of the active ingredients. Vaping dabs is a very intense experience!

If you’re new to vaping, then you are probably wondering what it is all about. In the following guide will we explain what e-liquid is and how to choose a good e-liquid for you. If you’re new to vaping, then you are probably wondering what it is…
The Ranker is the latest advancement from Smoant since the well-received Cylon mod. It utilizes their most recent chipset which fires with virtually no delay using dual 18650s. This super responsive mod is firmware upgradable. It also has a colorful 1.3-inch OLED screen with 2 user interface options.
For beginners, the k anger tech subox nano is nice, it doesn’t come with a battery so be prepared for that, but 70 for a sub ohm box mod that allows temp control all the way from 0.1-50 in .1 increments really isn’t bad. It’s my first sub ohm piece I’ve owned and I’m learning on it about temps, taste, clouds and coils on it. I always used to assume a higher temp was better, now with this piece I’m finding out more of the intricacies that different temps play on your vaping experience. Personally I use Charlies chalk dust dream cream and Cut wood bird brains (fruity pebbles flavor) on my box, box vape extremely nicely and the flavors are amazing
The Series 3X is everything you need to start vaping, whether you are just quitting cigarettes or want a new way to enjoy your dry herb or wax. This powerful and versatile vape pen allows you to switch between all three easily and quickly by utilizing a secure magnetic connection.
The latest salvo: A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics found five cancer-causing toxins in the urine of 16-year-olds who inhaled e-cigarette vapor, and a second study found, yet again, that e-cigarettes encourage teens to begin smoking traditional cigarettes.
All vape pens contain some kind of battery that powers the device. Next there is either going to be either an herb chamber for cannabis, or a coil that vaporizes e-liquid or wax. When the user engages the battery, it sends power to the heating coil or heating chamber.
Some of the models are 3 in one vape pen and come with interchangeable parts or multi-function parts that can be used for vaping more than one type of material. If you think you may want to experiment, this type would be the best for you.

Dry herbs have been used for centuries for meditation, relaxation and medicinal purposes. Certain flowers and herbs can be dried and crushed and then inserted into a vape pen that is capable of vaping them. The vape pen chamber will heat up the dry herbs which will release a vapor which can be inhaled. Certain flowers and herbs have different aromatherapy properties.
Be sure to measure how often you think you will use a vape pen. Its usage depends entirely on the user and if you are stuck somewhere, unable to charge it, then you may want to decide on a vape pen with a large battery capacity. Cheaper vape pens need to be charged throughout the day after continuous use, but larger ones might only need to be charged once a day. Some vape pens can be used while charging as well.
E-liquid vape pens, or e-cigarettes, are the most common and basic type of vape pens. They consist of a battery, an e-liquid tank, and atomizer coil. The atomizer coils will need to be replaced every week to three weeks depending on how much you vape. You manually fill the e-liquid tank with e-juice.
Portable pen vaporizers function much in the same way as a vape pen, but a portable wax pen vaporizer is going to be larger than a vape pen. They are lightweight and can be carried around, but some are not as compact. Some can be small enough to be hidden away in your palm, while others are large enough that they will stick out like a sore thumb.

Now all e-cig power sources are called mods. Box mods are one of two primary types of power sources, with tube mods being the other. Almost universally, box mods have a firing switch or button. Press the switch and the atomizer gets power from the mod and “fires”, vaporizing eliquid with the instantly heated coil. Release the button, and the power is cut off.
