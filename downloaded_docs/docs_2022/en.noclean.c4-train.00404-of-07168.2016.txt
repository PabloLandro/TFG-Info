Brain Cancer /Hand Cancer/Aorta Cancer
Sadly, Florida Attorney Jimmy Gonzalez has succumbed to several DIFFERENT cancers ALL caused by cell phone radiation exposure!
EACH CANCER EXACTLY WHERE HIS CELL PHONE WAS HELD CLOSE TO HIS BODY!
Since Jimmy’s warning about cell phones causing GBM (Glioblastoma) brain tumors, there is a rapidly growing list of political brain tumor deaths potentially linked to wireless radiation exposure that now includes the very honored Senator John McCain who has succumbed to his GBM (Glioblastoma) diagnosis.

Jimmy vs. Cell Phone Induced Cancer – A battle Jimmy fought to the end, and it is a battle RF Safe will continue in his dedication along with all the other lives which have been destroyed by a tradition of wireless profits before people.
Our prayers go out to Jimmy Gonzalez’s wife, children, and family! I’ve felt their pain and frustration over the issue of RF Radiation exposure. I attribute the death of my daughter Angel Leigh Coates to RF Radiation exposure as well. Just as Jimmy did, RF Safe will continue this battle through to our last breaths too! God Bless You, Jimmy!
“CELL PHONES DO CAUSE CANCER” – Jimmy Gonzalez (Obituary) February 20, 1972 – November 27, 2014

South Florida Attorney Jimmy Gonzalez testifies in front of the Pembroke Pines Fl Commission regarding the dangers of cell phone use and how using his cell phone for a period of 10 years for well over 30 minutes a day caused cancer to appear in the very spots on his body where his cell phone was heavily used…
Commissioners in Pembroke Pines have passed a resolution to warn residents about potential cancer dangers related to cellphone radiation.
The resolution, believed to be the first of its kind in the state, encourages residents to keep their cellphones at least one-inch away from their bodies, use a headset or speakerphone and send messages by text or email, according to the Sun-Sentinel.
“Our city’s resolution isn’t about creating panic and alarm,” said Commissioner Angelo Castillo. “It’s about raising awareness in a responsible way to ensure that the health of all cellphone users is protected.”
The resolution was passed after resident Jimmy Gonzalez told the commission about his brush with cancer, which he believes was caused by his cell phone.
Gonzalez had a cancerous tumor above his left ear removed in August 2011, a year after he’d had another tumor removed from his left hand.
“One day, it came to me,” Gonzalez told the Sun-Sentinel, “maybe there’s something in common with my hand and head.”
Gonzalez, an attorney who used to use his cell phone for several hours a day, is now cancer-free.
“Do I have 100 percent scientific study that can say well this is what caused it?” Gonzalez told NBC 6 South Florida Tuesday. “No but I can’t think of anything that would explain this otherwise.”
Some studies from the World Health Organization, Government Accountability Office and National Cancer Institute say cellphones could be linked to cancer, but scientists say more research is necessary.
Pembroke Pines Mayor Frank Ortiz feels it’s his obligation to inform residents of even the slightest health risk.
“Cities do that, they make people aware of other cities or people that have something wrong with them or something else like that, and I think that’s our job to make people aware of these things,” Ortiz said.
Commissioners plan to send the Pembroke Pines resolution to agencies across the state to encourage other cities to pass similar resolutions.

Notable Quotes
“Cell phones cause cancer.” “It should become crystal clear that cell phones do cause cancer and that the American people are not being properly warned about cell phones.” “… do whatever it takes to warn everybody about keeping cell phones away from their bodies.”
RIP Jimmy Gonzalez (1972-2014)
