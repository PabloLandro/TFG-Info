Therefore, it acts as barriers and helps to form the body’s first line of defence against condition and disease. To enhance the goodness of carrots, you should add a little fat in your carrot salad.

Vitamin A is solubl not in water but in fat. Therefore, it is not lost in the fluids inside the body.

That does not mean you should stop using your sunscreen when you eat a lot of carrots.
