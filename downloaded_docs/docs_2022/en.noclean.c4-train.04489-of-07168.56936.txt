Yes, I Can! - Handling Macular Degeneration
A- A+
#31 Quiz Answers - December 12, 2017
Sunglasses that block 100 percent of UVA and UVB light rays are much more expensive than other sunglasses.
False. You can’t judge how well sunglasses block ultraviolet light by the price. You can buy expensive designer glasses that don’t have good protection. Read the label to see if the lenses block 100% of UVA and UVB rays.
Children don’t need to wear sunglasses because their eyes are better able to withstand ultraviolet rays and glare than adult eyes are.
False. Children’s eyes need protection the same as adults.
Cataracts and age-related macular degeneration may be caused, at least in part, by too much ultraviolet light exposure.
True. Both cataracts and age-related macular degeneration may be caused (at least in part) by too much ultraviolet light exposure.
If you are a mountain dweller, you will likely be exposed to higher UV levels than if you live in the lowlands.
True. If you are a mountain dweller, you will likely be exposed to higher UV levels than if you live in the lowlands. The UV exposure increases at higher altitudes because the earth’s atmosphere is thinner. The ozone layer is less effective at blocking the UV radiation.
There is no reason to wear sunglasses on a cloudy day.
False. You need your sunglasses on cloudy days, too. Haze and clouds don’t prevent UV rays from reaching your eyes.
Sunglass lenses with dark tints are more protective against ultraviolet rays than those with light tints.
False. Sunglass lenses with dark tints are not more protective against UV rays than those with a light tint.
High-energy visible (HEV) light — also called blue light — is a kind of ultraviolet radiation.
False. High-energy visible (HEV) light – also called blue light – is in the visible light spectrum, not in the UV range. It is suspected as a cause of age-related macular degeneration so certain sunglasses are designed to block HEV light, too.
Only people with light-colored eyes need sunglasses; people with dark-colored eyes are naturally protected because they have more pigment in their eyes.
False. People with light-colored eyes may be more at risk of UV-related eye damage, but people of any eye color can benefit from UV protection.
Brown-tinted sunglass lenses are best for letting you see colors as they really are.
False. Gray is considered the most neutral of tints when it comes to color perception.
If you’re wearing high-quality sunglasses, it’s OK to gaze at the sun.
False. It’s not OK to gaze at the sun. Even if you’re wearing sunglasses it can damage your retinas.
Anti-reflective coating often is applied to the back surface of sunglass lenses to reduce glare caused by light reflecting into your eyes when the sun is behind you.
True. Anti-reflective coating applied to the back surface of sunglasses helps to eliminate glare and eye strain.
The UV Index is a 10-point scale that sunscreen lotion manufacturers devised in the 1970s to encourage people to buy their product.
False. The UV index was developed by the National Weather Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1994 based on a similar index developed two years earlier in Canada. 1 is low risk and 11+ is extreme risk of UV radiation that can cause sunburn, skin cancer, and cataracts. Here’s a link to today’s UV Index levels for most of North America.
If you wear contact lenses with a UV blocker, you still need to wear sunglasses.
True. If you wear contact lenses with a UV blocker, you still need to wear sunglasses because the contacts only protect the parts of the eye that are directly behind the lenses. The surrounding tissues are still exposed to the sun.
Certain medications can increase your body’s sensitivity to UV and HEV radiation.
True. Certain medications can increase the body’s sensitivity to UV rays.
