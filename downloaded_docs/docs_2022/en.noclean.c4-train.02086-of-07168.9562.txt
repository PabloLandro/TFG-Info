Lemon and Baking Soda
The combination of lemon and baking soda has 10 000 times more stronger effect than chemotherapy!
Why was this fact kept as a secret?
Being totally aware of the powerful properties lemon provides is completely opposite to the interest some world organisations have. For that reason, we recommend you share this article and help a friend who needs it!
Do you have any idea of the recent number of deaths because this secret was jealously kept in order to protect large corporations?
Numerous studies have proven the anti-cancer properties of lemon. Lemon also provides other benefits, including its strong power in treating cyst and tumors.
Lemons have the power to cure cancer, since it has been tested on all cancer types. Adding baking soda makes it even more powerful, because baking soda brings pH to normal level.
Lemon also has potent antimicrobial effect in treating bacterial and fungal infections. It is effective in the fight against internal parasites and it regulates blood pressure. Lemon is beneficial for the nervous system as well – it is a powerful antidepressant, reducing stress and calming nerve crises.
One of the largest drug manufacturers claims that 20 laboratory experiments, conducted since 1970 until recently, proved that:
Lemon destroys cancer cells in 12 cancer types. It prevents metastasis of cancer cells and it is 10 000 stronger than drugs like Adriamycin, chemotherapy and narcotic products.
What is more interesting is the fact that the combination of lemon extract and baking soda destroys cancer cells only, without harming healthy cells and tissues.
The experiments have shown that patients diagnosed with cancer should drink lemon juice and a teaspoon of baking soda. This treatment can not cure the disastrous side effects of chemotherapy.
The best way to be sure that lemons are organic without any chemicals used is to grow this fruit in your own garden or in a pot. Organic lemons are 100 times more efficient than lemons cultivated with chemical fertilizers and treated with chemicals.
Note: there is no peer reviewed medical evidence supporting the efficacy of lemon and baking soda in place of current medical therapy.
