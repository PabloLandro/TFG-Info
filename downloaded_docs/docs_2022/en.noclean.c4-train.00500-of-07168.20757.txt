Morphine Addiction
Morphine's euphoric effects tend to cause many individuals to develop a Morphine addiction. Tolerance (the need for higher and higher doses to maintain the same effect), as well as physical and psychological Morphine addiction, develop quickly.
Addictive drugs, such as Morphine, activate the brain's reward systems. The promise of reward is very intense, causing the individual to crave Morphine and to focus his or her activities around taking Morphine. The ability of Morphine to strongly activate the brain reward mechanisms and its ability to chemically alter the normal functioning of these systems can produce a Morphine addiction. Morphine also reduces a person's level of consciousness, harming the ability to think or be fully aware of present surroundings.
Individuals with a Morphine addiction may lose interest in daily activities and report loss of energy and boredom. Individuals who have acquired a Morphine addiction may develop problems with their jobs and personal relationships. Like other drug addictions, Morphine can become the most important aspect of their lives. Morphine addiction often costs addicts $100-$200 a day, which can cause addicts to quickly turn to lives of shoplifting, burglary, theft, drug dealing, and prostitution to support their Morphine addiction.

Drug Facts
Methadone can interact with other drugs. Alcohol and prescription, non-prescription, herbal and street drugs may interfere with the action of methadone in your body.
Methadone enters the illicit drug market primarily as a result of patients selling their prescriptions.
Contrary to popular belief methadone is a highly addictive drug. Abusers will often combine methadone with other drugs, such as Klonepin, in order to intensify the high and make it resemble the feelings they get from heroin.
Overdose due to methadone is on the rise in the state of Florida.
Methadone overdose is a serious medical emergency. In the event of suspected overdose call an ambulance. If the person is losing consciousness lie them on their side in the recovery position so that they will not choke if they vomit.
