Can You Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding
Can You Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding? Of Course YES.
If you have a baby an 8-month-old and you’re still breastfeeding, that’s awesome, then maybe in your mind “can you get pregnant while breastfeeding?” You’re starting to think about baby number 2 maybe you’re wanting to try when your baby’s about a year of age.
It sounds great if you’re not having regular cycles. It’s hard to tell if you’re ovulating or not and breastfeeding will do that too.
Some women never resume their period until they stop nursing. it’s because the hormones of breastfeeding suppress ovulation and the cycles with breastfeeding is not a pure form of contraception.
Of course, there are many women who get pregnant while they’re nursing and some would never have a period. Then all of a sudden find out that they’re pregnant.
It can happen but the chances of you ovulating when you’re not having cycles and when you’re breastfeeding are lower than they would be if you weren’t so that day might come.
When you really want to have another baby but you’re still breastfeeding and then you need to weigh out what your priorities are. If you really want to have another baby and you’ve breastfed your first baby until a year of age, that’s really good.
There’s a lot to be said in that you and your baby have gained the health benefits that come from nursing. And if you want to stop breastfeeding at that time, so your body can resume normal cycles and it will make it easier for you to get pregnant.
Then you can decide if that’s a decision you’d like to make in order to get pregnant, of course, you do need to ovulate and you need to time intercourse with ovulation. This is really hard to do again if you’re not having regular cycles.
I suggest that you talk to your doctor if you still wanna get the right answer about “can you get pregnant while breastfeeding?” They can help you decide what plan would be best for you based on their knowledge of your circumstances, their ability to ask you more specific questions.
