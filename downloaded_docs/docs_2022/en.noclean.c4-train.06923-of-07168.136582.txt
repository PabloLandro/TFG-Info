The Best Diet – 3 Key Features Your Diet Must Have For Weight Loss Success
Leave a reply
So you’ve already made the resolution that THIS is the year you’re going to lose weight and get in the best shape of your life. You’re not going to settle for second best – you’re going to achieve that dream body you’ve always wanted.
Great news – this is actually the best time to make that commitment. Why? Because you can take advantage of the powerful momentum and energy ‘Swim-suit Season’ brings to achieve your weight loss dreams.
But there’s nothing worse than committing to lose weight, only to get lost among the 5 gazillion diets out there. It can get confusing – you may end up wasting a lot of money and effort. You may end up wondering which diet is really the BEST diet for you.
You may even end up feeling so frustrated that you give up on your dream of becoming slim and healthy. But it doesn’t have to be that way.
In order to have rapid weight loss success, you have to find the best diet for you (a.k.a. the diet that will speed you towards your dream body at lightning pace). There are millions of diets – but only a few that are best for you and your lifestyle.
The best diet for you will have the 3 key features listed below. Choose your diet with these 3 key features in mind and you’re already halfway to your weight loss dreams.
#1 Proven Success Rate
Are there before and after pictures of people who have lost weight with that particular diet? Are there customer testimonials? Have there been independent studies done on the diet’s success rate?
The diet you chose doesn’t have to have all three of these but try to find at least some kind of proven success rate before choosing that particular program.
Finding a diet with a proven success rate not only lets you know that the diet works but it also helps give you the confidence that the diet will work FOR YOU.
Confidence is one of the most underrated factors in a successful weight loss program. If you’ve tried and failed with diets before you especially need that extra boost of confidence to carry you through the more difficult times in the diet. By reminding yourself that this diet has been proven to work – you’ll be able to keep going and reach your weight loss goals.
A related feature that gets extra points is if the diet has been recommended by an expert or a physician. Again this boosts your confidence that the diet is safe and effective.
#2 Affordable
Losing weight should not cost you thousands of dollars (unless we’re talking about surgery here and that’s an entirely different article). The best diet will be affordable for the average person.
If the diet costs too much, be very suspicious and look elsewhere. There are too many shady diets out there and as a consumer, it pays to be cautious.
I’ll give you an example of what I mean:
A close friend of mine went to a well-known weight loss clinic in our area. You know them – they regularly use famous entertainers and celebrities. She was told she had to pay the yearly fees up front (around $1000 NOT including food). They also told her she had to buy their food in bulk (like $500 for a year’s worth of chocolate).
When the chocolate gave her heart palpitations and she had to take it back, they told her it was non-refundable. She was out the money for the chocolate. Plus, she feels she can’t leave the program because she’s paid the yearly fees (which, you guessed it, are also non-refundable).
She unfortunately made the mistake of ignoring her instincts and paying way too much money for a diet program. If you notice you’re being asked for hefty fees right out of the gate, warning lights should be flashing in your mind.
Now on the other hand, the best diet WILL cost you something. It actually is better if you put some cash on the table for your diet program. Why? Because when we invest in something we’re more likely to stick with it. When we invest in something we are more likely to follow through and get the results we want.
For example another friend did a liver detox several months ago. I’m not really into liver detoxing but she read an article and figured she’d try it.
This detox kit cost her a whopping $50 and when she opened the instructions she told me she had to give up junk food for two weeks. In any other universe I would have laughed and simply forgotten about detoxing my liver. But because she had shelled out $50, she was invested – she decided that she hopefully wouldn’t starve from lack of junk food over two weeks and suffered through it.
If I’d gotten the detox kit for free there’s no way I would have followed those instructions. But because she was invested, she followed through and now has a healthier liver thanking her for it.
So when searching for the best diet, putting out some money on yourself and your dreams of a better body is actually a healthy thing. Just keep in mind that you shouldn’t have to spend thousands of dollars on it.
#3 Compatible with Your Tastes and Lifestyle
This is THE most crucial step however it’s the one where most people go wrong. When choosing a diet, they simply pick one and go, without considering if it is compatible with their tastes and lifestyle.
For example, if you hate feeling deprived or empty you might want to choose a program that lets you eat many times during the day so you don’t feel hungry. If you get bored easily you want a diet program that gives you tremendous variety and flexibility. If you don’t do a lot of cooking or food preparation, you’ll want to look at a program where the food is pre-made for you.
Diets are like cars – there are hundreds of different models out there, each with their own unique features. And they can get you where you want to go. But your personality might gel better with certain features than others.
Dieting is hard enough. Don’t make it harder on yourself by choosing a diet not compatible with who you are. Setting yourself up for success will also guarantee that you’ll stick it out until you reach your goal.
Here’s an `ALL-NATURAL’ Detox I suggest you use from a company with a solid 26+ year track record. It is the`Ultra Body Cleanse.
This is a thorough detoxification program. It consists of 2 steps, an Internal cleanse and a general detoxifier. It will clean the liver, kidney, lungs and intestine. It contains senna leaves and frangula bark. Once combined they sweep toxins and energize probiotics and enzymes. It cleanses the digestive system, including the elimination tract.
And one other thing, the best diet will be one that you can get excited about. Choose a diet that you enjoy, that you believe in, that may actually be – gulp – fun.
Emotional excitement will fade in time, yes. But it can give you enough of an emotional push to get you over the initial hump. By that time your first few pounds will have come off and will serve as your continuing motivation.
So those are 3 key considerations when looking for the best diet. Keep them in mind and you will progress in leaps and bounds towards your dream body. Remember, planning now may seem boring – but it’s the key to your future weight loss success.
And of` course I have to suggest one that worked very well for me that I hope will work for you. It does encompass all 3 key features we haven discussed in this article — plus one more great feature. It is an `ALL-NATURAL’, time tested program!

Delightful New Ways to Reduce Cholesterol Without Drugs
Leave a reply
Those of us with unfavorable cholesterol scores are constantly bombarded with the importance of controlling LDL-HDL levels. Unfortunately, many of the drugs prescribed for cholesterol reduction can have serious side effects such as fatigue, muscle cramps, brain fog, etc. Trying a natural adjustment to your diet may be a better and less risky way to tame the cholesterol beast.
With all the news and warnings about the dangers of high cholesterol, many people view cholesterol as a “bad” substance that should be eliminated completely from our lives. In truth, cholesterol serves some important functions in the body. In order to understand how cholesterol affects the body, one must first understand what cholesterol is.
Cholesterol is a waxy substance that is attached to the fats in our bloodstream and is present in all of the cells of the body. Cholesterol comes from food that we eat, as well as being manufactured directly by the liver. Cholesterol is an important regulator in the bloodstream, as it helps to regulate the formation of many cells as well as hormones. However, to have too high or too low of a cholesterol count in the blood can be a very dangerous factor, often leading to a heart attack or a stroke. Although cholesterol is prevalent in the blood stream, it cannot dissipate in the blood. The cholesterol maneuvers throughout the body attached to lipids (fats).
Over time, cholesterol builds up on the artery walls and this condition is known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis was thought to be an affliction of the elderly until the 1950′s when American pathologists were sent to Korea by the Pentagon to study the bodies of servicemen who died during the conflict. They autopsied around 2000 soldiers and found that approximately 75% had waxy, yellow deposits on the walls of their arteries; a shocking statistic considering the average age of the soldiers was 21. Their findings astonished the scientific community as it highlighted the onset of heart disease in the very young.
There are two main types of cholesterol. The first type is called LDL cholesterol, and the other is HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol, otherwise known as low-density lipoprotein, is considered the “dangerous” cholesterol. LDL cholesterol can build up on the artery walls. Over time this plaque build-up blocks blood flow, reducing circulation and causing stress and damage to the heart. This raises blood pressure, and eventually leads to heart disease or a heart attack. Individuals that have higher levels of LDL run a much higher risk of having heart disease. Although LDL is affected by genetics, there are several precautions that individuals can take towards keeping safe LDL levels.
The other form of cholesterol is HDL, or high-density lipoprotein. HDL is considered the “good” cholesterol. HDL cholesterol is important for the body to have as this type of cholesterol helps filter out LDL cholesterol from the lining of the arteries, as well as transporting fat in the bloodstream (triglycerides) to the liver so that it can be excreted from the body. It is believed that even having high levels of HDL is safe, as it can help protect one’s heart from a heart attack or stroke. Low counts of HDL could potentially lead to a heart attack and stroke, however this is rare for people eating a western-style diet, which is typically high in both forms of cholesterol.
Most of the cholesterol in our bodies comes from the foods we eat. Foods high in fats, particularly saturated and trans fats, contribute to high levels of LDL cholesterol. Meat and dairy products are the main sources of LDL cholesterol, while leafy vegetables, fruits, and nuts are more nutritious alternatives that have higher levels of HDL cholesterol. While genetics does play a role in cholesterol levels, a change in diet is the most effective way to lower dangerous cholesterol levels, and reduce your risk of heart disease and associated health problems.
Certain natural substances found in Ardyss, including plant sterols, fish oils, and policosanol have been shown in numerous clinical studies to be highly effective in promoting healthy cholesterol levels, particularly when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. If you are concerned about your cholesterol levels, now is the time to make a change, and Vasacor can help.
There are numerous medications on the market today, but for many individuals it is possible to lower cholesterol naturally rather than with drugs. Currently more than 60% of adults over the age of 45 suffer some form of heart or blood related issues, including high cholesterol. To ensure this does not lead to a shorter life or a poorer quality of life, the following steps can be taken:
Regular Exercise
The use of regular exercise to lower cholesterol naturally has been supported for decades as an effective alternative to pharmaceuticals. Something as simple as walking 30 minutes a night can significantly reduce cholesterol levels in the adult body while 30 minutes of full aerobic exercise 3-4 times a week is ideal for the optimum reduction in LDL and HDL levels.
Low Fat Diet
In conjunction with regular exercise, a low fat diet that contains less than 30% fat with as close to zero saturated fats as possible can help lower cholesterol naturally. Reading labels to ensure you receive the most accurate information as well is recommended as many labels are intentionally misleading. Anything pre-packaged, frozen foods, non-skim dairy products, and red meats, along with any high fat snacks or junk foods are all considered bad additions to a diet designed to reduce cholesterol.
Adding the Right Foods
Foods that are high in fiber, contain lots of garlic, fish oil, or soy, or that are rich in whole grains are considered highly effective in both stopping the effects of high cholesterol and reducing your existing levels. Fresh fruits and vegetables, beans, and whole grains are all good sources of these foods and should be integrated into a lower cholesterol diet as much as possible.
What foods specifically lower cholesterol? So glad you asked!
Foods that Lower LDL Cholesterol
There are a number of foods which are believed to significantly lower LDL cholesterol. Fiber-rich foods are said to be particularly beneficial and will not only lower ‘bad’ cholesterol, but also help the bowel to function properly, lowering the risk of colon and bowel cancer. There are many other foods that can help the body fight back against these dangerous deposits.
Fiber-rich foods, particularly oat bran, barley and wheat bran. They can be eaten as a cereal for breakfast and sprinkled onto other foods. Pearl barley can be added to soups. Apples and pears also have considerable amounts of soluble fiber and should be enjoyed on a daily basis.
Beans and pulses are high in fiber and low-fat. They also contain lecithin, a nutrient that lowers cholesterol. Try to incorporate kidney, fava, borlotti and other dried whole-foods into your diet; there are many different types of lentils and pulses that are delicious in soups and stews.
Avocado contains prolific amounts of monounsaturated fat, which helps to reduce LDL cholesterol and has many other health benefits including anti-cancer properties.
Raw carrots are rich in a fiber called pectin that is renowned for minimizing cholesterol. There are a number of fruits that also contain pectin, including; apples, citrus fruits, strawberries, raspberries and other red or black berries.
Shitake mushrooms are widely used by the Japanese and include a compound called lentinan, which not only lowers cholesterol, but is also thought to be anti-cancerous and may help to boost the immune system.
Garlic is a super food and is well known for its blood-thinning properties. It also contains a substance allicin which is thought to prevent the body retaining LDL cholesterol and research has shown that the equivalent of one clove per day can lessen ‘bad’ cholesterol by 10-15% in the majority of people.
Root ginger has been used in Chinese medicine for centuries and has numerous health benefits. It can be added to stir-fry’s (using healthy sesame oil) and other vegetable dishes.
Nuts are naturally high in omega-3 fatty acids and are known to significantly reduce blood cholesterol; walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts and almonds are especially beneficial.
Sesame seeds are rich in phytosterols. These compounds are said to substantially lessen LDL cholesterol. Other foods containing phytosterols include; celery, lettuce, asparagus, spinach, tomatoes, ginger, squash and strawberries.
Safflower, canola, soybean, and olive oil are monounsaturated and are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids. Research indicates that they can decrease atherosclerotic plaque by up to 15% when eaten regularly.
Salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel contain considerable amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which have many health benefits and are essential for brain and eye function.
Prunes are a wonderful source of antioxidants and fiber, which is known to reduce LDL cholesterol.
Alfalfa sprouts contain a substance called saponin, which is thought to obstruct and inhibit the formation of atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries.
If you have high cholesterol or a family tendency towards atherosclerosis it is best to avoid processed and prepared foods, fried food, food containing animal fats or animal products, high-fat dairy products and food containing either saturated fat or trans fats. Research has revealed the key to lowering LDL cholesterol is a healthy, balanced diet that incorporates plenty of soluble fiber and at least five portions of fruit or vegetables a day. This combined with regular cardiovascular exercise should help keep the heart healthy and provide numerous other health benefits as well.
Supplements
Supplements can also be added to help lower cholesterol naturally. To boost fiber and fatty acid intake, supplements such as Omega-3 in flax seed oil or fish oil along with garlic extracts have been shown to significantly lower cholesterol naturally and without any side effects. Found over the counter in any drug store or natural health store, these supplements are easy to take or mix in with food for significant benefits to a low cholesterol diet.
May I suggest some supplemental all-natural products which help lower cholesterol – Omega 369 and Fiber Balance.
Omega 369 is an ideal formula of Omega-3, Omega-6 and Omega-9 essential fatty acids (EFAs), the “good fats” that help support brain and heart, and maintain good health; EFAs contribute to processing of the cell membranes which help your cardiovascular system in balance.
