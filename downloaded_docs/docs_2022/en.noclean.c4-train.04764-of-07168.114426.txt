Secondhand Exposure to Cell Phone Radiation: An Emerging Public Health Problem?

Many people are unaware that they are exposed to cell phone radiation when their cell phones are in standby mode. This occurs because their cell phone contacts the nearest cell tower periodically to update its location.
In a moving vehicle, cell phones in standby mode contact cell towers more frequently. Thus, exposure to cell phone radiation from one’s cell phone is greater in transit.
Two Swiss researchers, Damiano Urbinello and Martin Roosli, set out to measure personal cell phone radiation exposure during car, bus and train trips when one’s own phone was in standby mode.
Their study just published in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology identified a source of cell phone radiation that may constitute a public health problem. Namely, secondhand exposure to cell phone radiation from other people’s cell phones can be considerable while traveling on buses and trains (1).
During bus or train trips, individuals may be exposed to considerable amounts of cell phone radiation from other people’s cell phones. Buses and railroad cars act like “”Faraday cages”” that reflect much of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by cell phones throughout the vehicles’ interiors. Thus, all passengers, including infants and pregnant women as well as those without cell phones, may be exposed to considerable levels of cell phone radiation emitted by others’ phones.
As for car trips, the results of the study suggest that exposure to cell phone radiation from one’s own phone in standby mode is relatively low compared to overall exposures during public transit. Nonetheless, those who are concerned about their exposure to cell phone radiation should turn off their phones during car trips, or at the very least, avoid using their phones for calls.
● “”The study indicates that own uplink exposure during car driving can be considerably reduced (about a fraction of 100) when turning off ones own mobile phone in order to prevent it from location updates.”” (1)
The researchers found that GSM, the 2G carrier system in Europe which is used in the U.S. for voice communication by AT&T and T-Mobile, is particularly problematic compared to UMTS, a 3G carrier system used for data transmission. The researchers did not test CDMA which in the U.S. is used by Verizon and Sprint for voice calls. Other research has found that GSM emits 13 to 28 times more radiation on average than CDMA during phone calls. No published studies have examined exposures from LTE, the 4G carrier system now in widespread use in this country.
● “”GSM levels in the reference scenario during bus and train rides were about 100 times higher than those during car rides. As a consequence of this high background exposure in trains, due to the use of other people’s mobile phone in a closed area intensified by the Faraday cage effect, the relative contribution of the location update from ones own mobile phone is small”” (1)
The study also reported that smart phones, including the iPhone 4 and the Blackberry Bold 8800, which can operate on four radiofrequency bands emit more radiation during standby mode than classic phones, like the Nokia 2600, which operate on two bands.
Earlier this year, a study was published that examined cell phones in standby mode while stationary. Kjell Mild and his colleagues from Sweden found that under these conditions cell phones contacted the cell towers only once every two to five hours. They concluded that exposure to cell phone radiation in this situation “”can be considered negligible.”” (2)
These studies should be replicated in the U.S. as well as in other countries since every cell phone carrier system operates differently.
In the meantime it is advisable to keep cell phone use in moving vehicles to a minimum as low level exposures to cell phone radiation have been associated with deleterious effects in humans.
To protect us from the health risks associated with cell phones and related devices (e.g., cordless phones, Wi-Fi, wireless Smart Meters and security systems, and cell towers), we need research independent of industry to develop biologically-based standards and safer technologies. A nickel a month from each cell phone subscription would suffice to fund a comprehensive program of research. Since the average cell phone subscription costs more than $47.00 per month, this tiny fee constitutes a prudent investment in our health and our children’s health.

We have been seeing a torrent of changes in the way that people, governments and legal bodies have been approaching the issue of cell phone radiation.
We recently reported a groundbreaking court case in Italy that ruled in favor of a man who claimed he developed a brain tumor as a result of excessive phone use for his work.
Another high profile occurrence was a recent study that was released which indicated a negative affect on unborn fetuses from phone radiation.
These are only a few of the changes that are going on worldwide, but in the last week a radical development occurred and it has turned the unlikely town of Pembroke Pines, FL into the new battleground for cell phone radiation awareness.
Inspired by a resident’s cancer survival story, Pembroke Pines passed what’s thought to be the first resolution in the state to warn residents about the possibility of cellphone radiation causing cancer.
Pembroke Pines resident Jimmy Gonzalez had a cancerous brain tumor removed from the area above Gonzalez’ left ear the same place where he held his cellphone for hours a day while working as an attorney. Just a year earlier, surgeons removed a tumor from his left hand, in between his index finger and middle finger.
The resolution encourages all residents to keep their cellphone at least one-inch away from their bodies, and to use a wired headset or speakerphone and to send messages by text or email. The resolution also encourages residents to stay informed about the latest scientific reports about cellphone radiation.
Pines plans to send the resolution, passed at its most recent meeting, to agencies across the state including the governor’s office, the Florida League of Cities and the Florida Legislature to encourage other cities and school boards to adopt a similar resolution to protect Floridians.
Does this sound familiar? That is because these are suggestions we have been promoting for quite sometimes. Simple and easy to follow tips that will help you limit the dangers of exposure to phone radiation.
We all know that smartphones are a huge part of our lives, and most of us are not willing to give them up. With tawkon for Android you don’t have to. You can talk all you want and tawkon will alert you when radiation levels spike, and suggest ways to lessen your exposure.
Do you think this is a harbinger of things to come? Will more towns, cities and states all over the country begin to adopt similar requirements?
What are your thoughts?

Traditionally, parotid gland tumors have been very rare. And they’ve generally shown up in people after the age of 50.
Not so anymore. According to a study done by a research group in Israel, there has been a sharp increase in these types of malignant tumors and most of them are occurring with people under the age of 20. Cell phone radiation is the suspected culprit.
What is the Parotid Gland?
The parotid gland is a type of salivary gland in the cheek the one closest to where most people hold a cell phone.
What’s important is that the new data from the Israeli study show no similar increases in the two other major types of salivary glands the submandibular and sublingual glands that are further away from where a phone is generally held.
The study, headed by R. Czerninzki of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem at Hadassah school of Dental Medicine, reported a significant increase in incidence of parotid gland tumors over last 30 years. Finding a four-fold increase in parotid gland cancers from 1970-2006, they found the steepest increase happened after 2001.
US Senate Hearing on Cell Phone Radiation
In 2008, Dr. Siegal Sadetzki, principal investigator of another study on cell phone radiation testified in a US senate hearing that cell phones were identified as a contributor to salivary gland tumors. In his report, he stated that risk of getting a parotid tumor on same side of head used for speaking on cell phone increases by:
34% if you are regular cell phone user & have used a cell phone for 5 yrs
49% if you have spoken on phone for more than 266.3 hours during your lifetime
58% if you’ve had more than about 5500 calls in your lifetime
Parotid gland tumors are not the only tumors being linked to cell phones.

Is There a Connection Between Autism Electromagnetic Radiation?

Research has established a potential link between autism and fetal/neonatal exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation. Based on epidemiological data, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recent evidence indicates the incidence of ASD to be roughly 1 per 110 children.
Some data suggest a possible correlation between autism incidence an environmental toxin known as radio frequency (RF) radiation. This is a biologically active substance. It is known that human exposure to RF radiation has increased during the past 20 years. It is suggested that fetal or neo-natal exposures to RF radiation may be associated with an increased incidence of autism.
Dr. George Louis Carlo PhD studied risks associated with cell phones funded by a government grant. The results he obtained initially indicated no correlations, however, by 1999, Dr. Carlo had obtained significantly more evidence pointing to a risk to DNA, eye cancers, and brain tumors.
At this time he developed a theory that low frequency cell phone signals are harmful to the functioning of cells. What can result of this impaired functioning is that cells which normally move wastes and toxins out of the body started to protect themselves and this cellular movement stopped. Without the ability to move wastes outside cells results in a buildup of toxins. Dr. Carlo’s hypothesis suggests that autistic children are less able to process heavy metals, so these remain in their bodies and cause neurological damage, including autism.
Further research conducted by Dr. Carlo along with Tamara Mariea and published in the Journal of the Australian College of Nutrition and Environmental Medicine in November 2007, demonstrated the positive effects that autistic children could experience in an Electromagnetic-free (EM-free) clinic. This was a trial with 20 autistic children, involving spending at least four hours, 2-3 times a week, in the EM-free clinic. In three months, analyses showed that heavy metals were beginning to be excreted by the children.
Food for Thought:
• The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sets standards for the amount of radio frequency that can be emitted by a cell phone based on the size and structure of a man’s head.
• Radio-frequency signals can reach deeper into children’s head because their skulls are thinner and their brains contain more fluid.
• In 2004, standards relaxed and roughly doubled the amount of radio frequency that could reach an adult brain and quadrupled that reaching a child’s.
• A child’s brain doubles in size during the first two years of life and keeps on developing until their early 20s.
Although it is impossible to pinpoint one single cause of autism or one single barrier to an autistic child’s successful recovery, we are continuing to take steps forwards in identifying contributing factors. It is definitely reasonable to agree with researchers who believe that the increase in exposure to EMR from all of the wireless devices in our lives in combination with environmental and genetic factors is creating the perfect storm to increase the incidence of autism.

Study Links In-utero Exposure to Magnetic Fields to Child Obesity

Wireless devices and household appliances may impact fetal development, changing endocrine and metabolic systems, according to a large study by Kaiser Permanente.
High electromagnetic field levels of household appliances (such as washing machines and hair dryers) and wireless devices (such as laptops and routers) may be at least partially to blame for the rise in childhood obesity in recent years, according to a 13-year study by Kaiser Permanente that followed hundreds of pregnant women and 733 of their children.
After controlling for several factors, including child gender, pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal age at delivery, race, education, breastfeeding, and smoking, researchers write in Nature’s Scientific Reports that children exposed to high in-utero levels are nearly twice as likely to be overweight or obese as children exposed to low in-utero levels.
Specifically, high levels were considered to be more than 2.5 milligauss (mG), which is a unit of magnetic field strength, while low levels were considered to be less than 1.5 mG, and medium was everything in between. (The Environmental Protection Agency has compiled a list of magnetic field measurements in everyday electrical devices.)
“”Pregnancy is a critical developmental stage that is among the most vulnerable periods to environmental exposures,”” De-Kun Li, a perinatal epidemiologist and the lead author of the study, said in a news release. “”EMF exposure during pregnancy could impact the fetal development, including endocrine and metabolic systems, predisposing offspring to higher risk of obesity…This finding could have implications for possibly reducing childhood obesity and better understanding the obesity epidemic.””
When breaking the study down into the 18 factors considered, the findings are a bit befuddling. Out of all areas studied, including maternal, prenatal, and childhood factors, researchers found that only family income and childhood habits of eating fruits and vegetables varied among the low, medium, and high maternal exposure groups.
It turns out that children who ate more fruits and veggies tended to have a mother with higher magnetic field exposure during pregnancy. Researchers said they could not explain this association. And oddly, the pattern of exposure according to family income was inconsistent: Women with low or high family income had lower exposure than women with medium family income.
The study comes on the heels of Dr. Li’s previous work showing that electromagnetic fields could play a role in pregnancy outcomes and childhood diseases such as asthma. Still, he stresses that the results need to be replicated by additional studies.

Electromagnetic Radiation is More Than Skin Deep

Milind Deora, Lok Sabha MP, has recently brought into the public domain a major health issue relating to electromagnetic radiation from cell phones and base stations mounted on telecom towers. The trigger for his taking this important public health issue with the department of telecom (DoT) was the accidental death of a young boy, which, according him, was due to ‘electronic discharge coming in contact with high-tension overhead wire and (that) electrocuted him’. While this may be a freak incident, Deora has rightly focused on the related issue of cell phone radiation, a serious health hazard in the long term.
The non-ionising radiations from microwaves emitted by telecom base stations and cell phones have been considered safe due to their extremely low power density that does not cause any thermal effect on human cells as long as the exposures are within the limits prescribed by the Inter- national Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (Icnirp) in its guidelines. Based on studies conducted in the 1990s, Icnrip fixed limits on radiation from cellular base stations that are 4.5 W/m2 for GSM 900, 9.0 W/m2 for GSM 1800 and 10 W/m2 for UMTS (3G) in 1998. Several measurements made of radiation at the base of telecom towers and other locations have found radiation levels much lower than these limits. Therefore, WHO has declared mobile phones and base stations safe for public health.
However, it should be noted that the Icnirp guidelines are based on short-term, immediate health effects such as stimulation of peripheral nerves and muscles and harm caused by tissue temperatures, resulting from absorption of energy during exposure to electromagnetic fields expressed in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR). These are not based on long-term exposure to radiation from cellphone and base stations, particularly from broadband wireless systems such as WiMAX and 3.5G mobile systems.
Subsequent to the publication of the Icnirp guidelines more than a decade back, a number of studies have brought out the dangers of long-term exposure of RF radiation to public health. Notable among these are the Freiburger Appeal published in October 2002 by the interdisciplinary society for environmental medicine of Germany. The Salzburg Resolution of 2000 recommends outdoor exposure limits that are much lower than the Icnirp guidelines, particularly in publicly accessible areas. Similarly, the Catania Resolution recommends preventive strategies based on the ‘precautionary principle’. The Paris Charter, signed in March 2003 by three mobile phone operators and the City of Paris, limits public exposure to radiation at levels much lower than the Icnirp limits.
The inadequacies of the existing guidelines have been brought out in the BioInitiative Report 2009 in which a number of adverse biological effects of electromagnetic radiation at very low levels from hundreds of peer-reviewed studies have been highlighted.
It is learnt that in India, the Telecom Commission has decided to adopt Icnirp guidelines. In view of the doubts raised about these guidelines in so many countries, including the European Union, it will be prudent to carefully examine all existing international standards and review the decision already taken. The country will have one billion mobile phones by 2012. To connect so many cell phones, about one million base stations may be required. This will create an enormous electromagnetic smog, particularly in urban areas. The effect of such exposure from multiple base stations has not yet been studied in depth. The latency of a serious disease like cancer is ten to 20 years. Therefore, a precautionary approach is justified.
Some regulatory measures can somewhat mitigate the problem. One is to prescribe the maximum emitted power for various systems in the licence and to measure the same for compliance during acceptance testing. Another could be mandating indoor coverage for all commercial and office buildings, particularly for third generation systems. It is estimated that 80% of the 3G multimedia (data/video) traffic will originate or terminate indoor in crowded urban centers. To provide in-building coverage, outdoor base stations have to increase their power level, ie, radiation contributing to the electromagnetic smog.
In case dedicated indoors cells are provided, their radiation level will come down considerably. Studies have indicated up to 400% increase in system capacity by deployment of indoor pico/ microcells and outdoor macrocells, which will make the environment safer, due to reduction in electromagnetic radiation levels. Last but not the least is to give financial incentive to operators who deploy lower power density systems which are environment-friendly.
Since the 3G systems have a much higher level of radiated power, a numberof countries, notably China, have prescribed stricter norms to limit electromagnetic radiation from these systems. These norms are more stringent than what is applicable in Europe/ North America.
Since 3G and broadband wireless access systems like WiMAX are to be inducted in India in the near future, urgent action is required to study the effects of radiation from these systems by an independent group of experts with a view to fixing limits in the Indian context. While various municipal corporations like MCD have recently formulated policies to regulate erection of towers in cities like Delhi, mainly from aesthetic & structural angle, there is no authority at present to regulate radiation from these towers. This must be done by Trai in the interest of public health.

Cell Phone Radiation Protection
(Brevard, NC) – For years, the issue of cell phone safety has been a hot topic of debate, but we now know, thanks to years of stringent laboratory research, that cell phones do emit levels of radiation that can negatively affect one’s health.
Aulterra, the leading cell phone radiation neutralizer manufacturer, is introducing the new Aulterra Neutralizer™ into U.S. markets. The Neutralizer is a small holographic disc which has been scientifically proven to be significantly effective in reducing and neutralizing the harmful effects of electromagnetic waves.
Electromagnetic fields are all around us. In their natural form they are harmless. When electromagnetic fields are man-made, they have been shown to disrupt the DNA structure of our bodies, as scientific studies have demonstrated.
“Growing evidence suggests that electromagnetic fields (EMF) can break or nick DNA strands. This phenomenon is known to be associated with cancer,” said Glen Rein, PhD, of the Quantum Biology Laboratories and Stanford University professor whose research demonstrated that with the Aulterra Neutralizer there is a reduction in the in-Vitro Electromagnetic Field Effect of Cell Phones on Human DNA.
“The most significant finding from the research showed that with the Aulterra Neutralizer, the effect of the cell phone radiation on DNA rewinding is 95% reversed when an Aulterra Neutralizer was attached to the cell phone. Without the Aulterra Neutralizer the electromagnetic fields from the cell phone produced a 40% increase (relative to control values) in the DNA rewinding rate. This effect of the cell phone radiation is highly statistically significant compared to the untreated control.”
The Neutralizer contains a proprietary blend of natural materials which neutralize harmful emissions. The powerful effect of this blend of natural materials was first discovered when it was used to neutralize and remove lead and zinc from a landfill during an environmental cleanup project.
Other cell phone radiation protectors act as blockers or absorbers. The Aulterra Neutralizer is a better solution. It neither blocks radiation nor absorbs it. Any device that blocks 100% of the EMFs from a cell phone would make it useless. Absorbers become saturated and fail to function. The Neutralizer works by neither blocking nor absorbing cell phone radiation. Instead, the Neutralizer changes the manmade frequencies into coherent, harmless frequencies—the way nature intended.
The Aulterra Neutralizer is made from a patented blend of paramagnetic elements including cerium and lanthanum and a rare inorganic compound derived from a crystalline mineral found in only two known sites in the world. These three micro-thin layers of activated rare-earth elements produce the thinnest, most effective neutralizer ever. Simply place the small holographic disc on your phone to combat harmful radiation.
Peel the back from the Neutralizer and place it directly on the back of your cell phone or inside the battery cover. The Neutralizer protects you from radiation from your cell phone and radiation from cell phone towers. The effective range is a 36” diameter sphere from the Neutralizer. And the Aulterra Neutralizer does not negatively affect cellular phone reception or transmission.
For added protection, the Aulterra Neutralizer can be used on the following electronic devices: Wi-Fi routers, tablets, laptops, desktops, microwaves, cordless telephones, baby monitors, televisions, video game equipment, breaker boxes/fuse boxes and more.
The Neutralizer is science that works! Reproducible tests prove that the Aulterra Neutralizer retunes the EMF frequencies of cell phones and other electronic devices into coherent energy. Once the frequencies are converted, they no longer harm to your DNA.
The secret of the Neutralizer lies in the crystalline matrix mixed into the ink of the Neutralizer patch. Neutralizer’s developer, Kim Dandurand identified the crystalline properties while engaged in a major environmental cleanup operation in 1996. He used the blend of material to neutralize chemical and radioactive waste from landfills.
Dandurand then investigated whether the paramagnetic substance could be used to neutralize the EMFs from cell phones and electronic equipment. Kim Dandurand funded a research program at the Quantum Biology Research Laboratories. Experiments showed that human DNA reacted adversely to EMFs emanating from cell phones. Tests on human DNA proved that with an Aulterra Neutralizer attached to a cell phone the natural coherent fields from the Neutralizer had successfully harmonized the incoherent EMFs rendering them harmless to living tissue.
Consider these cell phone radiation facts:
In a study by the University of Washington, Dr. Henry Lai discovered that brain cells are clearly damaged by microwave levels far below the U.S. government’s recommended safe zone and that even small doses of radio frequencies can accumulate over time to cause harmful effects.
In a research study conducted by Italian scientists it was discovered that radiation emitted by cell phones is especially conducive to the growth of cancerous cells.
In a study funded by the telecom industry to prove the safety of cell phones, it was revealed that cellular damage and tumor growth can be induced in a laboratory setting using radiation levels one-third of those listed the FCC’s exposure guidelines.
At the University of Utah, a researcher discovered that the younger the child, the greater the amount of radiation is absorbed by the brain.
Because of the intense electromagnetic field produced by most automobiles, Volkswagen of Europe has issued warnings stating that using a cell phone while in a car can be even more dangerous to the health of the individual.
Since 1975, the number of cases of brain cancer in the United States has increased by 25%.
Studies indicate that using a hands-free headset and earpiece is actually a greater health risk than holding the phone directly against the ear.

The jury is still out about whether electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones and wireless home phones pose health risks. For those concerned about the potential dangers of using mobile devices, here are safety tips provided by the Environmental Health Trust, a nonprofit that researches hazards of using mobile phones, and Pong, a company that makes smartphone cases that redirect radiation away from the heads of users.
1. When on a call, use a wired headset or speakerphone mode. Use a Bluetooth headset, which emits a smaller amount of radiation, only when talking. When not using the headset, keep it off your body.
2. Place the mobile phone away from your body when on a call.
3. Do not carry mobile phones in pockets of pants or in shirts or bras. Use a belt holster designed to shield the body from radiation.
4. Avoid using a mobile phone in a moving car, train, bus, or in rural areas at some distance from a cell tower. Distance from a cell tower will increase the cellphone’s radiation output.
5. Turn the mobile phone off when you don’t need to use it.
6. Use a corded landline phone instead of a wireless phone, which also emits radiation.
7. Avoid using mobile phone inside of buildings, particularly those with steel structures, which increases the device’s radiation output because signals are not as strong.
8. Do not allow children, whose bodies are more vulnerable to absorbing radiation, to sleep with a cellphone beneath their pillow or keep it at the bedside.
9. Do not allow children under 18 to use a mobile phone except in emergencies.
10. When making a call, do not hold the phone to your ear until after the person on the other line answers. The device emits more radiation before a call goes through.

Cell Phone Radiation Protection
Mobile, Portable, Cordless and Cell phones, and Wireless (WiFi) Internet Technology give off the most aggressive form of electromagnetic radiation known to man, because interferes with subtle invisible brain waves and is damaging to the DNA in our body cells.
We are constantly discovering new noxious low-frequency EMF, such as Digital Television, for example, and now we have found out about a new noxious Digital Radiation coming right off the screen of the new iPhones. Upon doing further research, we have now come up with new ways to combat these new noxious energies.
WiFi / Mobile Phone Radiation Shields are designed to eliminate noxious radiation emissions. These WiFi / Mobile Phone Radiation Shields creates a healthy life-force energy field which scatters the microwave emission and at the same time reducing the ‘hot head’ syndrome which usually accompanies mobile/ cell phone users.
Did you know that WiFi technology is just as damaging as Cell Phone Radiation? You can now place a WiFi Radiation Protection Shield directly computer to protect you in wireless internet cafes, or place on your wireless internet modem or card, to protect you from these noxious WiFi beams.
Did you know that any portable phone handset, cordless phone at home or in your office emits noxious electromagnetic radiation and microwave fields? Simply place a Mobile Phone Radiation Shield inside your phone under the battery or place and adhesive Mobile Phone Protection Shield on the back of the device near the aerial, and your portable phone will no longer cause you damage every time you use it. These protection shields are suitable for all mobile phones, portable phones, cordless phones and cell phones.
Mobile Phone Protection Shields also act as a Personal Space Clearer, giving you ten metres of protection everywhere you go, when you take your Mobile Phone, Notebook computer or any other device that has one of our Radiation Protection shields in it.
WiFi / Laptop / Mobile Phone Radiation Shields will protect you, your friends and your loved ones from causing any further harm while using this technology. Not only do these shields put the oxygen back into the air that this technology removes while using these devices but they also work as a person Space Protector, giving you a radiation protection field of around ten metres wherever you go. An absolute must for every type of cell phone, mobile phone or portable desk / home phone, any wireless internet connection or modem and every desktop and laptop computer.
WiFi / Mobile Phone Protection Shields prevents that burning hothead and nauseous feeling while engaged on the phone or even when the phone is in your pocket. These shields give you 100% protection and also prevent further DNA damage from the direct signals to your phone, internet modem or laptop. This can be easily verified through muscle testing (kinesiology), biofeedback machines or pulse testing. Our non-adhesive slides in under your battery. The advantage of this is that you can transfer it over to your new phone every time you update it. Or we have an Adhesive version that can be placed on the back of your phone, wireless internet modem or computer.
We know that you will be more than impressed with the level of improvement in your health and well-being, using our Orgone Energy & Schumann Resonance products, made using our unique Orgonium technology.
