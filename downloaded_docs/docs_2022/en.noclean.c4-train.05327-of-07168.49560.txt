"Should I swim or run to lower my cholesterol?"
Question
Which exercise will work better?
Answer
First, congratulations on considering an exercise plan! This is a great way to improve your overall health and also lower your cholesterol. It turns out that the precise type of exercise you perform is not so important for over all cardiovascular health is not as important as consistency and time devoted. Definitely the exercise should be an aerobic form of exercise, meaning it should make you feel a little out of breath and sweating.

Isometric exercises like weight lifting do not have the same benefits for heart health and cholesterol levels. As both swimming and running are aerobic activities, both will be ok. Next, the amount of time you devote to exercise is important. It is recommended that you exercise at least 30-60 minute on most days of the week in order to achieve optimal results. In addition to exercise, don't forget that eating a balanced healthy diet is also an important part of controlling your cholesterol, as is avoiding smoking and moderating alcohol consumption. In some cases, cholesterol levels remain high despite diet and exercise; in these cases, you should talk to your primary care doctor, as they may recommend starting a medication to lower your cholesterol more.
