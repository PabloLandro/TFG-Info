The sweet truth on fruit vs commercial sugars
By Noelle Bosshard	• May 18, 2017 • Food, Nutrition News
It is no revelation that sugar has been identified as a negative influence on our health and well-being, but what should we think about fruit – after all, it contains sugar as well. Sugar is added to a lot of food and recently has been the focal point of many diets and healthy-minded individuals as it has gotten a bad rap for its role in diabetes and obesity. In 2011-12 it was reported that Australians consumed approximately 60g of free sugar (added sugar) a day which equated to 14 teaspoons. The World Health Organisation recommends that people consume no more than 10% of their daily energy intake as free sugars, which was alarming to note that ¾ of children and adolescents consumed more than this recommendation. One of the leading sources of this sugar (19%) was from beverages such as soft drinks, energy drinks and fruit juices. So if fruit juices are on the list, why are fruits considered healthy? Let’s explore this a little further.
Fruits provide a great array of various nutrients such as Vitamin C and A, phytochemicals, antioxidants and dietary fibre.[1]Slavin J, Lloyd B. Health Benefits of Fruits and Vegetables. Advances in Nutrition: An International Review Journal. 2012;3(4):506-516. Fruits commonly contain soluble fibre which has roles in reducing serum cholesterol to lower cardiovascular risk,[1]Slavin J, Lloyd B. Health Benefits of Fruits and Vegetables. Advances in Nutrition: An International Review Journal. 2012;3(4):506-516. of course, removing the skin of the fruit will whittle away its fibre content. Whilst they provide a hefty amount of health benefits, fruits are relatively low in energy so they are mindful of your waistline. Their fibre content also plays a role in keeping you satiated to decrease the chance of you reaching for seconds.
Fruit contains sugar which gives it that wonderful taste. However, confectionary items and many other sweetened treats are loaded with added sugar, and unlike fruits, do not contain a wealth of nutrients for the body except from high GI carbohydrates and refined sugar.[2]Mobley C, Marshall T, Milgrom P, Coldwell S. The Contribution of Dietary Factors to Dental Caries and Disparities in Caries. Academic Pediatrics. 2009;9(6):410-414. When these discretionary foods are prioritised over nutrient-dense foods, people become at risk for micronutrient deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiency is not only limited to cases where food deprivation or starvation occurs, but also used to describe the state in which specific nutrient requirements may be unmet due to poor nutritional choices.[2]Mobley C, Marshall T, Milgrom P, Coldwell S. The Contribution of Dietary Factors to Dental Caries and Disparities in Caries. Academic Pediatrics. 2009;9(6):410-414. This can be especially detrimental to growing children who are not getting enough nutrient-rich foods in their diets to assist their growth and development. Couple this with the excessive intake of sweetened-beverages, confectionary, and processed foods, and the child will exceed their required energy intake, and may begin to gain weight, placing them at risk for chronic health issues which may lead on into adulthood.[2]Mobley C, Marshall T, Milgrom P, Coldwell S. The Contribution of Dietary Factors to Dental Caries and Disparities in Caries. Academic Pediatrics. 2009;9(6):410-414.
Dietary Fibre
Allow me to bulk up your knowledge about fibre:
Dietary fibre is present in a variety of plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. It is the indigestible part of the plant which travels along our digestive track to bulk up our faeces and prevent against a variety of chronic diseases, namely bowel cancer, diabetes and can even help with weight control via increased satiety. There are a few types of dietary fibre; soluble fibre, insoluble fibre and resistant starch. Soluble fibre is made up of compounds which are found in plant cells, such as pectins, gums and mucliage. This type of fibre helps to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, keep blood sugar levels stable to prevent energy crashes and may also help with constipation. Foods such as fruits, vegetables, oats and legumes contain this type of fibre. Insoluble fibre is made up of the structural components of plant walls which keeps them standing strong, such as cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. This type helps to soften our faeces by absorbing water to help keep you regular. This fibre also contributes to increased feelings of fullness after a meal to stop you reaching for seconds to help keep your waist in check! Foods such as wholegrain breads, nuts, seeds and the skin of fruits and vegetables house this fibre. Finally, resistant starch is not often thought of as fibre, but has similar actions on our gut health. It is part of starchy food that is undigested in the small intestine, so it travels into the large intestine where it acts as fodder for good gut bacteria to improve the health of our bowel. This type can be found in under-ripe bananas and in rice and potatoes that have been cooked then cooled in the fridge. For men it is recommended that they consume 30 grams of fibre per day, and for women, 25 grams of fibre per day. For some good sources of fibre, look here.
Dietary fibre is also a protective agent for weight gain, as high fibre food items tend to have a lower energy density (think fruits and vegetables which are good sources), meaning you can essentially eat more of them and consume the same amount of energy as you would on a lower fibre diet (plus you reap the amazing health benefits of fibre). Foods high in fibre are also filling which will help to stop you from overeating. Soluble fibre slows the emptying of the stomach to keep the grumbles away, and also delays the absorption of sugars in the intestine to keep blood sugar levels stable so that you don’t experience energy spikes and subsequent crashes.
As stated above, good sources of fibre include fruits and vegetables, while highly processed items such as biscuits, chocolate and other sugary confectionary are very poor in fibre due to being processed and refined items. Fruits contain natural fibre due to their plant origin and unprocessed nature, while confectionery offer little but sugar and refined carbohydrates.
Fructose – Fruit’s sugar
Fructose is the sugar present in fruits, and in our diet we get some fructose from fruit, but most of the fructose in our diets is from sucrose (table sugar) and foods containing added sugar (free sugar) such as confectionary. Fructose is derived from sucrose because table sugar is made up of 50% fructose and 50% glucose. This means that products with added sugar like cakes, confectionary and sweetened drinks, are high in fructose. Fructose that is added to foods in this way leads to chronic disease risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. However, fructose also exists in fruit, so are fruits also a risk for poor health? Thankfully no. Reasons for this being that fructose that is obtained from sources with added sugar such as cakes and chocolate also have little nutritional value except for refined carbohydrates and a high energy density, so these factors also contribute to the risk of poor health. Also, most of the fructose in the American diet came from sucrose and high-fructose-corn-syrup,[3]Bray G. How bad is fructose?. American Journal of Clincal Nutrition. 2007;86(4):895-896. instead of fruit, and was present in larger amounts due to higher sugar consumption.
Fructose from fruits is metabolised differently in the body due to dietary fibre, as well as fruits having micronutrients and phytochemicals which help to promote good health.
Dental caries
What’s nicer than glowing white smile? Certainly not rotting teeth. Sugar, apart from having detrimental effects on the waistline and blood sugar, is also associated with dental caries with excessive intake.[2]Mobley C, Marshall T, Milgrom P, Coldwell S. The Contribution of Dietary Factors to Dental Caries and Disparities in Caries. Academic Pediatrics. 2009;9(6):410-414. An increased risk of damages to teeth were associated with regular consumption of free, simple sugars, such as those added to confectionary and biscuits. It was reported that sugars are able to be metabolised into acids by plaque bacteria, thus creating a low pH (acidic) environment.[4]Touger-Decker R, Van Loveren C. Sugars and dental caries. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2003;78(4):881s-892s. This favours demineralisation of the teeth. However, a diet lower in added sugar as well as calcium rich sources (such as cheese), favoured remineralisation of the teeth.[4]Touger-Decker R, Van Loveren C. Sugars and dental caries. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2003;78(4):881s-892s. Of course, oral hygiene plays a role in keeping teeth free of issues as well, and should not be neglected. It has been reccomended to consume a balanced diet that is rich in wholegrains, fruits and vegetables and to limit sweetened and acidic beverages and practice good oral hygiene to prevent the erosion of teeth.[4]Touger-Decker R, Van Loveren C. Sugars and dental caries. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2003;78(4):881s-892s.
Fruit juice
So fruits are great right? They’re loaded with vitamins and minerals, fibre and taste great! One fruit product you should avoid however, is fruit juices. While still made from the nutritional powerhouses, fruit juice is a concentrated version that loads up multiple fruits in one serving. A study was conducted which looked at fruit, vegetable and fruit juice intake and their association with type 2 diabetes risk,[5]Bazzano L, Li T, Joshipura K, Hu F. Intake of Fruit, Vegetables, and Fruit Juices and Risk of Diabetes in Women. Diabetes Care. 2008;31(7):1311-1317. and found that fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with an increased risk, while consumption of fruit juices represented a positive association with the condition. This conclusion had already taken into account the participant’s known risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as BMI, current activity levels, and other behavioural factors. This association was attributed to the lack of fibre in fruit juices which is removed when the fruit is converted into a liquid state,[5]Bazzano L, Li T, Joshipura K, Hu F. Intake of Fruit, Vegetables, and Fruit Juices and Risk of Diabetes in Women. Diabetes Care. 2008;31(7):1311-1317. and also the high concentration of sugar as multiple fruits are condensed into the juice to make up the liquid.
The sugars present in juices are also consumed in large amounts as the liquid is easy to drink and requires little oral processing, and thus the juice can be consumed at much faster rates than whole food.[6]Flood-Obbagy J, Rolls B. The effect of fruit in different forms on energy intake and satiety at a meal. Appetite. 2009;52(2):416-422. As liquid doesn’t require mechanical breakdown from the teeth like a whole fruit, the person is able to consume more as less time is taken up during consumption, whereas if the person were to eat multiple fruits, it would take much longer due to chewing and swallowing processes.
Consuming fruit in the form of juice also does not present the same effect on satiety as whole fruit. Whole apples have intact cellular walls which enables the apple to be larger in volume than apple juice where those cellular walls are broken in the juicing process.[6]Flood-Obbagy J, Rolls B. The effect of fruit in different forms on energy intake and satiety at a meal. Appetite. 2009;52(2):416-422. This volume difference, as well as the removal of the fruit’s fibre in juice form, contributes to a lesser feeling of satiation, and thus will leave you ready to consume more.
This was further investigated by observing the effects of eating different forms of fruit before a meal on satiety and energy intake, and it was found that consuming either a whole apple, applesauce or apple juice with fibre, had different effects on energy intake and fullness, with the whole apple rated the highest for satiety.[6]Flood-Obbagy J, Rolls B. The effect of fruit in different forms on energy intake and satiety at a meal. Appetite. 2009;52(2):416-422. All three foods had similar fibre content, which suggests that the physical form of the food was more important than its fibre content.
Recommendations
Overall, fruit is the healthier choice when comparing it to sugary goods. Yes, fruit does contain sugar, however it also houses a wealth of antioxidants, nutrients and fibre which are great for our bodies, while typical refined sugary goods offer little but a great taste and empty energy. The key here is not to go crazy, and while you can enjoy that chocolate bar every once in a while, moderation is key with everything we consume. Focus on filling your diet with nutrient rich foods that nourish the body, and leave the processed sugary goods for treats.
