Arthritis? TRY WD 40
HOUSANDS of people around the world swear WD-40 has cured their arthritis.
Anecdotal evidence suggests there is a global craze for spraying the household lubricant on stiff knees, hips and wrists — even though it’s usually meant for jammed locks and rusty hinges.
Arthritis expert Professor Robert Moots, from Liverpool University, said a lubricant similar to WD-40 is already used to treat stiff joints.
He says: “It’s called viscose supplementation and it’s injected into the joints.
“But by spraying the outside of the knee with WD-40 I doubt if any would actually get into the joint. I’ve no doubt people who use it do feel better but it’s probably only a simple placebo effect.”
Yet thousands of people around the world swear WD-40 has cured their arthritis.
One US fan said on a website: “My father-in-law swears by it.
“He is a retired air force mechanic and when his knuckles and knees get grouchy he squirts them with WD-40. He says it works every time.”

BIGFOOT FOUND in Johore
Gout is a result of too much uric acid in your blood. Uric acid buildup usually is a sign that your kidneys aren't cleaning our your blood as well they should. Over time, this excess uric acid forms crystals between your joint spaces causing excruciating pain.
There are many foods that promote uric acid buildup and should be avoided. The most common are: alcohol, anchovies, peas, poultry, dark greens vegetables, dried fruits, fish, mushrooms, herring, meat gravies, broth, bouillon, mussels, sardines, red meats, processed meats, fried foods, caffeine, beans, lentils, eggs, oatmeal, and low doses of aspirin.

FALCO - Rock Me Amadeus...Remember Him?
Johann (Hans) Hölzel (February 19, 1957 – February 6, 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian classical music prodigy turned hip hop, pop and rock star. His albums and singles have sold about 60 million copies worldwide.
Falco recorded "Rock Me Amadeus" inspired in part by the Oscar-winning film Amadeus, and the song became a worldwide hit in 1986. This time, his record reached #1 in the U.S., bringing him the success that had eluded him in that major market a few years earlier. The song remained in the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks
Falco died of severe injuries received following his collision with a bus in his Mitsubishi Pajero near the resort of Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic on February 6, 1998, just two weeks shy of his 41st birthday. At the time of his death, he was working on a comeback into the music world.He was buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) in Vienna, Austria.
