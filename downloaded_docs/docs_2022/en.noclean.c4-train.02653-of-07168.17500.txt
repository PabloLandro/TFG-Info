The Ultra Heart-Healthy Oil You Haven‚Äôt Heard About
The Ultra Heart-Healthy Oil You Haven‚Äôt Heard About
In All Health Watch, Anti-Aging, Diet and Nutrition, Featured Article, Heart and Cardiovascular by INH Research May 8, 2018 2 Comments
We all know that olive oil and fish oil are good for heart health. And you can also add coconut oil to the list.
But a new study has found that another oil may do more to prevent heart disease than any of these.
And, chances are, you haven‚Äôt heard of it.
Camelina oil comes from the seeds of the cold-climate plant camelina sativa. It‚Äôs also known as false flax and gold-of-pleasure. It‚Äôs native to Europe and Central Asia. But it‚Äôs cultivated around the world.1
Many studies have shown that eating fatty fish can prevent heart disease. Fish oil is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids. They increase HDL (good) cholesterol levels and prevent plaque buildup in the arteries.2
Researchers from the University of Eastern Finland recently conducted a test of camelina oil and fish.
Scientists gathered 79 adults. They were healthy except they were prediabetic. This condition is linked with high LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. The ages of the subjects ranged from 40 to 72.3
Better for Your Heart Than Fish
The participants were randomly divided in four groups. Each group followed one of these diets for 12 weeks:
Ate lean fish such as cod or bass four times per week.
Ate fatty salmon or mackerel four times per week.
Took a daily 30-ml dose of camelina oil.
Ate their normal diet (control group).
Afterward, the lean fish group and the control group showed no improvement in their cholesterol profile.
The fatty fish group improved their HDL cholesterol composition. Both the size of their good cholesterol particles and the amount increased, which is good for heart health.
But the group that took camelina oil daily had a greater benefit. They improved their HDL profile like the fatty fish group. But they also decreased their levels of a lipoprotein called IDL. It‚Äôs associated with heart disease.
The study was published recently in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research.
4 Camelina Oil Health Benefits
Camelina is extremely rich in alpha-linolenic acid. This is an essential omega-3 fatty acid. Researchers believe this is the key ingredient that makes it so good for heart health. But it also has other health-boosting properties:
Antioxidant. Camelina oil is a strong antioxidant due to its high vitamin E content.
Anti-Inflammatory. It strongly inhibits inflammation both topically and when ingested.
Anti-Arthritic. Because of its high omega-3 content, it can alleviate arthritis pain. Patients apply the oil topically on the affected joints or ingest the oil.
Slows Brain Aging. There is some evidence that camelina oil may protect against dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Its high omega-3 content tamps down brain inflammation that can lead to cognitive decline.
Each tablespoon of the oil provides four grams of omega-3s. For comparison, one tablespoon of flaxseed oil contains less than one gram (0.8) of omega-3s. Olive oil has only 0.1 gram. Fish oil has about 1.4 grams, although it can vary by brand.4 5 6
Camelina oil also contains a rare and powerful fatty acid called gondoic. It has been shown to improve a person‚Äôs overall lipid profile to reduce heart risk.7
Camelina oil has no known side effects or drug interactions.
How to Add Camelina Oil to Your Diet
Camelina oil has a slightly nutty flavor. It can be used in salad dressings or as a cooking oil. Its extremely high smoking point of 475 degrees makes it a good choice for frying or saut√©ing.8
You can also take camelina oil as a daily supplement. The Finnish researchers used 30 ml, which is just over two tablespoons. Unlike fish oil, it does not have a disagreeable flavor.
You can buy camelina oil online and at some health food stores. But be sure to get a cold-pressed brand, not one that‚Äôs heat-extracted. This should be noted on the label. Cold pressing allows the oil to retain most of its nutrients.
One advantage of camelina oil is that it doesn‚Äôt spoil as quickly as other healthy oils. The shelf life is 24 months from the date of processing. It should be stored at room temperature and away from heat and direct sunlight.9
Editor‚Äôs Note: Discover the real cause‚Äîit‚Äôs not plaque itself‚Äîof heart attacks‚Ä¶ A doctor-recommended exercise that could be killing your heart‚Ä¶ The natural supplement that puts statins to shame‚Ä¶ And an antioxidant shown to reduce heart disease rates by 40%.
