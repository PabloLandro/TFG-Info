Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is one of the greatest inventions of humankind. It enables imaging the internal organs without using any harmful radiation. It uses the radio waves in the magnetic field generated with a powerful magnet. There are 3 MRI devices in the Department of Radiology. All 3 of the MRI devices are 1,5 tesla in power.
Considerations before MRI scan
You should read all of the explanations given below so that you can have a comfortable MRI scan and also maximum advantage of the scan is yielded for your health. Please take time to read through the subjects mentioned here.
Considerations before MRI
You do not need to fast or use special medication before MRI. However, the patient is prescribed a MRI Contrast Agent for certain MRI scans. YOU SHOULD BRING ALONG THE MRI CONTRAST AGENT if you were prescribed as well. The medication is administered through an intravenous line to the patient during MRI scan. If you are allergic to any medication or substance, please inform your physician before the agent is administered. However, you should remember that MRI contrast agents are perfectly safe.
You should definitely bring along your previous MRI films and, if any, other films related to the area to be scanned (x-ray or tomography films; ultrasonography or scintigraphy reports) to the MRI scan. These films and reports facilitate planning your test and give the opportunity of comparison with the new test. WE WILL RETURN THE FILMS AND REPORTS BACK TO YOU together with your test result.
You should submit your MRI request form duly treated to the official by computer in the MRI unit the day of your MRI scan. Then, please move to the waiting room. You will be called by the authorized person when your turn comes. Lunch breaks are not taken for MRI scans.
Considerations before entering MRI room
ANYONE WITH A CARDIAC PACEMAKER (including not just only patients but also patient relatives, medical staff and any other persons) CANNOT ENTER INTO MRI ROOM. ALSO, ANYONE WITH A NEUROSTIMULATOR (electrical mechanism to stimulate nerves), electric INFUSION PUMP or COIL incompatible with MR placed in their body CANNOT ENTER INTO MRI ROOM EITHER.
You should inform the health care team that will conduct the scan in the below-mentioned circumstances;
•	You might not be able to have the scan if you underwent an aneurism surgery in the past. Furthermore, please inform your physician if you had a valvular replacement or coronary by-pass surgery.
•	Please inform your physician if a hearing aid (cochlear implant) was inserted into your ear.
•	Please make sure that you definitely inform your physician if you have pellet, bullet, needle, piece of metal or shrapnel in your body. It might be dangerous to perform the scan.
•	If you have metals in your body such as hip or knee prosthesis, knee augmentation wedge or plate, there is a possibility that the test cannot be performed on the area with such metal placements. SO, please inform your physician.
•	If you are working in an environment with metal dust, the metal dust or burr accumulated on the surface of your body (particularly on your eyes) can pose an obstruct before the test. Inform your physician in this case as well.
You should have taken off and left behind listed below before entering into MRI room
Credit cards, bank cards, ANKARAY or METRO (subway) tickets, mobile telephones, watch, large pieces of metal on you (removable denture, belt with metal buckle, coins, keys, gun, pocket-knife, etc. Please remove your hairclip and earrings as well. You do not have to remove your ring unless your hand will be scanned. We recommend you untie your necktie as you will have to lay down for a while in the MRI room.
As certain cosmetic materials used around the eyes can cause disruption of the images, any make up should be removed before a scan including head.
If you are or might be pregnant or you are breastfeeding
MRI does not have any known harmful effects on the human body. Nonetheless, EXPECTANT MOTHERS CANNOT RECEIVE MRI SCAN IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER as a precaution for the development of baby. MRI scan is allowed after the 3rd month. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, please inform the medical team to perform the test in this regard.
In MRI room...
Except for very extraordinary situations, your MRI scan lasts for about 15-30 minutes. In other words, you will be asked to lay perfectly still in a magnetic mechanism shaped similarly to a tunnel during the MRI scan which is completely harmless. Please feel relaxed as you will be observed from the outside with a glass window and camera systems. So, your test can immediately be stopped and you can be taken out when necessary. One more person can accompany the patient in the MRI room on the condition that the precautions mentioned are taken. The patient relative should remain on a fixed spot and should not walk around in the MRI room. It s very important that you do not move particularly the scanned body area during the test. A movement can disrupt the imaging, which can lead to delaying or cancelling your test. You can breathe comfortably during the test (you can exceptionally be asked to hold your breath). Unless otherwise stated, you can blink your eyes or keep them shut continuously. You can gulp during the test. You will hear patterns of strong knocking and banging sounds. In certain circumstances, MRG contrast agent might need to be administered through an intravascular line. If you set these aside, MRI scan is actually a comfortable examination which offers you an opportunity to lay down for 15-30 minutes in the middle of the day!
How is the daily schedule of MRI appointments organized?
Patients are admitted to MRI scan according to the appointment queue. Still, small children are prioritized for MRI scans. As staying perfectly still is of great importance and very difficult to ensure in respect to children younger than 6 years old, small children should be get to sleep (with or without medication) to enter the test. Children who wake up and move during the scan should be taken out from the room in order to wait until they fall asleep again. Therefore, PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO SLEEPING CHILDREN. Furthermore, INPATIENTS IN DIFFICULT SITUATION ARE PRIORITIZED AS WELL.
When will you receive your MRI result?
You can receive your MRI result from Radiology Information Desk Secretariat n the afternoon or 2nd working day following the test (as of 16:00). In this case, MRI results are given in the afternoon on Wednesday for Monday, on Thursday for Tuesday, on Friday for Wednesday, on next Monday for Thursday and on next Tuesday for Friday tests.
