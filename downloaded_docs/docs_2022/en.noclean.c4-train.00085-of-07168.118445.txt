About Our Chargers
Vaping is quickly becoming a popular alternative to traditional cigarettes, and, with good reason. Vape pens do not produce ash or smoke, nor do they require harmful ingredients such as tar. Better yet, vape pens are customizable, giving you the ability to choose the flavor and content of your vape liquid as well as the accessories for your vaporizer.
Accessories
The accessories for your vaporizer or e-cigarette are a chance to make it uniquely yours. For many people, vaping is as much a lifestyle as anything else. So, you can select a vape charger, mouthpiece, tank and more that matches your persona.
Accessories are about more than looks, however. They add convenience, safety, and comfort to your vape experience. For example, a mouthpiece can adjust the airflow and taste. Similarly, lanyards and cases can make storing, protecting and carrying your vape easier.
Most vape and e-cigarette starter kits come with the basics to get you going. However, you may quickly want some more advanced and/or personalized accessories. With a few customizations, you can get the smoking experience that is right for you.
Vape Pen Chargers
One of the significant aspects of vape pens and e-cigarettes is their portability. You can carry one with you almost anywhere, enjoying it for hours. Of course, having a charged battery is necessary to enjoy your vape, so having a charger at hand for whenever you need it is a good idea.
Whether you need to charge a removable battery or your vapes built-in one, South Beach Smoke has you covered. If you need a vape battery charger on the go, grab a car adapter so you can always enjoy your vape or e-cigarette in the car. If your vape pen charger uses a USB, you can easily plug it in alongside your digital devices. It is also always a good idea to have an extra wall adapter around to keep your vape pen fully juiced.
Vaporizers that use removal batteries can be very convenient. If you have a few spare batteries, all you need to do is swap them out when one is drained. However, improper storage of rechargeable can be unsafe. A carrying case is an excellent solution for always having a battery on hand without risking damaging it.
Find the Best Smoking Accessories
Check out South Beach Smoke's collection of vaporizer and e-cigarette accessories. Whether you need a charger, a carrying case or any other accessory, we've got what you need. If you are just getting started, consider one of our starter kits which come with the essentials you need to enjoy vaping.
