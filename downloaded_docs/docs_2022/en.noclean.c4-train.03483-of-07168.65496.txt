Is breastfeeding stopping me getting pregnant again?
If you are very keen to become pregnant and you are not having periods at the moment, the best thing to do would be to reduce your breastfeeding...
08/08/2014
Question
I was wondering how breastfeeding affects ovulation.
I breastfeed my son usually only once or twice a day now (he is 20-months-old).
If I am at home all day with him this may increase to four or five times.
I have been trying to get pregnant for about five months now.
Could the breastfeeding be suppressing ovulation or is it just by chance?
I got pregnant with my son the first month of trying.
Answer
It is not clear from your letter whether or not you are having periods at the moment.
Breastfeeding does affect your hormones and prolactin (the main hormone involved in milk production) does inhibit ovulation.
Every woman is different in this respect, so that some women find their periods return as soon as they cut down their breastfeeding, eg when baby gets interested in solids, and some women find their periods do not return until they stop feeding altogether.
If you are very keen to become pregnant and you are not having periods at the moment, the best thing to do would be to reduce your breastfeeding further or to stop.
Once your periods return this implies that you are ovulating and likely to conceive again.
If you are having regular periods then this would suggest that you are ovulating and could get pregnant at any time.
Even if you are ovulating regularly, becoming pregnant in the first month of trying (as you did with your first child) is unusual and it is far more usual to wait for up to six months before you conceive.
Try to relax and enjoy the time before you become pregnant again. Having conceived easily the first time it is unlikely that you will have difficulties conceiving in the future.
Yours sincerely
