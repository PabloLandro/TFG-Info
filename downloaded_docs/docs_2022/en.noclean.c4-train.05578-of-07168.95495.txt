Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
Background
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which is needed by the body to form collagen in bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.
Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.
Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.
The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.
Scientific Evidence
Uses
Grade*
Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)
Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet. Although scurvy is uncommon, it may occur in malnourished individuals, those that need more vitamin C (such as pregnant or breastfeeding women), or infants. If vitamin C is unavailable, orange juice can be used for scurvy in infants. Symptoms should begin to improve in 1-2 days, and end completely within seven days. Treatment should be under strict medical supervision.
A
Common cold prevention (extreme environments)
Vitamin C reduced the risk of developing colds, by roughly 50% in people under physical stress or in extreme conditions, such as soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners. This area merits more research and may be of particular interest to elite athletes or military personnel.

The upper limit of intake (UL) should avoid exceeding 2,000 milligrams daily in men or women more than 18 years old (including pregnant or breastfeeding women).
Vitamin C administered by mouth or injection is effective for curing scurvy. 100-250 milligrams of vitamin C was given by mouth four times daily for one week. Some experts have recommended 1-2 grams daily for two days, followed by 500 milligrams daily for one week. Symptoms should begin to improve within 24-48 hours, and be completely cured within seven days. Treatment should be under strict medical supervision. For asymptomatic vitamin C deficiency, lower daily doses may be used.
For antioxidant effects, 200-1,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been given daily for four weeks to a year; 300-3,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been injected into the vein, from a single dose to a duration of eight weeks.
For breast cancer prevention, 500 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily.
For cancer prevention, 120-2,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for six to eight years.
For preventing the common cold in people in extreme environments, 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for up to 14 days.
For preventing the common cold in general, 30-3,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for two weeks to eight winters.
For treating the common cold, 200 milligrams to 3 grams have been taken by mouth daily for three to five days or longer.
For preventing complex regional pain syndrome in people with wrist fractures, 500 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for 50 days.
For fertility, 750 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for six months.
For heart conditions, 2 grams of vitamin C has been given by mouth before surgery, followed by 1 gram daily for five days.
For H. pylori infection, 400-1,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been given by mouth daily for up to seven weeks.
For high blood pressure, 60-4,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been given by mouth daily for 6-16 weeks.
For kidney disease, 3 grams of vitamin C was given by mouth before the kidney-toxic procedure, then 2 grams after the procedure in the evening and again the following morning; 100-200 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily.
For liver disease, 120-3,000 of milligrams vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for one day to six months; effectiveness on liver disease was lacking.
For life extension, 60-2,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for one month to 9.5 years.
For preventing nitrate tolerance, 3-6 grams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily.
For pregnancy, 100-1,000 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth up to four times daily during pregnancy until delivery.
For prostate cancer, 500 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily for an average of eight years.
For anemia, 200-300 milligrams of vitamin C has been injected into the vein three times weekly, for 3-6 months.
For preventing gout, 500-1,500 milligrams of vitamin C from food and/or supplements has been taken daily.
For skin aging, preparations containing 5-10% vitamin C were applied on the skin daily.
Children (under 18 years old)
The recommended daily intake by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine for infants 0-12 months old is the amount of vitamin C in human milk; for children 1-3 years old, it is 15 milligrams; for children 4-8 years old, it is 25 milligrams; for children 9-13 years old, it is 45 milligrams; and for adolescents 14-18 years old, it is 75 milligrams for boys and 65 milligrams for girls. The tolerable upper intake levels (UL) for vitamin C are 400 milligrams daily for children 1-3 years old; 650 milligrams daily for children 4-8 years old; 1,200 milligrams daily for children 9-13 years old; and 1,800 milligrams daily for adolescents and pregnant and lactating females 14-18 years old.
For metabolic abnormalities, 100 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth.
For scurvy or vitamin C deficiency in children, 100-300 milligrams of vitamin C has been taken by mouth daily in divided doses for two weeks. Older or larger children may require doses closer to adult recommendations. If vitamin C is unavailable, orange juice may be used. Symptoms should begin to improve within 24-48 hours, with resolution within seven days. Treatment should be under strict medical supervision.
