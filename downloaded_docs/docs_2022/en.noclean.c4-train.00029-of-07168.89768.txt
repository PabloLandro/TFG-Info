Very healthy and numerous health benefits. A few harmful qualities may be associated, but only under certain circumstances such as an allergic reaction.
A-
Very healthy and numerous health benefits. Harmful qualities may be associated, but aren't usually serious.
It is important to note that even the best things in life can become bad in immoderate amounts. So, although something may be rated an 'A+', overconsumption/overdoing can bring unwanted effects.
Category 'B'
B+
Very beneficial to your health. Things rated a 'B+' may have a few harmful qualities to pay attention to.
B
Overall beneficial to your health. Things rated a 'B' may have some harmful qualities to pay attention to.
B-
More beneficial to your health than not. However, harmful qualities are most likely associated and shouldn't be overlooked.
The main difference between category 'A' and category 'B' is the harmful qualities typically present in 'B' items. Serious side effects are usually uncommon, but are still possible and should be taken note of.
Category 'C'
C+
Both beneficial and harmful qualities associated. Things rated a 'C+' are typically a bit more on the beneficial side. Still, moderation is important.
C
A fairly even ratio of beneficial and harmful qualities. Moderation is important. Very general topics that can lean towards both sides of the spectrum will be placed here as well. Rice, for example, can be good or bad depending on the type.
C-
More harmful than beneficial. Side effects are common, especially when consumed/done excessively. Moderation is very important.
Category 'C' usually denotes to both good and bad qualities. When it comes to this category, it is important to keep this word in mind: moderation.
Category 'D'
D+
Harmful to your health. Although benefits may be associated, the bad most likely outweighs the good. Moderation is very important.
D
Harmful to your health. A few benefits may be associated, but the bad outweighs the good. Moderation is extremely important.
D-
Harmful to your health. Very few, if any, benefits are present. Things in this category should be avoided as much as possible.
Category 'D' is typically for things that are more harmful than beneficial. While consuming/doing something unhealthy once in a blue moon shouldn't hurt, we definitely recommend eliminating 'D' items as a regular part of your routine/diet.
Category 'F'
F
Category 'F' is for things that fail to bring anything beneficial to the table, and are very harmful to your health. We recommend completely avoiding anything in this category. Long-term side effects of 'F' items are usually very serious.
Category 'N'
N
'N' stands for neutral. Things placed into this category are generally (a) neither good nor bad for you, or (b) lack the necessary evidence to reach any conclusions.

Long answer
Ginger has long been used to help curb nausea. According to the University of Maryland, some studies have shown that it works better than a placebo in alleviating motion sickness - it reduced cold sweats and vomiting, although it may not reduce nausea. The evidence is mixed; studies that used conventional motion sickness medication like scopolamine as a placebo showed ginger to be less effective in reducing symptoms. Scopolamine, however, has some side effects that ginger does not, including drowsiness and dry mouth.
Pregnant women may want to take ginger to deal with the effects of morning sickness. So far, research has not shown that ginger will do harm to your fetus. It does have anticoagulant properties, however; you should avoid taking ginger to deal with nausea if you have an upcoming due date - it could cause you to bleed uncontrollably. Pregnant women should also check with their medical provider before using ginger to control nausea during pregnancy, as there is still some controversy over whether it's entirely safe.
As mentioned above, ginger is an anticoagulant. You should not mix it with other medications that have anticoagulant properties - either prescription strength drugs or over-the-counter painkillers like aspirin. Hemophiliacs should similarly be careful with ginger. So should anyone taking medication to deal with different conditions affecting the circulatory system, like hypertension or high blood pressure.
Ginger can lower your blood sugar. If you're diabetic or have metabolic syndrome, be careful - large doses of ginger may induce hypoglycemia. Ginger can increase bile production, too. If you suffer from gallstones, you may want to be careful with dosing.
If you're not pregnant, diabetic, afflicted with gallstones, or dealing with high blood pressure, are you in the clear to eat as much ginger as your heart desires? The University of Maryland reports that ginger superdoses might induce heartburn, mild stomach upset, or diarrhea. Be careful with ginger and exercise moderation, as you should with most things.
