Treatment
For each treatment, the effectiveness is rated on a scale of 0 to 10. The effectiveness rating is a combination of the claimed power of the treatment with the amount of evidence for that claim. The availability is rated on a scale of 0 to 5. The easier the treatment is to obtain, the higher the availability rating, the more expensive the treatment, the lower the availability rating. If the treatment is a common food the availability rating will be 5, if the treatment can only be obtained by mail order, the rating will be lower, if the treatment is only available by prescription the rating lower still. The safety is rated on a scale of 0 to 5. If the treatment is a common safe food the safety rating will be 5, if the treatment has mild adverse effects the rating will be lower, if the treatment requires injections or monitoring in a clinic to prevent the possibility of severe adverse effects the rating will be lower still.
The scores are totaled, and the treatments are ranked in descending order of the total score, then alphabetically.
This page is in progress and more treatments in the “others” category will be expanded.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D treats cancer. The vitamin D dose should be at least 4,000 IU/day (100 mcg/day). To get more protection, the dose can be increased to 8,000 IU/day, this is comfortably under the 10,000 IU/day that is the lower limit of risk, and the benefits are enormous. One IU of vitamin D is 0.025 mcg, alternately 1 mcg of vitamin D is 40 IU.
Vitamin D3 is naturally produced by the body, vitamin D2 is not. Only take vitamin D3, vitamin D2 is an inferior analogue whose potency is less than one third that of vitamin D3. Vitamin D2, ergocalciferol, is produced when ergosterol in a yeast extract is converted by ultraviolet light, it is never produced by the human body. Vitamin D3 is produced when 7-dehydro-cholesterol, a precursor molecule of cholesterol present in the skin, is converted by ultraviolet light. Vitamin D3 products include Bio Tech Pharmacal D3-50 - 50,000 IU, and Life Extension - Vitamin D3 - 5,000 IU.
The evidence that Vitamin D prevents cancer is overwhelming. Any health organization that does not recommend taking at least 2,000 IU/day of Vitamin D to prevent cancer is incompetent or corrupt.

Flax Seed Oil and Cottage Cheese
Flax seed oil and cottage cheese, the Budwig diet, treats cancer. Johanna Budwig determined that organic cold pressed flax seed oil was the most suitable fat to combine with an easy to eat protein-sulfur of quark/cottage cheese for the elusive respiratory enzyme to oxygenate cancer cells. These two disparate foods are able to combine and create the oxygen within cancer cells for restoring normalcy.
Only use flax seed oil from the refrigerated section of the health food store, and check the expiration date to make sure it has not expired. Never use capsules, flakes or flax seed oil from the room temperature shelves. The mixing ratio is two tablespoons of cottage cheese to one tablespoon of oil. Mix only the amount you are consuming at one time, and eat it immediately after. One example would be to mix 4 tablespoons of cottage cheese to 2 tablespoons of flax seed oil, consumed twice daily or more depending on the severity of the illness. One should probably start slowly with the oil, maybe just once a day and work their way up letting the body adjust to the protocol. The oil and the cottage cheese must be thoroughly mixed at a low speed, using an immersion blender, blending until a creamy texture with no standing oil is achieved.
Flax seed on its own also prevents cancer, but is not as potent as the flax seed and cottage cheese combination. According to the Dietary Fiber and Breast Cancer Risk study, high fiber foods in general prevent cancer, an extra 10 grams of fiber reduces the cancer risk by 5 percent.

Iodine
Iodine lowers the risk of cancer, especially breast, thyroid, stomach and gastric cancer. The typical Japanese consumption, which has a high intake of iodine from seaweed, is 2 mg/day. The supplementation should ideally be from food.
For women with painful breasts accompanying fibrocystic disease, taking 6 mg/day of iodine for six months improved symptoms in more than half of the women, and taking brown sea alga alleviated pain and nodularity in 94% of the women. Iodine deficiency increases the chance of stomach cancer, stomach cancer patients in a landlocked area of Iran were 2.5 times as likely to have severe iodine deficiency than control patients. Gastric cancer is the most common cancer in parts of northeastern Turkey where iodine deficiency is common. Also, a tincture of iodine painted on suspicious skin lesions can reduce the risk of skin cancer. When the lesions are painted every day for one to two months, eventually a scab forms which when it comes off leaves new good skin underneath.
Iodine also kills microorganisms and parasites, calms the body, increases energy, increases focus and concentration, helps to produce stomach acid, and increases the ability to sweat. Iodine also helps the body excrete toxic elements like mercury, lead, cadmium, aluminum, fluorine, and bromine, and toxic compounds like perchlorates. Iodine deficiency symptoms include hypothyroidism, brain fog, hormonal imbalances, hoarseness, poor short term memory, immune system dysfunction, acid reflux, chronic constipation, cold intolerance, excess phlegm, hypertension, heart arrythmias, fatigue, chronic headaches, weight gain, fibrocystic breasts, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), infertility, menstrual cramps, vaginal infections, and dry skin, mouth and eyes.
Seaweed is the food richest in iodine. Kelp are large seaweeds belonging to the brown algae (class Phaeophyceae). The concentration of iodine in kelp varies widely, Undaria kelp has 0.049 mg/g, and Green Bay kelp has 2.2 mg/g, and some kelp flakes have as much as 8 mg/g. Japanese kombu (Laminaria) has 2.4 mg/g, wakame (Undaria) has 0.042 mg/g, and nori has 0.016 mg/g. When kombu is boiled in water for 15 minutes it can lose up to 99% of its iodine content, while boiled sargassum loses around 40%. The seaweed consumption in Japan is about 5 grams per day. Because the concentration of iodine varies in seaweeds, it is best to eat a few different varities of seaweed to get enough iodine without overdosing. Supplements include Lugol's Solution, Potassium Iodide (SSKI), Povidone Iodine (PVP-I), and Iodoral. Iodine tinctures include CVS Pharmacy - Iodine Tincture Usp - 30 mL, and Lloyds Pharmacy - Care Iodine Tincture - 25 mL.
High iodine intake can cause health problems in people with pre-existing thyroid disorders. Transient hypothyroidism and iodine induced goiter is common in Japan and can be reversed in most cases by restricting iodine intake. For some conditions, and for some patients who do not respond to the typical Japanese consumption, doses of 50 to 100 mg of iodine per day are used; however, such large doses should only be used with careful supervision to ensure that the patient does not develop thyroid problems.

Magnesium
Magnesium reduces the risk of cancer, especially colon cancer. The typical supplementation dose is 8 mg/kg/day, which works out to 560 mg/day for a 70 kg person. The total treatment dose is 13 mg/kg/day, and the typical US diet provides 5 mg/kg/day, giving the typical supplementation dose of 8 mg/kg/day. The supplementation should ideally be from food.
Researchers from the National Cancer Center in Tokyo found taking an extra 327 mg/day of magnesium reduced a man’s risk of colon cancer by about 52%. Regions with high levels of magnesium in have lower rates of cancer, for example the cancer rate in Egypt is about 10% that of Europe and America because the soil and water is rich in magnesium, leading to a consumption of about 2.7 g/day. Both carcinogenesis and magnesium deficiency increase the plasma membrane permeability and fluidity. Magnesium deficiency is associated with dramatic increases in free radical generation as well as glutathione depletion. Without the cleaning and chelating work of glutathione, cells begin to accumulate cellular garbage and heavy metals, leading to cancer. Many enzyme systems also require magnesium, particularly those involved in energy production and DNA repair.
Magnesium rich foods include seeds (pumpkin, squash, watermelon, flax, sesame, and sunflower), bran (rice, wheat, and oat), and nuts (brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, and pine nuts). Magnesium supplements include Life Extension - Magnesium - 500 mg and PureBulk.com - Magnesium Gluconate.
Getting magnesium from food is reasonably safe. However, very large doses of magnesium from supplements may cause adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhea, appetite loss, muscle weakness, abdominal cramps, and extremely low blood pressure. Individuals with kidney failure lose the ability to remove excess magnesium from the blood, and should carefully monitor magnesium supplementation due to the risk of magnesium toxicity. Overall, it is best to get the required magnesium from food. If the patient is not getting enough magnesium from food, then magnesium from supplements can be added to reach the treatment dose of 13 mg/kg/day.

Vitamin C
Vitamin C at a high blood concentration treats cancer quickly. The best way of achieving a high blood concentration of vitamin C is with a liposomal form of vitamin C, which is more bioavailable than regular vitamin C, like Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C, from Livon Laboratories. With the liposomal form of vitamin C, 3 to 6 packets (each with 1,000 mg of vitamin C) a day, divided into three doses a day, will achieve a high blood concentration of vitamin C. A high blood concentration can also be achieved with intravenous vitamin C, but that can only be done in a clinic and there are many potential intravenous therapy adverse effects.
For best results when taking liposomal vitamin C, mix it with a beverage, drink on an empty stomach, and wait at least 15 minutes before eating. When taking liposomal vitamin C, the consumption of carbohydrates (especially refined sugar) must be limited, because carbohydrates impair oral absorption of this vitamin. It may be possible to make liposomal vitamin C at home with an ultrasonic cleaner; however, the amount that ends up encapsulated is unknown and the blood concentration achieved is also unknown.
A high blood concentration can also be achieved with many (usually six or more) large doses (two grams each or more) of vitamin C per day, however, it is inconvenient to take many doses and there is a large chance of adverse effects like diarrhea. A good form of oral vitamin C is sodium ascorbate. Vitamin C should not be taken with blood thinners, such as aspirin, coumadin or warfarin. Low doses of vitamin C have little or no effect.

Aloe Vera
Aloe vera arborescens treats cancer. From the “Cancer can be Cured” book, according to Dr. Aldo Facetti, aloe vera or barbadensis provides 40% of the active ingredients against cancer, while the arborescens variety provides 70%.
A recipe for a “processing unit” worth of the aleo vera arborescens cure follows.
Ingredients
300 grams of aloe vera arborescens (fresh pulp of the leaf, 3 years or older, preferably 5 years old)
500 grams of bee honey (if at all possible, raw unheated organic honey)
4 - 5 tablespoons of rum or whisky (cañazo, aguardiente)
Preparation
Wash the Aloe vera leaf (or leaves) and remove the thorns. Cut into pieces.
Put the Aloe vera pieces, the honey and rum or whisky in a blender or extractor.
Whisk for 2 to 3 minutes.
The end product will be a greenish syrup. The amount of syrup obtained by the above quantities of the three elements constitutes a “processing unit”. The syrup must be refrigerated. Before drinking the syrup, the bottle must be shaken to thoroughly mix the components. Take one full tablespoon of this syrup three times a day: mornings, noon and night, 1/2 hour before meals. The above preparation can last about ten days. Don't stop taking the “processing unit” until it is totally used up (even if you get what seem to be signs of improvement). When taking several “processing units” in a row, it is necessary to keep an interval of ten days between each unit because aloe vera is somewhat toxic.
Aloe vera juice can be bought, however, companies can claim 100% Aloe Vera juice if they add only one tablespoon of 100% Aloe Vera juice to a gallon of water. Additionally, companies can claim their product to be cold processed if they use HTST (High Temperature Short Time) processing. Juices with properly processed aloe vera include Global Healing Center - Aloe Vera Juice: 100% Organic - Cold Processed, and GoodCauseWellness.com - Aloe Vera100 Drink Mix. The typical dose is 200 ml/day.
Aloe vera can also be injected in the body to cure cancer. The injections work, but there is no need to inject aloe vera because it is also effective when taken orally.
Aloe vera may lower blood sugar, so those with diabetes should be cautious when taking it orally. Aloe vera can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and electrolyte imbalances.

Broccoli
Broccoli treats cancer. In a study published earlier in the Society of Experimental Biology and Medicine, researchers at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University found that the compound sulforaphane, which is found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, bok choy and Brussels sprouts, has strong anti-cancer properties, particularly when it comes to prostate and colon cancers. Even more promising results have been found with broccoli sprouts, which have more than 50 times the amount of sulforaphane than found in mature broccoli.

Chelation
Chelation treats cancer to a small degree, and since its effects are permanent it is perfect for prevention. The word chelate means pincer like claw. In medicine this word indicates the action of chemically grabbing metals and removing them. Chelation can be done orally or intravenously. Intravenous chelation is faster, but it can only be done in a clinic and there are many potential intravenous therapy adverse effects, therefore it should only be done in cases of acute metal poisoning. For all other illnesses, chelation should be done orally.
Because chelating chemicals remove all metals, including essential metals, safe chelation requires that the essential metals be replenished throughout the therapy. A good chelating system will provide the patient essential metals in the morning, and chelating chemicals just before sleep. Different foods and chemicals have different affinities for different metals, for example cilantro is good at removing mercury and EDTA is good at removing lead, also some chelators require other chemicals to chelate toxic metals, so to remove all the toxic metals the chelating system should have many chelators or helper chemicals, such as alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), cilantro, chlorella, coenzyme Q10, EDTA, garlic, L-Cysteine, magnesium, methionine, methysulfonylmethane (MSM) N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), selenium, sodium alginate, taurine, vitamin B12, and vitamin C. To add to the metal supplementation in the morning, while on chelation therapy the patient should eat many foods which have a high ratio of minerals to calories, such as root vegetables. The removed metals will leave through the urine, stool, sweat, or hair. To help this along, drink lots of water, eat lots of fiber, and sweat more with exercise and/or a sauna.
Extreme Health USA has two chelation systems, the vegetarian Heavy Metal Detox Supplement and with EDTA, the Heart Plus Detox Supplement. They both include a morning supplement to provide metals in the morning.
Science Formulas has two chelation products, the caplet bulk jar, Oral Chelation Caplet Formula and the liquid bottle, Oral Chelation Liquid Formula. The full treatment requires either the caplet bulk jar or three liquid bottles. Their morning supplement, Multi Chelation Support Formula, is sold separately.
There are many foods and chemicals which treat cancer safely, but once the patient stops taking them, most of the effects stop. Chelation has the advantage that once the metals are removed, they're gone forever, making chelation one of the best preventation measures, because taking it once gives lifetime cancer protection. It is still a good idea to take mild chelation therapy every few years because in that time the body will get more heavy metals, and also no single round of chelation therapy removes all the toxic metals.

Agaricus Blazei Murill (ABM)
The agaricus blazei murill (ABM) mushroom treats cancer. The typical dose is 5 grams (one teaspoon) in a glass of liquid three times a day, for a total of 15 grams/day.
ABM mushrooms for medicinal use grow best in the sunny, unpolluted landscape of the Brazilian rainforest, where the mushroom was discovered. ABM mushrooms grown in other countries have less of the cancer treating compounds, and often more toxic metals. Brazilian ABM mushroom products include Desert Forest Nutrionals - Agaricus Blazei Murrill Extract, and Desert Forest Nutrionals - Agaricus Blazei Murrill Powder. The ABM mushroom contains beta-glucans, derivatives of ergosterol, double stranded RNA, which is an anti-viral agent; proteoglycans and protein bound polysaccharides of low molecular weight, which are immune enhancers; and, protein bound polysaccharides of high molecular weight, vitamins B1 and B2, proteins in the form of amino acids, niacin, iron, and calcium.
People with mushroom allergies should not take ABM mushrooms in any form. There have been a few reports of liver damage when taking ABM mushrooms, this may be because killing many cancer cells quickly overloads the liver with debris. To minimize the strain on the liver, anti-oxidants can be added, such as the three anti-oxidants used successfully in the Berkely Study, where they helped regenerate and protect the liver in hepatitis patients; alpha lipoic acid, selenium and milk thistle. Also, liver flushes can be done.

Carrots
Carrots treat cancer to a small degree. Carrots can be eaten raw or juiced. Carrots are great as a base for juicing whatever else you want to include in your fresh vegetable juice. Carrots and other vegetables should be juiced without overheating them, because that would destroy the enzymes. A slow speed masticating juicer will make healthy juice without overheating. A typical amount of carrot juice for good health is 500 mL (2 cups) a day.
Carrots have vitamin A, beta carotenes, lutein, polyacetylene antioxidants falcarindiol and falcarinol, B vitamins, folates, copper, calcium, potassium, manganese and phosphorus. Vitamin A toxicity is possible with vitamin supplements and fish oils, but you can not overdose on vitamin A with carrots. Carrot polyacetylenes are also anti-inflammatories, and they have anti-aggregatory properties, preventing red blood cells from clumping together.
Purple carrots have about 30 times higher anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant levels than orange carrots, so they should be a more powerful treatment. Purple carrot seed products include The Cottage Gardener - Dragon Carrot, and Bountiful Gardens - Carrot, Dragon Purple.

Curcumin/Turmeric
Curcumin treats cancer. The typical treatment dose is 2 grams of dried powdered root per day, or 500 milligrams of curcumin powder three times a day.
Curcumin is the active ingredient of the Indian/Asian curry spice turmeric, curcumin is the principal curcuminoid in turmeric. Curcumin can suppress tumour initiation, promotion and metastasis. The anti-cancer potential stems from its ability to suppress a wide variety of tumour cells, down-regulate transcription factors, down-regulate enzymes such as COX-2 and other inflammatories, chemokines, cell-surface adhesion molecules, and down-regulate growth factors.
Curcumin might increase the risk of bleeding and so may be inadvisable if you are taking anti-coagulants.

Proteolytic Enzymes
Proteolytic enzymes treat cancer. A typical dosage for chronic illness is on the label. The Life Extension - Zywobin-Forte dosage is 4 capsules a day. The ModernHerbalist.com - Wobenzym-N dosage is 6 capsules a day.
For full effect, the proteolytic enzymes must contain pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain and bromelain. Some doctors recommend taking half of the proteolytic enzymes away from meals if it's being used therapeutically. This frees up the enzymes from digesting foods to perform other healthy functions.
Dr. Kelley recommends that patients follow a cycle of taking the enzymes and metabolic nutrients for 25 days (or less if the patient feels too toxic), then stopping the supplements for 5 days so that the body has time to eliminate the debris. This cycling continues until the malignancies are gone.
Adverse effects with high doses of porcine-based pancreatic enzyme therapy are intestinal gas, occasional bloating, and occasional indigestion. People with sensitivity to pineapple, may be sensitive to bromelain. People who are allergic to bee sting may have a similar reaction to bromelain. The cancer debris is toxic, which is why stopping the supplements for 5 days out of the month is recommended to eliminate the debris.

Wheatgrass Juice
Wheatgrass juice treats cancer to a small degree. The typical dose is 60 ml/day. The wheatgrass juice should be made at least 4 hours after cutting because the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is 40 times more potent 4 hours after cutting the wheatgrass than it is at the time of cutting. The wheatgrass should be grown outdoors, because indoor grown wheatgrass has high levels of mold and bacteria.
Outdoor grown wheatgrass powders include Pines - Wheat Grass Powder, and Florida Herb House - Wheatgrass Juice Powder. Outdoor grown frozen juices include Seven Grains Natural Market - Evergreen Organic Wheatgrass Juice, and Dynamic Greens - Juices. If you are ordering online, it is best to get the powders, because the frozen juices may thaw by the time you receive them.
Wheatgrass contains at least 13 vitamins (several are antioxidants), including B12, many minerals and trace elements, including selenium, and all 20 amino acids. It also contains over 30 other enzymes, including the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytochrome oxidase, the hormone abscisic acid (also called dormin), chlorophyll, and laetrile. Furthermore, wheatgrass is one of the most alkaline foods.
Wheatgrass grown indoors has mold. The mold can lead to a reaction, sometimes an anaphylactic reaction. Indoor growers claim this mold is harmless and that any reaction is a detox reaction, however, there is overwhelming evidence that the mold is harmful. Detox reactions generally last for a day or two, up to a week for a severe reaction, but they always pass eventually because the susceptible part of the infection dies and the toxins are flushed out. A permanent reaction can not be a detox reaction, it must be a reaction to a treatment. There are powders and juices from outdoor grown wheatgrass, there is no good reason to buy indoor grown wheatgrass. The safety rating of five is for outdoor grown wheatgrass, indoor grown wheatgrass would have a rating of two.

Baking Soda and Sugar
Baking soda combined with sugar treats cancer. Aluminum free baking soda is used, not baking powder. The sugar helps the baking soda get into cancer cells, whereupon the baking soda raises their PH, which kills them. The sugars combined with baking soda are typically maple syrup, or molasses. Honey is a very healthy sugar which kills cancer on its own, however, because it is acidic it reacts with the alkaline baking soda, neutralizing the alkalinity, so honey should not be used with baking soda. For killing cancer, honey is instead typically used alone or mixed with cinnamon.
The baking soda is stirred and mixed in a heated saucepan with the sugar. The maple syrup formula is one part baking soda with three parts 100% pure, aluminum free, maple syrup. The typical dose is one to three teaspoons of the mixture daily, which is one quarter teaspoon to three quarters of a teaspoon of baking soda. When buying maple syrup, buy Grade B maple syrup, if you cannot get Grade B, then get the darkest Grade A you can get. The baking soda and maple syrup must not be mixed in aluminum cookware, use Pyrex (or similar), stainless steel or copper cookware only. The mixture must be stirred briskly with low heat for 8 minutes. At first start at 49 Celcius (120 Farenheit), and each day increase the temperature by 4 Celcius (7 Farenheit) until the mixture is slightly burned. Then back off to the previous temperature for your permanent temperature. If the mixture tastes terrible, you burned it, which is easy to do. But if you keep it just warm enough so that it doesn't burn, the two substances will combine and it will taste quite pleasant. The mixture should not be refrigerated and not more than a nine day supply should be made at one time, these rules are suggested to insure the mixture does not separate during storage.
The molasses formula is equal amounts of baking soda and molasses. The typical dose is half to 1.5 teaspoons of the mixture daily, which is one quarter teaspoon to three quarters of a teaspoon of baking soda. Black strap molasses are the best type of molasses for cancer treatment.
Baking soda therapy is similar to cesium therapy, the difference being baking soda is cheaper but less powerful. Baking soda makes the cancer cells alkaline, reduces the intake of glucose into the cell (thus starving the cell), and restores the ability of DNA and RNA to control cell division.
Baking soda should be taken with potassium, because the baking soda will change the level of potassium in the body. Unfortunately a corresponding potassium dose could not be found, but two organic bananas a day should help. The average organic banana has 467 mg of potassium. Even after taking potassium, the treatment can lead to a dangerous potassium imbalance, and hyperkalemia (too much potassium) or hypokelemia (too little potassium) may result, so this treatment should not be used for more than three weeks at a time, with at least a week off between treatments.

Cayenne Pepper
Cayenne pepper treats cancer by killing cancer cells, and by improving digestion and removal of toxins. People often start taking 1/8th to 1/16th of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in 70 mL of very warm water of no hotter than 35,000 to 45,000 Scoville heat units (SHU) cayenne pepper. Many build up from there all the way to a teaspoon. Cayenne pepper is also available in capsules, one capsule of cayenne is around 450 milligrams, roughly 1/4th to 1/3rd of a teaspoon.
Cayenne pepper belongs to the Capsicum family and its botanical name is Capsicum annuum. It is the red or green chili pepper that is used to add flavor in food. Cayenne contains capsaicin, vitamin A, C, E, K, carotenoids and the complete B complexes. It is also a source of calcium, potassium, manganese and dietary fiber. Cayenne pepper helps treat cancer mostly by improving digestion as it improves circulation, and stimulates the flow of stomach secretions and saliva, which makes other cancer killing foods more effective. Also to a small extent it also dissolves fibroids and kills some cancer cells directly. This is why it is a component in some anti-cancer diets, like the Budwig diet for the cure and prevention of cancer.
Very hot cayenne pepper powders include Butcher and Packer - Whole Red Pepper - 90,000 Scoville units, and The Great North American Spice Company - Cayenne Pepper - 90,000 Scoville Units.
Cayenne pepper should always be taken with a meal, never on an empty stomach. Cayenne pepper doses should be started small, and increased slowly over at least several days until the target dose is reached or there are adverse effects. Excess consumption may cause burning sensations in the throat, stomach, or rectum.

Cesium
Cesium therapy treats cancer quickly. Cesium can be taken as cesium chloride, or as cesium carbonate. About 3 g of cesium in the form of cesium chloride is typically used in cesium cancer therapy.
Cesium makes the cancer cells alkaline, reduces the intake of glucose into the cell (thus starving the cell), and restores the ability of DNA and RNA to control cell division. It is a powerful treatment which can reduce pain from cancer within two days, and it has achieved a 50% cure rate on very advanced cancer patients, some already in a coma.
Cesium must be taken with a comparable amount of potassium, because cesium will change the level of potassium in the body. Even after taking a comparable amount of potassium, the treatment can lead to a dangerous potassium imbalance, so potassium levels have to be carefully monitored or else hyperkalemia (too much potassium) or hypokelemia (too little potassium) may result. This treatment should only be done under the supervision of a health care professional experienced with cesium therapy. In general, it should not be used with electromedicine devices (because some of these devices electroporate the cell walls, which may release some of the cesium chloride from the cancer cells).

Garlic
Garlic has been used to treat cancer throughout the ages, dating back to Hippocrates who recommended his patients eat large amounts of crushed garlic to cure their cancer. The typical dose to heal cancer is a minimum of six cloves of crushed garlic per day.
Aged garlic extract (AGE) is aged for up to twenty months. Over this time period the harsh and irritating compounds in garlic beak down into stable and safe sulfur compounds. Aged garlic extract contains primarily water-soluble sulfur compounds as well as a smaller amount of oil-soluble sulfur compounds.
Excessive consumption of garlic can lead to garlic odor on breath and skin, occasional allergic reactions, occasional increase in bronchial asthma and contact dermatitis, a chance of stomach disorders and diarrhea, and a decrease in serum protein and calcium levels. Garlic thins blood, so if you are taking large amounts of garlic you should not take blood thinners such as aspirin, coumadin or warfarin. Aged garlic extract does not lead to as much odor, but it is more expensive than eating garlic directly.

Hoxsey
The Hoxsey formulas treat cancer. The Hoxsey treatment has two herbal formulas. One is external, consisting of a red paste made with bloodroot, the active anti tumor ingredient, mixed with zinc chloride and antimony sulfide. This paste is applied directly onto skin cancer tumors. The internal tonic typically consists of red clover blossom, licorice root, buckthorn bark, burdock root, stillingia root, poke root, barberry root, oregon grape root, cascara sagrada bark, prickly ash bark, wild indigo root and sea kelp. A potassium iodide supplement is included with the tonic.
At the Hoxsey clinic, the Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, the formula is changed according to type of cancer, because some herbs are more effective against particular cancers. The effectiveness of 6 is for the Hoxsey Formula tonic used at home. With the experienced practioners at the clinic, the effectiveness would be 10 because they would use the best herbs for the cancer, they would also use the external paste, and they might also use other supplements, diet, nutrition, and chelation therapy.
Some of the ingredients in the Hoxsey formula can cause adverse effects. For example, buckthorn bark can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea if taken in large quantities. Cascara can cause diarrhea. Potassium iodide could cause adverse reactions in sensitive patients.

Milk Thistle
Milk thistle treats cancer to a small degree and supports the liver. The active ingredient in milk thistle is silymarin. The typical dose is roughly 400 mg/day of milk thistle extract, standardized to 80% silymarin, divided equally between meals.
Milk thistle products include Life Extension - Certified European Milk Thistle - 750 mg, and Holland and Barrett - Milk Thistle Capsules - 175mg. A milk thistle product combining a phospholipid with silybin which claims to increase bioavailabilty by a factor of ten is LiverSupport.com - Maximum Milk Thistle - 240 mg.
Liver support is important when treating cancer, because the liver has to work overtime to deal with all the cancer debris. The effectiveness of four is an addition of two for treating the cancer directly and two for helping the liver deal with the cancer debris.
Milk thistle can be used safely and effectively by a wide range of people, including pregnant and nursing women. Occasionally there is a mild and temporary laxative effect.

Paw Paw
Paw paw kills cancer cells by starving them of energy. It should be taken according to the dosage on the package. Paw paw should not be taken for longer than a month at a time.
Cancer cells use up glucose at very high rates, 10 to 17 times higher than normal cells. Cancer cells need the energy to grow quickly and to pump out anticancer compounds. The acetogenins in paw paw restrict glucose consumption, starving cancer cells of the energy they need. Paw paw has 50 types of acetogenins, including the powerful acetogenins bullatalicin and bullatacin, which have double ring structures. The acetogenins also restrict the energy production of healthy cells, but most healthy cells will survive a temporary lowering of energy production. However, it is best to not starve healthy cells for too long, which is why paw paw should not be used for more than a month at a time.
The best paw paw for treating cancer is the North American species of paw paw, Asimina triloba. Paw paw products include Nature's Sunshine - Paw Paw - 8.5 mg, and New Beginnings in Health, Paw Paw Cell-Reg - 12.5 mg. Graviola is related to paw paw, but it has fewer and less potent acetogenins than true paw paw. Even though graviola is cheaper than paw paw, it is not worth buying as a cancer treatment.
Paw paw should not be used for more than a month at a time, because it can starve healthy cells of energy. It can make people tired and therefore should not be used as a preventative. Paw Paw may starve fast growing cells such as a developing fetus, therefore pregnant women must not take paw paw. Patients with Parkinsons Disease should not take paw paw unless alkaloid-free preparations are used. There is also a possibility of allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Paw paw can cause digestion distress such as nausea, so it should be taken with food. Paw paw is a natural emetic, like ipecac syrup, and can make people throw up.

Walnut
Walnuts treat cancer to a small degree. The dosage in the mouse study works out to about 80 grams/day for a human. Walnuts are a rich plant source of omega-3s, and are loaded with gamma tocopherol (a form of vitamin E), phytochemicals known as polyphenols, and antioxidants. However, researchers have not found a single constituent responsible for the beneficial effects of walnuts. For example, the study found effects on multiple signaling and metabolic pathways related to tumor growth and metabolism and that walnut-fed mice had lower blood insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), a protein strongly associated with prostate cancer.

Bromelain
Bromelain treats cancer. A dose of 50 mg/day may prevent cancer, the protective effect increases with dosage and the best results occur when bromelain is given in doses above 500 mg/day. Bromelain is relatively nontoxic, and doses of up to 2,000 mg/day have been used. Most commercial products contain 500 mg of bromelain, manufacturers suggest a dosage regimen of 500 to 1,000 mg daily. Some doctors recommend taking half of the bromelain away from meals if it's being used therapeutically. This frees up the digestive enzymes from digesting foods to perform other healthy functions.
Bromelain is usually extracted from pineapple stems and sometimes from the fruit. People with sensitivity to pineapple, may be sensitive to bromelain. People who are allergic to bee sting may have a similar reaction to bromelain. Bromelain acts as a blood thinner and little is known about how bromelain interacts with blood-thinning drugs, people should avoid combining such drugs with bromelain in order to reduce the theoretical risk of excessive bleeding. Bromelain may also increase the heart rate.
Bromelain is just one of several proteolytic enzymes used to treat cancer. The full proteolytic enzyme treatment requires pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain and bromelain, as described in the proteolytic enzymes section, and is more powerful and expensive than bromelain alone.

Dichloroacetate
Dichloroacetate (DCA) treats cancer. The typical dose is 10 mg/day per kg of body weight. It generally takes three months for the drug to reach blood levels high enough to alter the tumor's metabolism.
DCA restores mitochondria in cells to make them function properly. Another function of normal mitochondria is signaling apoptosis, or cellular self destruction. Normal cells die and become replaced constantly. But with cancer cells, the apoptosis signal is nullified, making cancer cells immortal.
Dichloroacetate can cause pain, numbness of the fingers and feet, gait disturbances, and frequent urination. The adverse effects are uncommon at the typical dose of 10 mg/day/kg. At higher doses, the adverse effects are more common.

Honey and Cinnanmon
Raw honey with cinnamon treats cancer, the combination is from Ayurvedic medicine. The typical dose is one tablespoon of honey with half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Because cinnamon has possible adverse effects, it is best to start with a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, and if there are no adverse effects, increase the dose to half a teaspoon of cinnamon. You must only take true Ceylon cinnamon, not Cassia cinnamon which is an herb whose powder looks like Ceylon cinnamon powder and can be found on some store shelves labeled as cinnamon. Ceylon cinnamon sticks are tan brown, fragile, composed of thin and paper-like textured bark that forms multiple layers when rolled up. Cassia cinnamon sticks are reddish dark brown, tough, composed of uneven thick bark that forms only a few layers when rolled up. For the honey use pure, raw unpasteurized honey because heating destroys some of the medicinal compounds. Local raw honey is excellent, a good packaged honey is manuka honey.
Honey has sugars, acids and enzymes, most of the medicinal benefits are from the enzymes, and a bit from the acids. The enzymes include catalase, diastase, glucose oxidase, inhibine, invertase, katalase, and phosphatase. The main medicinal acid is proline. Many of the enzymes, like diastase and invertase, are sensitive to heat and light which is why honey should never be heated above 43 Celcius (110 Farenheit). The medicinal ingredients in cinnamon include cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl acetate, cinnamyl alcohol, and methylhydroxychalcone polymer (MHCP).
Honey is safe at the typical dose, however cinnamon has possible adverse effects at even half a teaspoon. People with any prior condition of the digestive system such as an ulcer or irritable bowel syndrome should be careful when eating cinnamon, more than half a teaspoon may cause the lining of the stomach to become irritated. Doses of more than half a teaspoon may increase heart rate, which is dangerous for those with heart conditions, and may damage kidneys. Cinnamon lowers blood sugar, so if combined with diabetes medication it may cause blood glucose levels to dip too low, therefore diabetics should pay extra care to their glucose levels when first taking cinnamon. Cinnamon thins the blood, so it should not be taken in any situation where a lot of bleeding may occur, like before surgery, or during heavy menstruation. Some traditional practitioners will give a mother cinnamon in order to induce contractions, so pregnant women may want to avoid cinnamon. Overall, cinnamon has many possible side effects, so if you have any problem with cinnamon, do not take cinnamon. The honey alone still treats cancer, although to a much lesser extent than honey and cinnamon.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) and Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)
Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) treat cancer to a small extent and protect the body from cancer cell debris. The typical dose is 300 mg/day of alpha lipoic acid plus 1,000 mg/day of acetyl-l-carnitine. When combined, ALA and ALCAR worked at 100 to 1,000 fold lower concentrations than they each did individually.
Alpha lipoic acid comes in two mirror image forms labeled 'R' and 'S', only the R form is produced and used by life processes. Only buy alpha lipoic acid with the 'R' label. Products with 'R' alpha lipoic acid and acetyl-l-carnitine include Life Extension - Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer with BioPQQ, Bestvite - Acetyl L-Carnitine 500 mg and R-Alpha Lipoic Acid 150 mg, and Robert Jordan Nutraceutricals - Acetyl-L-Carnitine plus Alpha Lipoic Acid. Combining the bioactive `R` isomer of lipoic acid and acetyl-l-carnitine decreases oxidative damage.
Adverse effects of alpha lipoic acid are mild and include a skin rash. Alpha lipoic acid may also lower blood sugar levels, which may increase the risk of developing hypoglycemia in diabetics and people suffering from low blood sugar. Alpha lipoic acid should also not be taken if you are currently suffering from, a thiamine deficiency. Adverse effects of acetyl-l-carnitine are rare. Doses of acetyl-l-carnitine higher than 500 mg/day may cause some gastrointestinal symptoms, which include vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and nausea. Some users report high doses of acetyl-l-carnitine causing a fishy body odor. Individuals suffering from kidney disease should not take acetyl-l-carnitine due to an increased risk of developing muscle weakness. High doses may also cause restlessness, and overstimulation.

Asparagus
Asparagus may treat cancer to a small degree, except for cancers which respond to l-asparaginase. The typical dose is four tablespoons of pureed cooked asparagus twice a day, improvement is supposedly seen in a month. Asparagus contains Vitamin B, folate, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, ferulic acid, quercetin, rutin, glutathione, steroidal saponins, and Asparanin A.
Unfortunately asparagus also contains an amino acid called asparagine. Normal cells generally manufacture this substance, but leukemia cells often cannot and must obtain their supply from adjacent normal cells. If starved of asparagine, leukemia cells die. Therefore the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians states “Eating asparagus would seem ill advised for people who have cancers that respond to l-asparaginase.”

Coconut Water
Coconut water may treat cancer to a small degree. Coconut water has a lot of potassium, one cup (250 ml) of coconut water has more potassium than a banana. Coconut water also contains magnesium, calcium, zinc, selenium, iodine, sulfur, manganese, boron, and molybdenum. Coconut water also contains cytokinins, which are are anti-again hormones. Cytokinins increase the vitality of cells throughout their lifetime, increase their lifetime a tiny bit, and may reduce their chance of becoming cancerous.
Because coconut water contains so much potassium, it can lead to hyperkalemia (too much potassium). The adverse effects of hyperkalemia include diarrhea, stomach irritation, and nausea. At even higher levels, muscle weakness, slowed heart rate, and abnormal heart rhythm may occur. Overall, coconut water is a healthy drink, one or two cups a day is fine, but too much can lead to hyperkalemia and should be avoided entirely if the patient is already suffering from hyperkalemia.

Rife
Rife machines treat cancer if they work properly. Royal Raymond Rife was a brilliant scientist who in the 1930s discovered that subjecting pathogens to their resonance frequency destroyed them in a similar way to how a glass is shattered when a singer hits the right note. In 1934 at his clinic in California, diseased people were exposed to the same frequencies to destroy the pathogen causing their illness. Treatments lasted only three minutes. The person would wait three days before another exposure giving the lymph system time to cleanse the debris from their bodies, and would be cancer free in about thirty such treatments or less. Unlike the chemotherapy treatments currently in use, Rife's therapy was 100 percent effective and engendered no adverse symptoms.
The problem is that the original Rife clinic was put out of operation by the American Medical Association. Other versions of the machine are now being made, however, the frequencies, waveforms, currents and interfaces to the body are often different, so it is difficult to know if a particular machine works. That's why the effectivess of this treatment is rated at 4, if there was a machine known to work properly, the effectiveness of that machine would be 10.
Occasionally, the machine has been used too long at a single session by an inexperienced operator, killing too many pathogens at once, which overloaded the body with debris and harmed the patient. The machine should be used in short sessions at least at the beginning, preferably by an experienced operator.

Boron
Boron treats cancer, mainly by killing fungal infections. The cheapest safe source of boron is borax, boric acid must never be taken orally. The typical cancer treatment dose is 1/8 teaspoon of borax per day for low to normal weight people, and 1/4 teaspoon for heavier people. The borax is dissolved in one liter of water and taken throughout the day. The borax is usually taken four days a week on, and three days off. The dose should be started small, at 1/32 of a teaspoon, then increased to the target dose over a month, to avoid a possible detox reaction from candida die off. If you get die off reactions, like nausea, dizziness, and diarrhea, stop taking borax until the reaction subsides, then you can build up slowly again. Borax in these large quantities must not be taken directly, it must be taken with water throughout the day.
Borax is sodium tetraborate decahydrate, with the molecular formula Na2B4O7·10H2O and molar mass of 381. The boron component of the molar mass is 43, so by mass boron is 11.2% of borax. Borax is also called sodium borate, sodium borate decahydrate, disodium salt, sodium tetraborate, and disodium tetraborate decahydrate. The density of powdered borax is 1.71 grams/mL, so one teaspoon is about 8.55 grams of borax, which has 0.96 grams (960 mg) of boron. One eighth of a teaspoon of borax has 120 mg of boron, and one quarter of a teaspoon of borax has 240 mg of boron. Borax is usually in the laundry section, brands include 20 Mule Team Borax, and Pascoes - Bare Essentials Borax. Other ways to get borax are listed in the Borax Cures Questions section, and on page 6 and page 7 of the Borax Cures site.
Boron at these high doses treats cancer by killing fungal infections, like candida, by getting rid of fluorine, by balancing the calcium concentrations in the body, and by helping the body use vitamin D. Killing fungal infections treats cancer, because fungal infections are a cofactor in most cancers. The problem is that killing a fungal infection releases all the fungal poisons at once, leading to a detox reaction, typically nausea, dizziness, and diarrhea. Likewise, higher amounts of calcium and fluoride passing through the kidneys may cause temporary kidney pain. Also, as the calcium is redistributed it can cause severe cramping and pain, or problems with blood circulation or nerve transmission. That's why boron doses should be started small and stopped when there are adverse effects, then restarted small again. That's also why boron must be taken with water, to ensure that there is always enough water for the kidneys to excrete the calcium and fluorine. Overall, boron in small quantities is safe, and those quantities are enough to treat arthritis, which is the most common medical use of boron. However, the larger quantities required to treat fungal infections, and therefore cancer, can be dangerous and must be approached cautiously.

Laetrile/Amygdalin/Vitamin B17
Laetrile, in combination with zinc, proteolytic enzymes and vitamin C, treats cancer. A typical oral dose during cancer treatment is around 100 mg/day. Laetrile requires zinc for transport in the body, proteolytic enzymes, and vitamin C. Laetrile therapy is also improved with manganese, magnesium, selenium, vitamins B6, B9 and B12, vitamin A, and vitamin E.
When the laetrile molecule comes across a cancer cell, it is broken down into two molecules of glucose, a molecule of hydrogen cyanide and a molecule of benzaldehyde. The benzaldehyde, and to a lesser extent the hydrogen cyanide, kill the cancer cell. A problem is that some bacteria in a person's intestines can also break down the laetrile molecule, causing cyanide to be released, which can lead to cyanide poisoning, whose symptoms are dizziness, blurred vision, and nausea. For this reason, it is usually suggested that oral doses be limited to at most 3 grams per day. Some of the bacteria which break down laetrile are in probiotics, so probiotics cause more cyanide from laetrile to be released. Also laetrile can lower blood pressure. Because of these problems, although the oral dose could go to 3 grams a day, the typical dose is much lower at 100 mg/day. If a patient has heart issues which would be made worse by a drop in blood pressure, they should not take laetrile. Whatever laetrile dose you aim for, approach it slowly, gradually increasing the dose each day, starting at 10 mg/day and increasing by only 10mg/day each day. While increasing the dose, pay attention to your body's signals, if any signs of cyanide poisoning occur (dizziness, blurred vision, and nausea), remember how much laetrile you were taking and do not repeat that experience. If the symptoms persist or if they are severe, see a physician immediately, because cyanide poisoning is a serious matter. If there is no physician immediately available and there is an extreme emergency, then a cyanide antidote kit, also called the Pasadena kit, can be used. The Pasadena kit uses three different drugs given in a specific sequence. Amyl nitrate is inhaled, and then the caregiver gives the victim sodium nitrate and sodium thiosulfate intravenously. The first two drugs pull the cyanide away from the blood cells, while the last one boosts the body's natural ability to get rid of the poison. The drugs have significant side effects, however, and can cause problems of their own if not given in the proper amounts. If there is no Pasedena kit available, then giving the patient sugar might help.
Laetrile is found in apricot seeds, about 5 mg per apricot pit kernel. A complication with getting laetrile from seeds is that there is a great variation between the amount of laetrile in apricot kernels, and plants in general, depending on their size, the tree from which they come, and the part of the world in which they are grown. Laetrile, a member of a group of cyanide containing substances called nitrilosides, is also found in smaller quantities in many other plants. Because laetrile is bitter to the taste, it has been mostly eliminated from the edible portion of domesticated foods by selection and cross-breeding. In general many domesticated foods still contain laetrile in the inedible parts, such as the seeds in apricots. From the list of plants which contain high levels of nitrilosides, the plants which have 500 mg of nitriloside per 100 grams of food include alfalfa leaves, apple seeds, apricot seeds, bamboo shoots, bitter almonds, wild blackberries, cassavas, cherry seeds, wild crabapples, Swedish (Lignon) cranberries, eucalyptus leaves, peach seeds, and plum seeds. Since only the amount of nitrilosides are listed, rather than specifically laetrile, the information is mostly useful to compare laetrile amounts between plants. The rule of thumb when eating seeds is to eat the fruit along with the seeds. For example, you do not want to extract the seeds from 50 apples and eat only those seeds, however eating a few apples every day along with their seeds is reasonably safe. If eating wild foods, spit out the bitter ones because the bitter flavor is due to the cyanide being released. Laetrile can be bought in pure form at several places, such as those listed at the "Apricot seeds kill cancer cells" page.
Laetrile is more effective as the dosage increases. Because of the problems with oral laetrile the typical dose is relatively small, so the effectiveness is rated at 4. However, in a clinic laetrile can be given intravenously to avoid bacterial breakdown and the patient monitored for problems, in which case the dose can be increased to 6 grams/day, which boosts the cancer killing power enormously, and the effectiveness would be 10. Generally, it takes an accumulation of about sixty grams over a period of about ten days before the patient can report tangible improvement. A rule of thumb for slower oral dosing could not be found, but it would certainly take much longer to reach the therapeutic accumulation with the typical oral dose of 100 mg/day.

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake is not recommended. It is only listed so that people who have heard of it realize how dangerous it is; and therefore try something else.
Rattlesnake meat or blood may treat cancer. The dose is typical meat consumption.
To prepare rattlesnake, take great care to avoid any contact with the teeth or venom. It is recommended that protective gloves be worn. Even after death, a rattlesnake can bite and will continue to “crawl” for several hours. Sever the snake head approximately 10 centimeters (4 inches) behind the skull and place in a covered container for disposal, also cut off the rattle. For your safety, do not handle the heads with bare hands. Hang the snake by the tail to allow the carcass to bleed properly. Be sure to do this in an appropriate area because the writhing of the carcass will splatter blood.
When rattlesnake meat is properly prepared, there is little risk of venom poisoning. However, rattlesnake often has salmonella bacteria, typically Salmonella Arizona or Salmonella Subgroup Three. If the patient does not resist the salmonella bacteria, the infection can cause fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and sometimes death. It should be possible to kill the salmonella with irradiation or freeze drying to make a salmonella free rattlesnake product without destroying the cancer killing proteins, but there are no reports of a salmonella free product being used to treat cancer.

Mistletoe
Mistletoe is not recommended. It is only listed so that people who have heard of it realize how dangerous it is; and therefore try something else.
Mistletoe extract may treat cancer. A common mistletoe extract is Iscador. Mistletoe itself is toxic and must never be eaten. Commercial extracts are usually safe. In the United States, any of mistletoe extracts must be prescribed by a physician. Mistletoe is typically given by subcutaneous injection, but it sometimes is injected directly into the tumor particularly on the liver, esophagus and cervix. It may also be taken orally in tumors of the brain and spinal cord.
Mistletoe contains a cytotoxic lectin, viscumin, and other lectins which are cytotoxic and immunostimulatory. It also contains a number of cytotoxic proteins and polypetides (viscotoxins).
Even a few leaves or berries can cause poisoning, so never eat part of a mistletoe plant and keep the plants away from animals and children. Commercial mistletoe extracts generally have minimal adverse effects, but occasionally allergic symptoms including anaphylactic reactions have been reported. It usually produces an increase in body temperature and flu-like symptoms. In addition, the injection site can become inflamed. Other side effects include upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever, headaches, chest pain, low blood pressure, and abdominal pain with nausea. Overdoses can cause severe poisoning including seizures, coma and death. In addition, because the preparation contains tyramine, patients on any type of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor antidepressant should not take it. The combination can cause dangerously high blood pressure. People with heart problems should also be careful, since it raises blood pressure and accelerates the pulse. Therapy is normally discontinued in case of high temperature over 38 Celcius.
