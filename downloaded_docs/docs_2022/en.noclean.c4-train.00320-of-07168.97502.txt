Living With Hemorrhoids Can Be Painful And Irritating
TIP! A long-term effective treatment for uncomfortable and painful hemorrhoids is to eat a lot of fiber. A hemorrhoid prevention diet centered around high fiber content should contain foods like oatmeals, whole grain pasta and breads, as well as leafy green vegetables.
If you want to prevent hemorrhoids, you should do all you can to have soft, easy to pass bowel movements. It helps to empty bowels regularly, whenever the urge happens if possible. To aid this process, be sure to get plenty of exercise, drink more water and add good fiber sources to your diet. The article below contains advice for the prevention and treatment of hemorrhoids.
TIP! Practicing thorough bathroom hygiene habits decrease your chances of getting external hemorrhoids. Use soft toilet paper that does not leave lint behind, and use a moist towelette to clean yourself after each bowel movement.
One of the most effective and long-term solutions to prevent formation of painful, uncomfortable hemorrhoids is to adopt a diet that is rich in fiber. For example, you can enjoy healthy, high-fiber foods like apples, dark leafy greens, whole grains and even oatmeal. The fiber will soften your stools, decreasing the strain that causes hemorrhoids.
Witch Hazel
TIP! Get thin to reduce the severity of hemorrhoids. People who are overweight tend to get hemorrhoids more frequently.
Consider using witch hazel as a treatment for discomfort and pain. This astringent shrinks the inflamed tissues, promoting healing and alleviating pain and itching. Use a cotton ball to apply witch hazel or pour it in your sitz bath.
TIP! Include plenty of fiber in your diet. If you eat a good deal of fiber, you will have softer stools.
If you suffer from hemorrhoids, prevent further aggravation of the condition by keeping substances that contain scents, dyes, and essential oils away from the inflamed area. Even minimal exposure to one of these substances may cause the hemorrhoid to burn or itch.
TIP! Never rely on laxatives as a method of eliminating hemorrhoids, as they are not meant to be taken on an ongoing basis. Laxatives could assist you in getting through a single bad constipation patch in order to have a simple bowel movement; however, they’re definitely not cures for hemorrhoid problems.
Excessive straining while moving the bowels is a major cause of hemorrhoids. Eating less processed food and drinking lots of water will make your stools softer, and thus require less straining to pass. To avoid straining, you may also want to try squatting. Use a stool that is placed underneath of your feet when you are defecating. Hemorrhoids are not common in areas of the world where people squat during a bowel movement.
TIP! Try to sit in a tub with warm water frequently, to relieve pain and swelling. Water that is warm, not hot, promotes circulation and decreases your discomfort.
To ameliorate the discomfort of hemorrhoids, shed some pounds! Being too heavy can exacerbate the effects of hemorrhoids. Those extra pounds around your mid-section add pressure to your body’s anal veins. Lose weight by following a high fiber diet, and you will alleviate the pressure on these areas of the body. One caution, however, is not to use laxatives continually to lose weight or treat hemorrhoids because this is an unhealthy alternative!
TIP! If you are having a painful hemorrhoid flare-up, a donut cushion may provide you with some relief. This type of cushion is shaped like its namesake and offers comfortable support that takes some of the pressure off of your hemorrhoids.
Water is one of the best treatments against hemorrhoids. Apply and soak your rectum in warm water for 10 minutes every day, and apply cold presses with a wet towel in the inflamed area. Get a toilet bath from your pharmacy.
TIP! Draw a warm bath and sit in it with your knees bent. The warm water will relieve the itchiness and pain due to hemorrhoids.
High fiber foods can ease hemorrhoid issues. Stools will inevitably be softer when fiber is present in the diet on a regular basis. With softer stools you won’t have to strain so much, and this will alleviate some of the discomfort you are experiencing. Fruits and fiber supplements are a few examples of the kinds of foods that might soften your stool.
TIP! Avoid scratching hemorrhoids. Scratching can cause damage in the area, and open wounds up for infection.
Laxatives aren’t a cure for hemorrhoids, they just fix your bowels briefly, but don’t offer you an actually solution to your problem. These laxatives could help you through a rough patch associated to constipation and you could have an easy time in relation to your bowel movement, but it cannot cure your hemorrhoid problem.
TIP! Exercise your anus to prevent hemorrhoids. Exercising can remedy lack of blood flow and make hemorrhoids less likely.
Never sit on the toilet when you are waiting to go. A lot of people like to read while on the toilet, however, this is not recommended because you could be straining unconsciously. Hemorrhoids can be aggravated by gravity also, so you’ll be more comfortable if you wait to sit down only when needed.
TIP! If you find a growth but you’re not certain if it is a hemorrhoid or not, consult with your doctor right away. Many people have difficulty differentiating between polyps and hemorrhoids.
As previously stated, the best way to avoid hemorrhoids is to keep your stools soft which will reduce straining and pressure. Adding more water and extra fiber to your diet can help. By following the advice in this article, you can help to ensure that hemorrhoid attacks do not occur as often.
