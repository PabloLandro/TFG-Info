Prescription Medications â€“ Short Term Memory Loss Cause
A number of prescription drugs, especially in combination with each other, can cause memory loss symptoms. Readers who experience signs of memory loss with any of the medications listed below should contact their physician for a possible drug interaction-memory loss evaluation.
Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety, sedative)
Common prescriptions include: Alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), flurazepam (Dalmane), lorazepam (Ativan), midazolam (Versed), quazepam (Doral), temazepam (Restoril) and triazolam (Halcion)
Opioid medications (pain killers)
Opioid medications (OxyContin, Norco, Vicodin, Percocet, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl) can cause memory loss symptoms.
See this page for further information.
Tricyclic antidepressants
Tricyclic antidepressants were initially developed in the 1950s. They are now commonly prescribed for other conditions such as chronic pain and eating disorders.
Common prescriptions include: Amitriptyline (Elavil), clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil) and trimipramine (Surmontil)
Antihistamines
Common medications include: diphenhydramine (Benadryl),brompheniramine (Dimetane), carbinoxamine (Clistin), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), clemastine (Tavist), and hydroxyzine (Vistaril)
Newer-generation antihistamines such as loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) tend to have fewer side effects related to memory impairment.
Anticholinergics (for incontinence, overactive bladder)
Common prescriptions include: Darifenacin (Enablex), oxybutynin (Ditropan XL, Gelnique, Oxytrol), solifenacin (Vesicare), tolterodine (Detrol) and trospium (Sanctura)
Special note: Long term use of anticholinergics in older adults can significantly increase the probability of cognitive impairment and memory loss symptoms. See Ref 1, below.
Sleep aids (hypnotic, sedative)
Common prescriptions include: Eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata) and zolpidem (Ambien)
A Comment on Statin Drugs
While anecdotal stories have frequently appeared in the media regarding memory loss symptoms being linked to statin drug use, the research evidence is weak and tenuous at best. Potential adverse effects might be resolved by switching from lipophilic to hydrophilic statins. See Ref 2 & 3 below.
