What are the health benefits of Himalayan Pink Salt?
The Himalayan salt or the ‚Äòpink salt‚Äô is known to be the most beneficial and cleanest salt available on this planet today, dating from the Precambrian Age of over 4 billion years when the planet earth was first formed.
Origin of the Himalayan Salt
It comes from the Punjab region of Pakistan. This region has the richest salt fields in the world. It comes from the mines around 5,000 feet below the Himalayan mountain range and the composed of dried remnants of the original, primal sea.
The Himalayan salt can be white, pink and or red in colour indicating its mineral content. These minerals are defined as highly beneficial for human and animal health.
Nutritional Value of Himalayan salt
The Himalayan salt is over 99 percent pure, a truly unique and loaded with over 84 traces of minerals including calcium, magnesium, potassium, copper and iron.
The pink salt often used for both culinary and therapeutic purposes. It is the best alternative to processed table salt, that is commonly used.
You can use it in your cooking as a healthy alternative to the processed salt, which is not only heavily processed and stripped off the minerals, but also loaded with a good deal of health damaging chemicals such as anti-clumping agent like yellow prussiate of soda, aluminium derivate and 97.5 to 99.9% sodium chloride.
The picture below illustrates the difference between Himalayan pink salt versus the common processed table salt:
My personal experience
There are a good deal of health and beauty benefits that I actually experienced myself when I switched to Himalayan salt in 2014.
I always had some unexplained health issues. After many years of GP and hospital visits, I did not get any profound diagnosis.
I was sick of being sick!
It was time I took the matter into my own capable hands, starting from looking at everything I consumed. I started testing the foods that were making me sick but still I were not getting any clear changes to my condition.
I was eating the eliminated diet of gluten and cow milk free, high in fruit and veg (blood type A) diet. I was not eating too spicy food either which is said to irritate your ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù the stomach!
My Research
As usual I started researching the pros and cons of everything I was eating even the ingredients and I came to a shocking discovery about the tablet salt! The more I looked into it, the more I learnt about it‚Äôs health damaging and highly toxic processing ingredients of table salt. This made me even more determined to look into an alternative option. Then I discovered the Himalayan Pink Salt.
After the first usage I started to feel my energy level was up and I was feeling more active, focused and healthy. My breathing was much easier and clearer and I wasn‚Äôt gasping for breath as I would normally do.
Himalayan salt lamp
I then bought the Himalayan Salt lamp which enables to clear the air by evaporating the dust and allergens in the environment instead of inhaling and getting them into the lungs.
The feeling of toxin and inflammation within my body started to decrease. I later found out that the Himalayan pink salt balances your body‚Äôs PH level.
Those who know me personally also know that I always had digestive issues. Tell you what people! This salt has helped cure those problems, completely!
I could not digest anything, even the plain water used to give me acid-reflux! This salt has helped stimulate the peristalsis of the digestive organs, balanced the stomach acid, supported the production of digestive fluids in the liver and pancreas, regulated the metabolism and harmonised the acid-alkaline balance.
This balance helped aid in my natural sleep pattern, which I was lacking in due to the imbalanced system.
I also started using the Himalayan salt crystals in my bath soaks to induce the sleep even better.
Despite my heavily imbalanced system, my blood sugar level used to fluctuate badly resulting in extreme bad headaches or I would pass out if I missed a snack or was late for having my meal. I had to constantly refuel the blood sugar level.
This was a frustrating vicious cycle because if I ate, I was getting indigestion and if I didn‚Äôt eat, I was getting extreme low sugar and lethargy!
I can happily share this with you lot, that all this is a total history now. I feel vibrant, healthy inside out and full of energy! All because I introduced the magic of the Himalayan pink salt in my life.
As I started to get more nutrition in my body; my bones became stronger, I got beautiful and radiant skin, stopped getting urine infections which used to be the regular thing.
Where did I purchase the Himalayan salt and lamp from?
Click here to purchase the same brand of Himalayan salt as I did, as I have tried and tested this. As some retailers are selling them and they are not pure and genuine.
If you want to purchase the Himalayan salt lamp, then please click here to purchase the one I did, again it is the genuine and purest form of salt lamp.
Alternatively, if you live in Greater Manchester, UK, then we can supply and deliver the Himalayan pink salt directly to your door. Please ask us in the comments section below for this service.
Or email us: rani@lifestyletipsandhacks.com
Final word
I now use the Himalayan salt in my diet same as I used the ordinary table salt. I am so pleased to discover that the Himalayan salt has the key elements to optimise my health and well being by providing me with a boost of key nutrients and minerals. I am so pleased that I have made this shockingly healthy discovery, which is a companion for life.
Just in case you‚Äôre wondering what I did with the remaining table salt that I had when I replaced it with the Himalayan salt‚Ä¶.I used it all up to melt the snow here in the UK. LOL üôÇ

I really want to improve my sleep quality. How long should I use it before the sleep? Do you have any recommendations?

Hi Furkan, the recommended time to use it before sleep is 45minutes to an hour. You can also use the Himalayan salt lamp in your bedroom to induce the sleep even further. Hope this helps. Good luck

Hey!
I have never even heard of this type of salt before.
It seems as though the benefits are amazing compared to regular salt. I actually don‚Äôt even use salt because it is so bad for you.
Where can I get something like this?

I am just curious, as it is still a salt. Does it still contain the same amount of sodium in it? I know, maybe a dumb question LOL. I see it in the store and have considered purchasing it instead of regular table salt. Now that I know the benefits, I can go ahead and make the switch!

Hi Matts Mom, it has a lot less sodium than the common table salt, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough after experiencing the benefits myself. So go and make the switch and I can assure you that you won‚Äôt regret it. Best of luck for your good health.

Very interesting and informative article. I didn‚Äôt realize that Himalayan salt was so healthy for you. I actually do use that for my cooking. And I do have a Himalayan rock salt lamp. I don‚Äôt use it like I should, but after reading how it helped you I guess I should start using it more. Is there a particular brand of salt that you would recommend? There are probably totally different brands in the U.K. than in the states.
Thanks for sharing your personal story!

Wow,
I was really clueless to all of the wonderful benefits of the himalayan pink salt.
I can‚Äôt believe how much it has helped you and your bodies health. It makes me want to leave work right now to go and buy some myself.
I will definitely be switching to pink himalayan salt after reading your article and maybe even spoil myself with the lamp you have shown as well!
Thank you for the great info!
Cheers,

Damn, I knew that Himalayan salt had benefits but I really didn‚Äôt know, it would make that much of a difference. I‚Äôm going to put in all the salt shakers now. I don‚Äôt know why so many people are afraid of salt! The worst thing that can happen is a salt deficiency. Plus, I sweat a lot when I am under the bars at the gym. Salt give me a great pump so I will opt for a better choice, this Himalayan salt!
