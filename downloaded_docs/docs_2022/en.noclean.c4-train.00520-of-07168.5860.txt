Crystal Therapy
Receiving Crystal Therapy (or crystal healing) can be a profound experience. When used in a therapeutic setting, crystals may influence powerful change from within. Whether you are looking to reduce stress levels, release anger, begin to free yourself of anxiety or depression, feel more positive, let go of certain emotions, or change patterns that may be holding you back in your life, Crystal Therapy is perfect for you!
Crystal Therapy has long been used to influence our wellbeing. We may carry a rose quartz crystal to assist us with love, or amethyst for assistance with our intuition. Hematite is sold in most pharmacies as a help for arthritis as it is thought to be excellent for inflammation.
As part of the consultation, suggestions are given on how you may benefit from carrying certain crystals and with placing them around the home/workplace for your wellbeing.
Crystal Therapy involves an energetic treatment aspect and a therapy aspect;
The therapy aspect used is Psychic Aura Reading if you come for a 60 minute session, or Holistic Counselling and/or Heal Your Life® Life Coaching and/or Psychic Aura Reading if you come for a 90 minute session. This is to ensure that the most appropriate crystals are chosen for your needs.
The energetic treatment aspect of crystal therapy combines the use of crystal therapy tools such as; high-grade jewellery quality crystals to be placed on the body. Crystal wands for psychic surgery, clearing, balancing and charging the aura and chakras. Finally, crystal grids may also be constructed around the body. These tools are used to direct crystal energy on and around the body to amplify your energetic field and influence positive change to mind, body, spirit and emotions.
Each crystal has a specific, constant vibration which is stronger than our own energetic field (aura).
Each variety of crystal (eg. clear quartz, amethyst) has it's own unique vibrational qualities which effect us in specific ways. For example rose quartz assists us with forgiveness, compassion and love.
When crystals are laid on and around our body in a crystal therapy session, they begin to effect our own energetic field and chakras (as the vibration is stronger and more constant than our own), so that we receive and respond to the vibrational qualities of the particular crystals used. For example, to find forgiveness, let go of anxiety, reduce stress levels.
This is a truly personalised experienced where you may come out feeling amazing. Why? Because your aura, chakras, mind, body and emotions are balanced according to crystals that have been chosen especially for you.
