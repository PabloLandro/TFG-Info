News - Ginger and B6 may help mums-to-be
By Holly Taylor BSc (Hons) DipCNM MBANT
Nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms experienced in early pregnancy. Approximately 70–85% of pregnant women experience nausea and half will also experience vomiting episodes. While the cause of morning sickness is still not known, a recent scientific trial suggests that both ginger and vitamin B6 may help mums-to-be manage morning sickness.
During the double-blind, controlled trial, 70 pregnant women with nausea were randomised to receive either 1g per day of ginger or 40mg per day of vitamin B6 for four days. The participants were then asked to grade the severity of their nausea and keep a log of the number of vomiting episodes during the 24 hours before supplementation and during the four treatment days.
The results are very promising, with supplementation helping to decrease the number of vomiting episodes in both groups equally. What’s more, both supplements had a positive effect on nausea. In the ginger group, 29 out of 35 women reported an improvement in nausea symptoms and 23 out of 34 women reported improvements in the vitamin B6 group.
