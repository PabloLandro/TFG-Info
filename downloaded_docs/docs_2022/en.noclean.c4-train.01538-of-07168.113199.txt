Take a senna based laxative tablet each night before bed time and you should get relief within a few days. Try to prevent constipation by eating plenty of fibre in your diet and drink plenty of fluids ( but not too many or you'll live on the loo!) Haemorrhoids are a pain in the butt !

HI Econn Here are some ideas to heal the issue. Drink a gallon of water a day (I do) to start moving out excess waste (colon) and toxins that are in the blood. Also, be sure to do a colon cleanse to help resolve the issue. Cause Hemorrhoids are often the result of poor diet, constipation or a sluggish bowel, straining during bowel movements, chronic low-level dehydration, lack of exercise, and/or a sedentary lifestyle. Correcting these factors can be very helpful in preventing and eliminating hemorrhoids. Caution: Bleeding during bowel movements needs to be checked to rule out other more serious conditions. If you experience blood in your stool, seek immediate medical attention. --------------------------------------... Natural Cures Aromatherapy: Cypress, juniper, frankincense, or niaouli. Ayurveda: Drink 1/2 cup of aloe vera juice three times daily until symptoms clear. The Ayurvedic herbal compound triphala is also very effective for relieving hemorrhoid pain and for promoting the overall health of the gastrointestinal tract. Diet: Eat an organic, whole foods diet that emphasizes high-fiber foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables (especially dark green, leafy vegetables, such as kale), grains such as brown rice and millet, and lean, organic meats and poultry. Also drink plenty of healthy beverages, such as herbal teas, fresh squeezed juice, and pure, filtered water. Flower Essences: Rescue Remedy Cream® can be applied to external hemorrhoids to ease symptoms. Herbs: The aptly named herb pilewort is a staple treatment for hemorrhoids in Europe because of its effectiveness in reducing hemorrhoid symptoms. Collinsonia is another highly effective herbal remedy for hemorrhoids. As a topical application, mix 10 ml of collinsonia tincture with 80 ml of distilled witch hazel and apply this combination after every bowel motion and as needed. Other useful herbs include bilberry, buckthorn bark, butcher`s broom, comfrey root, gotu kola, parsley, passionflower, and stone root. Homeopathy: Aloe, Hamamelis, Nux vom., Berberis, Acidum fluor., and Thuja are helpful homeopathic remedies. Juice Therapy: The following juice combinations can help keep the bowels regular and soften stools: carrot, spinach, celery, and parsley; carrot and watercress; or beet juice. Nutritional Supplementation: The following nutrients can help prevent and reverse hemorrhoids: vitamin C with bioflavonoids and rutin, vitamin A, beta carotene, vitamin B complex, folic acid, essential fatty acids, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Linseed oil (one teaspoon upon arising and at night) can also be used to help soften stools. Topical Treatment: Apply a combination of zinc oxide, vitamin E, and aloe vera gel or olive oil to the affected area. Witch hazel applied topically can help shrink hemorrhoids, while calendula ointment can help relieve pain and itching. Best of health to you
