What our patients say
I play American football and injured my knee in training. I was able to get a scan with LycaHealth the very next day and was able to use my private medical insurance. The whole process was exceptionally easy, and the receptionist on the phone was clear with providing me with the instructions for what I needed to do, like arrive 10 minutes beforehand and complete a registration form. The scan itself was quick and effortless. All in all I was in the scanner for about 25 minutes. The radiographer was lovely, made me feel comfortable and explained the whole journey from start to finish. The facilities were amazing – brand new and very stylish. I would recommend my team mates to go there (as we get injured every week)!

Frequently asked questions
How much does an MRI scan cost?
An MRI scan cost varies depending on different factors. If you are self-pay patient, MRIs start from £300 depending on how many body parts are required, or whether contrast involved.
LycaHealth is accredited by ALL major insurance companies. If you have health insurance you can call your insurance company, let them know which clinician has referred you and the type of MRI they have requested. Your insurance company will then generate an authorisation code.
If you would like a quote, please send your referral form to us for a quote with no obligations to book.
For more information please call our team on 0207 132 14400207 132 1440, or email enquiries@lycahealth.com
£300* offer applies to Orpington only. MRIs start from £550 for one part at LycaHealth Canary Wharf
How long does an MRI take?
An MRI scan can take anywhere from 15-90 minutes. Timings will alter depending on the size and location of the area scanned and information required. Your radiographer will tell you how long you should expect your scan to last at the beginning of the procedure.
How does an MRI scan work?
An MRI scan works using a magnetic field which pulls the protons in the body’s cells into alignment. The MRI sends out short bursts of radio waves which disrupt the protons. The MRI sensors then detect the energy released as the protons realign to the magnetic field.
What happens during an MRI?
During an MRI scan you will be required to lie on a flat bed which is then moved into the scanner, either head or feet first. Patients are able to communicate with the radiographer via intercom during the procedure. During the scan you’ll be required to stay very still. A friend or relative may accompany you if you feel nervous about the procedure.
What does an MRI do to your body?
An MRI scan is painless and safe; extensive research shows that magnetic fields or radio waves do not pose any risk. Some people with implants will be unable to have the procedure. For example, those with pacemakers and, usually, pregnant women.
Does having an MRI hurt?
Having an MRI scan is painless. If you suffer with claustrophobia there is the option to have a sedative. Young children and babies are often given a general anaesthetic to ensure that they stay still during the MRI scan.
What do you have to do before an MRI?
Before an MRI scan you must tell your healthcare provider about any conditions that could prevent you from having the scan. For example, if you have a pacemaker or are pregnant. There will be different criteria in terms of what you can eat or drink prior to the scan depending on the specific nature of your procedure. Before the MRI scan you must remove any metal objects, including jewellery, dentures and hearing aids.
How is the LycaHealth 3T MRI scanner different to others?
A 3T MRI scanner has a more powerful magnetic field strength. A 3T scanner, because of its increased signal strength, will provide clearer, more detailed images in a shorter time. It is especially useful for revealing minute detail.
When can I not have an MRI?
Not being able to have an MRI scan is usually due to some kind of metal object present in the body. Those with pacemakers, metal plates, cochlear implants, artificial joints, dental bridges and surgical staples, amongst other things, will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. MRI scans are not usually recommended for pregnant women. You should also inform your health provider if you have any tattoos as these can also contain traces of metal.
How long does it take to get MRI results?
At LycaHealth we can produce same day results for MRI scans. We can provide you with a disc to take with you or email the results (via secure link) to your referring clinician. Whatever suits you best.
Is MRI scanning safe?
The procedure of the MRI scan is safe. However, the strength of the magnet can cause metal objects to move with force. The examination area, therefore, will be free of loose objects that could cause harm.For your safety, you must remove all metallic belongings prior to the procedure. For some examinations, a contrast dye is injected to enhance images. For this particular procedure, if you have a history of kidney issues, this must be discussed with your healthcare provider prior to treatment.
What’s the difference between MRI and CT scan?
The difference between CT and MRI scans is that a CT scan uses X-ray technology which exposes the patient to small amounts of radiation. An MRI scan uses a magnetic field instead. Differences between abnormal and normal tissue are often clearer with an MRI scan image. An MRI scan can take longer than a CT scan.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. They help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Cookies enable us:

You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of Cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse Cookies, our system will issue Cookies when you log on to our website.
Where we store your personal data
When it reaches us, we then store it on a secure server so that it can only be read by authorised personnel. Although we make every effort to create a secure environment for your Personal Data, LycaHealth cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information that you transmit to LycaHealth by non-secure email.
How we protect your information
Your personal information is safeguarded by the Data Protection Act 1998 (and from 25 May also by the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)) and our internal policies.
The sensitivity of patient information is well understood within LycaHealth (all staff are given training on their duty of confidentiality to you). We keep paper and electronic records securely to prevent unauthorised access in line with current legislation.
Managing the Data
We need to be able to move electronic information between the separate systems that provide information to support your care and the care processes. Data is also extracted and processed to support the operation of the services and monitoring the delivery and management of the services.
When information may be shared and who with
We will only ever share your information if it is in the best interests for your care. We will not disclose any information that identifies you to anyone outside your direct care team without your express permission, unless there are exceptional circumstances such as when there is serious risk of harm to yourself or others or where the law requires it.
Who we may share your information with:
Where the information to be shared is relevant and appropriate to your ongoing direct care with the following:
Other Hospitals
GPs
Other Clinicians
Social care
None of your identifiable information will be shared with non-care organisations except with your explicit consent and this will then be subject to strict agreement about how it will be used.
There may be circumstances where the reasons for disclosure are so important that they override the obligation of confidentiality (e.g. to prevent someone from being seriously harmed). Disclosure may also be required by Court Order or under an Act of Parliament, i.e. there is a statutory or other legal basis for the disclosure. The advice of specialist staff e.g. Caldicott Guardians are also sought prior to making disclosures in the public interest, or where a Court Order or statutory basis is provided as justification.
Section 251
Disclosures may be permitted under section 251 of the NHS Act 2006. This allows the Secretary of State for Health to set aside the common law duty of confidentiality in special circumstances. However even in such special circumstances, rigorous assessment will be undertaken to determine whether there is sufficient justification to allow access to the requested confidential patient information and no such disclosure will be made unless it is deemed entirely justifiable.
Accessing your information
You have the right of access to your own records as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 which, with some exceptions, entitles individuals to a copy of information held about them.
If you would like a copy of the information which we hold about you, please contact our Operational Manager.
It will help us if you can state which Clinic(s) you attended and the approximate dates and type of treatment for which you want to see the record. You must apply in writing, giving your name, address, date of birth and, if you have it, your ID number. Say that you are applying for access to your health records. Please allow up to 40 days for us to process your application.
For providing copies of your medical (paper) records, or x-ray films you may be charged a fee, depending on the work involved.
Keeping information up to date
If you consider that any part of the information held in your record is inaccurate, you can apply to have this corrected. If we agree that the information is incorrect, the alteration will be made. If we are not satisfied that the information is incorrect, a note will be made of the information you consider is inaccurate.
You will be given a copy of either the correction or the note.
Your rights
You can have a say in how LycaHealth uses information about you. If you do not wish personal data to be used or shared in the way that is described, please discuss the matter with us. You have the right to request that your confidential information is not used beyond your own care and treatment and to have your objections considered, and, where your wishes cannot be followed, to be told the reasons, including the legal basis. Where permitted by the applicable laws and regulations, LycaHealth will delete Personal Data upon your written request.

If you are not satisfied with LycaHealth’s response to the complaint, or do not want to approach LycaHealth with a complaint directly, you are able to request an assessment of LycaHealth with the Information Commissioner. The Commissioner investigates complaints at their own discretion, and usually expects the complainant to exhaust LycaHealth’s own complaints procedure first.
If you remain dissatisfied at the conclusion of any review, you may complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office, whose address is:
Information Commissioner’s Office
