Fish Oil Raised my LDL
by Jeanne
(Los Angeles, Calif.)
I have had high cholesterol for years. I am allergic to all the different types of statins.
I also can not tolerate niacin as to stomach problems. Was put on fish oil and today found out that it raised my LDL 24 points.
I don't know what I should do, the fish oil did lower my triglycerides. Need help!!!!

Take flax seed oil instead of fish oil
by: Harriet
I have taken fish oil for 6 months...cholesterol and triglyceride are highest they ever been...now the Dr doubled the dosage for fish oil.
After reading that fish oil can actually raise cholesterol I will not be taking this and going back to my Flex Seed oil.
