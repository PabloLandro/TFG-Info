Burn More Calories by Chewing Gum While Walking!?!

Can weight loss be as simple as walking and chewing gum?
Well, according to a recent report, you can burn extra calories by chewing gum while you walk. However, the metabolism-boosting side effect is pretty much a non-issue for most of us because it looks like the calorie-burning benefit appears to mostly benefit men over the age of 40.
ABC-TV got a lot of mileage out of this “news” report that first aired in late May after appearing in The Journal of Physical Therapy Science.
“Chewing gum isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of weight loss. But with more than 70 percent of adults in the United States overweight or obese, you take good news where you can get it,” notes Dr. Chantel Strachan, a second-year internal medicine resident at the University of Connecticut who works in the ABC News Medical Unit.
You should know by now that exercise and a balanced diet is the most effective way to get healthier and feel better.
But we continue to look for quick fixes. And that brings us back to this study from Japan, which was presented at a medical conference in Europe.
Details, shmetails … all we cared about was the bottom line: Chewing gum while walking may actually help you burn more energy and potentially help with weight loss.
Yes, walking – like any physical activity – burns calories.
“But men over the age of 40 were found to burn almost two additional calories per minute when walking while chewing gum. Women in this study, younger and older, did not have significant changes in their energy expenditure,” Strachan reported.
The doctor – and most other nutrition experts – stopped short of prescribing gum for walkers. More study is needed, they agree.
HuffingtonPost.com noted, “The effects of chewing gum have been studied for decades. A 1999 study in the New England Journal of Medicine called ‘The Energy Expended in Gum Chewing’ found that seated test subjects used 19 percent more energy when they chewed zero-calorie gum. If they did nothing but sit and chew gum, researcher calculated that they would lose 11 pounds at the end of a year.”
Hmmm, I think I am capable of sitting and chewing gum, so sign me up. Meanwhile, I’ll continue using my MealPlanMap.com meal-planning program to ensure I eat healthy no matter what the occasion or location.
We urge you to gum one, gum all and adopt our proven way to drop your pesky extra pounds and improve your health.
