The Benefits of Himalayan Rock Salt – Man Versus Oils Investigates
November 9, 2018	21	By Paul
Ok, this one a little out of left field I know, but I did promise to expand my knowledge on other chemical free options after the great crystal exhibition episode of 2018, so grab a beer, take a seat and come with me on a salty man-journey! Like much of the stuff I write about here, this little post was inspired by my beautiful wife – and a light bulb she wanted me to purchase. This one started with a text as she is currently away working – “Hey, when you are in town today can you see if you can get a bulb for the salt lamp?”. My response… “We have a salt lamp?”.
So after my re-edumancation into the things that we have in our house, I managed to open said lamp, find a bulb and get it replaced – turns out they are at the local health food store… Who knew? And of course, now that my tiny little mind is constantly consumed with what things do in the world of chemical free living – added to the fact that I was too afraid to ask Nic, I decided to have a look into the benefits of Himalayan Rock Salt.

Conclusion
What is it?
Yep it’s salt! It comes from the Khewra region of Northern Pakistan and its pink colour comes from the minerals that are contained within it. This salt is said to be millions of years old and contains trace elements of 84 minerals including potassium, calcium and magnesium.
Now, time to be a little skeptical here… The trace elements are so small that I really struggle to understand how they can be of benefit, I mean if you want potassium, eat a banana. There is also no real discernible difference between natural rock salt and natural sea salt, however the human body does in fact need salt as part of a balanced diet and both types are much much better for you than processed white salt – and let’s face it, natural sea salt looks soooo much better on the side of a margarita glass than the processed stuff!!.
What are the benefits?
Now, before we start, as I do with Essential Oils – and crystals for that matter, I need to be clear here. I am not going to sit here and promote the use of any type of natural salt as a magical cure for every disease known to man. I don’t agree with that and will never try to say otherwise. Unlike the benefits which, again like oils etc. are largely in the eye of the beholder, there are some proven health risks to those with high sodium intakes including high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney failure.
However unless you are piling it onto your nightly steak and veges, it does seem to have some benefits to the human body. These include:
Muscle relaxant and stimulant
Assisting the body in maintaining proper fluid balance and preventing dehydration – we have all seen the sports drink ads
Assisting nervous system impulses
Assisting with the prevention of low blood pressure
Assisting with mood/sleep
How do we use it?
So, in order to gain the manly benefits of this type of salt without the negative effects, you can try the following:
Salt Lamp
Salt lamps are claimed to improve the air quality of your home and are created by carving a large chunk of salt out of the mine, gouging a hole in the bottom and inserting an electrical light socket and plug – well that is the simple process anyway. Their use is even simpler, make sure there is a bulb in it, plug it in and switch it on.
I use the term ‘claimed’ as I have not been able to find any proof that they do this but proponents will tell you that as they absorb water and particles from the air, taking positive ions with them. The heated salt then releases water vapor back into the air leaving the impurities on the lamp. They also then expel negative ions. This process is supposed to leave the air clean and pure leading to improved sleep and a clearer, calmer and more focused mood.
Ummmmmm…. we use one, it is essentially on all day. I have to be honest, I have to put it in the category of if you feel it making a difference, then it probably is. It does look nice at night though. If you suffer from allergies etc. then I would probably give it a try!
Salt Bath
Back when I wrote about manly uses for lavender essential oils, I did mention for those of us who are a little more comfortable within ourselves that a lavender bath might be worth a go. If you tried it and loved it, then I have a treat for you. I didn’t love the lavender bath – of course I had to try it for research’ sake but I am not a fan of baths. But after a hard game of indoor soccer or a busy day on the beach, or any other manly stuff like, you know, working, a salt bath is the bomb (no pun intended)!!!
Again, I am not sure there is any real health benefit as such, however these baths will make you feel like a new man… For a good old salt bath you will need:
A bathtub (obviously)
2 – 4 Pink Himalaya Salt rocks
Water
Anything else you need to make the whole thing a little more manly such as:
Sports Magazine
Man drink and nachos
TV (you know a TV in the bathroom is a good idea)
Fill the bathtub, add your Himalayan salt rocks and stir until the salt is mostly dissolved. Then submerge as much of your body as you can for around 20-30 minutes.
As one man to another… if your body is stiff and sore… do this, you will not regret it, and will probably even tell your mates how good it is!
Epsom salts – Epsom salts are not actually a salt but rather a pure mineral compound of magnesium sulfate in crystal form. It is not salt as it has no sodium chloride. It looks like salt, can smell like salt but, unlike the duck, is not salt. That aside, if you are a little low on the old pink Himalayan rock salt this week, you can substitute the old Epsom salts for a fairly good result.
Cooking
Salt does get a bit of a bad rub in the dietary world. However, scientists have long outlined some very strong benefits of eating salt – which is the only reason I am mentioning it – if it is proven in science, then I will talk about it. As I said earlier, this does not apply to processed table salt, rather natural sea salt or natural Himalayan rock salt. I mentioned some benefits at the start of this post, below is some of the extra benefits to be had by eating moderate amounts of natural salt:
Improved vascular health and blood circulation
Improved respiratory and lung function
A stable pH balance of your cells
A lowered blood pressure
However, these benefits are only recognised as part of a controlled diet – and by this I mean healthy foods in moderation – too much salt in your diet will have the reverse effects of these benefits. To reduce blood pressure and lower the risk of heart disease, the Australian Heart Foundation recommends adults eat less than 5g of salt (2000mg of sodium) a day. That’s less than a teaspoon a day.
There’s no salt is buffalo wings right? anyone?
Himalayan Salt Plate
Ok, so this one has no benefit at all, I just wanted to add some manliness to this post. Now I ask you what man doesn’t want to find a way to impress his mates with a little out of left field salt cooking. A salt plate is a big flat lump of very hard rock salt that can be heated on the grill, or in the oven and then used to cook meat, seafood or anything else to add a little bit of a salty flavour to it.
They can also be chilled and used as a flavour enhancement to your manly fruit and cheese platters, seafood platters or even some deli meats…
I haven’t used one, and in the interest of full disclosure, didn’t know they existed until now but I might have to give one a bit of a go at some stage. Will keep you posted. Oh and ladies, if you are reading this – it is coming up to Christmas so *cough cough* Gift idea *cough*.
Conclusion
So there you have it, a simple request to change a light bulb and this is what you get. A long-winded exchange into a product that in terms of real health benefits I am still more than a little skeptical about in regards to salt lamps but comfortable with in terms of consumption. The bath does feel good though. Now, must go as I have to turn the salt lamp on, pour a glass of red and run me a man-bath!
Have fun!
Paul

This is a great article Paul. I have heard about Himalayan salt but I did not know all its benefits for our body. I will for sure introduce it in my nutrition primarily because it is a muscle relaxant and stimulant. thank you for revealing to us this awesome salt that has nice benefits.

Hey Paul! I am so pleased to see a dude embracing these ideas and writing posts about them. I just recently did some research for a post I did on the benefits of sea salt on the skin after a sweet dip in the ocean and I was fascinated and grateful to gain the knowledge and insights you provide here as the pink crystals that have all the minerals that give them there colour has actually inspired me to want to travel to its origin in North Pakistan and scope it out. I am an avid bath taker and always seeking a more natural element that can enhance my well being and having gained this information from you, I am keen to learn more. Thank you so much and keep up the great work! Cheers!

This is a good and entertaining overview of Himalayan rock salt and it’s uses. I have been using this pink salt in my cooking for a while now and love the flavor. it is much better and better for you than just plain ole processed table salt. I loved the humor in your writing

Hey Paul,
I like the looks of the Himalayan Rock salt lamps and if they do produce the aromatic and health benefits, what a bonus. I agree with you on the disease curing, the salt lamp was not meant to do that, oh well.
Christmas is coming up and there are so many different styles of the lamps and low priced that you could order a bunch of them and give them to your friends for Christmas without spending the bank. I am sure this will be a popular gift and re-gift.
A note on the salt yes we do need a pinch of salt a day for health benefits like you mentioned. One other note there are so many microplastics floating around that guess what they have snuck there way into processed salt.
As for salt in the Buffalo wings? My answer is whatever you add into the Buffalo Wings for example a pinch of salt, Chilli sauce, BBQ sauce, and pepper.
Some trivia for you, scientists have actually found microplastics in our feces, not sure if it comes form the salt.
I am sure the salt plate will some how add salt flavoring to whatever you are going to cook up on it. Let us know how that works out.
Really appreciate the information on the salt lamp and salt accessories.
Thanks.

I stumbled upon this post on salt and it is something I am fervent about. As you’ve pointed out, Himalyan salt is healthier than regular salt. I am of the mind that NO ONE should be using refined salt! Salt should ALWAYS be unrefined so it has all trace minerals intact. Many doctors are coming to the realization that while sodium found in regular refined salt can raise blood pressure, un refined salt as in himalyan salt (also Redmond salt) is very very good for the heart! I laughed when you mentioned that you didn’t know your home had a salt lamp! LOL! I asked for one and my husband bought me one for my birthday a couple of years ago.
I have many airborne allergies, and I have to say that those allergies really did improve and become less intense after I had the lamp going. By the way, these lamps should be left on all the time to do their ‘work’, so you may not want it in your bedroom. We have ours in the open concept living room/dining/kitchen area of our home. It acts like a night light too when I need to visit the kitchen area during the night. They really are beautiful all by themselves, even without health benefits. We use the ground up himalyan salt, or Redmond salt liberally in all our cooking and to season our plates of food as needed. So much tastier than regular salt too! I would describe it as a sweeter milder saltiness. While you many not want to push this salt on anyone, I will LOL!
Everyone…. put away your regular salt and replace it with himalyan salt, for taste and for health. Regarding the lamps, choose the larger ones, a small one does not have much impact on air quality unless it’s a very tiny room!

Hello Paul,
I have not heard of the Himalayan salt before but after reading your blog I did some research and it seems to be quite popular. I think I’ll just like to use for a warm bath especially after playing soccer with the boys. I did read that it could help calm tensed body muscles, don’t know how true this is.
Not a bad product to try, seeing that it doesn’t cost so much.
Thanks for sharing this, warm regards.

Smiles, it was a salty man-journey indeed,
This is whole new stuff for me, and at the same time, it was quite interesting, 84 minerals is a big deal.
Thanks for sharing all the options, benefits and uses. Cooking seems to be familiar part for me though.
Have fun Paul, it’s truly been an enlightening read

Paul, I almost felt guilty for wanting to tread into this post’s little man world. I was really looking for more information about the claimed benefits of salt lamps. They look cool. Yet, like with many other ionizer devices that are supposed to clean the air; I have not figured out how to know if they are really working. Your post gives me a level of comfort of knowing that I may never really know if you don’t know.
I have learned more about Himalayan rock salt than I ever expected to know. I probably should replace the table salt with this type of salt. Thank you.

Hi Sondra – haha, I write for men but certainly love it when I attract female readers. Something my wife is certainly trying to encourage for sure.
Changing your table salt is something I would certianly recommend if you are using processed whist salt.
Thanks so much for stopping by

Very intriguing. Reading through the article, I got dumbfounded at the strange work the salt lamp does. I’ve never heard anything regarding this. The salt bath is no exception. I am very curious to try it out right now and I am very sure I will order for mine and feed you back with my findings.

Man you are funny! I enjoy reading your post lol I have a question, do you thing the Himalayan salt lamp will help with the mold in the basement? I have converted my basement into an entertainment room, I do find mold a lot lately, if you let that grow, you are doomed. Just trying to find the solution. Anyways, I have never thought of using Himalayan salt for a bath before. After reading your post I am going to give it a try 😉

Haha Nuttanee, thanks. Salt lamps do dry out the air a little so it might help in keeping it at bay. Check out this post I wrote on Mould, Just try a little vinegar to get rid of it to start with.
Hope this helps
Paul
