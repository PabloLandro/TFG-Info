Have you seen the rare white Himalayan salt lamps before?
Weâ€™ve been hearing for the last few years all the benefits of Himalayan salt lamps but this is the first time Iâ€™ve seen the rare white Himalayan salt lamps, they look amazing. About So Well
What is a Himalayan Salt Lamp, you ask? The Himalayan Salt Crystal Lamp is an organic natural air purifier. Although it is a captivating lamp, it does so much more than provide you with a light source. It invigorates you, energizes you, refreshes you, recharges you and soothes you.
Salt Crystal Lamps are also used to aid in restful sleep and to combat EMF pollution from home electronics. These lamps also improve respiratory function. They are a natural way to enhance wellness.
The Salt Heart Massage Stone is smooth and designed to help those who have dry skin conditions, such as eczema. The stone is anti-bacterial and all-natural, crafted from an array of 84 minerals. That is impressive!
The Salt Heart Massage Stone can also be used as an all natural deodorant. The stone provides disinfecting and odor neutralizing qualities that prevent germs and odor-causing bacteria. To learn more about So Well products, you may read Aprilâ€™s full review.

Well being Ive had so much time to think. I been hoping to see a giveaway for one of these because they say they have healing properties. I came down with the big BC last year. I cant see it can hurt to get one because of the chance is high Ill get it back. Well if they hadnt allowed them to purposely poison us then we wouldnt be needing to search out things to help save our lives (when thier purposely with holding medicine that very well cure cancer) So I dont have much to go on but things like this and I thank you for having such a giveaway and it does help the winner feel great everyday. Im telling you throughout all this Ive learned the strangest things can truely help. Im a believer

I have a bit of trouble sleeping, especially in complete darkness. One of these lamps would create the perfect amount of light for me, and it would help me sleep better. Plus, these are gorgeous!

My son has one and loves it. Iâ€™d like to see if it helps here.
