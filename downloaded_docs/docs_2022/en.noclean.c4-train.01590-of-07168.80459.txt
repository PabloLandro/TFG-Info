Top 3 Nutrients For Overall Health
When it comes to overall health and wellbeing, there are a few critical nutrients the body needs. These nutrients will give your system the nec- essary building blocks for health and vitality. So, whether you are looking to start a healthy lifestyle or just want to maintain where you are, these three nutrients will do the trick!
1. Vitamin D
Ever wonder why health experts recommend vitamin D supplements? Or why so many foods and drinks are fortified with vitamin D3? Also known as the sunshine vitamin, this nutrient influences over 2,000 genes in the human body. It's produced in your skin with mild sun exposure, or obtained from food and supplements. This fat-soluble vitamin regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption, supports lung function, and stabilizes insulin levels. It also promotes healthy immune function and keeps your bones strong.
Want to find out more? Here are the most important health benefits of vitamin D:
Helps Build Stronger Bones †
Children who don’t get enough vitamin D are at risk for rickets, a health condition that causes softening of the bones. Adults with vitamin D deficiency are more likely to develop osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and fractures. This nutrient supports bone health by increasing calcium absorption into your system. Maintaining an adequate vitamin D intake may reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by aging.
Protects Against Heart Disease †
Vitamin D has a protective effect on your heart and may help prevent high blood pressure, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. According to researchers, this nutrient reduces the production of renin, a hormone that contributes to the onset of high blood pressure. Vitamin D has been also shown to improve circulation and regulate blood sugar, leading to better cardiovascular health.
Prevents Breast Cancer †
A study published in 2009 indicates that 70 percent of breast cancer patients have vitamin D deficiency’s. When vitamin D levels reach 40 ng/mL, the risk of breast cancer can drop by over 30 percent! This nutrient appears to be particularly beneficial for preventing cancer in postmenopausal women. It also fights oxidative damage and promotes DNA repair, which further reduces cancer risk.
Improves Mental Health †
People with high levels of vitamin D are less likely to develop psychiatric disorders. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), and depression. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, vitamin D supplements may even help lower the risk of multiple sclerosis and ease symptoms.
Assists In Weight Loss †
Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation promotes weight loss and reduces fat mass. In a recent study, dieters who took daily calcium and vitamin D supplements lost more weight compared to the placebo group. If you want to shed pounds, this nutrient can help. It not only supports fat loss, but also helps reduce obesity-related disorders, such as high blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia.
Deficiency Warning Signs
Statistics indicate that 40 to 75 percent of people worldwide are vitamin D deficient. Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels (50 to 80 ng/mL) in the blood helps reduce mortality and prevent chronic diseases. Low levels of vitamin D in the body have been linked to: †
Chronic inflammation,
Decreased bone density,
Cardiovascular problems, and
Cancer
Stress fractures,
Muscle pain,
Tiredness
Osteoporosis
Even though it’s not fully understood how vitamin D works in the body, researchers agree that this nutrient is vital for health and well-being. It influences nearly every cell in your body, helps your bones absorb calcium, and protects from free radicals. To boost your vitamin D intake, consider taking supplements or eat more salmon, mackerel, tuna, egg yolks, cheese, and organ meats.
2. Fish Oil
Fish oil is one of the most popular supplements on the market, and for good reason. Rich in monounsaturated fats, it fuels your body and supports cardiovascular health. Diabetics take fish oil to keep their blood sugar levels stable. Athletes use it to fight inflammation and recover faster from training. Seniors who take fish oil have stronger bones and manage arthritis pain more easily.
The human body can not produce DHA and EPA, the most important fatty acids. Thus, they need to be obtained from food. Fish oil is an excellent source of omega-3s and comes in a convenient pill or liquid form. From reduced risk of heart disease to sharper cognitive function, its benefits are amazing. Let's go over the top reasons why you should take fish oil and how it benefits your health:
Relieves Arthritis Pain †
Studies indicate that fish oil is just as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief, but without unwanted side effects. This supplement not only relieves pain, but also lowers inflammation in the joints and tissues. It's particularly good for arthritis patients, athletes, and people with inflammatory conditions.
Supports Healthy Cholesterol Levels †
Fish oil supplements reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL (good) cholesterol. The FDA has actually approved fish oil as an alternative treatment for high cholesterol. This nutrient helps reduce heart disease risk and improves cardiovascular health in as little as one month!
Fights Depression †
The omega-3 essential fats in fish oil may relieve anxiety, depression, mental fatigue, and nervous disorders. According to Dr. Michelle Price Judge, this supplement may help protect women from post-partum depression and lift their mood. Other studies have found that fish oil improves depressive-like, anxiety-like, and cognitive behaviors in mice. These findings can be applied to humans as well.
Prevents Cancer †
A growing body of research suggests that fish oil can even prevent breast, colon, and prostate cancers. It also increases the effectiveness of conventional cancer drugs and speeds up healing. A 2013 study has shown that fish oil supplements inhibit cancer cell growth and reduce inflammation while minimizing the side effects of chemotherapy.
Supports Eye Health †
According to health experts, fish oil supplements protect people from age-related vision loss, cataracts, and macular degeneration. They may also reverse age-related eye disorders and improve vision. Research shows that people with omega-3 deficiency have a greater risk of eye diseases.
Deficiency Warning Signs
Omega-3 essential fatty acids are crucial to your health. Even the slightest deficiency can affect muscle and bone function, brain health, blood pressure, and mood. Low levels of omega-3s in the body have been linked to: †
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease
Poor memory
Chronic fatigue
Depression
Infertility
Impaired immune function.
Dry Skin, hair and nails
Painful Joints
Memory “Fog”
Crave Fatty Foods
This nutrient is available in supplement form (as fish oil), but also occurs naturally in certain foods, such as tuna, salmon, and other cold water fish. Be sure that your fish oil is from 100% wild caught fish to insure quality and health benefits. Whether you want to keep your heart healthy, lose weight, ward off cognitive issues or just create a healthier you, fish oil can help!
3. Multivitamin
Looking to improve your health? Want more energy and stamina? Or maybe you wish to last longer in the gym? If so, take a daily multivitamin. This supplement should come first on your list. Designed to prevent nutrient deficiencies, multivitamins support optimal health and well-being. Some increase longevity and enhance immune function. Others contain nutrients that boost sports performance and speed up recovery.
Let's take a closer look at the top health benefits of multivitamins:
Fuels Your Body †
The modern diet lacks essential vitamins and minerals. Many foods lose valuable nutrients during processing. Additionally, it's hard to track your daily intake of micronutrients. A quality multivitamin can protect you from nutrient deficiencies and provide your body with the fuel needed to function properly. In general, these products contain vitamins and minerals that fight free radicals, support immune function, promote healthy skin, and regulate hormone production.
Reduces Stress †
Research suggests that taking a daily multivitamin can make you more resilient to stress. B-complex vitamins are particularly helpful for those dealing with stress, anxiety, depression, and irritability. Certain nutrients found in multivitamin formulas cause your brain to produce more dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and other chemicals that improve stress response and boost mental health.
Prevents Birth Defects †
Pregnant and breastfeeding women have higher nutrient requirements. A daily multivitamin can make it easier to meet your nutrient needs during pregnancy. This product may help prevent birth defects, low birth weight, and congenital anomalies in the baby. Ideally, look for prenatal multivitamins with higher levels of folate, niacin, iron, zinc, magnesium, and calcium.
Lowers Your Risk of Cancer †
Some vitamins, such as folic acid and vitamin D, play a key role in cancer prevention. When consumed as part of a balanced diet, they lower your risk of colon, breast, lung, and stomach cancer. Recent evidence shows that multivitamins can reduce cancer risks by as much as eight percent!
Wards Off Infections †
According to science, regular use of multivitamins by the elderly can help prevent infectious diseases. Depending on the ingredients used, these supplements may strengthen your immune system and ward off infections. Vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and folic acid enhance your natural defense mechanisms, destroy free radicals, and support cell regeneration. These factors combined improve your body’s ability to fight bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens that may cause disease.
Deficiency Warning Signs
The hidden cause of muscle aches, migraines, fatigue, and recurring infections could be nutrient deficiencies. A diet that's low in calcium and vitamin D puts you at risk for osteoporosis, arrhythmia, and impaired muscle function. Potassium deficiency leads to constipation, electrolyte imbalances, muscle cramps, and weakness. If you’re biotin deficient, you may experience hair loss, brittle nails, and dull skin. A deficiency of magnesium is likely to cause tingling, numbness, seizures, depression, coronary spasms, and mood swings. †
Choose a quality multivitamin that goes beyond the recommended daily allowance for most nutrients. Our formula contains vitamins and minerals as well as amino acids and antioxidants that scavenge free radicals. Being non gmo and gluten free, we have used only the best ingredients to help ensure you optimal health.
