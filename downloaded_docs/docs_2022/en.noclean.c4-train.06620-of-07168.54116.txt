Maintenance for my Himalayan Salt Lamp
​﻿The Himalayan Salt Lamps are maintenance free but there are a couple of thing we want to know about them. I had gotten many comments about that the Himalayan Salt Lamps "leak water" or would make a poodle around them. That in fact may happen in very humid areas or humid days and only if they are off. I always recommend to have them light up, so they are constantly working and this will not happen in 99% of those cases.
The other question is, How do I change the Light bulb? What type of light bulb dose it use?
The light bulb is a 15 watt ligh that you can get at any hardware store, or you can order them from us:
