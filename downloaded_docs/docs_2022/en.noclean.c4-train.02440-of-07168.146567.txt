No connection between cancer and cell phones, experts argue

In May the World Health Organization published a report that said cell phones are “possibly carcinogenic.” Last month The Economist published a different report suggesting it simply wasn’t possible for the radio waves emitted by a cell phone to cause cells to mutate. Now, another group of research experts from Britain, the United States, and Sweden — who have studied the WHO report — are also arguing that there’s no connection between cell phones and cancer. “Although there remains some uncertainty, the trend in the accumulating evidence is increasingly against the hypothesis that mobile phone use can cause brain tumors in adults,” the group said in a recent report published in Environmental Health Perspectives. According to Reuters, a number of other studies have also been unable to find a link between increases in brain tumors and cell phones in the 10 years since cell phones have become commonplace. “This is a really difficult issue to research,” David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge told Reuters. Spiegelhalter was not part of the study but said that it’s “clear that any risk appears to be so small that it is very hard to detect — even in the masses of people now using mobile phones.”

They can’t, they have cell phone rumors in that specific critical decision region.

Cell phones cause cancer.. YES OR NOT?????????

Stay calm. The WHO “study” that started this was no study at all. Not even a metaanalysis of previous research findings. It was a bunch of important Doctors all saying “yes, we think it could cause cancer”. While it is nice that they think so (and my suspicion is that someone needed a grant renewed), it is largely irrelevant. The hallmark of science is replication of results and findings and there are not serious studies showing a casual link, let alone a statistical link, with cancer and cell phones. Cell phone usage has really only been heavy in the last 12 years or so, so it is possible that with more exposure over a longer period of time that it may become more clear. If you are worried about it, use a wired earpiece/microphone and then the phone won’t be next to your head.

What about other cancers?

only android phones cause cancer

At least Android phones have signal, unlike a certain other phone (*hint: Apple makes it*).
And yes people, I realize the phone has reception, not transmission issue. It’s just a joke.

i think it’s shades of gray. how many cigarettes does it take to cause a cell change? who the f*ck knows – nobody can answer this. it’s prolly better to use a headset for the long calls (anything over 5-10 min?) that’s kind of my rule of thumb. i usually feel like the longer calls leave my head buzzing if I don’t use the headset.

I argue that the influx of radio transmissions, power lines, etc over the past 100 years has led to so many getting cancer…I am no expert.
sirpaul
More likely is that all the chemicals in todays supermarket and fast food stores give us cancer. Radio waves and power lines don’t give cancer unless you are hugging the transformer. There are plenty radio waves from space (and the Sun) alone and nobody complains about that (skin cancer is caused by UV rays, not radio waves – big big difference!).

Powerlines? Take a look a the incidence of cancer among linemen. Studies have shown No statistical correlation. I have friends who have been linemen all their adult lives. At times when repairing 250,000 volt transmission lines they have the line in their hands. If anyone would get cancer from power lines, one might imagine it would be them.

It’ll be the kiddies who get the tumours first…

I dont get it… So it does ? or not ?
My question will be so will the CDMA or TDMA cause more harmful ? or UMTS signal ?
Oh wait… We have Cell towers everywhere and there is one on top of this building… what you have mifi at home ? wow we are doom!!!! Huh what Verizon have all nation cover ? so they have the most strong signal ? so its more radiation ? I’m so confused.. may be I have something growing in my head….
