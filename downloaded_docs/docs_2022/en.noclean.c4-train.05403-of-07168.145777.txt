Bladder Infections: UTI Causes, Symptoms, Treatments
When a specific type of bacteria is isolated, antibiotics may then be changed to those that are more active against that particular bacterial type. If the bacteria shows resistance unresponsive to the antibiotic that was initially prescribed, then the antibiotic is changed promptly to one that the organism is susceptible to in order to cure the kidney infection. Home treatment with oral antibiotics and adequate water and fluid intake are usually sufficient for curing uncomplicated kidney infection and urinary tract infection.
Nondrug home treatment with fluid intake, cranberry products, or acupuncture without antibiotics is not advisable for kidney infections. However, if symptoms are severe uncontrolled nausea and vomiting resulting in inability to take medications or the infection is difficult to control with the routine oral medications for kidney infection, then hospitalization may be required to receive intravenous antibiotics, intravenous hydration, and aggressive management of symptoms.
In cases of complicated kidney infection hospitalization may also be necessary. Self-medication for kidney infection is considered only in patients with mild, recurrent urinary infections. In individuals who are reliable and familiar with the symptoms of kidney infection, appropriate antibiotics prescribed to them in advance by their treating physicians may be started at the onset of their symptoms. There is no scientific data to suggest that avoiding any type of food while suffering from a kidney infection is harmful or beneficial.
However, it is important to note that severe nausea and vomiting as well as poor appetite can occur with kidney infection. Therefore, it may be difficult to maintain adequate food and liquid requirements for patients with kidney infection, as this may lead to dehydration and worsening weakness. The treating physician may prescribe medications to treat these symptoms. Some natural remedies for kidney and urinary tract infection, cranberry and cranberry juice, may have a role in reducing the risk of future kidney infections.
This approach seems to be more useful as a preventative measure than actual treatment. The main approach to prevention of kidney infection is proper hygiene. Because the majority of infections tend to happen due to the presence of bacteria entering the urinary tract from the urethra, proper personal hygiene plays a theoretical importance in preventing urinary infections. For example, in women, wiping the genital area from front to back after going to the bathroom may significantly prevent bacteria around the anus or vagina to gain access to the urethra.
Hygienic use of bath tubs and douching may also have a preventive role, but is not universally supported by clinical experts. Because sexual intercourse is another risk factor for kidney infection, it is advised to empty the bladder urinate after sexual activity to drain bacteria that may have entered the bladder. This practice, however, is not overwhelmingly proven by available clinical data and not recommended by some experts. Preventive antibiotic therapy can sometimes be helpful in women who have recurrent UTIs more than 3 to 4 times per year.
This could be guided by presence of symptoms suggestive of an infection or after sexual intercourse if infections are temporally associated with sexual intercourse. Preventive prophylactic antibiotics are also recommended for patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures when bacteria are detected in screening urine culture. Daily application of topical intravaginal inside the vagina estriol cream may reduce episodes of symptomatic UTI and kidney infection in postmenopausal women.
On the contrary, oral estrogen did not significantly reduce episodes of UTI in these women. Cranberry and cranberry juice or other cranberry products may have benefit in preventing urinary infections as demonstrated in some, but not all, research studies.
Other important measures may apply to special situations. For example, in individuals for indwelling bladder catheters, it is important that the catheter is changed routinely under the guidance of a physician. The area around the catheter, especially where it enters the urethra, should be monitored and cleaned routinely.
In patients with kidney infection who also have kidney stones, the stone may serve as a potential focus of infection that can spread to the rest of the urinary system. Therefore, these patients may be referred to a specialist urologist for evaluation and possible removal of the stone s to prevent future urinary infections.

Movement of the fetus that is felt by an examiner - A woman can sense her baby move insider her womb when she is about 16 — 20 weeks pregnant, but an examiner can only feel these at about 20 — 24 weeks. Fetal felt by an examiner are considered as more reliable than those that are subjective and can only be perceived by the mom.

For most women, breastfeeding while pregnant is a fine choice and will not harm either baby-- the one in your arms or the one growing inside. Many mothers not only continue nursing during pregnancy but continue "tandem nursing" after the new baby is born —breastfeeding both children at once.
As part of the let-down reflex related to milk production, the uterus contracts in response to the oxytocin released, so breastfeeding while pregnant may put high-risk mothers in danger of miscarriages.
If the woman has a history of preterm labor, bleeding, or uterine pain, it might be wise to stop breastfeeding as a precautionary measure. If the mother is not high-risk, then breastfeeding is generally safe during pregnancy. Of course, should a woman decide to breastfeed while pregnant, she will want to make some adjustments.
Nutrition will be extremely important. Three people—the growing fetus, the breastfeeding child, and the mother—will need adequate nutrition, and dietary adjustments should be made to address the needs of all three.
The diet should have more fruits and vegetables and an adequate balance of carbohydrates and proteins. Nutritional supplements like prenatal vitamins should be taken regularly. In addition to a balance diet and prenatal vitamins, the mother should add to calories to her normal recommended dietary allowance. Approximately of those calories goes to the fetus as it grows in the uterus and from to calories will help her maintain adequate milk production.
Increase calcium as it is needed by both the fetus and the breastfeeding child for growth and development and to avoid potential deficiencies in the mother.
The fetus and nursing child extract a lot of calcium from the mother's body, which could predispose her to more cramps and even hypocalcemia. Drink lots of water. Keep the body hydrated throughout the day to help combat fatigue and ensure proper body processes and overall health of the fetus, child, and mother. Fatigue may be worse than in ordinary pregnancy or in simple breastfeeding.
Much energy is required to maintain the pregnancy and to provide adequate breast milk production. Get enough rest and eat more nutritionally dense foods. Due to increased nipple sensitivity occurs in response to the pregnancy hormones, estrogen and progesterone, the woman's nipples may become sore.
If she's still breastfeeding, she'll need to take extra care of the nipples to reduce nipple soreness. Dryness can cause nipples to become more painful and may even lead to cracking or lead to bacterial infections. Apply nipple shields when breastfeeding, use lanolin cream. As the pregnancy progresses, the nipple soreness and breast tenderness may eventually abate. If the discomforts are too much to handle, it may be time to wean the child. Formula may be used to supplement breast milk and if the child is ready for solid foods, increase these with each feeding.
Emotional attachment may become an issue. Deal with fussing, tantrums, or any negative reactions to weaning in a loving manner. Always assure the child of parental love. Engage in other bonding activities to let the child feel less neglected and more loved.

I have turning to 9 months baby on may 19, I got confused if im pregnant cause last year august my period came but sept until i didnt get my period yet. And my period didn't start till my second born was 10 months. But my period was odd instead of red it was brown, had few clots, few sharp pains, and it only lasted for 3 to 4 days.
Just wanting to know is this normal? Right now I'm having to wait till next month to see if I get one. After completing 60 days of giving birth i started bleeding again while breastfeeding is it normal. In my experience, if you have mastitis and you express the "rest of the milk" it only increases the production of milk, so not good for swollen breasts that are producing to much milk.
What help me was to block feed. I would only offer one breast to the baby at each sitting, and some times 2 or 3 feeding in a row. Then the next ones would be the other breast.
This way, each breast gets a rest, which slows down the production a bit. I have a nine months baby still breastfeeding. I had my menses when she was 6months and a week old,menstrated again the seventh month but the following month no menses till today, please could it be that im pregnant or what?
My baby is 7 mths and exclusively breastfed I haven't menstrated since beginning of previous pregnancy To all of you ladies questioning if you are pregnant Absolutely possible, but not necessarily.
Periods are extremely unpredictable while breastfeeding even if they have seemed to return to a schedule they may not stick to that schedule. However, even if your baby is breastfeeding exclusively you CAN ovulate, and you can absolutely become pregnant. I have a 7 mnth old baby nd last mnth i ddnt c my periods only spotting 4 2days,dis mnth also no periods. Since birth ws on periods every 2 weeks nd nw des nothing.
Im i pregnant again? I have a 4 month baby,i gave bifth on sept. I have a two months old baby I am still breastfeeding. But I recently began to feel pains on my uterus region; dizziness; headaches etc But i recently saw pink spotting and it continued for 2 days.
I have a 6mnths bby who is still breastfeeded and I sometimes feel dizzy and have stomach cramps does that mean I could be pregnant? This article is well written and seemingly informative but implantation bleeding at 6 to 12 weeks makes zero sense. I av a ten month old baby, i started my first period on the 18th. Hi am breasttfeeding my 7months baby and I was supposed to see my period on 25 th until now I didn't see any thing.
And my question is am I pregnant? My period is 5 days late and im bloated and the white mucus has increased. Also diarrea and gas daily. What else other than pregnancy could it be. You can also tell you are pregnant if while nursing if you have sharp pains in your stomach that stop when you stop feeding baby and start when you resume feeding.
The more mothers that breastfeed the better! Anything that helps them along is great. Implantation bleeding happens wayyyy before the weeks mentioned. Did you mean to say days?

The infant is exclusively breastfed. The infant is not more than 6 months old. The infant breastfeeds more than 6 times a day. Each breastfeeding session lasts at least 15 minutes. The mother is still amenorrheic no menstrual flow since giving birth. How Does Breastfeeding Effect Pregnancy? According to Riordan J.: Breastfeeding and Human Lactation, 3rd ed. Breastfeeding Management for the Clinician: Using the Evidence, Common Pregnancy Signs While Breastfeeding Signs of pregnancy while breastfeeding are generally the same as those that are seen in regular pregnancy.
Galactoceles - Galactoceles are small sacs containing milk within the breast. They are large, soft lumps often found at the lower part of the breasts. These are created when the outlets of the milk ducts get blocked. Breastfeeding mothers and those who have recently weaned their babies may develop them.
They usually resolve without the need for any treatment. Galactoceles may or may not be a sign of pregnancy. Cysts - Cysts are fluid-filled lumps caused by changes in hormonal levels. They often have no other accompanying symptoms and only a few of them are painful. Women who are menopausal or nearing menopause are more prone to developing cysts than younger women. Again, cysts are not sure signs of pregnancy, but they may indicate it. Fibroadenomas - Fibroadenomas are solid round lumps that may be moved around the breast.
They can disappear on their own after menstruation, but sometimes, they increase in size during pregnancy. If you notice movable lumps that seem to be growing, you may be pregnant. Lipomas - Lipomas are not caused by pregnancy or hormonal changes, but by excess fats.
They can form on any part of the body containing fat, such as the breasts. It is a condition, which affects 1 in people but a person usually gets only 1 to 2 lipomas on the body. Unlike a cyst or fibroadenoma, a lipoma feels squishy when pressed. Also, a lipoma is deep while a cyst is shallow and near the surface of the skin. Breast Cancer - Most lumps such as cysts, fibroadenomas and lipomas are benign, but some may also be cancerous.
It is not common during pregnancy, but if you notice lumps on your breasts, have them checked by the doctor just to be safe — especially if the lumps are painful and bigger than 2 inches, and if you have a family history of cancer. A lump may be cancerous if it has these features: If it can't be moved around If it's hard If it does not go away after the menstrual period If it develops after menopause The baby's mouth does not attach to the breast properly while breastfeeding.
The infant has problems sucking the breast. The mother does not breastfeed frequently. The child misses feedings — especially at night when the mother is asleep.
The milk is not released regularly, causing the build-up in the ducts. The baby tends to get milk from one breast only.
The breasts got struck and acquired damage to the milk glands and ducts. Clogged milk ducts are treated by the following measures: If possible, feed the baby with only breastmilk and not formula for at least 6 months. Breastfeed when the baby asks for milk, even during odd hours of the night. During the first months, this can be every 2 to 3 hours.
Encourage the baby to drink milk when your breasts are sore. Do not interrupt the baby's feeding — try not to remove the breast; wait for him to release it, instead. If you intend to cut down on feedings, do so gradually to allow the milk glands to adjust. Ensure that the baby is adequately attached to the breast. Try different feeding positions. Massage the painful breast to remove blockages.
Warm the breast with a warm compress or bathe in warm water. Doing so can help soften the milk and dissolve clogs. Express the leftover milk after feedings. Imaging tests and physical exams can determine what causes the uterus to become bigger than normal Quickening Quickening is the fetus' movement felt by the mother. This is a dark line on the abdomen, which appears around the 23rd week of pregnancy. It starts from above the pubic hair and runs straight upwards to the belly button.
Sometimes, a linea alba or light line appears and turns into a linea nigra later on. This is believed to be caused by the effect of hormones to the skin, causing it to create a dark pigment called melanin.
Dark-skinned women are more prone to having this sign. This usually disappears after birth, so if it reappears, it could indicate that you are pregnant again.
Melasma, or also known as chloasma mask of pregnancy , is a condition of having dark patches of skin on the face. Like linea nigra, this is an effect of the hormones on the skin's pigmentation. Melasma can also occur on other parts of the body such as the areola. Although pregnancy hormones cause melasma, other things may also cause the skin to develop dark blotches: More commonly known as stretch marks, striae gravidarum are thin lines on the skin resulting from a growing belly during pregnancy striae means grooves and gravidarum means pregnancy.
Skin develops stretch marks when it grows faster than it can adjust itself. These marks often appear on the baby bump during the third trimester, but they may grow on areas that accumulate fat, such as breasts, hips, thigh, buttocks and lower back.
Weight gain or increasing body size not associated with pregnancy can cause these marks.
