Whole fruit better than juice for reducing diabetes risk: study

BMJ Harvard University Juice
Boston – If you want to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, consume whole fruit rather than fruit juice, concludes a new study from Harvard University.
The study involved more than 187,000 women from three longitudinal studies. All of the participants started out having no major chronic diseases, and 12,198 developed type 2 diabetes over the years. Researchers examined lifestyle and diet factors, and found people who consumed three servings a week of whole blueberries, grapes and apples were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Conversely, people who favored fruit juice were at higher risk for diabetes.
The study was published online Aug. 29 in BMJ.
