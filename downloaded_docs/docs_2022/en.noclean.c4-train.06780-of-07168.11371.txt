Whether losing weight is your new year resolution or you just want to get in shape because you’ve had enough, whatever the reason, the point is to become fit and there is no right time for it. Hence, start today and lose weight effortlessly as summers are just around the corner.
If you feel conventional diets and hardcore exercise routines are not made for you, simply go for the secret tricks to lose all the body flab without anyone noticing. Wondering what those secret tricks are?
Take a look below and be speechless!
1. Talk and Walk!
Why limit your phone calls to sitting behind a desk or relaxing on the couch? Make the most of this habit and lose weight while you enjoy long conversations. Simply be on the run when you speak to your friends and family members on the phone.
Take a walk up and down the stairs, work your legs by walking around your lounge or simply take a walk to the end of the street. Easy right? You will burn calories and the best part is, you won’t even realize it!
2. Chew the Gum!
Love popping a chewing gum in your mouth? While you love the gums because of their unique flavors, trust us, you will love them, even more, when the weight loss secret is revealed!
Chewing a sugar-free gum all day long can boost your metabolic rate by more than 20%, which means you can lose up to 10 pounds per year. Interesting right? Moreover, chewing gum can help get rid of double chin and tone up the jaw line muscles.
3. Hello, Bigger Chunks!
Whereas most researchers suggest how smaller bites can make you feel full sooner, the revelation suggests the opposite when losing weight is in question. How? When you consume bigger chunks of salads or raw fruits on daily basis, you not only trick your brain into eating more but you feel full sooner, meaning you eventually eat less and cut back on calories. Hence, when you make yourself a bowl of assorted salad next time, cut the fruits and veggies into bigger chunks and enjoy losing weight secretly.
4. Pack a Snack!
Don’t you always feel hungry when you see scrumptious meals being served at fast foods and cafes? Well, if you want to lose the excess weight, ditch the fattening foods and eat a homemade snack instead. Simply pack a snack with you when you visit the mall or the shopping center and whenever you feel hungry, bite it away!
5. Supersize the Aqua Intake
Believe it or not, you can lose weight by just drinking water! Adding up to 10 glasses of water in a single day’s routine, you can feel full all day long and ultimately consume fewer calories. Moreover, you can stay active, fresh, hydrated and help your skin revive like never before.
Drinking loads of water can help flush out toxins from the body and also keep the tummy full.
6. Spice it Up!
Consuming spicy meals can actually help you shed weight immensely. While the chili can boost the metabolism at a great rate, it can also help burn fat. Spicy foods are also beneficial as they can curb your appetite and may allow you not to eat sooner. For the ideal spices, add some green chilies, red chili flakes, capsicum, jalapeños and spicy pickles in your diet.
7. Stop Stacking
Stacking junk food items at home such as crisps, chocolates, sweets, candies and what not are merely enemies of fitness. If you want to lose weight, simply stop hoarding them at home. This way, once the unhealthy processed foods will be out of sight, they will be out of mind within a jiffy too!
8. Move when Bored
This is the best advice when shedding weight is in question. Whenever you feel bored sitting at home, drop down to the floor and do 20! Either jog around the house, warm up and do lower body exercises or simply dance away. Once you get into a habit to move when bored, firstly you will never feel bored again and secondly, you will lose weight effortlessly.
Simply add these 8 secret tips into your daily routine and feel smarter by the day!
