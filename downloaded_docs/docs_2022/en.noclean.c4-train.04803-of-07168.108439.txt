Morphine Addiction
Morphine is a narcotic, opiate based pain reliever which acts directly on the central nervous system. Morphine is available in both generic and brand name products, such as MS-Contin, Oramorph SR, and Roxanol, just to name a select few. Morphine is available by prescription in a variety of forms which include oral solutions, immediate and time -released capsules, suppositories, and via injectable preparations. Morphine is normally injected by medical clinicians when it is being used for preoperative sedation, as a supplement to anesthesia, or as analgesia. Morphine has commonly been reported to be an extremely effective pain medication, when the powerful opiate is used properly.
Unfortunately, there are many downsides to Morphine that should be carefully considered prior to using the drug, as it is an extremely powerful narcotic that that directly affects the central nervous system; thus, just a single dose of this medication has been reported to be able to block a process in the brain that is associated with learning and memory for as long as twenty four hours after the drug has been ingested.
Morphine Side Effects
The most common side effects of Morphine may include, but are not limited to: constipation, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain, dry mouth, blurred vision, anxiety, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, loss of appetite, dizziness, anxiety, or insomnia. The more serious, but less common side effects of this powerful pain reliever may include, but are not limited to: slow heartbeat, shallow breathing, cold and clammy skin, confusion, swelling due to fluid retention, uncoordinated muscle movements, light-headedness, abnormal thinking, inability to urinate, memory loss, insomnia, severe weakness, fainting, feeling light-headed, convulsions, seizures and death.
Although Morphine has been reported to be effective in relieving severe pain adequately, it has also been reported to impair the user's mental and physical performance. Many individuals have reported that using Morphine has significantly decreased their sex drive and that the drug can also cause severe constipation; additionally, a percentage of women that have taken the drug, have reported an interruption in their menstrual cycles.
Morphine Abuse
Morphine abuse and addiction has been reported to be among the highest as compared to a large number of other types of similar drugs that are currently being used for the treatment of chronic and severe pain; additionally, drug overdose rates that have been linked directly to the medication have increased dramatically in comparison to other similar types of opiate based drugs. Drug researchers at Brown University conducted studies in relation to Morphine use that have indicated that as little as a single dose of the drug of the drug could potentially contribute to addiction; additionally, a study that was conducted by Japanese researchers concluded that mice that were administered just 10mg. of morphine, twice a day for as little as five days, exhibited drug withdrawal symptoms.

Morphine Addiction
Because Morphine is an opiate narcotic, it has a high potential for addiction; thus, tolerance and physical dependence on the drug are likely to develop rapidly. Morphine has proven to be so highly addictive, that in controlled studies that compared the physiological effects of injecting morphine and injecting heroin, there was no preference indicated; additionally, addiction studies conducted by the same research team demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate with both heroin and morphine use.
Morphine addiction can quickly begin to take its toll on an user, causing a number of devastating long-term effects. Just like different types of opiate narcotics, the psychological addiction that has commonly been known with addiction to Morphine can last beyond the normal physical withdrawal period. Even past the physical addiction for the powerful opiate has passed; a person may still suffer from side effects that include insomnia, mood swings, forgetfulness, confusion, paranoia, depression, anxiety, and other psychological disorders.
Morphine Withdrawal Symptoms
Morphine withdrawal includes both physical and psychological symptoms, which will occur as a result of abruptly stopping the use of the drug. The symptoms of morphine withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant, so much so that many people will begin to start taking the drug again in order to get relief. Morphine withdrawal symptoms are usually experienced shortly before the time of the next scheduled dose, but they can occur as early as several hours after the last administration of the drug.
Withdrawal symptoms from morphine can include, but are not limited to, sweating, diarrhea, runny nose, dysphoria, watery eyes, insomnia, and a desire for more morphine. As withdrawal from morphine continues, the person is likely to begin to experience more intense drug withdrawal symptoms, such as severe depression, insomnia, diarrhea, restlessness, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea, tremors, and an even more stronger and intense craving for the drug. Morphine withdrawal has been reported to be similar to heroin withdrawal, and the individual will typically experience chills or cold flashes with chills, kicking movements of the legs and excessive sweating. Severe muscle spasms, pains in the bones and the muscles of the back and extremities are also common Morphine withdrawal symptoms.
Morphine withdrawal symptoms have generally been reported to peak between 48 and 96 hours after the last dose of the drug and will usually begin to subside after about a week. It is important to note that the sudden withdrawal of morphine by long term users could potentially be fatal; for this reason alone, a person should go through the Morphine detoxification process under the watchful eye of trained detox professionals at a quality drug rehab center.
Morphine Overdose
A Morphine overdose can occur when a person accidentally or intentionally ingests more of the drug then the body can handle. Medical assistance should be gotten right away if a person who has taken Morphine experiences the following symptoms: constipation, pinpoint pupils, stupor, slowed pulse, vomiting, flaccid muscles, extreme fatigue, palpitations, clammy skin, difficult breathing, nausea, low blood pressure, blue lips, or coma.
Treatment for a Morphine overdose should begin by immediately contacting emergency medical assistance at the first sign of a problem; having a sense of urgency in this situation could be the difference between life and death. Treatment for a Morphine overdose may include, but will not be limited to, the administration of intravenous fluids, and continuous monitoring of the person's vital signs. Laxatives and activated charcoal are commonly used to try to soak up the remnants of the drug in the stomach.
Morphine Drug Facts
When being compared to a host of different pain killers, such as oxycodone and codeine, morphine tends to be more likely to be abused.
Without having the assistance of a quality drug treatment program during the Morphine detox, there is a high probability that an individual will experience a drug relapse. Relapse commonly occurs after withdrawal from Morphine, if the triggers both psychological and environmental are not addressed appropriately.
Testimony to Morphine's highly addictive properties is in the high rate of relapse that is commonly associated with this drug; additionally, individuals who abuse morphine and heroin have been reported to have the highest relapse rates among all drug users.
Only heroin, which is almost identical in its chemical structure to Morphine, can be closely compared in terms of drug dependence liability.
The sudden withdrawal of morphine by long term heavily dependent users could be fatal, although morphine withdrawal is considered to be less dangerous than alcohol withdrawal.
Pharmacist Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sert�first discovered Morphine in the mid 1800's by the , and called it (after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams) "morphium".
Every individual who uses Morphine for a long time (regularly) will be at a high risk for developing a physical dependence to the drug; it is at this point, that more Morphine will be needed to keep the same level of pain management that was originally experienced. When this occurs, it is described as developing a Morphine tolerance and this is a hallmark of any type of a drug addiction.
Morphine effects have commonly been reported to reduce a person's level of consciousness, harming the ability to think or be fully aware of present surroundings.
Drug Facts
Research has demonstrated that, when methadone is given in regular doses by a physician, it has the ability to block the euphoria caused by heroin if the individual does try to take heroin.
Methadone enters the illicit drug market primarily as a result of patients selling their prescriptions.
Methadone was initially used as a painkiller by the Germans during World War II.
Physicians may also be prescribing methadone more often given the media and law enforcement attention that has been focused on the abuse of other opiate drugs, in particular OxyContin.
Methadone overdose is a serious medical emergency. In the event of suspected overdose call an ambulance. If the person is losing consciousness lie them on their side in the recovery position so that they will not choke if they vomit.
