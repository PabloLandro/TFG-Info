A new study shows that being married is associated with improved cancer survival in both men and women.
MARRIAGE IMPROVES CANCER SURVIVAL
It has often been observed that married people, and married men in particular, tend to be healthier and live longer than unmarried people. A number of explanations have been offered to explain this phenomenon, including the greater tendency of married men to abstain from unhealthy behaviors when compared to unmarried men. Now, a newly published clinical research study suggests that married cancer patients may have significantly better outcomes when compared to unmarried patients. This research study appears in the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
Using a large public cancer database (the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, or SEER, database), 734,889 patients diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2008 were studied. These patients’ diagnoses included cancers of the lung, colon, rectum, breast, pancreas, prostate, liver, bile ducts, head and neck, esophagus and ovaries, in addition to lymphoma.
After adjusting for other potential confounding factors, the researchers conducting this study found that married patients were17 percent less likely to present with advanced-stage (“metastatic”) cancer, compared to unmarried patients. Married patients were also 53 percent more likely to undergo recommended treatments for their cancers when compared to unmarried patients. Finally, married cancer patients were, in general, 20 percent less likely to die as a result of their cancers when compared to unmarried patients. Not surprisingly, male cancer patients experienced a greater benefit from marriage in these important areas when compared to married female cancer patients. (Although married women appeared to significantly benefit from marriage, as well.)
A particularly fascinating finding in this clinical study was that the survival benefit associated with being married exceeded the average survival benefit of chemotherapy for cancers of the prostate, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, and head and neck!
The findings of this very interesting clinical study suggest that the social support that married people enjoy, as well as other benefits of marriage, appears to have a very positive impact on patients seeking care for cancer at an earlier stage of disease, and in patient compliance with cancer treatment recommendations. Therefore, marriage appears to be associated with significant improvements in cancer detection, earlier and more complete cancer treatment, and cancer-associated survival. While these benefits of marriage appear to apply to both men and women, men especially seem to benefit from marriage in this regard.

Colonoscopy Prevents Colorectal Cancer

A large new public health study shows that colonoscopy remains the single most effective tool for the prevention of colorectal cancer.
COLONOSCOPY PREVENTS COLORECTAL CANCER
As I discuss in my book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race, colorectal cancer remains the third most common type of cancer in both men and women, and the third most common cause of cancer death among both men and women.
In A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race, I discuss the known lifestyle and dietary factors associated with colorectal cancer risk, as well as evidence-based strategies to reduce your risk of developing this form of cancer. One of the most important of these colorectal prevention strategies is screening colonoscopy. Since the vast majority of colon and rectal cancers first begin as benign polyps, the identification and removal of these premalignant polyps (“adenomas”) can actually prevent the future development of this potentially deadly form of cancer.
Now, a new clinical research study, which appears in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, reveals just how important, and how effective, screening colonoscopy is in preventing colon and rectal cancer.
The Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study are two very large ongoing prospective public health studies. In this case, 88,902 volunteers from these two studies were followed for an average of 22 years. During this time, 1,815 study volunteers were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 474 volunteers died of colorectal cancer.
Among the volunteers who underwent screening colonoscopy, there was a 43 percent reduction in the risk of developing colorectal cancer if they had undergone polyp removal during colonoscopy, compared to study volunteers who did not undergo colonoscopy. Among the study participants who underwent colonoscopy, and who had no polyps detected, their risk of developing colorectal cancer was 56 percent lower when compared to the volunteers who did not undergo colonoscopy. The authors of this study also noted that screening colonoscopy was associated with a 68 percent reduction in the risk of dying from colorectal cancer, based upon the results of this very large prospective public health study.
The findings of this very important public health study show that screening colonoscopy remains the single most effective method of preventing colorectal cancer, and preventing death due to colorectal cancer. At the present time, the American Cancer Society recommends that people with an average risk of developing colorectal cancer should undergo their first colonoscopy at age 50. If this initial screening colonoscopy is normal, then patients should undergo routine screening colonoscopy every 10 years thereafter, as long as each subsequent colonoscopy remains normal.
Although many people shy away from colonoscopy due to concerns about discomfort, or due to modesty concerns, colonoscopy remains one of the most effective cancer screening and cancer prevention tools available. Therefore, if you are due (or overdue) for screening colonoscopy, please do not delay in having this potentially lifesaving test performed.

Fruit and Diabetes Risk

New research finds that some fruits reduce diabetes risk, while other fruits have no impact on diabetes risk (and fruit juice increases diabetes risk).
FRUIT AND DIABETES RISK
Diabetes has become a significant public health problem in the United States, and around the world, in recent years as obesity rates have continued to climb. According to the American Diabetes Association, nearly 26 million Americans (8 percent of the population) have diabetes. Diabetes is a prolific cause of serious illnesses, including heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, and limb loss. Diabetes causes, or contributes to, more than 230,000 deaths in the United States each year.
We all know that fresh fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, and have consistently been linked with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (for more details on the links between diet and cancer, see my book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race). But new research suggests that not all forms of fruit are created equal when it comes to maintaining an optimal level of health, including the prevention of diabetes. This new research study appears in the current issue of the British Medical Journal.
The ongoing Nurses’ Health Study and the Nurses’ Health Study II are huge prospective public health studies that, together, involve more than 150,000 female nurse volunteers, while the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study includes more than 36,000 male physicians. The primary outcome evaluated by this particular public health study was the risk of diabetes associated with fruit intake.
During the long course of this enormous public health study, 12,198 study participants went on to develop diabetes. After adjusting for other known diabetes risk factors among these more than 185,000 research volunteers, the regular consumption of blueberries, grapes, raisins, apples, and pears was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing diabetes. On the other hand, the consumption of bananas, grapefruit, peaches, plums, apricots, oranges, strawberries, and cantaloupe did not reduce diabetes risk. At the same time, the consumption of fruit juices, which often contain significant added sugar, was associated with a small but significant increase in diabetes risk.
In summary, the findings of this important public health study indicate that the risk of diabetes appears to be reduced with the consumption of at least 3 servings per week of blueberries, grapes, raisins, apples, and/or pears, while the regular consumption of other common fruits had no apparent impact on diabetes risk. However, fruit juice consumption was associated with an increase in diabetes risk.

Doctors Frequently Make the Wrong Diagnosis

A new study finds that internists make the correct diagnosis in only 55 percent of simple illnesses, and in just 6 percent of complex cases.
DOCTORS FREQUENTLY MAKE THE WRONG DIAGNOSIS
When we see our doctor because we are sick, most of us expect that we will leave his or her office with a reasonably accurate diagnosis, and the appropriate treatment recommendations for our illness. However, a newly published clinical research study suggests that these expectations might be rather unrealistic, particularly if we are suffering from an illness that requires a reasonably complex evaluation by our physician. This new clinical study appears in the current issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.
In this study, 118 general internists were recruited from throughout the United States. All of these physicians were asked to provide a diagnosis for 4 previously validated patient scenarios, including both straightforward and complex clinical cases. These doctors were asked to provide their diagnoses after reading the histories, physical examination findings, general diagnostic testing results, and disease-specific testing results for each of these 4 cases.
The results of this clinical study were not exactly reassuring to prospective patients…. The 118 participating internists came up with the correct diagnosis for only 55 percent of the straightforward cases. When it came to making the correct diagnosis for the more challenging patient scenarios, the physician-volunteers in this study correctly diagnosed only 6 percent of the more complex clinical cases! Moreover, the doctors who participated in this web-based clinical study appeared to have little insight into their diagnostic shortcomings, as their very high level of confidence in their diagnoses was similar for both the straightforward cases and the more complex cases. This latter finding led the study’s authors to question whether or not physicians who are dealing with complex patient cases realize how likely their diagnosis is to be wrong. (If a physician is unaware that his or her diagnosis is very likely to be wrong, then they may miss an opportunity to perform a more in-depth evaluation of their patient.)
While this is a small pilot study, its findings are nonetheless quite disturbing. It suggests a simultaneous lack of diagnostic accuracy and over-confidence on the part of at least some physicians when it comes to evaluating patients, arriving at a correct diagnosis, and (hence) prescribing the correct treatment. Whether or not the findings of this small study can be generalized to all internists (or to all doctors in the United States) is not clear. However, the disconcerting findings of this clinical study should serve as a red flag to physician residency training programs and physician certification boards. Meanwhile, becoming an educated healthcare consumer, and asking your physician to explain his or her assessment to you, may be just what the doctor ordered!

Dr. Wascher’s Home Page
According to recent Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for veterans who served on active duty between September 2001 and December 2011 is more than 12 percent. A new website, Veterans in Healthcare, seeks to connect veterans with potential employers. If you are a veteran who works in the healthcare field, or if you are an employer who is looking for physicians, advanced practice professionals, nurses, corpsmen/medics, or other healthcare professionals, then please take a look at Veterans in Healthcare. As a retired veteran of the U.S. Army, I would also like to personally urge you to hire a veteran whenever possible.
Disclaimer: As always, my advice to readers is to seek the advice of your physician before making any significant changes in medications, diet, or level of physical activity
Dr. Wascher is an oncologic surgeon, professor of surgery, cancer researcher, oncology consultant, and a widely published author
I and the staff of Weekly Health Update would again like to take this opportunity to thank the more than 100,000 health-conscious people from around the world who visit this premier global health information website every month. Over the past 12 months, 3.5 million pages of high-quality medical research findings were served to the worldwide audience of health-conscious readers. As always, we enjoy receiving your stimulating feedback and questions, and I will continue to try and personally answer as many of your inquiries as I possibly can.
