Cell Phone Radiation Protection
(Brevard, NC) – For years, the issue of cell phone safety has been a hot topic of debate, but we now know, thanks to years of stringent laboratory research, that cell phones do emit levels of radiation that can negatively affect one’s health.
Aulterra, the leading cell phone radiation neutralizer manufacturer, is introducing the new Aulterra Neutralizer™ into U.S. markets. The Neutralizer is a small holographic disc which has been scientifically proven to be significantly effective in reducing and neutralizing the harmful effects of electromagnetic waves.
Electromagnetic fields are all around us. In their natural form they are harmless. When electromagnetic fields are man-made, they have been shown to disrupt the DNA structure of our bodies, as scientific studies have demonstrated.
“Growing evidence suggests that electromagnetic fields (EMF) can break or nick DNA strands. This phenomenon is known to be associated with cancer,” said Glen Rein, PhD, of the Quantum Biology Laboratories and Stanford University professor whose research demonstrated that with the Aulterra Neutralizer there is a reduction in the in-Vitro Electromagnetic Field Effect of Cell Phones on Human DNA.
“The most significant finding from the research showed that with the Aulterra Neutralizer, the effect of the cell phone radiation on DNA rewinding is 95% reversed when an Aulterra Neutralizer was attached to the cell phone. Without the Aulterra Neutralizer the electromagnetic fields from the cell phone produced a 40% increase (relative to control values) in the DNA rewinding rate. This effect of the cell phone radiation is highly statistically significant compared to the untreated control.”
The Neutralizer contains a proprietary blend of natural materials which neutralize harmful emissions. The powerful effect of this blend of natural materials was first discovered when it was used to neutralize and remove lead and zinc from a landfill during an environmental cleanup project.
Other cell phone radiation protectors act as blockers or absorbers. The Aulterra Neutralizer is a better solution. It neither blocks radiation nor absorbs it. Any device that blocks 100% of the EMFs from a cell phone would make it useless. Absorbers become saturated and fail to function. The Neutralizer works by neither blocking nor absorbing cell phone radiation. Instead, the Neutralizer changes the manmade frequencies into coherent, harmless frequencies—the way nature intended.
The Aulterra Neutralizer is made from a patented blend of paramagnetic elements including cerium and lanthanum and a rare inorganic compound derived from a crystalline mineral found in only two known sites in the world. These three micro-thin layers of activated rare-earth elements produce the thinnest, most effective neutralizer ever. Simply place the small holographic disc on your phone to combat harmful radiation.
Peel the back from the Neutralizer and place it directly on the back of your cell phone or inside the battery cover. The Neutralizer protects you from radiation from your cell phone and radiation from cell phone towers. The effective range is a 36” diameter sphere from the Neutralizer. And the Aulterra Neutralizer does not negatively affect cellular phone reception or transmission.
For added protection, the Aulterra Neutralizer can be used on the following electronic devices: Wi-Fi routers, tablets, laptops, desktops, microwaves, cordless telephones, baby monitors, televisions, video game equipment, breaker boxes/fuse boxes and more.
The Neutralizer is science that works! Reproducible tests prove that the Aulterra Neutralizer retunes the EMF frequencies of cell phones and other electronic devices into coherent energy. Once the frequencies are converted, they no longer harm to your DNA.
The secret of the Neutralizer lies in the crystalline matrix mixed into the ink of the Neutralizer patch. Neutralizer’s developer, Kim Dandurand identified the crystalline properties while engaged in a major environmental cleanup operation in 1996. He used the blend of material to neutralize chemical and radioactive waste from landfills.
Dandurand then investigated whether the paramagnetic substance could be used to neutralize the EMFs from cell phones and electronic equipment. Kim Dandurand funded a research program at the Quantum Biology Research Laboratories. Experiments showed that human DNA reacted adversely to EMFs emanating from cell phones. Tests on human DNA proved that with an Aulterra Neutralizer attached to a cell phone the natural coherent fields from the Neutralizer had successfully harmonized the incoherent EMFs rendering them harmless to living tissue.
Consider these cell phone radiation facts:
In a study by the University of Washington, Dr. Henry Lai discovered that brain cells are clearly damaged by microwave levels far below the U.S. government’s recommended safe zone and that even small doses of radio frequencies can accumulate over time to cause harmful effects.
In a research study conducted by Italian scientists it was discovered that radiation emitted by cell phones is especially conducive to the growth of cancerous cells.
In a study funded by the telecom industry to prove the safety of cell phones, it was revealed that cellular damage and tumor growth can be induced in a laboratory setting using radiation levels one-third of those listed the FCC’s exposure guidelines.
At the University of Utah, a researcher discovered that the younger the child, the greater the amount of radiation is absorbed by the brain.
Because of the intense electromagnetic field produced by most automobiles, Volkswagen of Europe has issued warnings stating that using a cell phone while in a car can be even more dangerous to the health of the individual.
Since 1975, the number of cases of brain cancer in the United States has increased by 25%.
Studies indicate that using a hands-free headset and earpiece is actually a greater health risk than holding the phone directly against the ear.

The jury is still out about whether electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones and wireless home phones pose health risks. For those concerned about the potential dangers of using mobile devices, here are safety tips provided by the Environmental Health Trust, a nonprofit that researches hazards of using mobile phones, and Pong, a company that makes smartphone cases that redirect radiation away from the heads of users.
1. When on a call, use a wired headset or speakerphone mode. Use a Bluetooth headset, which emits a smaller amount of radiation, only when talking. When not using the headset, keep it off your body.
2. Place the mobile phone away from your body when on a call.
3. Do not carry mobile phones in pockets of pants or in shirts or bras. Use a belt holster designed to shield the body from radiation.
4. Avoid using a mobile phone in a moving car, train, bus, or in rural areas at some distance from a cell tower. Distance from a cell tower will increase the cellphone’s radiation output.
5. Turn the mobile phone off when you don’t need to use it.
6. Use a corded landline phone instead of a wireless phone, which also emits radiation.
7. Avoid using mobile phone inside of buildings, particularly those with steel structures, which increases the device’s radiation output because signals are not as strong.
8. Do not allow children, whose bodies are more vulnerable to absorbing radiation, to sleep with a cellphone beneath their pillow or keep it at the bedside.
9. Do not allow children under 18 to use a mobile phone except in emergencies.
10. When making a call, do not hold the phone to your ear until after the person on the other line answers. The device emits more radiation before a call goes through.

Concerned over the health hazards, National Green Tribunal restrains telecom firms from settting up towers
Concerned over the health hazards likely to be caused by cell phone towers, the National Green Tribunal has restrained several telecom firms from setting them up without following mandatory provisions of law and taking permission from the competent authority.
“”Considering gravity of allegations levelled and health hazard likely to be caused, we direct that no construction of cell phone communication towers shall be made without following mandatory provisions of law and necessary permission from competent authority,”” a NGT bench of Acting Chairperson Justice A S Naidu and expert member P C Mishra has said.
Issuing notice to the Ministry of Communications and IT, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Ministry of Health, Securities and Exchange Board of India and telecom firms — Bharti Infratel Ltd, Airtel, Idea, Vodaphone, Tata, Reliance and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, the NGT has sought their response by the next date of hearing on December 20.
The tribunal’s order came on the plea of Delhi resident Arvind Gupta, who has sought directions to the Centre and the telecom firms for implementing guidelines and regulations issued by MoEF regarding installation of cell phone towers nationwide.
In his application, filed through advocate B P Tripathy, Gupta has alleged that MoEF guidelines have not been followed and implemented by Department of Telecommunications while allowing installation of towers throughout the country.
He has also alleged that “”norms are flouted brazenly by all companies involved with installation of mobile towers , having complete disregard and concern for environmental protection“”.
Gupta has alleged that radiations emitted by towers not only adversely affect flora and fauna, but can also cause cancer in human beings.
He has further alleged that the Centre and telecom firms have not devised rules and guidelines for implementing existing regulations pertaining to installation of telecom towers so that environmental exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by them will be minimised.
In his application, he has sought constituting of a high powered committee of experts to lay guidelines for limiting cell phone tower radiation before installing any new towers.
He has further sought directions to market regulator SEBI to restrain it from granting permission to any company to invite investments from general public for installing cell phone towers for private profits, saying it will lead to “”irreparable environmental damage and health hazards to human lives…””.
The applicant has also sought transfer of all the cases related to mobile tower radiation from the high courts to NGT.

Is EMF really harmful to your health? Are you safe from EMF? Do you even know what EMF is? Then this post is very important for you to read and understand. EMF as some are not fully aware of it is short for Electromagnetic fields. EMF is invisible electrical magnetic fields which are a weak type of radiation.
EMF is commonly found everywhere. The earth release natural EMF that is weak and extremely low. According to scientist this low EMF are safe and helps regulate important functions on the human body. However, there are other kinds of EMF which are artificial and can cause harm to the body. This is our focus and our main concern.
Artificial EMF is usually found everywhere. There are usually emitted by most electronic gadgets you have at home and offices such as computers, laptops, cellphones, WiFi modems, hair dryers and other gadgets that uses high voltage wires.
EMF can cause a lot of health problems such as brain tumors, leukemia, birth defects, miscarriages, chronic fatigue, headaches, cataracts, heart problems, stress, nausea, chest pain, forgetfulness, cancer and other health problems. But according to some studies, cannot cause such health problems. However, more and more experts are stating with shown evidence that are real health concerning issues.
Now, do you think EMF is health concerning? Have you experienced extreme migraine when you use your computer all day long? Then, there are some problems with EMF.
And because our homes and offices are filled with gadgets and appliances that emits EMF everyday then the chances you get more serious problem is pretty high. So how can you protect yourself from EMF? EMF detectors are what you need.
There is EMF detector that specializes on EMF measuring on the environment to prevent any serious harmful effect or help you find a way to lessen your exposure. EMF measures the level of on the environment and alerts you if the surrounding area is high of.
A perfect example of an EMF device is the Electromagnetic Field EMF Detector Impulse. It is designed specially to detect measure and alert you of low and high radiation. Just point it in the place you want to measure it will the job. It usually makes the ticking sound when measuring. But you can also set it to tick when you are in a high EMF environment.
So what now? It only detects but does not control the EMF. Detection is a good sign. It means you are now aware of the EMF around you. You can now try unplugging some devices at your home and stay away from places with high.

Scientists Warn that Cell Phone Radiation Excites the Brains of Healthy Adults

Children and pregnant women should avoid using cell phones, cordless phones and other wireless devices.
This is according to a panel of influential scientists, which believes that much stricter safety measures are needed to protect people from being harmed by electromagnetic radiation from devices including cellphones, cellphone towers, powerlines and wireless internet.
The scientists met to consider all the evidence linking wireless devices to cancer, neurological diseases and infertility, and concluded that there was evidence of “serious disruptions to biological systems”.
The panel’s findings and recommendations have recently been published in the scientific journal, “Reviews on Environmental Health”.
But Vodacom spokesperson Richard Boorman says there is no cause for alarm:
“There have been thousands of scientific studies into the effects of radio frequency on health. There is no evidence to convince experts that exposure below the guidelines set by International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) carries any health risks, for adults or children.”
But according to the Swedish Karolinska Institute, which took part in the panel: “Many researchers now believe the existing safety limits are inadequate to protect public health because they do not consider prolonged exposure to lower emission levels that are now widespread”.
Panellist Professor Elihu Richter from the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine in Israel said there was already “an increase in cancer and neuro-behavioural impairments, even though these wireless technologies are fairly new. This finding suggests that the exposures are already too high to protect people from health harm”.
Professor Yuri Grigoriev, Chair of the Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, said simply: “”Pregnant women and children of all ages should avoid using cell and cordless phones given the health effects we are seeing already.””
The panel recommends that government should greatly reduce the exposure limits for electromagnetic radiation. It also called for the establishment of an international registry to track the incidence and mortality rates for cancers and neurological and immune diseases over time.
It also proposes that the producers of new wireless technologies needed to prove that these are safe and that there should be compulsory testing of electromagnetic emissions levels before these were introduced.
Boorman agreed that there were “still some gaps in scientific knowledge, and more research is being carried out to fill these” and that the World Health Organisation set the priorities for global research
“However,” added Boorman, “people who personally want to can take simple steps to reduce their exposure as a precaution by keeping the mobile device away from the head and body during use, by using an earpiece, using the loudspeaker function, placing the device on a surface when sending data files and texting instead of calling”.

Growing Concern of the WiFi Radiation Impact on Children

Dr. David O. Carpenter, M.D Worries About the Biological Effects of Wireless Technology in Schools
Dr. David O. Carpenter, M.D is a subject matter expert and contributing author to Safe Schools 2012 on the subject of Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs). He shares his understanding about the health impacts of WiFi (a Radio Frequency (RF) exposure) as well as Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) emissions on children through this and many other publications. In December 2011, Dr. Carpenter authored a declaration, richly filled with information on the biological effects of wireless technologies and his concerns about the safety of wireless devices in schools. He recommends wired solutions, as opposed to WiFi, as a way to safeguard children and maximized learning.
Dr. Carpenter’s Background
Dr. Carpenter authored an Amended Declaration, dated December 20, 2011 as a court filing about Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) documenting his view on the impact WiFi will have on children attending school.
In Amended Declaration declaration, we find that Dr. Carpenter is a public health physician, educated at Harvard Medical School and currently, Director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany and Professor of Environmental Health Sciences within the School of Public Health. Previously, he was the Dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Albany and the Director of the Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research of the New York State Department of Health. Throughout his career, Dr, Carpenter concentrated his studies on electrophysiology, Electromagnetic Field bioeffects from Radio Frequency (RF) and Microwave (MW) radiation.
Some Views and Findings From Dr. Carpenter
Dr. Carpenter says, “In the context of school development, WI-FI exposes building occupants including children and adults constantly from both computers and infrastructure antennas. Duration may be an even more potent contributing factor to RF/MW radiation bioeffects than exposure levels. Chronic, such as all-day, school exposure, is more likely than short and intermittent exposure, such as cell phone use, to produce harmful health effects, and is likely to do so at lower exposure levels.”
He says solid scientific evidence is clear about the links between Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) exposure levels and possible changes in cell membrane function, cell communication, metabolism, activation of proto-oncogenes, and the triggering of the production of stress proteins. He observes that these health risks come from exposures below FCC guidelines and the same or less than those levels from school WiFi. He says, it has been shown that these radiations can cause cell deaths, DNA breaks, chromosome aberrations, cell stress, killed brain neurons, and even premature cell aging.
Human studies on the health impacts of Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation have found “changes in brain function including memory loss, retarded learning, performance impairment in children, headaches and neurodegenerative conditions, melatonin suppression and sleep disorders, fatigue, hormonal imbalances, immune dysregulation such as allergic and inflammatory responses, cardiac and blood pressure problems, genotoxic effects like miscarriage, cancers such as childhood leukemia, childhood and adult brain tumors, and more.”
He observes, public health science generally accepts the fact that some human groups are more vulnerable than others. Those more vulnerable include children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with preexisting illnesses and/or impairments. Children especially are vulnerable to exposed, because of the susceptibility of their developing nervous systems. Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation, he points out, more easily penetrates children’s heads. Children absorb more of the Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) energy in their tissues than adults at WiFi frequencies. Children’s skulls are thinner, their brains are smaller, and their brain tissue is more conductive.
Dr. Carpenter notes that the FCC public Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation exposure guidelines are based on the height, weight, and stature of a 6-foot tall man, not children with unique susceptibility. At early ages, children have a high rate of cellular activity and are at more at risk for DNA damage and subsequent cancers. He also notes, “Growth and development of the central nervous system is still occurring well into the teenage years, such that the neurological impairments predictable by the extent science may have great impact upon development, cognition, learning, and behavior.”
Studies have shown that when fetuses are exposed to Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation there is an increased risk factor for childhood leukemia and a higher incidence of miscarriages.
Dr. Carpenter understands from years of study and solid scientific evidence that Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation and Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) fields present health dangers. He also believes that there is active suppression of literature on these dangers. He goes on to say that the large body of scientific literature makes it clear that radiation exposure of chronic duration is quite harmful to humans, particularly children, as well as to animals and plants.
Declaration Summaries
Dr. David O. Carpenter, M.D believes Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation is a serious concern and a risk to human health. He observes that exposures like those from FM, TV and cell phones have been demonstrated to be harmful even though they are low intensity and only sometimes a long duration. Introduce varying age groups and those with preexisting sicknesses, there is higher risks, particularly for children. To make a bad exposure worse, increasing the constancy and length of exposure toward the maximum, up to a 24/7 durations such as from WiFi, will put human health at an even greater health risk.
Computer radiation microenvironments, where there are many sources of Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW), as is the case with WiFi-equipped schools, are more harmful than a single, isolated Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation exposure at the same power density and duration. Children are known to be more susceptible to these radiations than adults and now these radiations are in a school-confined radiation-filled environment. He believes internet access should be through wired access, not WiFi.

Hazard Thoughts for Tower Professionals

Cell Phone Radiation Protection
For tower professionals and those that work in the broadcast and wireless industries, safety is paramount. While RF safety awareness is an important aspect of any hazard assessment, all professionals need to be mindful of all the other possible risks attached to the job. Working on towers is often regarded as the most dangerous job in America, and the statistics for fatal accidents don’t make pleasant reading. Therefore, safe working practice to eliminate the risk of injury or death has to be at the forefront of everybody’s mind in an industry fraught with danger. However, when it comes to analyzing potential hazards, there is no single one-size-fits-all assessment plan.
While certain risks may exist on one job, another site may pose completely different hazards, so for any professional working on towers, masts and antennas, assessing hazards has to be done on a site-by-site basis. That being said, certain risks tend to exist at nearly every site, and because workers in the profession face them on a daily basis, it can be all too easy to forget just how potent these hazards are. The result is that even the most experienced professional takes unnecessary risks every now and again, which can lead to avoidable accidents, so it always worth reassessing the common problems faced by tower and antenna engineers.
Working at height
The most obvious risk people working in the tower and antenna world face are the daily climbs. Whether its 50 feet or 500 feet the consequences of a fall can be the same, and every height has to be respected equally. Quite a few tower professionals will admit to having taken a chance while working at height during some point in their career, but in doing so they are risking their lives.
When a climb looks easy, or it is getting late in the day, it can be tempting to take short cuts. However, the job is dangerous enough without adding unnecessary risks into the equation, so properly assessing each tower before you climb and following OSHA or local safety procedures is vital to prevent becoming an unfortunate addition to the statistics.
Rooftop hazards
Many antennas, especially those in the cell phone industry, are these days located on top of roofs and other structures, and these can pose less obvious hazards for anybody tasked with repair or maintenance. Apart from the various trip hazards caused by rooftop furniture, such as air vents, a less visible and more sinister threat can be present, especially on older buildings.
Despite the Environment Protection Agency’s 1989 Asbestos Ban and Phase Out Rule, asbestos could still be present on some older buildings. This is because, before the health risks and the associations with lung cancer was realized in the early 1980s, asbestos was used as insulation and fireproofing almost everywhere. While EPA rules mean than all roofing material should now be asbestos free, you cannot take for granted that the building you are working on has no asbestos. If there is a suspicion that asbestos could be present, and you are planning to disturb roofing material, extreme caution needs to be taken. Be sure that the EPA or a certified industrial asbestos removal company has done an appropriate survey. For modern buildings, constructed since 1989, there shouldn’t be a problem, but when in doubt, seek guidance.
Weather
The weather is one the most challenging aspects for working on towers and antennas. Not only is it unpleasant working in the bitter cold, pouring rain, or baking sunshine, but also the weather can lead to accidents and injury. The most obvious threat posed by weather systems to anybody working at height is of course lightning. Nobody wants to be up an antenna or tower when a thunderstorm hits. While the tower may be protected by a lightning dissipation system, somebody working on the tower won’t be protected from stray, potentially lethal, discharges. Being on a tall object means the risk of a lightning strike is high. However, in some locations, the speed at which storm clouds can gather is easy to underestimate. A good rule of thumb is that if it looks like thunder, stay down. Be sure that your safety plan addresses this up front.
Torrential rain, extreme cold and even high levels of heat also pose risks. Rain can obviously make climbing surfaces slippery, while metal antennas in sub zero temperatures pose skin contact risk. In hot weather, burns are possible too, so when it is very cold or hot, check the temperature of the antenna or tower before ascension and always wear protection.
Heat and cold also pose life-threatening stress risks. It is important to know the symptoms of these conditions, and appropriate first aid for them.
Tiredness
Driving long distance is as much a part of the job as climbing. Several hours behind the wheel will often result in feelings of tiredness, so time should be taken when arriving on site to shrug off feelings of fatigue. Don’t risk climbing or working when feeling sleepy. Feeling tired can lead to mistakes, so if a journey has drained you, take time to have a coffee, stretch your legs, or even take a short nap if necessary. Furthermore, for anybody in such a physical job, it also helps to keep yourself in shape and take care of your overall health and fitness, which can reduce the risk of something untoward happening when up a tower, mast or antenna.
Training
In addition to the RF Awareness training mentioned earlier, LBA now offers comprehensive Outdoor Worker Awareness training with certificate, on-line. This training encompasses heat and cold stress; venomous snakes, plants, and spiders; U/V dangers; and other OSHA hazards tower specialists are likely to encounter outdoors.

B.C. School Districts Divided on Future of Wi-Fi

A B.C. school district concerned about the dangers of wireless signals is reviewing a CTV investigation revealing that radiation levels in classrooms equipped with Wi-Fi aren’t any higher than in those without.
The Greater Victoria School Board has placed a moratorium on the installation of wireless systems until it hears from a committee studying the potential for health impacts. But after hearing about a CTV News investigation on wireless signal exposure, school board chair Peg Ocherton said she wants to know more.
“I’d be interested in actually seeing the report. If CTV’s willing to share that fully with us, that would be great. I’d give it to the committee for their referral,” she told CTV News.
After her request, CTV forwarded information to Orcherton, who will ask her committee to review it before making recommendations to the board.
She admitted the board is taking a prudent approach.
“The question for us is student safety,” Orcherton said, adding that there are at least two students who have health problems their parents believe are connected to electromagnetic emissions.
In tests conducted at four Vancouver schools, children in schools with Wi-Fi installed were found to have about the same exposure to electromagnetic emissions produced by the devices as schools without Wi-Fi. The levels inside schools were about 10 times lower than a student would feel outside in the playground or walking to school.
Vancouver School Board chair Patti Bacchus said she wasn’t surprised by the results.
“We overall feel that we have been assured that it is a safe technology, that is appropriate for use in schools,” she said.
The B.C. Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils voted in May to ask each school district in the province to set aside at least one school at each education level without Wi-Fi, cordless phones or cell phones, in response to some parents’ beliefs that the waves can cause everything from headaches to cancer.
After being shown the results of CTV’s investigation, confederation chair John Puddifoot said he would speak with his board.
“I’d love to have had this data before the resolution was passed,” he said.
Dave Michelson, a researcher at the University of B.C. Radio Science lab, studies radio waves, and says the emissions from wireless devices carry millions of times less energy than cancer-causing rays like UV from the sun.
“The miracle of wireless communications is we can detect signals that weak and get information out of them. As far as any physical effects, they’re too weak to have almost any physical effect,” he said.
Karl Reardon, the Planetworks engineer who performed the tests for CTV News, said that the signals coming from the Wi-Fi units were too low to measure on most equipment.
“It’s so far below any of the standards; it’s literally thousand of times below the Health Canada limits. It’s comparable and lower than the environment we’re exposed to every day when we’re outdoors,” he said.
The province’s two largest school districts, Vancouver and Surrey, are hoping to have Wi-Fi installed in all of their schools by the end of next year.
