India Healthy Child with HIV: Meet “Andrew”
“Andrew” is a handsome 3-year-old healthy boy who is HIV positive. He has big brown eyes with short black hair. He is in need of a forever family.
“Andrew” is developing well for his age. He can draw people and animals with distinct features. He is able to write his own name and simple words. “Andrew” is a very happy boy who communicates very well with adults and other children. He is an active boy who can sit, stand, and walk without support. He plays purposefully with toys and loves to play a structured game with other children.
Did you know that HIV is spread through sexual contact, birth, breast milk and blood to blood contact (such as sharing needles)? Children who are HIV+ can share food, drink, bathtubs, swimming pools, towels, beds, toys and all other household items with their family members and friends. HIV is not transmitted through urine, stool, snot, tears or sweat. While it is recommended and wise to handle the blood of an HIV+ child with care, it is also helpful to know that the risk of transmitting HIV through a bloody nose or skinned knee is very minimal. This is especially true for a child that is on HIV medications, because the medications can reduce the amount of HIV in a person’s system to the point that the HIV is considered “undetectable”, meaning there is only a very tiny amount of virus in the person’s system.
There are so many children like “Andrew” who are healthy and ready to be adopted, but HIV keeps many families from considering them for adoption. Please visit our HIV adoption page for more resources and to learn more about adopting a child with HIV.
This is a shared referral. “Andrew” is in need of a forever family. For more information on “Andrew” or other waiting children like him, please contact India@awaa.org
If you would like to learn more about the process of adopting “Andrew” or other waiting children from India, please sign up for our free informational webinar, “Adopting from India” on March 21st from 3:00-3:30 PM EST.
