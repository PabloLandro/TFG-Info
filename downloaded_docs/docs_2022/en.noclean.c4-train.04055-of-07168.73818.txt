LA Tone Slim Chewing Gum Review - Does It Work?
October 08, 2013
Superdrug - Â£2.99
Of course in this generation; with such busy lifestyles or maybe we're just plain lazy, we try to opt out for easier routes. When it comes to losing weight; its not any different, a lot of people including myself are too lazy to exercise, so we try to find substitutes. SlimGum is basically chewing gym that is enriched with weight-loss promoting ingredients. So chewing good to lose weight sounds pretty good huh? Simple and easy to do. xD
As the packaging states it has active weight-lost promoting ingredients:
Green Coffee Bean Extract
Chromium
L-Carntine
^ Those 3 may help to burn fat
Green Tea Extract
Biotin
Thiamine
^ Those 3 help to support metabolism
The purpose of SlimGum is to help reduce your appetite so that you eat less (thus weight lost/management) with its ingredients, while promoting fat in the body to burn. The gum has minty taste which will fade after 5 minutes of chewing. The gum has a rough texture, as you can see in the photos above. But the major question that everyone wants to knows, is weather it actually works or not?.
The answer varies on numbers of conditions. If you were depending on the gum alone for weight lost, the ingredients in the gum aren't high enough for you to see results in a few days or weeks time. You would need to chew these over for 1 month or more, which can be costly as it recommends you to chew 4 per day and you only get 10 in one packet. Of course how much you chew per day can alter the results too.
If you were to chew this along with a diet and exercise, it can be effective as it reduces your appetite. However you could also reduce your appetite with normal regular chewing gum which is a much cheaper alternative.
So does it work? Yes it can. But I personally think it's pricey and not worth the money as it offers the same effects and results that normal chewing gum would.
So what do you guys think of this idea of chewing gum to lose weight? ^_^
