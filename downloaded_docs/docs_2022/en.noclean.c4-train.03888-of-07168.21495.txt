About Skin Tag Removal
Skin tags can be unsightly and even annoying, so it is no wonder that many people are searching for skin tag removal tips and tricks. But in reality, these skin protrusions that commonly appear in the armpits, groin, neck, chest and other parts of the body are completely benign and harmless. They have not been associated with any other medical conditions, including skin cancer, and there is really no need to remove them at all.
Myths about skin tags
There are many myths regarding skin tags. Note that:
Skin tags are NOT cancer
Skin tags are NOT contagious
Skin tags DO NOT regrow in greater numbers if you remove them
Do skin tags cause any problems?
There is absolutely no discomfort or pain caused at all from skin tags. They can be annoying if you keep noticing they are there or you keep feeling them. Especially on your collar or groin. Otherwise, they are removed for cosmetic reasons.
Sometimes they can fall off by themselves as well.
Skin tag removal procedures
There are many ways to remove skin tags, but the following are the most effective:
Tie off the tag at the base with floss or string (it will drop off)
Freeze off with liquid nitrogen
Cauterize or hyfrecate
Removal with scissors (there are no nerves in them)
If you are experiencing any pain or discolouration in your skin tags, or find any other nodule, bump or painful lesion on your body that might be skin cancer, have it checked out by your skin doctor. If you have questions or concerns about skin tags contact your local doctor, who will arrange for you to see a dermatologist.
