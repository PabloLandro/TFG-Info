An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This saying resonates immensely with mothers. One of the most difficult things that a parent has to face is taking care of a sick child. We have all dealt with cough and colds, fevers, flu, asthma and a host of other illnesses. But what happens when there is no cure for your child‚Äôs ailment? Case in point- dengue. In the first three quarters of 2016, the Department of Health reported 84,000 cases of dengue in the country and out of this number, 372 people died.
Born Out of Love and Necessity
In 2012, friends Marga Nograles and Celine Gabriel-Lim decided to put up Kiele to address their own needs for an effective deterrent to insect bites. ‚ÄúAs a mom of three, I‚Äôm always concerned about my children getting insect bites and the dangers that come with that, specifically dengue. Celine has sensitive skin and is quite prone to them, too,‚Äù shared Marga. ‚ÄúWe tried many brands in the past. Some would work but were full of toxic ingredients. Some smelled good but were inefficient.‚Äù
The Women of Kiele ‚Äì We want to make the world safer and more beautiful one product at a time.
Unsatisfied with what was available in market, the two women thought of creating their own anti-mosquito spray. The idea was to make no less than a product that was efficacious, all natural and one that had a distinctly unique fragrance. It took the women more than a year to achieve this. ‚ÄúThe process involved numerous trials and errors. We sourced our scents from France and worked closely with local fragrance experts to come up with a product that met both our meticulous standards. And that‚Äôs how Kiele‚Äôs anti- mosquito cologne was born.‚Äù
Origin and Philosophy
Marga and Celine chose Kiele (a french name) for the brand as an ode to the french origin of their fragrance. Later they discovered that Kiele also means ‚Äúfragrant blossom‚Äù in Hawaiian which turned out to be pretty apt description.
The business partners confess to being the biggest fans of their products. To date there are two eau de toilette: the Kiele Anti-mosquito Baby Cologne and Chibelli Alcohol-free Baby Cologne (not anti-mosquito). Also available is the Kiele Green Tea Anti-mosquito Room Spray which leaves your house smelling fresh but also keeps those pesky insects at bay. All are backed by the brand‚Äôs par excellence philosopy which is comprised of 3 A‚Äôs : anti-mosquito, contains anti-harmful chemicals and is acceptable for all ages
Kiele products are anti mosquito, anti-harmful and acceptable for all ages.
What‚Äôs next for the brand? ‚ÄúWe are definitely planning on expanding our categories as we continue to create products that are all natural and safe for consumers. Next in line is the Kiele Skin Correcting Powder which is a cosmetic wonder! It not only blurs imperfections and creates a perfect matte finish but also heals and protects as it is loaded with anti-acne and anti-aging properties,‚Äù enthused Marga.
Now available! Achieve the perfect matte finish as you heal your skin. A staple in my make-up kit.
For a brand that started out as a personal undertaking, Kiele now has a solid fan base that‚Äôs consistently growing. I was all but ecstatic when I discovered it. The nightmare of having both my kids in the hospital because of dengue last August (yes, they form part of that alarming statistic) still haunts me. Today, I spray the anti- mosquito cologne on my children everytime they leave the house. The packaging is very handy too and fits comfortably in my daily bag. It‚Äôs also very reasonable priced.
Another plus is that for a minimum order, the owners can customize the bottles in the design of your choice. I absolutely loved the bottles with The Busy Queen P logo that Marga just made for me! These perfect blend of protection, prevention and light perfume in a bottle makes wonderful gifts.
Kiele x The BQP! Love my personalized bottles.
For orders, you may call the Kiele hotline 0307 8621 and look for Tonette. Kiele is also sold in the following stores: The Echo Store, Tart Tatin (Rockwell) and Nothing But Water.

I want to try KIELE‚Äôs anti mosquito cologne because it‚Äôs easy to carry, has a mild scent (as you described it) and more importantly, it will protect my son from insect bites and the dreaded dengue.

I was a fan of the anti-mosquito patch when it was first introduced. My kids used it until such time that they were already embarrassed to be seen with it on their clothes. Now that I am aware that these products are available, I am positive that my teenagers will welcome its use considering the pleasant scent combined with its anti-mosquito protection.

I‚Äôd like to try KIELE anti-mosquito baby cologne because I‚Äôll be protected from mosquito bites as I enjoy the outdoors. I love hiking, biking, kayaking, etc. off road where mosquitoes abound (mountains, woods, rivers, lakes). It‚Äôs the only anti-mosquito baby cologne- if it‚Äôs mild enough for babies, then it will work great for me (I‚Äôm a chemical-sensitive person). Can‚Äôt wait to use KIELE on my next outdoor activity!

My daughter has very sensitive skin. From her infancy to now that she‚Äôs a teen, it has been a struggle to find one that is effective yet safe. Hopefully the anti mosquito spray will be the answer to my many years of searching for the ONE to help prevent those nasty insect bites.

I remember when I was only 5 years old (nursery) when I got dengue fever. I was admitted in the hospital for 2 weeks and wasn‚Äôt able to attend classes for a month, 24 years ago. I can‚Äôt forget that day even now that I‚Äôm 29 because that was my most unforgettable moment and my mom told me that they thought I‚Äôm gonna die that time. That‚Äôs why now that I have two kids, insect repellent lotion is always on my budget/grocery list because I want to make sure that my kids won‚Äôt get insect bit or dengue and always safe wherever they go. This time, I want to try it not only for my kids but for my self too because it so malamok here sa Sari-sari Store ko. And now I‚Äôm joining this promo and hoping to be chosen too! Thanks for the giveaway! üôÇ
