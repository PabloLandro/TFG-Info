side effect help
I see people refer to ginger candy to help with the nausea. Does anyone know what the brand is, or where I can buy some?

A friend of mine gave me ginger lozenges from Trader Joe's. It was their own brand. I have to say that I didn't like them. For me, they were too "strong". I never bothered looking for another brand. I was lucky and didn't have a problem with nausea. My oncologist gave me a prescription for anti-nausea medicine, but I only needed it once. I hope you are able to find something that works for you. Take care.

I buy candied ginger in the spices aise of the grocery. Publix and Kroger and Walmart all carry it. It's cut in tiny, irregular pieces, and you just suck on one for nausea. It worked very well for me.

Thanks for your help. We don't have Trader Joe's here, but I will definitely be looking at Walmart.

I think you can buy candied ginger at specialty grocery stores or Amazon. I don't remember the brand i had, but it worked better than any anti nausea medicine i tried.
Sometimes gingerale and/or gingersnaps help, too.
Good luck!

I am assuming that the usual prescriptions of Zofran and Ativan may not be doing the job? They were my constant companions. if they cause constipation, drink mixes and other products containing sugar alcohols (erythritol, mannitol, sorbitol - they normally end with "tol") help with that, and the drink mixes help you stay well hydrated.
At the treatment facility I attend, they offer ginger ale to all in the infusion rooms and beds. As to lozenges or candies, have a look on Amazon, that way you can avoid shopping and all the infections being sneezed and coughed around. Just what you need, a cold on top of nausea!
Not!

Thanks, I'll check Amazon too. The drink mixes are an interesting idea, I'll look into that as well.

You can also buy ginger capsules and ginger drops. The drops work well. Place under tongue. I bought these at Whole Foods, but I am sure you can find on Amazon.

Cost plus carries ginger candy. Ginger is a great anti-nausea remedy. Ginger tea is also good.

I appreciate the input from everyone, I have asked questions at another site and gotten no response. It's nice to have a source of information that has been where I am. Thanks

I got mine in bulk from the grocery store. I also make ginger tea with ginger root.
Whatever you find, make sure that it is real ginger and not just ginger flavored
