Himalayan Salt Lamps: Benefits and Myths

Himalayan salt lamps are decorative lights you can buy for your home.
They are carved out of pink Himalayan salt and believed to have various health benefits.
In fact, advocates of salt lamps claim they can clean the air in your home, soothe allergies, boost your mood and help you sleep.
However, others question whether these claims have any merit.
This article explores the evidence on Himalayan salt lamps and sorts fact from fiction.
What Are Himalayan Salt Lamps and Why Do People Use Them?
Himalayan salt lamps are made by placing a light bulb inside large chunks of pink Himalayan salt.
They have a distinctive look and emit a warming, pink glow when lit.
True Himalayan salt lamps are made from salt harvested from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan.
Salt sourced from this area is believed to be millions of years old, and although it's very similar to table salt, the small amounts of minerals it contains give it a pink color.
Many people choose to buy Himalayan salt lamps simply because they like the way they look and enjoy the ambiance the pink light creates in their homes. Meanwhile, others find their supposed health benefits alluring.
Summary
Himalayan salt lamps are carved from the mineral-rich, pink salt mined from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan. Some people buy them to decorate their home, while others believe they provide health benefits.
How Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Work?
Salt lamps are said to provide health benefits because they are "natural ionizers," meaning they change the electrical charge of the circulating air.
Ions are compounds that carry a charge because they have an unbalanced number of protons or electrons.
They are produced naturally in the air when alterations occur in the atmosphere. For example, waterfalls, waves, storms, natural radioactivity and heat all produce air ions (1).
They can also be created artificially by commercially produced air ionizers.
It's suggested that Himalayan salt lamps may produce ions by attracting water particles that evaporate off as a salt solution when heated by the lamp, forming mostly negative ions (2).
However, this theory has not yet been tested.
Currently, it's unclear whether salt lamps produce ions in meaningful amounts, if at all.
Summary
Himalayan salt lamps are said to change the charge of the surrounding air by producing ions that have health benefits. However, it is not currently clear whether they can produce any or enough ions to affect your health.
What Are The Health Claims and Do They Stack Up?
There are three main health claims made about Himalayan salt lamps.
1. They Improve Air Quality
Salt lamps are often claimed to improve the air quality of your home.
More specifically, they are advertised as being beneficial for people with allergies, asthma or diseases that affect respiratory function, such as cystic fibrosis.
However, there is currently no evidence that using a Himalayan salt lamp can remove potential pathogens and improve the air quality of your home.
The claim that they are good for people with respiratory conditions may be partly based on the ancient practice of halotherapy.
In this therapy, people with chronic respiratory conditions are said to benefit from spending time in salt caves due to the presence of salt in the air.
Yet, there is little support for this practice, and it's not clear whether it is safe or effective for people with respiratory conditions (3).
Furthermore, tests on air ionizers, which emit high levels of negative ions, haven't yet been shown to benefit people with asthma or improve respiratory function (4, 5, 6).
2. They Can Boost Your Mood
Another frequently made claim is that Himalayan salt lamps can boost your mood.
Some animal studies have shown that exposure to high levels of negative ions in the air may improve levels of serotonin, a chemical involved in mood regulation (1).
Yet, human studies investigating claims regarding the psychological effects of air ionization found no consistent effects on mood or feelings of well-being (7).
However, researchers did find that people with depressive symptoms who were exposed to very high levels of negative ions reported improvements in their mood.
Nevertheless, the link they found wasn't dose-related, meaning that people's mood improvements couldn't be explained by the dose they received. Thus, researchers questioned whether the link was causal.
Additionally, it's very unlikely that salt lamps could expose you to the high number of negative ions used in these studies.
3. They Can Help You Sleep
Studies have not yet examined the effects of Himalayan salt lamps on sleep.
However, a review of the effects of air ionization on relaxation and sleep didn't find any evidence of a beneficial effect (7).
Thus, even if salt lamps do affect the air environment, it's not clear if this would have an effect on sleep patterns.
It's possible that using the dim light from a Himalayan salt lamp may help promote sleepiness toward the end of the day if you use it to replace bright electric lights.
This is because bright light before bed can delay production of the sleep hormone melatonin (8, 9).
However, this isn't specific to salt lamps, and the theory hasn't been tested.
Summary
Himalayan salt lamps are claimed to improve air quality, boost mood and help you sleep. However, there is currently little evidence to support these claims.
Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Have Any Benefits?
Although some of their health claims are not supported by science, Himalayan salt lamps may have other benefits.
These include:
They are attractive: If you like the way they look, they could be an attractive addition to your home.
They create a nice ambiance: They could help create a relaxing atmosphere that helps you unwind.
They might help limit light in the evening: If you struggle to sleep, using dim lights in the evening may help you get to sleep faster.
Overall, these points may make them a great addition to your home.
Summary
Himalayan salt lamps are inviting, create a warm and relaxing ambiance and may help you wind down before bedtime.
The Bottom Line
There is no evidence behind the health claims related to Himalayan salt lamps.
While they may be an attractive addition to a room and help create a relaxing environment, there's little to suggest they do much else.
More research on the theories surrounding their potential health benefits is needed.

By Franziska Spritzler, RD, CDE
Eating healthy can help you lose weight and have more energy.
<p>Eating a nutritious diet has many benefits, including potential weight loss.</p><p>However, it's important to set realistic expectations.</p><p>For example, if you pressure yourself to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible/" target="_blank">lose weight</a> too quickly, your plan to achieve better health may backfire.</p><p>Researchers found that obese people who expected to lose a lot of weight were more likely to drop out of a weight loss program within 6–12 months (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16339128" target="_blank">1</a>).</p><p>Setting a more realistic and achievable goal can keep you from getting discouraged and may even lead to greater weight loss.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Having realistic expectations increases your chances of maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors.</p>
2. Think About What Really Motivates You
<p>Remembering why you're <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-tips" target="_blank">making healthy choices</a> can help you stay on course.</p><p>Making a list of specific reasons why you want to get healthier can be helpful.</p><p>Keep this list handy and refer to it when you feel you need a reminder.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>When you're tempted to indulge in unhealthy behaviors, remembering what motivates you can help you stay on track.</p>
3. Keep Unhealthy Foods Out of the House
<p>It's difficult to eat healthy if you're surrounded by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/avoiding-junk-food" target="_blank">junk foods</a>.</p><p>If other family members want to have these foods around, try keeping them hidden rather than on countertops.</p><p>The saying "out of sight, out of mind" definitely applies here.</p><p>Having food on display in various areas of the house has been linked to obesity and increased consumption of unhealthy foods (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16418755" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916909" target="_blank">3</a>).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Keeping unhealthy foods out of the house, or at least out of sight, can increase your chances of staying on track.</p>
4. Don't Have an "All or Nothing" Approach
<p>A major roadblock to achieving a healthy diet and lifestyle is black-and-white thinking.</p><p>One common scenario is that you have a few unhealthy appetizers at a party, decide that your diet is ruined for the day, and proceed to overindulge in unhealthy foods.</p><p>Instead of considering the day ruined, try putting the past behind you and choosing healthy, unprocessed foods that contain <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day/" target="_blank">protein</a> for the remainder of the party.</p><p>This will help you feel full and satisfied rather than stuffed and frustrated.</p><p>A few off-plan choices make very little difference in the long run, as long as you balance them with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/50-super-healthy-foods/" target="_blank">healthy foods</a>.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Rejecting the urge to judge your day as "good" or "bad" can prevent you from overeating and making poor choices.</p>
5. Carry Healthy Snacks
<p>Sticking to a healthy diet can be tough when you're away from home for extended periods.</p><p>When you get too hungry on the go, you may end up grabbing whatever is available.</p><p>This is often processed food that doesn't really satisfy hunger and isn't good for you in the long run.</p><p>Having healthy <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-high-protein-snacks" target="_blank">high-protein snacks</a> on hand can help keep your appetite in check until you're able to have a full meal (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25266206" target="_blank">4</a>).</p><p>Some examples of good, portable snacks are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-proven-benefits-of-almonds/" target="_blank">almonds</a>, peanuts and jerky. Also consider filling a small cooler with hard-boiled eggs, cheese or Greek yogurt.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Take healthy, high-protein snacks when you're on the road or traveling in case you're unable to eat a meal for several hours.</p>
6. Exercise and Change Diet at the Same Time
<p>You may have heard you shouldn't change too many things at once when trying to improve your health. In general, this is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-baby-steps-optimal-nutrition/" target="_blank">good advice</a>.</p><p>Still, research shows that when you make both dietary and physical activity changes at the same time, the results tend to reinforce each other.</p><p>In a study in 200 people, those who began eating a healthy diet and exercising at the same time found it easier to maintain these behaviors than those who started with either diet or exercise alone, then added the other later (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609341" target="_blank">5</a>).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Simultaneously beginning to exercise and changing the way you eat increases your chances of healthy lifestyle success.</p>
7. Have a Game Plan Before Eating Out
<p>Trying to maintain a healthy diet while eating out can be very challenging.</p><p>Still, there are ways to make it easier, such as checking out the menu before you go or drinking water before and during the meal.</p><p>It's best to have a strategy in place before you get to the restaurant rather than being overwhelmed once you get there.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-healthy-tips-for-eating-out/" target="_blank">20 clever tips to eat healthy when eating out</a>.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Having a plan before eating out can help you make healthier food choices.</p>
8. Don't Let Traveling Derail You
<p>Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, being outside of your familiar territory can make it difficult to stick to a healthy lifestyle. Here are a few tips:</p><ul> <li>Research the restaurants and supermarkets ahead of time.</li></ul><ul> <li>Pack some healthy foods that <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/22-healthy-foods-that-dont-spoil/" target="_blank">don't spoil easily</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Challenge yourself to stay on track for most of the trip.</li></ul><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>You can stick to a healthy eating plan while traveling. All it takes is a bit of research, planning, and commitment.</p>
9. Practice Mindful Eating
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide/" target="_blank">Eating mindfully</a> can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Take time to enjoy your food and appreciate its ability to nourish you. This increases your chances of making successful, lasting behavioral changes.</p><p>In a four-month study, overweight and obese women who practiced mindful eating significantly improved their relationship with food (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21977314/" target="_blank">6</a>).</p><p>Another 6-week study in women with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/binge-eating-disorder" target="_blank">binge eating disorder</a> found that binge episodes decreased from 4 to 1.5 per week when the women practiced mindful eating. Plus, the severity of each binge decreased (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22021603" target="_blank">7</a>).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Adopting a mindful eating approach can help you achieve a better relationship with food and may reduce binge eating.</p>
10. Track and Monitor Your Progress
<p>Logging the foods you eat into a diary, online food tracker or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-best-calorie-counters/" target="_blank">app</a> can help you stick to a healthy diet and lose weight (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617080" target="_blank">8</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23229890" target="_blank">9</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220777" target="_blank">10</a>).</p><p>Measuring your exercise progress is also beneficial and provides you with motivation that can help you keep going.</p><p>In a three-month study, overweight women who were given pedometers walked farther and lost six times more weight than those who didn't use them (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068676" target="_blank">11</a>).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Tracking your food intake and exercise progress can provide motivation and accountability. Studies show that it helps you stick to a healthy diet and leads to greater weight loss.</p>
11. Get a Partner to Join You
<p>Sticking with a healthy eating and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-start-exercising" target="_blank">exercise plan</a> can be tough to do on your own.</p><p>Having a diet or exercise buddy may be helpful, especially if that person is your partner or spouse (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15796642" target="_blank">12</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599511" target="_blank">13</a>).</p><p>Researchers studying data from more than 3,000 couples found that when one person made a positive lifestyle change, such as increasing physical activity, the other was more likely to follow their lead (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599511" target="_blank">13</a>).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Having a partner join you in making healthy lifestyle changes can increase your chances of success.</p>
12. Start the Day With a High-Protein Breakfast
<p>If your first meal is well balanced and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/protein-at-breakfast-and-weight-loss/" target="_blank">contains adequate protein</a>, you're more likely to maintain stable blood sugar levels and not overeat for the rest of the day (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22554612" target="_blank">14</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889354" target="_blank">15</a>).</p><p>In one study, overweight women who consumed at least 30 grams of protein at breakfast felt more satisfied and ate fewer <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day/" target="_blank">calories</a> at lunch than those who ate a lower-protein breakfast (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889354" target="_blank">15</a>).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Eating a high-protein breakfast helps you stay full and can prevent overeating later in the day.</p>
13. Realize That It Takes Time to Change Your Habits
<p>Don't be discouraged if it takes longer than you expect to adapt to your new, healthy way of living.</p><p>Researchers have found that it takes an average of 66 days to make a new behavior a habit (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674/abstract" target="_blank">16</a>).</p><p>Eventually, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-for-beginners" target="_blank">eating healthy</a> and exercising regularly will become automatic.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Do your best to stay motivated and focused while you adapt to a healthy lifestyle. It takes 66 days to make a new habit, on average.</p>
14. Figure Out What Works Best for You
<p>There is no perfect way that works for everyone.</p><p>It's important to find a way of eating and exercising that you enjoy, find sustainable and can stick to for the rest of your life.</p><p>The best diet for you is the one you can stick to in the long run.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Weight loss methods that work for some people are not guaranteed to work for you. To lose weight and keep it off, find effective strategies that you can stick to in the long term.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>Breaking your habits and improving your diet is not easy.</p><p>However, several strategies can help you stick to your diet plans and lose weight.</p><p>These include mindful eating, keeping unhealthy snacks out of sight, carrying <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/29-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss" target="_blank">healthy snacks</a> and managing your expectations.

With April hopping along and Easter just around the corner, it's time for dyeing eggs (and inadvertently, dyeing hands.) It's easy to grab an egg-dyeing kit at the local supermarket or drug store, but those dye ingredients are not pretty.
Assembling Dye Ingredients
<ul> <li>Orange: 2 cups yellow onion skins, water to cover skins by an inch, 1-2 tablespoons vinegar.</li></ul><ul> <li>Yellow: 2 cups water, 1 tablespoon turmeric, 1-2 tablespoon vinegar.</li></ul><ul> <li>Light green: 2 cups red onion skins, water to cover skins by an inch, 1-2 tablespoons vinegar.</li></ul><ul> <li>Blue: 2 cups purple cabbage, water to cover cabbage by an inch, 1-2 tablespoons vinegar.</li></ul><ul><li>Pink: 2 cups water, 2 cups peeled, chopped beets, 1-2 tablespoons vinegar.</li></ul>
Making the Dye
<ul> <li>Bring water and dye ingredients to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15-60 minutes or until the desired color is reached. Deeper water color will produce darker eggs.</li></ul><ul><li>Let the water mixture cool, then strain the liquid into dyeing bowls. Add one tablespoon of vinegar for every cup of liquid.</li></ul>
Dyeing the Eggs
<ul> <li>Place hardboiled eggs into the dye and let them soak in the refrigerator until they reach the desired shade. Soaking them overnight will result in richer colors.</li></ul><ul> <li>Retrieve the dyed eggs from the dye and place them on a drying rack or in an egg carton.</li></ul><ul><li>Admire your work!</li></ul>
<p>For extra credit, wow your friends at your next <em>Game of Thrones</em> viewing party, and use these dye recipes to make <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/marietelling/deviled-dragon-eggs" target="_blank">deviled dragon eggs</a>!</p>

This week, progressive Democrats and youth advocates are launching a nationwide tour to win support for the Green New Deal. Though popular, the ambitious plan to tackle climate change has struggled to earn the endorsement of centrist Democrats in Rust Belt states like Michigan, the second stop on the tour.
<img lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xOTQwMjcwNC85ODB4LnBuZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NTYwOTc2ODV9.oFT-5B_uhkkGgAK_oG6UNUHdeDBMMKhsXUj8LTXpoj8/img.png" id="0b966" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="0TQ8OP1555628113" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" />

This map shows the major roads and highways that run through southwest Detroit (shaded in pink). The Ambassador Bridge (orange) and planned Gordie Howe Bridge (red) will be major sources of pollution, particularly for those living near the bridge. During the planning of the Gordie Howe Bridge, it was called the new trade crossing, or NTC. The dark orange line around the bridge denotes the NTC Impact Region, the area researchers identified as being most affected by the project.
<p>In October, construction <a href="https://detroit.curbed.com/2018/10/5/17940636/gordie-howe-international-bridge-construction-officially-starts" target="_blank">began</a> on the $4.4 billion Gordie Howe Bridge, named after the all-time Red Wings great, a project that promises to expedite the flow of traffic to and from Canada. Many residents opposed the project from the start, and some are now calling for restitution to the community, which is coping with contamination so severe that locals complain of the foul odor.</p><p>"Where I live, most of our pollution comes from the Marathon refinery. The smell is sometimes gas or a rotten stench, and how bad it is depends on which way the wind is blowing," said southwest Detroit native Nathan Love. "During the summer, we just pray the wind doesn't blow our way."</p><p>The smell comes from the <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/11/09/marathon-oil-protest-pollution-southwest-detroit/107519866/" target="_blank">high concentration</a> of <a href="https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/chemicals-and-contaminants/sulfur-dioxide" target="_blank">sulfur dioxide</a>, a dangerous pollutant emitted by oil refineries and steel mills, as well as cars and trucks. The high volume of diesel exhaust from surrounding highways, as well as the the <a href="https://www.ezbordercrossing.com/list-of-border-crossings/michigan/ambassador-bridge/" target="_blank">Ambassador Bridge</a>, is only making the problem worse.</p>

Concentrations of sulfur dioxide or SO2 (left) and particulate matter or PM2.5 (right), two dangerous pollutants, are highest in southwest Detroit.
<p>A <a href="http://caphedetroit.sph.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Resource-Manual-6.13-Southwest-Detroit-Website-Version-10-4-16.pdf" target="_blank">2016 report</a> from the University of Michigan noted that southwest Detroit sees more traffic than any other part of the city, and warned that the Gordie Howe Bridge would bring more contamination to the heart of southwest Detroit, a neighborhood that "has had, and continues to have, the highest levels of [sulfur dioxide, particulate matter] and toxic pollutants that have been measured in Detroit, and in many cases, in Michigan," the authors wrote.</p><p>The findings were corroborated by a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664744/#app1-ijerph-14-01243" target="_blank">2017 study</a>, which found that the community is burdened by the heaviest pollution in Detroit, given its proximity to several industrial facilities and a high concentration of diesel-powered trucks. It further found that the risk of <a href="http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/cancer">cancer</a> is higher in southwest Detroit than in other parts of the city.</p><p>Heather Gordin, vice president of communications for the <a href="https://www.gordiehoweinternationalbridge.com/en" target="_blank">Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority</a>, defended the Gordie Howe Bridge by explaining that it would keep traffic moving so that trucks and cars don't sit still and churn out exhaust. "A lot of pollution and air quality concerns come from the stopping and starting of vehicles and the backing up of vehicles on highway infrastructure, so we spent a lot of time on how to keep vehicles moving to mitigate that type of pollution," she said.</p>

<p>While the addition of a second bridge may cut pollution associated with stopped cars, it will also bring more pollution to southwest Detroit. And truck exhaust isn't the only problem. Construction has also displaced hundreds of residents. Roughly 300 locals who once lived in the footprint of the bridge have been relocated from their homes. Salandra Lopez, a longtime southwest Detroit resident, relocated via the <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/government/mayors-office/bridging-neighborhoods-program" target="_blank">home swap program</a>. She said it was hard to leave her childhood home, but she had no other choice.</p><p>"I lived there since I was a child. I am 43 now. These were my people. We are a very close-knit community, rich in language culture and history," Lopez said. "I had to do what I had to do. These big business only think about profit. They don't think about the people they're impacting. They don't care about the little people."</p><p>Mohammed Alghurabi, a senior project manager with the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/" target="_blank">Michigan Department of Transportation</a>, is sympathetic to the hardship faced by longtime residents who were forced to move. "The process was very friendly, although it was very hard and very difficult because that's peoples' home, so I have a lot of empathy and I feel for the people who went through the process," he said. While officials say they endeavored to do right by locals, longtime residents remain frustrated with the project.</p>

Respondents said their top five concerns about the project were rats, clogged sewers, traffic congestion, air quality and road dust. Respondents also said they wanted decision-makers to consider pollution and public health issues in undertaking the new bridge.</p><p>To compensate for the many burdens associated with the new bridge, the SWDCBC is calling on the city to develop a nearly $8 million community benefits plan. The money would pay for job training, health care and home repair and other services for the remaining residents living near the bridge, as well as pollution monitoring after the bridge opens.</p><p>Organizers are hopeful that the Detroit will adopt the plan. "I am eager to see [if the city] will do right by the people that are here," Compton-Montgomery said. "Those that are left really don't want the bridge, but there's not much they can do about it."</p>

The abandoned Boblo Island Boat Dock Building in southwest Detroit
<p>According to Gordin, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority has been working closely with residents on plans to build a 100-foot buffer around the base of the bridge that will include a walking path and green space. But residents feel like these efforts aren't enough.</p><p>"We keep seeing what they plan on doing and none of it is enough for me," said southwest Detroit resident Selena Burgess. "I don't want the bridge here. Never really did. But there's nothing we can do. It's coming."</p><p>For residents like Burgess and others throughout southwest Detroit, the Gordie Howe Bridge highlights the need for city and state officials to work with communities to ensure they benefit from new infrastructure projects. For now, southwest Detroiters have little recourse for dealing with the Gordie Howe Bridge.</p>

New EPA Asbestos Rule Falls Short of Full Ban

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passed a new rule on asbestos Wednesday that it says will "close the door" on new, unapproved uses. But public health advocates warn the rule could actually open the door to increased use of the carcinogenic fibrous material.
<iframe width="100%" height="150" scrolling="no" id="twitter-embed-1118579769010982912" src="/res/community/twitter_embed/?iframe_id=twitter-embed-1118579769010982912&created_ts=1555525173.0&screen_name=EPA&text=News%3A+EPA+Strengthens+Regulation+of+Asbestos+to+Close+Loophole%2C+Protect+Consumers%3A+broad+new+rule+strengthens+EPA%27s%E2%80%A6+https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FDbV8pgO5Gj&id=1118579769010982912&name=U.S.+EPA" frameborder="0" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="GO5WWS1555592725"></iframe>
<p>However, some public health advocates worry that the rule creates a mechanism by which companies can introduce new uses of asbestos as long as they get approval.</p><p>"This toothless regulation requires companies to seek approval from EPA to resume manufacturing, importing, and processing of asbestos for 15 obsolete uses. It does not ban these uses, but leaves the door open to their return to the marketplace. To think that any company would willingly attempt to resurrect these 15 obsolete asbestos uses is ludicrous. That EPA would enable it is unconscionable," <a href="https://www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/" target="_blank">Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization</a> President Linda Reinstein said in a <a href="https://www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/archives/51138" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="150" scrolling="no" id="twitter-embed-1118594588220911616" src="/res/community/twitter_embed/?iframe_id=twitter-embed-1118594588220911616&created_ts=1555528706.0&screen_name=Linda_ADAO&text=ADAO+responds+to+%40EPA%E2%80%99s+%40EPAAWheeler+dangerously+inadequate+new+%23asbestos+%23SNUR+rule+that+puts+corporate+profits+ah%E2%80%A6+https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FgcNHLzECIW&id=1118594588220911616&name=Linda+Reinstein" frameborder="0" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="YVHXV21555592725"></iframe>
<p>Reinstein also noted that the rule does not cover existing uses of asbestos, such as its use by the Chlor-Alkiki industry. It also does nothing about the asbestos left in schools, homes and offices from when the material was widely used as an insulator and flame retardant.</p><p>Assistant administrator at the EPA's <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/tag/chemicals" target="_self">chemical</a> office Alexandra Dunn <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/politics/epa-asbestos/index.html" target="_blank">told CNN</a> that the agency was still reviewing current uses of asbestos and might propose additional regulations or bans. A few days before the new rule was announced, Wheeler told the House Energy and Commerce Committee he would ban current uses, The New York Times reported, but health advocates like Reinstein argue that Wednesday's rule does not qualify.</p><p>Consumer protection groups have spent a decade lobbying for a law change that would empower the EPA to fully ban asbestos, which kills between <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/asbestos-us-epa-trump-2597804155.html" target="_self">12,000 and 39,275 Americans each year</a>. When an amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act was finally passed in 2016, requiring the EPA to assess and regulate chemicals and enabling it to do so based exclusively on their health and environmental impacts, advocates hoped a ban was in sight.</p><p>Asbestos was added to the first 10 chemicals to be assessed under the amendment, but when the EPA first issued its proposed SNUR in June 2018, advocates were disappointed. Some <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/epa-asbestos-trump-2594546540.html" target="_self">employees voiced concerns</a> the rule could open the door to new asbestos uses.</p><p>The final rule is stronger than the original proposal, The New York Times pointed out, because it requires approval for any new use, not just one of 15 former uses. Some public health advocates do think it is a good start.</p><p>"Most of the things coming out of the EPA these days aren't good," retired EPA employee and current <a href="https://www.environmentalprotectionnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Network</a> member Gary Timm told CNN, "but their asbestos work is so well documented." However, he also thought a full ban would be a logical next step.</p><p><a href="https://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank">Environmental Working Group</a> legislative attorney Melanie Benesh also thought a full ban was in order.</p><p>"This new rule makes it more difficult for industry to resume some abandoned uses of asbestos, but that is a half step at best," Benesh said in a <a href="https://www.ewg.org/release/epa-asbestos-rule-half-step-leaves-deadly-carcinogen-legal" target="_blank">statement</a>. "Administrator Wheeler should use the authority under the new Toxic Substances Control Act law and ban all uses of asbestos. That is the only way the public can trust industry will never again be able to use this dangerous material that has literally killed tens of thousands of Americans."</p>

When Does Plant and Animal Species Loss Become a Societal Crisis?
Dr. David Suzuki
17 April
Insights + Opinion

It's heartening, in the midst of the human-caused sixth mass extinction, to find good wildlife recovery news. As plant and animal species disappear faster than they have for millions of years, Russia's Siberian, or Amur, tigers are making a comeback. After falling to a low of just a few dozen in the mid-20th century, the tigers now number around 500, with close to 100 cubs — thanks to conservation measures that include habitat restoration and an illegal hunting crackdown.
<p>The foundation has also worked for 15 years to protect and recover southern resident killer whales, or Salish Sea orcas, near Vancouver. We've gone to court four times to get government to define critical habitat, complete recovery plans and issue an emergency order to protect the whales. We even joined a U.S. case to protect them from underwater noise from naval exercises.</p><p>We won all cases except the one to force government to order immediate on-the-water changes to human behavior. That case became moot when federal fisheries and environment ministers recommended emergency protections only to have cabinet turn them down. At least we were able to get a multi-stakeholder advisory process to decide what changes to human activities will be made to help the whales. There's hope, but also concern that time is running out.</p><p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/endangered-alberta-caribou-legal-action-1.4993310" target="_blank">foundation partnered with two conservation organizations and two First Nations</a> to ensure the federal environment and climate change minister fulfills her legal responsibility to protect five boreal caribou herds in Alberta. There's often room for sustainable economic development and species abundance, but sometimes tough decisions have to be made, and politicians will look to the public to gauge the extent to which we consider wildlife loss a crisis.</p><p>Many wildlife populations in Canada are in peril. Is this regarded as a societal crisis? If not — if faced with leaving a vastly diminished world for future generations and losing species like orca and caribou is not seen as an urgent matter — why not? What will it take to make wildlife crises our own? Is there a tipping point at which Canadians will create the political momentum for society to pivot from wildlife decline to supporting much overdue conservation actions? If so, have we not reached it?</p><p>With its iconic tigers, Russia has shown what can be accomplished with robust habitat and species conservation measures that prioritize at-risk wildlife. It's a lesson Canada needs to learn.</p>
