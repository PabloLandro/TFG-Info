Hi all, Just read some recent research finding that contradicts the belief that maintaining an alkaline environment would weaken cancer cell growth. Could someone knowledgeable please comment on this research. See website https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180731104216.htm that was followed by article in Medical News today 2/8/18 with heading ‚Äúcancer cells are weaker when more acidic‚Äù.
I‚Äôm at present treating basal cell carcinoma with ACV, BS and VCO and if this info is correct I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing.
Hope someone can throw some further light on this. Blessings to all of you.

Baking Soda and Coconut Oil

I had a scab on my scalp that was 12mm in diameter and very slowly getting bigger. My doctor referred me to a surgeon who did a punch biopsy. The results showed that it was BCC and the surgeon said that I would need surgical removal fairly soon. The wait for an appointment to see a surgeon for an evaluation was two months so that made it easy to decide to use an alternative treatment. Although I had Black Salve available, it felt too extreme to use on the thin flesh of my scalp so I chose instead to apply baking soda and coconut oil once a day, thanks to all the Earth Clinic reports.
After a week, it got a bit irritated with some small amounts of blood expressed. At that point, I cut away the hair in the area and started applying a Band-Aid to keep it from my pillow when I slept. In the shower every day I washed my hair normally and then applied pHisohex anti-bacterial face wash as an antiseptic and then rinsed that as well.
After eight weeks the bleeding stopped and signs of the BCC were disappearing. I kept applying the mix for four more weeks just in case. Now the hair is growing back well although it's a little lighter and the only way I can tell where it was it is a slight dent in my scalp. I stopped six weeks ago. In a follow-up visit to my doctor I had to show him twice where the BCC used to be.
FYI, I consulted three more surgeons who all said it needed to be cut out and one even said I'd need a skin graft (where no hair would grow) to cover the wound. At that point the (free) surgery wouldn't actually be available for another three months as I am a public patient with a low time-priority issue. None of them would discuss my self-treatment for legal reasons.
In retrospect, I'd try the Black Salve as a quicker treatment and possibly more certain cure. Thank you EARTHCLINIC!

I had a bcc on my scalp. Had surgery but it came back with a leison that grew larger. I researched and found a lady who had cured her mother's bcc in the same spot as mine with baking soda and coconut oil. She gave a pictorial ongoing account so I tried it and put it on every day and cleaned it at night. It was tender but gradually came off a little at a time. After several weeks the last part came off today. My scalp is red but I am going to put aloe vera on it. Now I'm hoping my hair will grow back there. Not sure if there is any of it remaining under my scalp but guess I'll find out.

Cured 3 BCC with ACV and baking soda with coconut oil.
The first time I removed my bcc, I used ACV soaked in a cotton ball and taped it to my BCC every night. After a few days it turned red and after about a month I was BCC free.
The second time I removed my bcc, it was close to my eyes, so I used baking soda with coconut oil 1 tbsp each mixed and made a paste and applied it to the area. After about 2 weeks I was bcc free. I had to deal with scabbing and redness but after that I'm bcc free.

Side effect reported
I started treatment of BCC on my chest yesterday with baking soda and coconut oil. Before the treatment I had only two small visible lesions. Now my chest is full of "new" visible "spots". Is it this normal reaction to the treatment? Thanks, Vessna

Vessna, the mixture might be pulling hidden ones to the surface. Which is a good thing in my book.

Vessna, that is perfectly normal. The lesion will probably get inflamed and may pus up or bleed slightly. Then over time it will heal normally. Just keep applying the paste.

I was just diagnosed with basal cell on the tip of my nose. I used a paste of coconut oil and baking soda (1 tsp of each) as often as I could. I also first swabbed the area with apple cider vinegar. I am happy to say after about 6 weeks, I am free of any cancer on my nose. It works and looks completely normal.

Hi! I was just recently diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma as well and I saw your post and I have been using the baking soda and coconut oil. What happened when you used it? Mine has a scab on it that's hollow and it has a ring around that looks like it's trying to heal. It's flaky after putting the paste on. Is this normal?

Taylor, that's exactly what mine looked like during my treatment of it with 101 different tryouts of things.
If the area isn't getting bigger, keep at it and pls report back.

I have just been diagnosed with a BCC on my nose, after being told last year it was just a scratch by a GP and had it zapped with the dry ice thing üôÅ After the skin cancer doctor doing 3 biopsies and freaking me out, he says it's around $5000 up front, which I don't have, even if I wanted the surgery straight away. I'm glad I've seen this page and that people seem to have success with the ACV, baking soda and coconut oil. They are all things I already have, so I will start today and see what happens‚Ä¶ It's good to see so many people here who have been through it before. I've not really been around anyone with this problem before, and the doctor scared the heck out of me üôÇ

I have been using both apple cider vinegar and a paste of bicarb and coconut oil. I am not sure if I knocked the scab, but it has bled and gone dark now, so is it safe to continue with both of these treatments? Thank you so much

Would anyone have any advice about how to treat a BCC on my bottom eyelid? I'm interested in trying baking soda but not sure how much it would sting/be dangerous to the eye itself? Many thanks for any helpful advice?

CherryJoy, Of course it will help any stage of BCC. Use organic raw apple cider vinegar and after generously wiping with a Cotton ball & allowing to dry apply baking soda & coconut oil. You should see results after 3 to 4 weeks. Stay away from chemical sunscreens and wear a large brimmed hat.
