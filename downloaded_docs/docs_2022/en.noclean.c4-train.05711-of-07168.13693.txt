Soothe Your Cold with Fresh Florida Citrus
Tweet
I have two children in school. If you’re a parent, you know one thing that means: they’re constantly coming home with colds and other viruses.
While I love how my kids have enriched my world, this is not my favorite thing that they have “brought” to my life!
Like most of us, I sometimes turn to home remedies to try to soothe my cold symptoms and feel a bit better. And of course, I like to incorporate fresh, delicious Florida citrus when I do.
But does the vitamin C in citrus actually help prevent, cure, or shorten the common cold?
Well, this is a controversial question. Research has found that high doses of vitamin C may prevent colds in people with very strenuous and active lifestyles (marathoners, for instance).
It can also be helpful for people at higher risk of vitamin C deficiency. For instance, older adults and smokers fall into this category.
However, for more “average” people, it seems that increasing vitamin C probably doesn’t actually prevent colds.
But there is some good news. Increasing our vitamin C intake over the long term (like by eating delicious fresh oranges daily!) may slightly shorten the duration of the colds we get.
How much? Well...by about a day.
While this isn’t a huge difference, I personally will take it! Sounds like a good reason to increase citrus intake during winter!
Well, but what if you’re in the middle of a miserable cold and want some relief? Should you still try some citrus-based home remedies?
I think so! Most of them also involve heat (which helps soothe your throat and open things up), honey (which has antibiotic and antiviral properties), ginger (also antiviral) or other helpful ingredients. Sounds good, right?
Plus, they’re delicious and have stood the test of time. I don’t know about you, but I’m going to go with it.
So, here are a few citrus-based cold and flu remedies and treats to try the next time you’re under the weather. They may just help—and they certainly won’t hurt.
Honey Citrus Syrup
This is a simple process of slicing oranges, tangerines, clementines or other citrus, heating honey, and mixing the two together with spices or herbs. The mixture is then kept refrigerated and can be used in teas or as a natural cough syrup.
Immune Booster
Nothing fancy here—just a fresh vitamin C blast. This drink is made from pureed grapefruit, oranges, and kiwis, another fruit that is very high in C. This one is even better for you than juice, because the whole fruit is included and all the fiber is still in the drink.
Cold Remedy Tea
Have you heard about the healing powers of turmeric? I was familiar with this spice through its use in Indian cooking, but it has recently gained popularity in healing circles due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities. I’ve tried turmeric when suffering from a cold and felt it helped. I definitely enjoyed it most mixed with orange juice, ginger, and honey, as in this hot tea!
Fire Cider
Are you the type of person who believes that when it comes to curing a cold, the remedy needs to feel a bit…extreme? Check out this Fire Cider, made from horseradish, garlic, ginger, hot peppers, herbs, vinegar, and yes, fresh oranges and lemons. If it doesn’t cure you, it might at least keep other people from accidentally kissing you and getting sick!
Send Some Sunshine
Is someone you love feeling a bit under the weather? (Maybe that person is you!) Why not send them a beautiful fresh box, crate, or basket of fresh Florida oranges, tangerines, or grapefruit? Picked at the peak of ripeness and bursting with sunshiny vitamin C, this gift is bound to perk your sniffly friend or loved one up. Be a hero.
