Symptoms of Kidney Disease
In this video nephrologist Danuta Trzebinska, MD at UC San Diego Health (http://health.ucsd.edu/nephrology) discusses the symptoms associated with different stages of chronic kidney disease and how they worsen as you progress from the least severe stage to the most severe stage. Chronic kidney disease is a silent disease and some patients will have nonspecific symptoms only, which are often ignored or overlooked until their kidney disease is quite advanced.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection in any part of the urinary system — the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. An infection of the urethra, or urethritis, may cause burning sensation when urinating and cloudy discharge. A bladder infection, or cystitis, may result in pelvic pain, frequent, painful urination, and blood in urine. A kidney infection, or acute pyelonephritis, may cause back pain (possibly only on one side), high fever, chills and nausea. UTIs typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply in the bladder. Most commonly, these bacteria come from the digestive tract through fecal matter. UTIs are more common in women because of their anatomy. Specifically, the short distance from the A to the opening of the urethra and bladder makes it easier for the bacteria from the digestive tract to reach the urinary system. This is why the most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra. Other bacteria may be brought over with S contact. Women who use certain types of birth control such as diaphragms or spermicidal agents are more at risk. Hormonal deficiency during menopause also makes women more vulnerable to infection. Infection limited to the bladder can be easily treated with antibiotics. However, if left untreated, a lower urinary tract infection may spread up to the kidneys where it becomes more dangerous. A kidney infection may result in permanent kidney damage. In rare cases, an infection may also spread to the bloodstream and can be life threatening. Urinary tract infections can be prevented following these steps: - Drink plenty of fluids – to flush out bacteria more frequently. - Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement - this helps prevent bacteria in stools from spreading to the urethra. - Empty the bladder soon after I to flush bacteria. - Avoid feminine products such as douches and powders, which could irritate the urethra. - Avoid diaphragms and spermicides as birth control methods

Is it Bad to Hold our Urine? | #aumsum
Our body has various ways to get rid of unwanted waste materials. One of these ways is through urine. Urine is a liquid waste consisting of unwanted materials like water, salts, urea, uric acid, etc. The urinary system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. The two kidneys filter blood and produce urine, which flows through the ureters and starts getting collected in the urinary bladder. When our urinary bladder starts getting full and it begins to stretch or expand, the nerves of the bladder inform the brain to produce an urge to urinate. Now, when we want to urinate, the bladder contracts and the urine flows out of the body through the urethra. Once in a while, it's okay to hold our urine. But stress and pressures of modern life make us hold our urine more often and for longer periods, which can have negative effects on our health. For example, a wet and warm bladder of urine is the perfect breeding ground for harmful bacteria. Hence, if we don't empty the bladder regularly, then the bacteria are more likely to grow and multiply, causing urinary tract infection or UTI. Holding the urine can also cause the bladder to remain expanded or stretched for too long. This may make it difficult for the bladder to contract normally while urinating. As a result, the bladder will not be emptied completely which can lead to discomfort, pain and other serious problems. Sometimes, the excess urine in bladder can even flow back to the kidneys, causing kidney damage or kidney infection. In very rare cases, the bladder may even burst, risking the life of the individual. Also, don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel.

What Causes Bladder Infections 7 Ideas That Can Cause It!
http://utahtexans.com/ Click on the link above for a free video guide to dietary supplements and alternative medicine! Today I am going to share what causes bladder infections and some simple ideas on preventing this health problem. Right now there are millions of tiny germs that would love to make a home inside your body and not pay rent. These germs could include bacteria, fungi, parasite or a virus. If one of these germs succeeds in living in your body then this is called an infection. The bladder is a organ and do you know what it's job is? Yes, it has the job of holding urine so that it can be removed by the body. If a germ makes a home inside the bladder and starts to reproduce then this is what is known as a bladder infection. This type of an infection is very common in women, but are rare in men. In fact more than half of all women will get at least 1 infection in their life. One of the reasons why it's more common in women is because the tube that carries urine out of the bladder called the urethra is shorter in women than in men. Another reason women have this problem more often than guys is that the opening of this tube is right near the reproductive organs of a women. Bacteria from the reproductive area then can make a short trip to the opening of this tube and travel to the bladder. According to WebMD the more lovemaking a women does the higher the risk of this health problem. Also women who are diabetic are more at risk for this problem and do you know why? Germs love sugar and it helps them grow. Another cause of this ailment is pregnancy. This is due to increased pressure from the pregnancy to the urethra. Lastly after a woman uses the bathroom and wipes front to back it can increase the risk of getting this problem. For guys one of the risk factors of germs multiplying in the bladder could be an enlarged prostate. This enlarged prostate might prevent the bladder from eliminating all the urine inside it. This then could increase the chance of germs to multiply. Another risk factor for both men and women are problems with the kidneys such as kidney stones. Lastly if someone has a weak immune system then it will increase the chance of an infection. To sum everything the leading causes of a bladder infection has to do with a weak immune system, problems with the kidneys, diabetes and an enlarged prostate. For women lots of lovemaking could increase the chance of this problem, pregnancy and using the bathroom and wiping from front to back. Supplements and alternative medicine can be confusing and even harmful. Make things really simple and give your body a HUGE edge by viewing a free video guide I created at http://utahtexans.com/.

Cure KIDNEY DISEASE - FULLY Repair Your Kidney NATURALLY & PREVENT KIDNEY FAILURE with BAKING SODA
PREVENT KIDNEY FAILURE http://bit.ly/2i1YrSd naturally with baking soda! How to Repair Your Kidneys Naturally http://bit.ly/2Az59GP Using Baking Soda. The basic ingredient in baking soda, sodium bicarbonate, has come under increased scrutiny lately because it appears that this chemical has the potential to repair or improve the operation of the human kidney http://bit.ly/2zqPewp. In 2009, British scientists at the Royal Hospital in London uncovered research that bicarbonate slows the progress of kidney disease. In addition, the US National Health Institute has conducted experiments that show that kidney dialysis using bicarbonate agents have more restorative properties than standard dialysis treatments. It may be hard to accept, but the box you keep in your refrigerator to keep the ham from stinking may also save your life. What Causes Kidney Damage First, it is important to understand what causes typical kidney damage so you can understand how it is normally treated and how sodium bicarbonate differs from these standard treatments. Your endocrine system produces hormones and enzymes to help digest food into safer chemical your body can process. The pancreas is normally the organ that produces the majority of sodium bicarbonate to protect your kidneys during digestion. Sometimes, even your kidneys will produce additional amounts of this enzyme depending on the type of diet you subject your digestive system too. If your diet puts too much strain on these two organs (especially a diet rife with sugars, fried fatty foods, and other unhealthy choices that cause your endocrine system to work overtime in order to process these proteins and sugars), they will both suffer a significant reduction in their ability to produce sodium bicarbonate naturally. Without sufficient bicarbonate production to neutralize the acids produced during digestion, these acids can erode organ health, damage your kidneys and speed the aging process in adults. How Does Bicarbonate Repair Kidneys When those with significant kidney damage undergo dialysis or kidney treatment, sodium bicarbonate is one of the most common agents used. This process, known as acid buffering, is means of base supplementation and is the basis for most new forms of dialysis treatments. This agent, when processed through the dialysis machine, helps in the removal of excess fluids and waste material from your bloodstream. Therefore, dialysis is helping add the sodium bicarbonate that your kidneys can no longer produce into your endocrine system to help you process food and waste materials in your blood stream. When your body is producing normal amounts of bicarbonate on its own, this can extend the life of your kidneys, your overall endocrine system, and your total lifespan. What evidence provides substantial proof of this claim? The US National Health Institutes conducted studies that first noted the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate dialysis in the place of normal, acetate-free biofiltration dialysis. Patients place on the SBD treatment had greater nitrate oxide synthase, the process that balances the pH of your blood. Patients on normal acetate-free biofiltration had a lower reaction than BHD in activating vessel wall cells to synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators. Additionally, other studies done by Dr. Ione de Brito-Ashurst and his colleagues from the Department of Renal Medicine and Transplantation showed that daily sodium bicarbonate intake slows the progress of chronic kidney disease and prevent patients from ever having to undergo kidney dialysis. This randomized controlled trial showed that patients were given a minor daily dose of SB during a yearlong period had only 2/3 of the kidney function decline shown in patients given standard kidney disease treatment. In short, sodium bicarbonate can prevent and in some case reverse the onset of chronic kidney failure and stop related diseases like heart disease and end-stage renal disease. How Should You Use Baking Soda to Repair Your Kidneys Naturally? Daily sodium bicarbonate intake is not for everyone. It is usually administered in powder form along with water and can be very difficult for sensitive stomach or who are easily prone to nausea to ingest easily. Fortunately, it is not toxic, so anyone who can tolerate the appalling taste and can overcome the initial onset of nausea can take it daily to prevent kidney disease and degeneration of your endocrine system. Properly administering for those in danger of developing kidney disease involves initially includes taking 1/2 teaspoon of SB sublingual (dissolve it under your tongue) on the first day. Next, take 1/2 teaspoon of SB and 1/2 tsp of sodium chloride (cooking salt) in 1.5 liters of drinking water daily for two to three days. Then, reduce your daily dosage to 1/4 ts

Awareness of the Kidney Disease Symptoms in Women
►► http://treatmentforkidneydisease.tamo... ◄◄ THE BEST NATURAL TREATMENT FOR KIDNEY DISEASE THAT EXISTS & REALLY WORKS!!! Awareness of the Kidney Disease Symptoms in Women What you need to know about kidney disease symptoms in women: A kidney infection is the worst disease for your body. It is not only dangerous, but also very painful. It can happen to anyone but the result and symptoms vary. In men and in women, both have the different symptoms as well as different results. Whatever the cause will be, you must be aware of the kidney disease symptoms in women so that you can get the cure in the early stage. Generally renal diseases happen due to the less amount of water in the body. The kidney is a very important organ of our body. It works as a filter in your body and pass away the waste of your body. But if your body has the less amount of water, it will be difficult for passing the waste and then it gets stuck in your kidneys and spreads infection. This will cause discomfort and pain inside your body as well as in a worst case scenario, it can become kidney failure. Kidney disease symptoms in women can be difficult to identify You can prevent kidney disease symptoms in women by identifying the disease at a very early stage. This disease generally starts very slow and it becomes very hard to notice, but there are some kidney disease symptoms in women that can be noticed, and identify the disease. The signs of kidney disease symptoms in women are described here with the necessary information. Normally there are two kinds of kidney infections found in the body of women known as pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis. You can easily understand this as acute and chronic in nature. Acute infection comes very quickly and can be severe. The infection due to this spreads very quickly in the body, and the chronic infection runs very slowly and gets worse as the time passes. It can also make the kidneys fail. In our bodies, blood vessels filter the bloodstream to produce urine. Acute infection tries to block these vessels so that it will not be able to filter anymore. Then the waste of the body starts collecting in the body and incurs some damage. That waste starts burning in the body which causes lots of pain, sclerosis, scarring and finally the kidney failure, one of the signs of kidney disease symptoms in women. Chronic infection is the most dangerous among all. This infection can be found in a person, twice, thrice or maybe several times. This infection generally blocks the urinary tract. When a patient tries to urinate, it is very painful and uncomfortable. This is one of the more commonly reported kidney disease symptoms in women that occurs frequently. This infection usually happens because of a deficiency of water in the body. People forget to drink the sufficient amount of water because of work, etc., and thus this infection spreads. This is also the reason that this disease can happen several times in the same patient. Kidney disease symptoms in women happen between the 20-40 years age groups The specific kidney disease symptoms in women are several pains or aching in the back, fever, chills, dullness and increase in urination. In case you found such symptoms in your body, you must visit the hospital immediately and have tests by consulting with the experts. If possible, you must start the treatment as kidney infections before it generally become worse, and as the time passes. These infections generally happened in the age of 20 to 40 in women. Eating a high protein diet and consuming excess calcium can also be the reason of kidney infection. However, men are more risky of this infection more than the women. But that doesn't mean it is not popular in women. This disease becomes very popular nowadays as people used to eat unhealthy food like fast food or preservatives, which directly affects your kidneys. Renal disease symptoms in women are not usually noticed right away.

6 Home Remedies for Urinary Tract Infections
6 Home Remedies for Urinary Tract Infections Urinary tract infections are the second most common reason why people go to the doctor every year. Men can get urinary infections, but they are much more common in women. Over eight million women see their doctor for treatment of this infection every year. And 20 percent of these women will have a second infection. The good news is that there are many home remedies for urinary tract infections. We will tell you about six of them in this article. 1. Baking Soda Urinary infections that last more than two days will require medical intervention. Untreated urinary infections can infect your kidneys and will turn into a much more serious problem. To help prevent a developing urinary tract infection or treat it from the start, you can add a teaspoon of baking soda to a glass of water. This will help relieve the infection. Baking soda neutralizes acid in your urine and accelerates recovery. 2. Cranberries Cranberries and blueberries are from the same plant family and appear to have the same properties that inhibit bacteria. According to a study, cranberry juice prevents urinary infections. Also, eating this fruit whole has the same benefits. 3. Cranberry Juice Many studies have found that drinking cranberry juice can help prevent urinary tract infections. It seems as though cranberry juice prevents bacteria that causes the infection and it also has a very mild antibiotic. Drink 4 ounces of cranberry juice a day to help keep your bladder free from infection. But if you tend to have urinary infections or have one right now, try to drink at least 2 or 4 glasses of cranberry juice a day. 4. Pineapple Bromelain is an enzyme that is found in pineapples. In a study, people that had a urinary infection were given bromelain along with the usual round of antibiotics, and the infection went away. Eating a cup of pineapple will taste good and you can help get rid of your infection. 5. Vitamin C Some doctors are prescribing at least 5 g or more of vitamin C a day for patients that have recurring urinary tract infections. Vitamin C keeps your bladder healthy by essentially acidifying urine because it prevents potentially harmful bacteria from entering. 6. Water If you tend to get urinary tract infections, be sure to drink a lot of water: around 8 glasses a day. You should be urinating at least every four or five hours. If you are currently dealing with an infection, drink water to fight it. Drink a total of 8 ounces of water every hour. This will help you eliminate bacteria.

Bladder Infections In Women - Warning Signs
Related: Bladder Infection - Quick Symptoms List https://youtu.be/OIjBspLI92M What's Causing My Lower Abdomen Pain? https://youtu.be/iHOeex1WYjk Bladder Cancer Quick Symptoms List https://youtu.be/BMAMVmfdfhw Kidney Infection - Quick Symptoms List https://youtu.be/80LCLDqsONg Bladder Infections In Women - Warning Signs Statistically, women get bladder infections much more often than men because bacteria can reach the bladder more easily in women. The urethra (the tube that carries urine away from the bladder) is shorter in women than it is in men. Therefore, bacteria that gets into the urethra has less distance to travel to get to the bladder and start growing into an infection. Women also have a higher risk for getting a bladder infection because * certain types of contraception (like diaphrams and spermicides) increase the risk of bacterial growth in the urinary tract, * decreased estrogen levels cause changes that make the urinary tract more susceptible to bacteria. * pregnant women are less likely to flush all bacteria during urination. Warning signs of a bladder infection in women include the following. * Painful burning or stinging sensation while urinating). * Urine produces a peculiar, even foul odor. * Urine appears pinkish or reddish due to presence of blood. * The feeling that you need to urinate happens more often than usual. * You sometimes feel an urgent need to urinate, even though little urine is produced. * "Hesitancy," meaning it takes a while for urine to begin to flow. * Incomplete voiding of urine (leaving urine in the bladder after urinating) * A feeling of pressure in the lower abdomen, lower back, or (less often) tenderness on the sides of the back (flanks). Lower abdominal tenderness may include cramping. * Incontinence or involuntary flow of urine may occur. * In elderly women, lethargy or confusion may accompany incontinence. The purpose of this video has been to provide quick, basic information about warning signs of bladder infections in women.

Prostate Disorders and Infections Part 1
http://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/endosterol.html http://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/products.html The male urethra is a strong barrier against infection but the prostate is vulnerable to infections, cancers, and benign enlargements. In contrast to female urinary infections, male urinary infections are uncommon because the male urethra presents a stronger barrier against ascending bacteria. However, when bacteria succeed in swimming up to the bladder, they hide inside the prostate and from its sinuses may invade and reinvade the urinary bladder and kidneys. Like women, when men get urinary bladder infections, they have similar symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and burning. But, unlike women, men's bladder infections are always secondary to prostate infections and therefore require longer treatments (7-10 days instead of 2-4 days). Since prostate and bladder infections don't cause much fever, when men have fever and chills, it indicates that they actually have three infections that have occurred in sequence: prostatitis (prostate infection), which caused the cystitis (bladder infection), which in turn caused the pyelonephritis (kidney infection). In such cases of ascending urinary infections, antibiotic treatments will not normalize the fever before three days and antibiotics should be given for at least two weeks. Because kidneys seldom get infected in normal men, when they do, further investigations become necessary to rule out secondary causes such as kidney stones, scars, anatomical abnormalities, and tumors. http://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/blog/ http://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/Liver-GallBladder-Chemical-Detoxification.html

16 Signs Your Blood Sugar Is High & 8 Diabetes Symptoms
16 signs your blood sugar is high & 8 diabetes symptoms. The first thing that comes to mind for most people when the discussion of health and high blood sugar is brought up is diabetes. It’s an extremely dangerous and deadly condition, but long before the individual is diagnosed with it, the body gives away signs that their blood sugar level is very high. This will help us stay as healthy as possible. #DiabetesSymptoms #HighBloodSugar #Diabetic Music: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music Summary: 16. Excessive Urination/Urinating During the Night: Granted if you drink high amounts of water before you go to bed, there is a good chance you’re waking up in the middle of the night to urinate. But if you’re blood sugar level is too high, you could pick up a urinary tract infection which can result in excessive urinating. 15. Blurred Vision: Don’t overreact and go buy a pair of glasses if you begin to have temporary blurred vision. In most cases it’s high blood sugar, which causes the lens in the eyes to swell up. 14. Difficulty Concentrating: When the body is lacking insulin, it’s unable to remove glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. This doesn’t allow the body to properly function. This is why you feel tired and can’t concentrate properly. High blood sugar levels can dehydrate you because the body is trying to remove excess glucose through urination. 13. Dry Mouth: Because of the high glucose levels in your blood and saliva, which are caused by high blood sugar levels, your mouth becomes dry. 12. Impotence: This issue which only refers to men, stems from problems that are caused by poor long-term blood sugar control. This damages the nerves and the blood vessels. 11. Recurrent Infections: There are several recurring infections that need to be monitored. Dysfunction of the thyroid, adrenal and pituitary glands. Also watch out for numerous diseases in the pancreas and severe increase in blood glucose. 10. Slow Healing Wounds: If you find that the smallest cuts and bruises are taking longer than usual to heal, high blood sugar levels could be the cause. It affects the nerves and can lead to poor blood circulation, making it tough for blood – need for skin repair – to reach the wounded area. 9. Stomach Problems: When you have high blood sugar levels, emptying the food from your stomach could be delayed. This can lead to bloating, distention, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. 8. Constant Fatigue or Extreme Tiredness: If your thyroid level is low, there is a good chance you are going to feel tired, sleepy or depressed. In order to fight infections, it takes energy, which can result in constant fatigue and high blood sugar levels. 7. Thirst: When you have high blood sugar levels, your kidneys are forced to work overtime to filter and absorb the excess sugar. In order to achieve that, liquids need to flow through the body in order to urinate the sugar. 6. Dry and Itchy Skin: When there is poor blood circulation flow through the body, it causes itchy skin. The most common areas of the body that become itchiest are the lower parts of your legs. 5. Always Hungry: You may be one of those people that have a big appetite, and that’s fine. However, for people who normally do not have a large appetite, this could be because you’re lacking a hormone called incretin. Incretin reduces the flow of sugar from the liver after consuming a meal. If you lack this hormone, food empties quicker and you’ll be hungry again shortly after dinner, which increases your blood sugar level. 4. Excess Abdominal Weight/Fat: This is one of the most common signs that you have high blood sugar levels. The food that you have consumed was not all able to get into the cells as energy which would nourish the cells, so in turn, you feel hungry again. 3. Nerve Problems: Simply put, if your blood sugar levels are high, it can damage the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the nerves, which can lead to nerve problems. 2. Skin Changes: If you begin to experience discoloration and certain growths on your skin, your blood sugar level may be high. Also, you may notice dark, thick areas of skin may begin to form on the back of your neck and your hands as well. 1. Tingling and Numbness: This goes hand-in-hand with nerve damage. If you experience tingling and numbness in certain areas of your body, your blood sugar level may be high. This type of nerve damage is called neuropathy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscribe to Bestie : https://goo.gl/tUqro6 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our Social Media: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHOLISTIC ATLAS | KIDNEY INFECTIONS | ANTIBIOTICS
A caller (Gary) from Maryland talks to Dr. G about his 22-year-old niece who had two kidney infections last year. He wants to know what they can do to prevent this from happening again in the future. Well, the first thing we have to do with young adults and children is show them that there is benefit into the bargain. What you want to do first is get one bottle of our minerals and for two weeks take one ounce twice a day. You can mix it with juice or water or just take a straight shot. Also, everyone should stop eating anything with wheat, barley, rye or oats in it. The gluten protein in wheat, barley, rye and oats is very difficult, if not impossible for the body to digest and it disallows absorption of nutrients into the body. Once someone has done this, they are going to feel better. Check out the rest of the article here: http://holisticatlas.com/?p=8415
