Fetal MRI
Ultrasound imaging is the primary fetal monitoring modality during pregnancy, nevertheless fetal MRI is increasingly used to image anatomical regions and structures difficult to see with sonography. Given its long record of safety, utility, and cost-effectiveness, ultrasound will remain the modality of first choice in fetal screening. However, MRI is beginning to fill a niche in situations where ultrasound does not provide enough information to diagnose abnormalities before the baby's birth. Magnetic resonance imaging of the fetus provides multiplanar views also in sub-optimal positions, better characterization of anatomic details of e.g. the fetal brain, and information for planning the mode of delivery and airway management at birth.
Indications:
Fetal anomalies
Maternal tumors
Pelvimetry
Examinations of the placenta
Modern fetal MRI requires no sedatives or muscle relaxants to control fetal movement. Ultrafast MRI techniques (e.g., single shot techniques like Half Fourier Acquisition Single shot Turbo spin Echo HASTE) enable images to be acquired in less than one second to eliminate fetal motion. Such technology has led to increased usage of fetal MRI, which can lead to earlier diagnosis of conditions affecting the baby and has proven useful in planning fetal surgery and designing postnatal treatments. As MR technology continues to improve, more advances in the prenatal diagnosis and treatment of fetal abnormalities are to expect. More advances in in-utero interventions are likely as well. Eventually, fetal MRI may replace even some prenatal tests that require invasive procedures such as amniocentesis.

Brain MRI
Brain imaging, magnetic resonance imaging of the head or skull, cranial magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), neurological MRI - they describe all the same radiological imaging technique for medical diagnostic.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain includes the anatomic description and the detection of lesions. Special techniques like diffusion weighted imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spectroscopy provide also information about the function and chemical metabolites of the brain. MRI provides detailed pictures of brain and nerve tissues in multiple planes without obstruction by overlying bones. Brain MRI is the procedure of choice for most brain disorders. It provides clear images of the brainstem and posterior brain, which are difficult to view on a CT scan. It is also useful for the diagnosis of demyelinating disorders (disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) that cause destruction of the myelin sheath of the nerve).
With this noninvasive procedure also the evaluation of blood flow and the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is possible. Different MRA methods, also without contrast agents can show a venous or arterial angiogram. MRI can distinguish tumors, inflammatory lesions, and other pathologies from the normal brain anatomy. However, MRI scans are also used instead other methods to avoid the dangers of interventional procedures like angiography (DSA - digital subtraction angiography) as well as of repeated exposure to radiation as required for computed tomography (CT) and other X-ray examinations.
A (birdcage) bird cage coil achieves uniform excitation and reception and is commonly used to study the brain. Usually a brain MRI procedure includes FLAIR, T2 weighted and T1 weighted sequences in two or three planes.

MRI Scan
The definition of a scan is to form an image or an electronic representation. The MRI scan uses magnetic resonance principles to produce extremely detailed pictures of the body tissue without the need for X-ray exposure or other damaging forms of radiation.
MRI scans show structures of the different tissues in the body. The tissue that has the least hydrogen atoms (e.g., bones) appears dark, while the tissue with many hydrogen atoms (e.g., fat) looks bright. The MRI pictures of the brain show details and abnormal structures (brain MRI), for example, tumors, multiple sclerosis lesions, bleedings, or brain tissue that has suffered lack of oxygen after a stroke. A cardiac MRI scan demonstrates the heart as well as blood vessels (cardiovascular imaging) and is used to detect heart defects with e.g., changes in the thickness and infarctions of the muscles around the heart. With MRI scans, nearly all kind of body parts can be tested, for example the joints like knee and shoulder, lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine, the pelvis including fetal MRI, and the soft parts of the body such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen. The MRI procedure includes three to nine imaging sequences and may take up to one hour.

Pregnancy
MRI can be indicated for use in pregnant women if other forms of diagnostic imaging are inadequate or require exposure to ionizing radiation such as X-ray or CT.
As a safety precaution, MR scanning should be avoided in the first three months of pregnancy.
Similar considerations hold for pregnant staff of a magnetic resonance department. An epidemiological study (by Kanal, et al.) concluded that data collected from MRI technologists were negative with respect to any statistically significant elevations in the rates of spontaneous abortion, infertility and premature delivery.
However, also for psychological reasons, it might be a wise precaution that pregnant staff members do not remain in the scan room during actual scanning.
There have been several reports (results could not be reproduced) that static magnetic fields may provoke genetic mutations, changes in growth rate and leukocyte count and other effects. No reports have been published that persons exposed to magnetic fields, including staff at MR departments, have a higher incidence of genetic damage to their children than found in the average population.
This research needs further investigation and for this purpose pregnancy should be considered a relative contraindication for MR spectroscopy and MRI procedures.
Taking into account that clinical MR imaging devices operate at field strengths of between 0.2 and 2.0 T, higher field strengths need more investigation.
MRI Safety Guidance
Today, there is no sign that MR can harm the fetus or embryo (MRI is used for fetal MRI - fetography). However, if a MRI examination is ordered, there should be a strict indication for this examination.

Single Shot Technique
In single shot techniques (used for EPI, TSE, FSE, RARE, HASTE), the entire raw data set is acquired with a single excitation pulse. The magnetization of a fully relaxed spin system is used. Each of the subsequent echoes is given a different phase encoding. For improved SNR, spatial resolution or FOV, the needed raw data are acquired over a number of sequence repetitions. Each repetition then collects a fraction of the complete raw data set. Only slightly more than a half of the raw data is acquired. The image is obtained through half Fourier reconstruction.
A single shot sequence is useful in cases where movement is to expect e.g. in abdominal Imaging or fetal MRI.
