Could a coldsore (herpes simplex virus) lead to genital warts?
Dr. Robert Killian, University of Utah School of Medicine Answered Jan. 17, 2014
26 years experience in General Practice
Viruses. Nope. Not in any way. Warts are caused by either the human papilloma virus or the molluscum virus. Herpes is not in any way related to these viruses.

If a person with a cold sore kissed me on the cheek, what are the chances I could contract herpes simplex virus 1? I washed it off 5-10 minutes after.
Dr. Gurmukh Singh, University of Pune – Armed Forces Medical College Answered Jan. 30, 2016
47 years experience in Pathology
HSV 1 is prevalent. More than 3/4 of people have HSV 1. It is quite likely that you have the virus already. If you have had a cold sore, ever, you have HSV 1. Even if you get it, it is not a big deal for an otherwise healthy person. For good health - Have a diet rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low fat milk and milk products, nuts, beans, legumes, lentils and small amounts of lean meats. Avoid saturated fats. Exercise at least 150 minutes/week and increase the intensity of exercise gradually. Do not use tobacco, alcohol, weed or street drugs in any form. Practice safe sex. Read more...

What type of herpes simplex virus causes cold sores?
Dr. Robert Kwok, Baylor College of Medicine Answered Oct. 3, 2011
31 years experience in Pediatrics
Type 1 more common. Cold sores on or near the lips are due to recurrence of herpes type 1 or 2. Herpes viruses, after the initial infection, live in a person's nerves and travel down the nerves to the surface to form blisters that break open, spreading more virus. Type 1 is more common on the lips, and type 2 more common on the genitals. With people engaging in oral sex, either type can be in one or both locations. Read more...
