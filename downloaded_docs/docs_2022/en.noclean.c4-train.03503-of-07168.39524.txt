About Lipitor
What is Lipitor?
Lipitor is a branded cholesterol medication, which contains the active ingredient atorvastatin. Lipitor is a statin taken by patients whose cholesterol levels are too high and need to be regulated. In combination with a low-fat diet, it serves to lower blood fat levels and prevent dangerous complications such as arteriosclerosis and heart attack. According to the manufacturer Pfizer, Lipitor lowers your LDL-cholesterol levels by 39%-60%, depending on dosage, provided you stick to a healthy low cholesterol diet. Lipitor is also taken by stroke and heart attack patients.
How does Lipitor work?
Like other statins, too, Lipitor reduces your blood levels of cholesterol by blocking an enzyme involved in the production of cholesterol. As a result, your body processes more of the cholesterol present in your bloodstream, bringing down hazardous levels of the blood fat, an important step towards preventing heart attack and other potentially dangerous illnesses. Lipitor has also been proven to reduce triglycerides, a type of blood fat associated with arteriosclerosis. In addition to taking Lipitor, you will need to adjust your diet and lifestyle to reduce your cholesterol. This involves eating less saturated fat and being physically active.
Does Lipitor interact with food and drink?
Lipitor and grapefruit are known to interact. However, this only applies if you consume large amounts of grapefruit or its juice. If you limit your intake to two small glasses of grapefruit juice per day, this will not affect your blood levels of atorvastatin. A large intake of grapefruit can interfere with your body’s ability to process medication and lead to high blood levels of the active ingredient, which can cause harmful side effects.
You can drink alcohol when taking Lipitor. However, if you regularly consume large amounts of alcohol, Lipitor may not be suitable for you. This is because Lipitor is only to be taken if your liver is healthy. Please tell your doctor if you tend to drink alcohol on a regular basis to prevent being prescribed any medication which may harm you.
Can I continue taking Lipitor while pregnant or breastfeeding?
If you are planning to become pregnant or are already pregnant, please stop taking Lipitor and speak to your GP. Lipitor is not suitable for pregnant women, so you should practise contraception during treatment. There is no conclusive study on the effects of Lipitor when taken while breastfeeding. Please speak to your doctor, who will be able to tell you whether the benefits may outweigh the risks in your case.
Who should not take Lipitor?
You should not take Lipitor if you have had an allergic reaction to Lipitor or any other statin in the past. If there is any problem with your liver function, you should also refrain from using Lipitor. You also need to be cautious if you have had a stroke, have an underactive thyroid gland, suffer from muscle pains or are over 70 years old. Please discuss all conditions listed above with your doctor before taking your first Lipitor tablet. Zava can only offer repeat prescriptions for Lipitor, provided you have been taking it for at least three months. If you experience side effects, please discuss your treatment with your GP.
Does Lipitor interact with other drugs?
Please let your GP know if you are regularly taking any other medication, or have just finished a course of medication. Medications that can interfere with Lipitor include antifungal remedies, certain antibiotics, tablets used to regulate lipid levels, some types of high blood pressure tablets as well as HIV treatments. Other cholesterol lowering tablets, cimetidine, phenazone and antacids may also interact with statins. Lipitor should not be taken with the natural remedy St. John’s Wort, which can interfere with the active ingredient.
Which Lipitor dosage will I need to take?
Lipitor is available in different dosages. Tablets can contain between 10 and 80mg atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor. You will usually be starting with a Lipitor 10mg dosage. Your GP will then gradually increase your dosage to the required level. You will also be placed on a low cholesterol, low fat diet, which you will need to maintain to lower your cholesterol in the long term. Your doctor will monitor your progress over the following weeks and adjust your medication, if necessary.
How is Lipitor taken?
Lipitor can be taken independently of mealtimes and at any time of the day. You should make sure you take your daily tablet at the same time every day and swallow it with a drink of water. You should not chew the tablet but swallow it whole.
What does Lipitor contain?
Every Lipitor tablet contains 10, 20, 40 or 80mg atorvastatin, the active ingredient. Other ingredients in Lipitor are lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polysorbate 80, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, hyprolose, hypromellose, thickeners, macrogol 8000, titanium dioxide (E171), contains talc, simethicone, stearate emulsifiers, sorbic acid and benzoic acid.
Lipitor tablets are round, white and are usually marked with their dosage on one side, and “ATV” on the other. They are available in different pack sizes and can come in blister packs or plastic bottles.
Please ensure you keep all medication out of reach of children at all times.
