How to Control Cancer by Checking Genetically Modified Foods & Environmental Pollution
Cancer has been a thorn in the flesh of the human race for a pretty long time now, and it is not showing any signs of stopping except we do something drastic about it. But top scientists and researchers including nutritionists the world over, are of the strong opinion that so many factors which are largely man made are responsible for the rising occurrences of cancer in our modern world.

Scientists say that the main issue is that cancer occurs when the DNA is modified or re-engineered. A renowned Nigerian Pharmacist, Emmanuel Nwankwo asserts that because we have embraced modified lifestyle is the reason cancer is on the rise; this is what the western and advanced world has been suffering for so long he says. And because we in this part of the world have equally adopted this modern lifestyle, the problem has become also a part of us even here in Nigeria. “Once you modify the cell DNA, it goes haywire and starts doing what it is not supposed to do”, the expert says.

Weight Reduction: How to Combat Overweight and Obesity Using Natural Foods & Herbs
The subject of obesity and Overweight even though has become a huge problem among both the growing and adult populations; it is also a big concern both in developing and developed societies of most parts of the world. Thus apart from the fact that sometimes the problem of overweight could be genetic, that is, it could be inherited from one’s predecessors and so on, medical and other expert researches have proven that it is majorly a problem of lifestyle behaviours.
Be happy to shed that excess weight
Urbanisation, the spread of fast food joints and the attendant need for food processing, preservation, and packaging, has turned a vast size of the population to the consumption of a whole lot of unwholesome and even 'dead' foods. But the good thing as I keep saying is that in one form or the other, nature has always provided ways out of these problems which we have incurred on ourselves in the first place, when we decided to abandon nature. Basically the remedy for obesity and overweight including so many, if not all of human health issues, is for us to return to nature.
Signs of overweight and obesity
Obesity is the extreme of overweight; either of these simply implies that you have stored up excess fat in your body, and that your weight far exceeds your normal weight; this means that your weight is not exactly corresponding to your height, or body mass index (BMI). Your BMI is a measure of your weight in relation to your height; to calculate your BMI, multiply your weight in pounds and divide that by the square of your height in inches.
Overweight is a BMI that is greater than 25, whereas obese is a BMI greater than 30.
As a result of increased fatty cells there will be an increased waistline. So watch it because if a man for instance, develops a waistline of 40 inches and above, he is already crossing the borderline, while a woman that measures 35 inches or above at the waistline is also showing signs of overweight.

How to Treat, and Avoid Constipation Via Nutritional and Lifestyle Approach
How is your bowel movement; how often do you use the loo? If you have not been paying attention to this simple process, then this is time you should start. The reason for my curiosity and concern is just that many people out there are used to emptying their bowel just a couple of times in a whole week, still they think it is all good and normal. Well, I would like to let you know that it is not just normal. Constipation has today become a very common occurrence or a part of life for so many, and little do people know that it could just be the major reason for their illness and so many other forms of serious sicknesses people suffer on a daily basis.
The alimentary canal is the channel of digestion & bowel movement
Often I have noticed people complain that they are not able to (easily) pass faeces! Constipation is a problem that almost everybody suffers at one time or the other. But for some, it is a serious problem that they go through as a routine but not knowing how to help themselves. Constipation is a condition in which you find it difficult to pass faeces, or you are not able to do it on a regular basis. Thus for a normal bowel movement, you ought to visit the toilet at least once every day. But from experience, you would have no need visiting the toilet when you have not eaten enough of bulky food, and you need bulky foods as part of your diet.
For instance if you have eaten (mostly) white rice for most of the day, you will most likely not have the urge to empty your bowel the next morning and for the whole day for that matter. This is simply because your favourite white rice as the term (white) connotes, is polished grain; it lacks the all important dietary fibre which your system requires for an effective bowel movement. It is very important we avoid constipation because when you do not regularly eliminate waste, you only go to accumulate toxins in your system, and this can lead to so many diseases later! The following signs however, will tell you that you are constipated and should therefore do something about it:
Fruits & vegetables - Rich fibre diet

How You Can Heal Rheumatoid Arthritis by Natural Lifestyle Changes and Approach
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic progressive and debilitating disease; it is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the body including joint pain, and pains and discomfort in the tissues that surround the joints, and other organs in the human body. But you have a variety of natural lifestyle approaches that you could adopt to get remedy.
You have an autoimmune disease when your immune system begins to attack your own body, mistaking body tissues for foreign invaders or attackers. This is different from the case with osteoarthritis where you tend to find a damaging wear and tear effect. Rheumatoid arthritis can however, permanently damage the joints as the lining of the joints are usually attacked in the process. It will later if not contained, lead to erosion of the bones and even deformity.
Inflamed joints of the hands
This ailment of the joints and bones is typical of a systemic disease because it gradually goes round to affect every part of the (joints) of the body.
Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis
The Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis are many and usually include the following: Stiffness experienced in the morning, pain and swelling at the Joints, anaemia, low appetite and attendant loss of weight, non-specific systemic flu-like symptoms such as tiredness, sickly feeling, depression, mild fever, flare-ups.

Best Natural Ways to Burn Fat, Cure Obesity, and Maintain a Healthy Weight
Of course Overweight and Obesity as a health topic is always in the news because it is one of the biggest health issues of today, and its total cost on the health and economy of the populace and nation is incredibly enormous. But that nature has always provided solutions for everything under the sun is a fact you must begin to come to terms with. Regarding overweight and obesity, for as long as you still have more and more of those visceral fats surrounding your abdominal cavity organs, then you should know you may just be prone to contracting issues leading to high blood pressure or diabetes.
Apart from these, you may also be risking NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), various coronary diseases, and even some forms of cancer. These unnecessary fats surrounding your organs are needlessly suffocating these organs and they are as well capable of producing poisons that are likely to harm you. You just need to burn them off by applying the available natural remedies.
Plenty of fat to burn
It therefore warrants that you adjust your lifestyle which basically will include your dietary habits, and exercise or the lack of it. The followings however, are the steps you could take to remedy this situation by natural means. Being robust is no longer in as health research has confirmed; your main focus should be on health and not necessarily appearance.
You must know that digestion begins right in your mouth; this means that you must ensure to chew your foods more slowly thereby allowing the salivary gland to produce enough enzymes. Also, you need to eat and pay more attention to the food you are eating; do not chatter; do not also allow your mind to wander while eating.
Avoid fried foods as much as possible, and also make sure you do not eat out frequently; also do patronise fast food shops too frequently.
Also, do yourself a favour – avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which may be disguised as safe. They can easily create stored up fats which is very injurious to your liver as well.

How You Can Treat Methanol Poisoning by the Use of Ethanol
When tragedy struck in the little town of Ode-Irele in Ondo State some weeks ago people reacted in frenzied ways due to the confusion, fear and arguments that ensued. On national television, I saw devotees and fear-stricken villagers alike, doing obeisance and performing all manner of appeasement rituals to some local deity at the shrine of the gods of that land. Obviously so many thought the gods of the land were actually to blame! Needless to say that any keen observer will notice a near perfect semblance and striking affinity between the locally brewed illicit gin called ogogoro or kai-kai, which is widely consumed by the locals, and the chemical substance known as methanol.
A victim of (Ode Irele) methanol poisoning
It is true that methanol is alcohol, but it is certainly not the drinkable type of alcohol; it is however, quite different from ethanol. The locally brewed illicit gin or ogogoro is alcohol and definitely bears close resemblance with methanol. They both look alike and smell alike, but methanol as many of us are just beginning to understand, could be a deadly poison when ingested. Methanol is also known as methyl alcohol; it is a light, volatile and colourless flammable liquid with a unique smell similar to that of ethanol which is somewhat a drinkable type of alcohol.
But when methanol is erroneously ingested by anyone a lot could go wrong. The question is - if any of these illicit gin/herbal hawkers should lay their hands on any of these chemicals like methanol, who is going to tell them the difference? It is also true that nearly ninety percent of what these hawkers serve to their numerous clients is alcohol based.
More facts as revealed by scientific research is convincing enough to let the world know that methanol poisoning was responsible for the series of preventable deaths that have silenced the gentle town of Ode Irele, and thrown it into a mournful mood since the past weeks. Since the team of World Health Organisation first gave a preliminary investigative report suggesting methanol poisoning, a big argument has arisen between health experts, government officials, community heads, and traditionalists who claim the gods were angry and so decided to go killing some perceived thieves.
Are the gods really to blame?
Luckily too, the Ondo State government health department after taking time to study and investigate the incidents, have equally submitted that methanol poisoning must have been responsible, yet the hullaballoo regarding the perceived wrath of the gods as postulated by the local chiefs and the keepers of the shrine, have continued to loom and linger.
My biggest surprise and disappointment however, has been the fact that even some highly placed and educated people are also in the fray – eulogizing the unimaginable powers of the gods to be behind this unfortunate tragedy that has befallen this tiny town of Ode Irele. But none of the surviving victims who are still under intensive care have confessed that truly they were at the shrine to cart away some old artefacts as alleged by the chief priest and the traditional chiefs. If anything at all, I think that the gods have seized this unfortunate incident as an opportunity to promote themselves in the eyes of the unwary and ignorant public through their custodians and high priest. If anyone has committed any crime in the form of theft, and is at the point of death, I think they will normally and easily own up to their misdemeanour!
