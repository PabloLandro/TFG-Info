How To Prevent Cataract
By Lakshmi Unny Nair Cataracts, Featured, Health Care 0 Comments
[toc]A progressive reduction in vision due to clouding of the eye lens is called cataract.Cataract, which is a part of the biological ageing process, is a leading cause of blindness in the world.In the United States alone nearly twenty two million people are afflicted by this eye disease. Unless remedial measures, in the form of surgery, are not resorted to on a timely basis, a person having cataract can lose his or her vision completely.
In the initial stages, a person having cataract may complain of a slight blurring of his or her vision. As the condition worsens cataract patients may experience difficulty in reading, writing, recognizing familiar faces and even distinguishing colors. Some cataract patients may also complain of double vision.
Steps To Prevent Cataract
There are numerous simple but effective measures to prevent cataract. Listed below are some helpful tips to prevent cataract.

Adopt Smoke And Alcohol Free Lifestyle
That’s Right. If you really want to reduce your risk of suffering from cataract later on in life, adopt a cigarette and alcohol free lifestyle. Detailed medical research has shown that people who chain smoke cigarettes have a higher incidence of developing cataract.
Similarly, excessive consumption of alcohol also increases an individual’s chance of developing cataract. These simple lifestyle changes can ensure that your eyes remain healthy, well into your golden years.
Eat Right
To prevent cataract eat healthy. People who eat a lot of junk food have a higher incidence of developing lifestyle diseases like diabetes. Diabetes patients have a greater likelihood of suffering from eye diseases like cataract.
Additionally, eating a diet that is high in different kinds of antioxidants like selenium, beta-carotene and vitamin E can ensure that your vision remains near perfect.To prevent cataract include plenty of green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits in your daily diet.
Vitamin Supplements
In addition to making wise food choices, it is important to take a good quality multivitamin, especially one that has appreciable amounts of Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Taking a multivitamin that has good amounts of vitamin E and vitamin C over an extended period of time can reduce the risk of cataract by as much as twenty seven percent.
However, to prevent cataract you need to take vitamin C and vitamin E supplements continuously for at least five or more number of years.
Wear Protective Eye Wear
You must invest in protective eye wear especially if you spend a lot of time outdoors under direct sunlight. The harsh ultra violent rays of the sun can accelerate cataract formation. Choose a good brand of sunglasses which provides full protection against ultraviolet light.
Look for sunglasses that provide ninety nine to one hundred percent protection against both UVA and UVB rays. To prevent cataract, choose close fitting or wrap around sunglasses with extra wide lens which can protect the eyes from every angle.
Have Regular Eye Examinations
This is an important health practice to prevent cataract. Like the rest of the body, you need to pay equal if not more attention to the eyes. Routine eye check up can not only help to detect cataract formation in the early stages but it can also help to slow down its progression. It is important to visit an ophthalmologist once a year to prevent cataract and other eye diseases.
