Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Is there a cancellation fee if I cannot attend or complete my appointment?
A: If you are booked for an MRI scan and are unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances, please contact us at least 24 hours before your scheduled appointment time.
If you request to end your MRI scan prior to completion on the day of your appointment you may incur a 75% cancellation charge.
Please note that private medical insurance companies and third parties may not cover cancellation fees.
If you have any particular worries or doubts about being able to manage your MRI scan, please contact us in advance as we may be able to help: 0207 467 6190 / client.support@umegroup.com. Your comfort is of utmost importance to us.
Q: Do you accept self-pay patients?
A: We accept both self-funding and insured patients, as well as patients referred by the NHS, embassies and Medico-Legal companies.
Q: Can I refer myself for a scan?
A: All patients require a referral and associated referral letter from a clinician in order to undertake any diagnostics at our Centre.
Q: What insurers do you accept?
A: We are covered by most major insurers including: Aviva, AXA, Bupa, Cigna, Healix, Simply Health, WPA and Vitality.
Q: Is the scan safe? Will I feel anything? Are there any risks?
A: All our scans are safe and you will not feel any pain from our scanning machines. The radiologist will ask you a health and safety questionnaire at the time of your scan to ensure you meet the criteria to have a scan and to minimise any risks.
Q: How do I prepare for my scan?
A: After booking your appointment you will receive the relevant patient information guide/s by email or post. Our patient information guides are also available to view and download from our website: www.harleystreet-medicalcentre.com/patient-information/faq-and-patient-guides/.
When you arrive for your scan a member of our Imaging Team will take you through the health and safety protocols and questionnaires relevant to your scan.
Q: Can I have a friend/family member accompany me in the scanning room?
A: Of course, we do our utmost to make sure patients feel comfortable and at ease during their scan. You are welcome to bring one person with you inside the scanning room; provided they meet all health and safety protocols.
If you would like to bring a Chaperone, kindly contact us in advance to let us know: 0207 467 6190 / client.support@umegroup.com.
Q: Do I have to wear any special clothing? Can I wear jewellery?
A: You do not need to wear special clothing. At the time of your scan you will be provided with a gown to change into, which helps to ensure clear scanning images. All metal, including jewellery and credit cards, is prohibited due to the magnet in the scanning machines. The radiologist will check that you have removed anything containing metal prior to your scan to ensure all health and safety protocols are met. You will have access to a locker for storing your belongings during the scan.
Q: What if I have a metal implant?
A: Due to the strong magnetic field in the scanning machines, metal is not allowed in the imaging room. Scans are prohibited for patients with a metal implant or pacemaker; if this applies to you then please rest assured an alternative solution will be researched and recommended to you.
Q: What if I am pregnant?
A: All female patients are asked this question at the time of booking and prior to their scan. Pregnant women are not permitted to undergo any diagnostic imaging as it is harmful to unborn babies.
Q: What can I expect during my scan? Will I have an injection?
A: On arrival for your scan the radiologist will go through the detailed journey of your scan so you know exactly what to expect. You may experience some loud noise from the scanning machines; for which we provide headphones playing your choice of music. An injection is only required if your scan involves a contrast injection - this information will be provided to you when you book your appointment.
Q: How long does the scan take?
A: The length of time the scan takes depends on which scan you are having and if you are having multiple body parts scanned. Please check with our bookings team when you book your appointment and they will be pleased to advise how long your scan will take.
Q: Will I receive a copy of my image scans?
A: Yes, following your scan the radiologist will provide you with a CD of your image scans to take away with you.
Should you require an additional CD, a £15 charge will be applied.
Please note that, unless specifically requested by your referring doctor or consultant, we do not usually issue non-private patients with CDs.
Q: Who reports the results of my scan?
A: Our expert radiologists provide a detailed report for each scan.
If you have been referred by the NHS your scan will be sent back to your referrer who will report your scan.
Q: When do I get the results of my scan?
A: Your results will be sent to your referring clinician between 24-48 hours after your scan.
Q: Disability Access
A: We are committed to ensuring that people with disability and their families and carers are not discriminated against in any way, and that they have access to the full range of services, facilities and information we offer.
If you have a disability and are visiting Harley Street Medical Centre for an appointment or treatment, please let us know before you attend so we can discuss what support you may need.
