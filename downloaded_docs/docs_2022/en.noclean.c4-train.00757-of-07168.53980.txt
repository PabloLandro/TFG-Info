The Danger EMF Cell Phone Radiation

Home Radiation Protection
Damage from cell phones comes from two sources. The first damaging source occurs from the Near-Field Plume of radiation generated by the cell phone’s antenna. This plume of radiation extends out a distance of six or seven inches from the antenna in all directions. The near-field plume has been studied most extensively and contains the most intense energy. It is able to penetrate deep into biological tissue. This radiation is absorbed when the cell phone is held in close proximity to the body.
The second form of damage comes from a radio wave called the information-Carrying Radio Wave, or ICRW. The cell phone signal is made up of two parts. The first part of the signal vibrates at 600 to 2500 megahertz. This wave is moving much too fast for the body to recognize and, as far as we can tell, is not causing any harm. However, when a person speaks or sends a text message the information is “piggy-backed” or packeted onto the first radio wave. This creates a second wave or signal which is called the information-carrying radio wave, or ICRW. It vibrates at a frequency down in the hertz range. In this range the ICRW is recognized by the body and it is this wave that is causing damage.

WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY WHEN IT IS EXPOSED TO EMF RADIATION?
Your cellular energy is now used for protection rather than metabolism. Cell membranes weaken keeping nutrients out and waste products in.
This causes waste to accumulate inside the cells creating a higher concentration of free radicals, leading to both disruption of DNA repair (micronuclei) and cellular dysfunction.
THE DANGER: Unwanted cell death occurs releasing the micronuclei from the disrupted DNA repair into the fluid between cells (interstitial fluid) where they are free to replicate and proliferate. This, says Dr. Carlo, is the most likely mechanism that contributes to cancer.
Damage occurs to proteins on the cell membrane resulting in disruption of intercellular communication. When cells can not communicate with each other, the result is impaired tissue, organ, and organism function. In the blood-brain barrier, for example, cells can not keep dangerous chemicals from reaching the brain tissue, which results in damage.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY?
Dr. George Carlo: The cellphone industry’s own research program concluded cellphone radiation was damaging to consumer’s health. Dr. George Carlo, was the cellphone industry’s Director of Research who was hired to run their $28 million dollar, 7 year research program to find out if cellphones were dangerous. Dr. George Carlo presents and reveals how the information-carrying radio waves from cell phones and other wireless technology are causing biological harm. Dr. Carlo says that when our cells are hit by EMF radiation, the cells regard the information-carrying radio waves as unrecognizable foreign toxins. This causes the cell membranes to weaken and shut down the transport channels between cells. As a result, nutrients donít get in and waste products donít get out. Among these waste products are free radicals that cause disruption of the cellular respiratory function. The cells become further energy-deficient, eventually triggering programmed cell death. The free radicals also interfere with DNA repair, a factor in the development of micronuclei and tumor formation.

How To Detect WiFi Radiation Without An RF Meter

I know a lot of people are still sitting on the fence about WiFi. They’ve read my articles, they know what the studies say about RF radiation. They know WiFi is no good for them.
But they carry on using it.
Why?
For a whole load of reasons. The main one is probably convenience. Personally WiFi offers me nothing. The connection is not as good and I am not interested in surfing the Internet whilst I am wandering round the house or whilst I’m lying in bed……
Call me old fashioned but my PC stays firmly on the office desk. Apart from the occasions when I am away for a few days. And even then, I’d rather live without Internet if I can.
But if you are one of those people who prefer to keep using WiFi then this one’s for you.
It’s some software which you can install on your laptop which gives you a detailed map of your Wi-Fi coverage. It will actually show you the information on a floor plan (that you have to supply first). You just download the software, upload your floor plan and then walk round your home or office to survey signal strength.
Of course the people who designed this software designed it with the idea that people would be able to determine where the strongest signal was. It’s good for that too.
But for us EMF conscious types it can be better used to reduce your WiFi radiation exposure.
For instance, if you live in an apartment you may not even have WiFi. But you know that your neighbor does because when you switch your laptop on it tells you there is another signal. This software can tell you where the WiFi hotspots are. If your bed is situated on one of them then you know you need to either talk your neighbors into moving their router or move your bed.
If you are in a shared office and you don’t need the Wifi then this software can tell you where to situate your desk so you are the least exposed to it.
Similarly if you regularly go to an Internet café but you don’t use the WiFi then this software can tell you where it’s best to sit to minimize your exposure.
You may think, why bother with the software? Why not just look at the signal bar information in the WiFi function of your laptop.
You can do this too. But this software condenses all this information by telling you what the combined coverage is for a given location. If the map shows the location in green it means the signal is strong and if it shows it in red it means the signal is weak.
The other great thing about this software is that it’s FREE.
In giving you information as to the WiFi signal strength it is actually giving you information on RF radiation levels. It gives you the choice.
Of course it’s not as good as an RF meter, because it does not measure the RF levels in RF units, it just gives you an indication of signal level. But from an EMF mitigation viewpoint this is still very valuable information.
I don’t have WiFi so I have not been able to test this software, but the reviews I have read on it are very good.

In this modern society we can’t live without a mobile phone. We spend a lot of time on a cellphone. Is this cause health problem? Yes! The usage of mobile phone makes the health problem because of the radio waves that coming at the time of switched on the mobile. The very basis of cell phones carries voice through radio waves. The contact with the radio waves increases many when you are talking on the mobile phone.
There are many disadvantages of using mobile phone especially it related to the health. There are many diseases such as cancer, the danger of using mobile phone still existing and it will exist forever. In this article we can see the different diseases and dangers of using mobile phones. First of all we can examine the hazards of living in areas having cell phone towers.
Cell phones are not really a danger one but some researchers have found that living in an area with high frequency telephone towers can cause cancer. According to a study conducted by ITAS (Indian Thermal Analysis Society) says that three cancer patients were found in the Usha Kiran Apartments that stands near the cell phone tower named Vijay Apartments (Carmicheal road, Mumbai, India). A well-known Indian midday newspaper carried this article on the issue of Usha Kiran Apartment patients suffering from cancer due to the mobile towers.
The ITAS concludes that people living within 50-300 meter radius of cell phone towers are causing many diseases because of electromagnetic radiation. This conclusion tells that the acceptable radiation is 9.2Watt per square meter in India. The “danger zone” is different for other countries based on their acceptable standers of radiation. It is 580-1000 Micro- Watts per square centimeter for the US. The people living within 2 to 2.5 miles in the radius of towers are in the danger zone.

Cell Phone Radiation Protection
What if you think you have got radio frequency RF radiation in your home but you do not want to, or cannot, go to the expense of buying a dedicated RF meter?
Worry not, you can use your portable AM radio to detect certain radio frequency (RF) sources, otherwise known as electromagnetic fields or EMFs.
How To Detect RF Radiation With Your AM Radio Step By Step
Here is how you can detect RF radiation with your portable radio:
1. Turn your radio dial to the white noise between stations, where there is no radio signal.
2. Move around turning your radio antenna in all directions.
When you hear it start to hiss this means you are picking up static and that there is a source of radiofrequency radiation present.
DETECT RF RADIATION USING YOUR AM RADIO – DIFFERENT SOURCES
– put your AM radio next to your cell phone when it is switched on. Next get someone to send you a text message, or to call your phone, see what happens
– place your AM radio near a Compact Fluorescent Bulb (CFL), switch it on and listen to what happens.
– hold your AM radio next to your electrical appliances and listed. Many of them are now being equipped with RF transmitters to link up with the smart meters which are being deployed
– move round your house holding your portable AM radio near your electrical sockets, if your radio starts to hiss as you are doing this this is a good indication that there is dirty electricity.
Limitations Of Using Your AM Radio To Detect RF Radiation
You cannot use your AM radio to detect all sources of RF radiation. It won’t pick up certain sources, such as certain Wi-Fi and Wimax sources, which are too high a frequency and don’t generate a strong enough electric field to create static.
In the absence of a dedicated RF meter your AM radio can be a reliable indicator of where radiofrequency fields are present, given the limitations listed above. If you are on a low budget what better way to detect RF radiation than with your AM Radio.

August 20th 2012 – Everyone has been hearing the question Are cellphones dangerous, and everyone who has children prays that they are not. Unfortunately, radiation emanating from mobile phones (or cell phones) is a very real thing and something that little ones cannot escape from. One tends to think that the worst thing one can conceive simply cannot be true, but this escapism does not save one from adversity, when the effects of cellphone radiation begin to show up in the form of headaches, hyperactivity or inability to concentrate in children.
Cell phones and health risk are not linked together idly; but that does not mean that cell phones and health risk have to coexist. There is some truth in the matter, for which reason stories of health toll, radiation sickness and the harm caused by EMF have been doing the rounds. However, it is important for careful parents to look into and get a real answer on the truth of the matter. And the book How To Protect Your Child From Cellphone Radiation gives exactly those answers that every parent has been looking for. Cell phones are a necessary evil. The only thing to do, then, is to protect children from the harmful effects of cellphone radiation. This book tells parents how they can protect their children without giving up on the convenience and utility of having a cell phone. Learn how one can possibly still acquiesce and buy the child the up-market, hip cell phone that he or she asks for, while being careful of their health and future risks.
Understanding the nature of electromotive force and how it may harm humans who are exposed to it is now made easy. One can easily check out the book and even get the Kindle version of it for less than a dollar. This book lays down simple rules, dos and don’ts that tell it like it is to every parent, and suggests measures that all members of the household can inculcate with ease. This is one book which is quite small, interesting to read and simple to understand.

Cellphones Also Pose a Danger

Cell Phone Radiation Protection
Mobile phone masts or towers are not the only dangers to health because of the radiation they emit but cellular phones may also pose danger to one’s health.
The effect of mobile phone radiation on human health is the subject of recent interest and study, and as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world (as of June 2009), there were more than 4.3 billion subscriptions worldwide.
Mobile phones use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range.
Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.
The World Health Organi-sation (WHO) has classified mobile phone radiation on the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) scale into Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic.
A carcinogen denotes any substance, or radiation that is an agent directly involved in causing cancer.
This means there ‘could be some risk’ of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.
Some national radiation advisory authorities have recommended measures to minimise exposure to their citizens as a precautionary approach.
The issues of radiation and their dangers are well known to the kingdom’s Consumer Association, and the chairman Bongani Mdluli, on Tuesday this week made it known that the Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology needed a commission of inquiry to look into this.
There is growing concern internationally that the radiation from gadgets like the cellphone and cell-phone masts or towers needed to be minimised.
Many scientific studies have investigated possible health symptoms of mobile phone radiation. These studies are occasionally reviewed by some scientific committees to assess overall risks.
A recent assessment was published in 2007 by the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
Part of the radio waves emitted by a mobile telephone handset are absorbed by the human head.
The radio waves emitted by a GSM handset can have a peak power of two watts, and a US analogue phone had a maximum transmit power of 3.6 watts.
The maximum power output from a mobile phone is regulated by the mobile phone standard and by the regulatory agencies in each country.
In most systems the cellphone and the base station check reception quality and signal strength and the power level is increased or decreased automatically, within a certain span, to accommodate different situations, such as inside or outside buildings and vehicles.
The rate at which radiation is absorbed by the human body is measured by the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and its maximum levels of modern handsets have been set by governmental regulating agencies in many countries.
In 2006, a large Danish study about the connection between mobile phone use and cancer incidence was published.
It followed over 420 000 Danish citizens for 20 years and showed no increased risk of cancer.
The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz) considers this report inconclusive.
A 2009 study examined the effects of exposure to Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) emitted by standard GSM cell phones on the cognitive functions of humans.
The study confirmed longer (slower) response times to a spatial working memory task when exposed to RFR from a standard GSM cellular phone placed next to the head of male subjects, and showed that longer duration of exposure to RFR may increase the effects on performance.

Brodeur went so far as to claim that the search for the truth about the hazards of electromagnetic fields was threatened most by the “obfuscation of industry, the mendacity of the military, and the corruption of ethics that industrial and military money could purchase from various members of the medical and scientific community.”8 Suspicion spread to many other wavelengths on the nonionizing electromagnetic spectrum, producing fears about occupational exposure to electricity as well as exposure to microwave appliances, radar, video-display terminals, and even cellular telephones. Dozens of studies looked for associations with brain cancer, miscarriages, fetal-growth retardation, lymphoma, breast cancer, breast cancer in men, lung cancer, all cancers, immunologic abnormalities, and even changes in the behavior of animals.
When people hear that a scientific study has implicated something new as a cause of cancer, they get worried. They get even more worried when the exposure is called radiation and comes from dangerous-looking high-voltage power lines controlled by government and industry, which some distrust deeply. Such exposure seems eerie when people hear that electromagnetic fields penetrate their homes, their bodies, their children. The worried citizens took action. Frightened people, including parents of children with leukemia, undertook their own epidemiologic studies and fought to get high-power transmission lines moved away from their children. Congress responded with large direct appropriations for wider research on the effects of electromagnetic fields.
After a large apparently positive study in Sweden,7 the Swedish government came close to mandating the relocation of schools to at least 1000 meters from large power lines. But cooler heads prevailed once it became clear that the absolute incremental risk was small at most, the conclusions were based on a tiny fraction of all Swedish children with leukemia, and the increase in risk was found only in relation to some estimates of magnetic fields, not to the actual fields measured in children’s homes.

Cell phone towers health effects
This whole saga began when two Denver researchers, puzzled by small clusters of cancer in children, came to believe that living in close proximity to high-voltage power lines was a cause of leukemia.4 The analysis they published in 1979 was crude and relied on distances from homes to power lines and on wiring configurations rather than on direct measures of exposure to electromagnetic fields. They found that the risk of childhood leukemia was more than doubled among children living near such power lines, a finding that led to more studies and more concern. Soon activists and the media began to spread the word that electromagnetic fields cause cancer.
The hypothesized cause was exposure to extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields generated by the electrical current in power lines. Physicists understand these invisible fields well, but most physicians, parents, and patients do not. The movement of any electrical charge creates a magnetic field that can be measured.5 Even the 60-Hz residential electric current (50 Hz in Europe) creates a very weak oscillating field, which, like all magnetic fields, penetrates living tissue. These low-frequency electromagnetic fields are known as nonionizing radiation, since the amount of energy in them is far below that required to break molecular bonds such as those in DNA.
One ironic fact about low-frequency electromagnetic fields is that we live and worry about them within the Earth’s static magnetic field of 50 μT, which is hundreds of times greater than the oscillating magnetic field produced by 110/220-V current in houses (0.01 to 0.05 μT).5,6 Even directly under high-voltage transmission lines, the magnetic field is only about 3 to 10 μT, which is less than that in an electric railway car and much weaker than the magnetic field close to my head when I use an electric razor (about 60 μT).
Although most physicists find it inconceivable that power-line electromagnetic fields could pose a hazard to health, dozens of epidemiologic studies have reported weak positive associations between proximity to high-voltage power lines and the risk of cancer.6,7 The negative or equivocal studies did not end the controversy. Fear of leukemia is a powerful force, and the media response amplified the perception of electromagnetic fields as a health hazard. In 1989 The New Yorker published three articles by journalist Paul Brodeur that described in mesmerizing detail how maverick researchers had discovered a cause of cancer that the establishment refused to accept.8-10 Like many of the epidemiologic studies themselves, these widely quoted articles described biologic mechanisms of action for electromagnetic fields that were hypothetical, even fanciful.

Warning to Parents
Of critical importance to all parents is that some studies have suggested that children exposed to magnetic fields of between two and three milligauss or above experienced a significantly increased risk of developing cancer. Since ambient levels of two to three milligauss can routinely be measured in buildings within 50 to 150 feet of wires carrying strong electric current, these findings are especially troublesome.
The report leaked last October by the mellitus National Council on Radiation Protection recommended a safety limit of 0.2 microteslas, a very weak field compared to those generated by household appliances. A person standing one foot away from a vacuum cleaner or electric drill can be exposed to anywhere between two and 20 microteslas.
There is no way to block EMFs (they even penetrate lead shielding), and the only protection is distance from the source.
In our electronic age, its almost impossible to eliminate exposure to the myriad of electrical sources with which we come in contact on a daily basis.
Thousands of electric company substations are scattered throughout our cities large and small and they abut homes, apartments and office buildings — even schools. Since few of the high-voltage lines that lead into and out of these substations have been buried to prevent harmful emissions, magnetic fields of potent strength can be found virtually everywhere.
Concerns have also been raised about magnetic fields given off by faulty household wiring, by high-current conductors concealed in the walls, ceilings and floors of commercial office buildings and other large structures; and by high-voltage transformers that can be found in almost any large building.

Checks showed the operators were exposed to more electromagnetic radiation than people who work on power lines or in power stations.
In another study, Swedish researchers assessed the long-term exposure of people living near high-voltage transmission lines by taking spot measurements of the field strength in each home, and using them to confirm the accuracy of a computer model that calculated the strength of the fields emitted by each of the lines, according to distance from the lines, the wiring configurations, and the current level the lines were known to be carrying.
Then they programmed a computer with records of past current loads that had been maintained over the previous 20 years for each of the transmission lines. They were thus able to pinpoint with great accuracy EMF exposure for each cancer victim. What they found was a clear dose-response relationship between exposure to even weak power-frequency electromagnetic fields and the development of cancer, especially acute and chronic myeloid leukemia.
A second Swedish study, which also employed cases and controls, was conducted by epidemiologists. It confirmed that average magnetic field exposure over time was the critical factor in the development of disease. Interestingly, these studies were funded in part by the Swedish utility industry.
Maria Feychting of Swedens Karolinska Institute looked at 127,000 children who lived near big power lines for over 25 years and found twice the risk of leukemia.
“In our study we found about a two-fold increase in the risk if the children were living close, within 50 meters (yards) of a big power line,” she told Britain’s Channel Four television.
The new study by the University of Bristol showing that power lines can attract cancer-causing gases like radon has heightened concerns.
Even scientists who have failed to find a reason for the apparent link refuse to say it is safe to live near a high-voltage power line.
