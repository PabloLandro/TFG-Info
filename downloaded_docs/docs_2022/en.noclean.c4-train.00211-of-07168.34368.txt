Getting Pregnant after Childbirth
Getting pregnant after childbirth is not so common but some women opt for this. There are different reasons for opting for pregnancy after childbirth. Pregnancy in itself is a life altering experience for a woman where a woman undergoes the rigours of childbirth. The body needs to recuperate from the rigours of childbirth but if a woman has made her mind to get pregnant after childbirth, she has to take some precautions. Read on.There are a lot of factors that encourage couples to opt for another pregnancy right after childbirth. Most often it is found that it has got to do with an insight to the future of the children. Parents feel that the relation between the siblings is great when they are very near in the age bracket. Then there are also instances when the mother wants to get down with all the hassles surrounding child rearing at one go and then concentrate on other aspects of her life may be like career or family business. Getting pregnant soon after childbirth is of course a personal choice and there are a few points that one needs to note before embarking on the decision: Remember, That You May Not Get Pregnant Immediately While Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is considered to be a natural contraception means for a woman who is recovering from childbirth. Breastfeeding enhances the release of hormones like oxytocin that reacts upon the natural fertility status of a woman. It works on a negative feedback inhibition and thereby reducing fertility in the woman for as long as she is breastfeeding her child. However, the chances of getting pregnant while breastfeeding are not zero as you may start ovulating again after three months of your delivery. The Healing Time You need to understand that pregnancy is always a challenge for your body even if you are very healthy and fit person. So it is vital to allow your body to recuperate the rigours of childbirth. Consult your healthcare provider and obtain a proper advice on what should be the minimum time that you need to give your system to heal and brace up or another pregnancy. The system of the woman undergoes a few changes that results in using up of the energy that is stored up in the form of fats and proteins. They aid the renewal, repair and development of the damaged or affected systems brought about by the trauma of childbirth. During pregnancy the woman is naturally predisposed to some medical conditions like reduced hemoglobin levels and anemia. Even her bone marrow requires time for regeneration. So while planning your next pregnancy, you need to ensure that your body gets the required time to refill itself with a steady supply of healthy red cell that will in turn ascertain the birth of a healthy baby. It is advisable not to rush and get exposed to the risk o the development of protein imbalance in the next baby and also weaken the immune system that will subsequently expose you and the unborn baby to a host of other diseases. Check your diet and rest adequately Pregnancy results in the loss of essential nutrients and proteins. So while planning your next pregnancy, ensure that you take vitamin and mineral supplements regularly apart from a healthy diet. Similarly a good amount of rest is necessary to allow your system to get back in the usual functioning mode. Staying relaxed and stress-free is important to help your reproductive hormones function properly. Stay Romantic and Do Not Use Contraception Pregnancy brings about a lot of changes in the emotional level in both the partners. While planning another pregnancy, it is important that you embark on a rediscovery and re-exploration journey between yourselves so that you feel inclined to get intimate and enjoy it too. And obviously you need to stop using any variant of contraception. While planning pregnancy after childbirth it is also important that the male partner adapts to the changes in the woman’s body and treat her tenderly and lovingly so that she feels comfortable.

Getting pregnant after childbirth is not a good idea. There should be sufficient time for the body to heal and recover fully so I would suggest not to go in for a second pregnancy just after delivery. It is better to wait for a year or two but to each is its own.

Good information. Would like to know when can I start preparing for my second baby? My first baby is just three months old. I want to have a quick pregnancy so that both the kids grow up together. also I want to settle abroad, so if I complete my family early then settling would be easy
