Jamal Has Big Trouble from a Bug Bite
By Colleen Messina
1 Swat! When a mosquito bites, you swat it. Mosquito bites get itchy, red, and uncomfortable. Some mosquito bites cause big trouble. Mosquito bites can cause a disease called malaria.
2 Jamal, a small boy in Kenya, first got malaria when he was a baby. He was not very strong. He got sick often. He went to the hospital. Doctors gave him a drug called quinine. This drug helps people with malaria. It helped Jamal when he got sick, but it didn't keep him from getting malaria again.
3 Jamal's mother felt very scared when Jamal was sick. She said he was a playful child. When he had malaria, he didn't feel well enough to play. Sometimes in the middle of a game, Jamal would get a stomachache. He would get a headache. He even had convulsions. It was hard for Jamal's mother when he had these attacks.
