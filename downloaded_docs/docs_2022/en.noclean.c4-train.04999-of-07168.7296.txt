I have the Snow Wolf 200w TC. This thing is so fun I can hardly put it down for long. I have the limited edition with the gun metal finish. It also has the updated chip on this model. The first gen snow wolf 200 had some issues that were addressed with the new version. The only cons so far are
If you get an authentic vapor pen, rest assured that you will get decent performance. But some vaporizer pens are very cheap, and you get what you pay for. Cheaper vape pens take too long to heat up, are fragile and can even burn the material. When using cheap vapor pen, you get a burnt taste. That’s why we recommend investing in a decent vaporizer, made by a reputable manufacturer. The best vaporizer pens will give you great flavor and nice throat hits.

The main downside comes from the fact that the tank is built into the vape, so you cannot experiment with other vape tanks. But in our opinion, this isn’t a dealbreaker and can XEO Void is still a fantastic vape pen! No leaks, easy to use, and super smooth vapor.
Battery life is a major factor in choosing any electronic device these days. Since you’ll use the vape pen as a portable device, you don’t want the battery to die when you need a vape. Vape pens that support bigger batteries are also bigger in size, so there’s a tradeoff.
Vape pens for waxes and oils are the type of device that will vaporize CBD oil. Vaping CBD has become incredibly popular of late. CBD is a non-psychoactive ingredient extracted from cannabis. CBD vape pens allow you to enjoy the relaxing properties of cannabis without worrying about intoxication.

However, the FDA Commissioner improperly included KandyPens in a category with JUUL and other e-cigarette products that contain nicotine. KandyPens does not, and never has, made any pre-filled liquid nicotine pods. Rather, all KandyPens’ products are sold empty – without any liquid, e-juice, or concentrate – and are for aromatherapy purposes only. KandyPens deliberately designed its products to enable each individual user to decide what to insert into the pods and KandyPens’ products are not intended for use solely with nicotine.
We can accomplish this a few different ways. First, we diligently work to develop and craft several flavor profiles. We go through rigorous processes with a group of people who care deeply about our products. Our flavors are then tested and re-tested. Only the best of our flavor profiles are selected and sent to a group of individuals for multiple tastings and final selections. The most important detail of this process is that we have secured partnerships with elected producers of the highest quality ingredients and operations available. We also use, what we believe to be, the best nicotine provided. Once our product is fully mixed, each batch is tested for purity and taste before being sent in for bottling. Once this lengthy process is complete, and all standards have been met, we finally release our authentic, finished products to the market.

Temperature control followed on the heels of those earlier improvements. Temp control (or TC) is the most recent technological development in vaping chips that emerged initially in 2014 and has quickly become an industry standard feature of most mods.
Vape pens, also referred to as vaporizer pens, vapor pens or vape pen mods are tiny pen-shaped vaporizers. Originally vape pens were made to look like cigarettes but since then have evolved into their own thing. Vaporizer pens are typically powered by a small battery that screws onto a tank or atomizer that contains a heating coil system. The vaporizer pen is then loaded up with nicotine-containing liquid and when the button is pressed, the battery engages the coil and vapor happens.
Some of the models are 3 in one vape pen and come with interchangeable parts or multi-function parts that can be used for vaping more than one type of material. If you think you may want to experiment, this type would be the best for you.
Vape pens come in different varieties to suit any person looking for a portable device with clouds and pure flavor. There are e-liquid vape pens, concentrate vape pens, and dry herb vape pens. Some vape pens can do both concentrate and e-liquid. It all depends on your atomizer cartridge and the base of the vape pen.
The Series 3X has made significant improvements to the Series 3 including increased battery life capacity, variable voltage options, battery indication and an improved e-liquid system. Both pens are cross compatible with each other so you can use your existing herb/wax/e-liquid pods.
Coil-less – Coilless atomizers do away with coils altogether. Coil-less vape pens feature bucket-shaped atomizers. Material is heated more efficiently this way, making for smoother, tastier vapor. Cleaning is also easier with coil-less atomizers.
Hi Amanda. I wouldn’t get the iStick 50W, as it had some autofiring issues. Any of the other three are solid choices. The Subox Mini has a larger tank than the Nano, but the Nano is slightly sleeker in terms of the design of the box itself. The Evic Mini looks great as well and you can’t go wrong with any of those three you mentioned.
The mod is constructed from zinc alloy with carbon fiber decals. It has a luxury look and feel for fans of luxury cars and watches. Its centered 510 pin lets you to use up to 30 mm atomizers without overhang. The user interface is simple to operate, and its large screen is very easy to read.
Ceramic Rod – Like quartz, ceramic is inert, so it doesn’t affect the flavor and aroma of vapor. Vape pens with ceramic rods heat materials slowly and lowly, so little combustion occurs. Expect comfortable, delicious vapor.
The right type of coil matters for your style of vaping. E-liquid and concentrates often use single or double coils. High quality concentrate vape pens use quartz rods for a pure flavor experience. Ceramic rods are also used in high quality concentrate vape pens. Users can also find ceramic coil-less atomizers exclusively for dry herb vape pens.

I have the IPV4S and to me it is all I could need. Fingerprints do get on the screen but that’s not a big deal to me. I love it so much I can never put it down. I always have my dripper on it (a mutation x v2) and I can go to 120 with it but I always keep it at around 65 I found is the sweet spot with my coils. To me it could be a little better but im not one to complain I love to see people recognizing it thank you.
Vape juice with nicotine is the most common variety, but there are various strengths up to and including zero nicotine. These are typically written out in mg amounts, going up by 3 from 0mg. If you are unsure of the level of nicotine you are looking for, check out our article on nicotine strength levels.
Vape pens come in all shapes, designs, and colors, from simple pens to extremely stylish ones like the Series 3X. While appearance doesn’t have anything to do with the performance of the pen, and some obnoxious looking pens might outperform their much better-looking counterparts. However, some people want to own only elegant gadgets, even vape pens.
Let me start off with saying “Thank you”. Thanks to everyone who was part of the making of the “K Vape” vaporizer. In all my experiences with various Portable Vapes, this is by far the best vaporizer on the market today. I have never experienced such an awesome experience in my entire years of vaping, to add I was vaping on the first level with no issues, that’s right NO ISSUES whatsoever. Regard
The internal lithium-ion battery provides power to the vape pen and causes it to conduct any liquid or dry herb of your choosing. The battery also houses any functions for all-in-one devices such as a power button and/or temperature control buttons. Pen-shaped vape pens usually carry on average a 700 mAh battery capacity. With a high electrical resistance coil in your atomizer, these batteries can last hours before it needs another charge.
Hey guys. I’m looking to do an upgrade. I have the iStick TC40W with an Atlantis V2. The battery life sucks and I’m just not getting quite the flavor out of the combo that I was told I would get. I’m looking for something a lot better, keeping short of rebuilding coils and dripping. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
All vape pens contain some kind of battery that powers the device. Next there is either going to be either an herb chamber for cannabis, or a coil that vaporizes e-liquid or wax. When the user engages the battery, it sends power to the heating coil or heating chamber.

Even cannabis users have been switching over to vaping to avoid the harmful side-effects of combustion. Today they have vaporizer pens made for wax and dry herb. The dry herb vape pens utilize a heating chamber to vaporize your herb.
Temperature control addresses both those problems by regulating and controlling the amount of power supplied to the coil. When the coil is not “bathed” sufficiently in e-liquid, it quickly overheats, producing dry hits. Temp control technology doesn’t actually sense temperature — instead, it monitors the changing resistance of the coil, which corresponds to predictable changes in temperature. When the coil begins to overheat, the temp control chip instantly reduces the power, thus preventing the wick from burning and minimizing or eliminating dry hits. If the coil becomes totally dry, power will be completely cut off.
Today’s vape mods are sophisticated devices, often supporting advanced features such as temperature control, variable wattage and tracking functionality. You don’t need this tech to get a great vape, but it helps!
Vape pens for dry herbs use heat to extract the active ingredients of herbs and botanicals. Very popular for medical marijuana patients, dry herb vaporizers allow for accessing active ingredients without combustion.
Size is a large factor in purchasing a vape pen. Think about your lifestyle. If you are a construction worker, you probably want to consider a larger device that is durable and will last the duration of your work day and possibly more. If you are a student and always on the go, you will want a smaller device that can fit safely in a pants pocket or small book bag pocket. If you are looking for a stealthy device, the smaller vape pens will accommodate your needs. Larger vape pens are usually saved for at-home vaping, but will provide lots of power and battery life as well.
SUB-OHM: Some devices might come with sub-ohm resistance coils. Extra safety precautions should be practiced when using a sub ohm device. Sub-ohm coils will only work on a device capable of firing sub ohm atomizers and coils. You must also ensure that your batteries can handle sub ohm atomizers and coils. Improper use can lead to damage or injury. MistHub is not responsible for any damage caused by the misuse and/or mishandling of sub-ohm devices. Check out our Tutorial Section where you can learn more about the different kinds of devices and tips on how to use them safely.
