Benefits of Taking Ginger
Jermane Cooper
When it comes to ‘superfoods,’ ginger is easily among the most popular. This spice, often incorrectly referred to as a root, is closely related to other foods such as turmeric, and cardamom, and it is especially popular in Asian cuisine and medicine. While in these cultures, it is not uncommon to find ginger in baked goods and other meals, it is also possible to simply consume ginger juice instead, and still reap the benefits from this nutrient powerhouse. Are you unfamiliar with the benefits of ginger? Read on to discover 11 ways that drinking ginger can positively impact your health.
Treating Nausea
One thing ginger excels at exceptionally well is the treatment of nausea. Whether it’s about of morning sickness, a hangover from drinking too much alcohol, or even just an upset stomach, taking ginger orally can help soothe your digestive system, reducing feelings of sickness and the chance of vomiting. There is some research to suggest that even nausea caused by chemotherapy or HIV/AIDS treatments can also be remedied by taking ginger. Keep in mind, however, that in the case of pregnancy, it is important to consult your doctor before taking any medication, herb, or supplement to assess associated risks.
Treating Dizziness
Similarly to nausea, dizziness caused by vertigo can also be remedied by a healthy dose of ginger. Vertigo causes a general sense that one is off balance, and that can make standing, and even sitting incredibly difficult. Vertigo has many causes, but regardless of its source, the symptoms are much the same. It is not uncommon for one to feel like they are spinning, or being pulled to one side, along with general dizziness, nausea, headaches, hearing loss, and the urge to vomit. Fortunately, taking ginger tea or juice can help soothe all of these symptoms.
