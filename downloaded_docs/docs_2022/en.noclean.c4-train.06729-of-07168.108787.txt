Why Grapefruit And Some Medications Don't Mix
Written by Opal Tribble
I love grapefruit. They are a nutrient powerhouse. Not only are they are an excellent source of fiber, they are also a great source of antioxidants such as Vitamin A, and Vitamin C. But, despite their excellent qualities, grapefruit can be harmful to some who take medication.
Grapefruit also contains chemicals that can interfere with enzymes that breaks down certain drugs in your digestive system. When this happens, the medication enters the bloodstream at unacceptable levels. This can increase your chances of developing side effects.
According to a study published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a group of natural chemicals named furanocoumarins was likely the culprit. Originally, scientists thought that flavonoids were the culprit for this interference.
Grapefruit Most Commonly Interacts With Drugs Taken For:
Allergies
Anxiety
Depression
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
HIV
Impotence
Seizures
If you are taking drugs for any of the above conditions avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice unless approved by your pharmacist or family internist.
