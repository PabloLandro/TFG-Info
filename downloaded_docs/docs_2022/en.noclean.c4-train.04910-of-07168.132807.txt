Hemorrhoid remedy: anal plug?
gaiafool asked on Fri, 08 Dec, 2006
I can't find anything about this on the Internet, but I know I read it in an alternative remedies book years ago. I tried it myself once when I had an especially bad hemorroid and it worked miracles. I sat in a hot bathtub and gently inserted the anal plug and left it in for 15 minutes or so. I'm trying to find a description of this online, that is not sexually oriented, and so far have had no luck. I would like something "clean" that I can send to a friend.

HI There Here are some ideas to rid of the issue. Cause Hemorrhoids are often the result of poor diet, constipation or a sluggish bowel, straining during bowel movements, chronic low-level dehydration, lack of exercise, and/or a sedentary lifestyle. Correcting these factors can be very helpful in preventing and eliminating hemorrhoids. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Natural Cures Aromatherapy: Cypress, juniper, frankincense, or niaouli. Ayurveda: Drink 1/2 cup of aloe vera juice three times daily until symptoms clear. The Ayurvedic herbal compound triphala is also very effective for relieving hemorrhoid pain and for promoting the overall health of the gastrointestinal tract. Diet: Eat an organic, whole foods diet that emphasizes high-fiber foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables (especially dark green, leafy vegetables, such as kale), grains such as brown rice and millet, and lean, organic meats and poultry. Also drink plenty of healthy beverages, such as herbal teas, fresh squeezed juice, and pure, filtered water. Flower Essences: Rescue Remedy Cream® can be applied to external hemorrhoids to ease symptoms. Herbs: The aptly named herb pilewort is a staple treatment for hemorrhoids in Europe because of its effectiveness in reducing hemorrhoid symptoms. Collinsonia is another highly effective herbal remedy for hemorrhoids. As a topical application, mix 10 ml of collinsonia tincture with 80 ml of distilled witch hazel and apply this combination after every bowel motion and as needed. Other useful herbs include bilberry, buckthorn bark, butcher`s broom, comfrey root, gotu kola, parsley, passionflower, and stone root. Homeopathy: Aloe, Hamamelis, Nux vom., Berberis, Acidum fluor., and Thuja are helpful homeopathic remedies. Hydrotherapy: Hydrotherapy is the application of water, ice, steam and hot and cold temperatures to maintain and restore health. Treatments include full body immersion, steam baths, saunas, sitz baths, colonic irrigation and the application of hot and/or cold compresses. Hydrotherapy is effective for treating a wide range of conditions and can easily be used in the home as part of a self-care program. Many Naturopathic Physicians, Physical Therapists and Day Spas use Hydrotherapy as part of treatment. I suggest several at-home hydrotherapy treatments Juice Therapy: The following juice combinations can help keep the bowels regular and soften stools: carrot, spinach, celery, and parsley; carrot and watercress; or beet juice. Nutritional Supplementation: The following nutrients can help prevent and reverse hemorrhoids: vitamin C with bioflavonoids and rutin, vitamin A, beta carotene, vitamin B complex, folic acid, essential fatty acids, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Linseed oil (one teaspoon upon arising and at night) can also be used to help soften stools. Topical Treatment: Apply a combination of zinc oxide, vitamin E, and aloe vera gel or olive oil to the affected area. Witch hazel applied topically can help shrink hemorrhoids, while calendula ointment can help relieve pain and itching. Alternative Professional Care If your symptoms persist despite the above measures, seek the help of a qualified health professional. The following professional care therapies have all been shown to be useful for treating hemorrhoids: Acupuncture, Applied Kinesiology, Bodywork, Detoxification Therapy, Environmental Medicine, Guided Imagery, Light Therapy, Magnetic Field Therapy, Naturopathic Medicine, Osteopathy, Oxygen Therapy (Ozone insufflation), Qigong, Prolotherapy, Reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Yoga Best of health to both of you
