Weight Loss Chewing Gum
Appetite Suppressant Chewing Gum
Appetite Suppressant Gum
Originally developed in the late 90’s, appetite suppressant diet chewing gum is usually sugar free and contains a chromium compound, which according to certain research is an effective aid for weight loss and regulates fat deposition. This claim remains unproven.
On the contrary:
Appetite suppressant diet gum includes artificial sweeteners which may slow down the digestive process and increase appetite. Such sweeteners may also increase our sweet tooth.
Chewing stimulates the pancreas to make digestive enzymes and can increase feelings of hunger which might lead us to eat more than we need.
Verdict
Whether or not chromium is linked to weight loss, appetite suppressant gum is not the answer to your weight problem. Successful weight loss requires long term diet modification, not chewing gum. Besides, appetite is a natural bodily function. It should be properly satisfied not suppressed by chewing gum.
