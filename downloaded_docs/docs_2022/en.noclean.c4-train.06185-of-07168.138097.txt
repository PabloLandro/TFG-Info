Warning Signs of an Impacted Wisdom Tooth
Posted on March 2, 2017 | Leave a comment
Somewhere between the ages of 18-24 your wisdom teeth begin to erupt. Depending on how these teeth come in will depend if they need to be removed. It’s not necessary for you to get your wisdom teeth removed if they are correctly positioned in your mouth and do not cause any pain or dental problems. However, 85 percent of adults have their wisdom teeth removed to protect their over all oral health. Unfortunately, the eruption of wisdom teeth can be a painful experience that disrupts your daily life.
Common Symptoms of Impacted Wisdom Teeth
Swollen gums that are tender and bleeding
An impacted wisdom tooth can make your gums swollen and tender to the touch. They may even start to bleed. This can make brushing and flossing feel like an impossible task. As other dental issues can create the same symptoms, it is important to make an appointment with your dentist to have the situation evaluated.
Swollen Glands
Many times swollen glands accompany impacted wisdom teeth. Most times these glands are located in your shoulders and neck area.
Pain in the back of the mouth
An impacted tooth or teeth can cause you an immense amount of pain. As the tooth or teeth that are impacted continue to try and erupt, your pain and symptoms can become worse. The pain should be at its worse towards the back of the mouth but could in fact radiate down your jaw. The best way to diagnose a suspected emerging wisdom tooth is to visit your dentist.
Swelling around jaw
With swelling of your gums, many times impacted wisdom teeth can cause your jaw to swell. As the symptoms progress, your mouth may become difficult to open.
What happens if you ignore the problem?
I highly recommend that you do not ignore the problem. When impacted wisdom teeth are not removed, there could be complications. Impacted teeth can force other teeth out of place. They also can cause infection. Impacted wisdom teeth are prone to infection and decay so left untreated you could be looking at a serious problem down the line.

Are Wisdom Teeth a Problem?
Posted on February 8, 2016 | Leave a comment
Your wisdom teeth don’t make themselves known until you have nearly reached adulthood. Usually between the ages of 17-25. The name “Wisdom Teeth” was adopted as these teeth don’t arrive until you have reached, what is considered the “age of wisdom”.
Are Wisdom Teeth a Problem?
Wisdom teeth are not always an issue. Not everyone needs to have them removed. If your wisdom teeth are healthy and properly aligned, there is no reason for fuss at all. As a matter of fact, about 30 percent of people are missing one or more of their wisdom teeth.
Issues With Wisdom Teeth
Unfortunately, for many of us, the need to have one or more wisdom teeth removed during a lifetime is likely. It is estimated that 85 percent of all people will need to visit the oral surgeon sometime in their life in relation to a wisdom tooth/teeth. Often, wisdom teeth do not grow in properly. If a wisdom tooth does not make it to a normal position, it can cause problems with chewing, damage adjacent teeth or periodontal problems. Your dentist can make an assessment and recommend an oral surgeon if necessary.
What is an Impacted Wisdom Tooth
An impacted wisdom tooth is a tooth that becomes stuck under the gum or partially emerges from the gum. Impacted wisdom teeth unfortunately are a common occurrence. Depending on the person, they may or may not cause pain. When your wisdom tooth is trying to emerge, it can cause your gum to become inflamed and swollen. When emerging, they can also cause pain in your face, other teeth or ears.
Signs of an Emerging Wisdom Tooth
Swelling of the gum in the back of your mouth
Difficulty opening your jaw
Bad breath
A bad taste in the mouth
Pain when you open your mouth
Pain when chewing or biting
The best way to know if your wisdom teeth are a problem is by visiting your dentist. Regular check ups can avoid big problems later.

Tips For Recovering from Wisdom Teeth Removal
Posted on May 1, 2013 | 1 comment
What Does Recovery Involve After Wisdom Teeth Are Pulled?
After having your wisdom teeth removed, the speed of your recovery depends on the degree of difficulty of the extraction (a simple extraction of a fully erupted tooth versus a tooth impacted into the jawbone). In general, here’s what to expect.
During the first 24 hours
Bleeding may occur for several hours after tooth extraction. To control it, position a piece of clean moist gauze over the empty tooth socket and bite down firmly. Apply constant pressure for about 45 minutes. A moistened tea bag is an effective alternative. The tannic acid in tea helps healing blood clots to form (blood clots function similarly to scab over an open wound). Repeat this process if a small degree of bleeding continues; if heavy bleeding continues to occur, contact your dentist or oral surgeon. Avoid rinsing or spitting for 24 hours after tooth extraction, avoid “sucking” actions (for example, don’t drink beverages through straws or smoke) and avoid hot liquids (such as coffee or soup). These activities can dislodge the clot, causing a dry socket to develop.
Facial swelling in the area where the tooth was extracted typically occurs. To minimize swelling, place a piece of ice, wrapped in a cloth, on that area of your face on a schedule of 10 minutes on, followed by 20 minutes off. Repeat as necessary during this first 24-hour period.
Pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), can be taken for minor pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe more potent pain relievers, if necessary.
Antibiotics that may have been prescribed prior to tooth extraction (to treat any active infection around the wisdom tooth to be extracted) should continue to be taken until the full prescription is gone.
Foods should be restricted to a liquid diet until all the numbness from anesthesia has worn off. Eat soft foods for a few days. Also avoid alcohol if you’re also taking narcotic pain medication.
Continue to brush your teeth, but avoid the teeth directly neighboring the extracted tooth during the first 24 hours. On day two, resume the gentle brushing of your teeth. Do not use commercial mouth rinses — these can irritate the extraction site.
After 24 hours
Facial swelling in the area of the tooth extraction should be treated with heat after the first 24 hours of ice. Apply a moist warm towel to the area on a 20-minute on, 20-minute off schedule. Repeat as necessary.
Rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) after meals and before bed. Do not use commercial mouth rinses.
Stitches, if used and if not of the self-dissolving type, need to be removed by your oral health care provider in about 1 week. If you do require stitches, ask what type you have been given.
Watch for signs of dry socket. Dry socket is a common complication that occurs when either a blood clot has failed to form in the extracted tooth socket or else the blood clot that did form has been dislodged. Without clot formation, healing will be delayed. When it happens, dry socket typically occurs 3 or 4 days following the extraction and is accompanied by pain (ranging from “dull” to moderate to severe) and a foul mouth odor. Your dentist or oral surgeon will treat the dry socket by placing medication in the socket.
Complete healing doesn’t occur for a few weeks to a few months following the extraction. However, usually within the first week or two, enough healing has taken place for use of your mouth to be reasonably comfortable in the area of the extraction. Your dentist will explain what to expect in your specific case.
