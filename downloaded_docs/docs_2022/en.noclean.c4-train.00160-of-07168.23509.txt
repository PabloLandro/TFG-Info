Regular Exercise To Lower Cholesterol
Regular Exercise To Lower Cholesterol
Moss Greene
A regular, daily exercise program is vitally important to lowering cholesterol. You don’t have to join a health club or start running marathons. Thirty minutes of vigorous walking at least three days a week (preferably five to seven) is more than enough to make a positive difference in your cholesterol count.
Always look for other ways to increase your physical activity. Park your car as far away from the supermarket as possible. Use stairs rather than escalators and elevators. You can add variety to your routine by walking one day, swimming the next and going for an occasional bike ride. Join a local hiking club for outdoor fun and companionship. On rainy days, you can do your walking in an indoor shopping mall or use an exercise video/DVD. And, by all means, enjoy your exercise.
