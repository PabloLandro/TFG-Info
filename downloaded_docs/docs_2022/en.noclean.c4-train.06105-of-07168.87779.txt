Fruit juice 'not linked to type two diabetes'
05/09/2007
A new study has found that 100 per cent fruit juices are not significantly associated with an increased risk of type two diabetes.
Researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts decided to explore the relationship between common drinks and insulin resistance - a precursor to type two diabetes - in 2,500 healthy men and women.
They found that people who consume pure fruit juices are not at a higher risk of developing insulin resistance.
However, consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks appears to be associated with insulin resistance, even in adults who are otherwise healthy.
Senior author Dr Paul Jacques, professor at the university's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, revealed: 'Study participants who consumed two or more sugar-sweetened beverages per day had significantly higher fasting blood levels of insulin as compared to participants who did not report consuming any such beverages, regardless of age, sex, weight, smoking status, or other dietary habits.'
The expert explained that people with higher fasting levels of insulin are more at risk of developing type two diabetes.
'In contrast, consumption of 100 per cent fruit juice was not significantly related to any of our measures of insulin resistance,' he noted.
The experts advise that consumers should limit their intake of sweetened, nutrient-poor beverages and drink more water instead.
