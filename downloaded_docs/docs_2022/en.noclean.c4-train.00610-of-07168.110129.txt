Do Cell Phones Cause Cancer?
The Official Answer, says a study of more than 5,100 people published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, is no. But consumer advocates and some researchers have questioned the results. Among concerns:
The study did show that about 10 percent of people who used cell phones for at least 30 minutes a day for at least ten years had a "substantially" higher risk of some type of brain cancer than those who did not use a cell phone.
Other research showed mixed results, according to Max Wizniter MD, a pediatric neurologist at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital of Cleveland. The reasoning is that previous studies were done on analog phones, which are rare these days. They emit a higher amount of energy than the more current digital phones most in use today.
Although Dr. Wizniter has concluded that there is no association between cell phone use and brain cancer, he says some things you can do if you are concerned-first, keep the conversation short and secondly, use a hands free device.
Text messaging was not included in these studies.
