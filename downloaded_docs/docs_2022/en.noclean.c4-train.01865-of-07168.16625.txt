The ADEXUSDx® Methanol Dip Test is an enzymatic assay used for the qualitative detection of methanol above an established cut-off in human whole blood, plasma, or serum samples in clinical laboratory settings as an aid for healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of methanol overdose. Poisoning by methanol leads to severe metabolic acidosis and a delay in treatment may result in permanent blindness and potential death. This test meets the needs of healthcare professionals faced with the challenge when laboratory testing is not readily available. Methanol is used primarily for the manufacture of other chemicals and as a solvent. It is added to a variety of other commercial and consumer products like windshield washing fluid, de-icing solution, solid canned fuels, paint remover, etc. It is also present in alcoholic drinks as a congener. Toxicity occurs as a result of accidental ingestion or overdose. It is readily absorbed in the GI tract with peak levels attained in 20-90 minutes and metabolized in the liver to formaldehyde, then to formic acid, and excreted as carbon dioxide and water. Accumulation of formic acid is responsible for the toxicity of methanol poisoning. The most serious toxic manifestations are visual impairment ultimately resulting in permanent blindness, metabolic acidosis, coma, and even death. Since antidotes are available, early diagnosis is important because prompt and effective treatment can decrease both morbidity and mortality.
