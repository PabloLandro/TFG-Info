What is a urinary tract infection?
Urinary tract infections (UTI) can be very painful but are easily treatable with antibiotics. Here are the causes and treatments for this condition.

What is urinary tract infection?
A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system, including kidneys, bladder and urethra. Most infections occur in the lower urinary tract; the bladder and the urethra.
Women are at considerably greater risk of developing a UTI than are men, with about five per cent per year developing UTI symptoms. The risk for men increases with age, with the frequency similar in men and women over 60.
The condition ranges from cystitis (a mild but distressing inflammation that is limited to the bladder) to severe infections of the kidney, such as pyelonephritis (when the infection has reached the kidney tissue itself).

How do you treat urinary tract infection?
Infection limited to your bladder can be uncomfortable, and symptoms can worsen considerably if a UTI spreads to your kidneys.
Doctors typically treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. But you can take steps to reduce your chances of getting a UTI in the first place.
⚠️ Drinking cranberry juice has traditionally been recommended for treating cystitis, but large studies suggest it does not make a significant difference.
Treatment depends on how and why the infection shows itself. Most patients respond rapidly to antibiotic therapy and are unlikely to have any other urinary tract abnormality.
A high fluid intake is essential. Alkaline substances, such as citrates, taken in water might improve symptoms. By making the urine more alkaline, they make the environment more hostile to bacterial growth and improve the results of antibiotic therapy.

UTI symptoms
Symptoms differ, depending on whether the infection affects the lower (bladder and urethra) or upper (kidneys and ureters) parts of the urinary tract.
⚠️ Urine infections are more common in the elderly, due to poor bladder emptying, an enlarged prostate, or incontinence associated with stroke or dementia.
Common UTI symptoms include:
Generally feeling tired and unwell
Cloudy or foul smelling urine
Increased need to urinate
Pain or burning sensation when urinating
Blood in your urine
Lower abdominal pain
In older men, generalised symptoms such as confusion and incontinence can be present.

When should you visit your doctor?
Contact your doctor if you develop any of the signs and symptoms of a UTI.
UTIs are rare in men, so all cases require investigation.
⚠️ Prostatitis, the infection or inflammation of the prostate (a gland beneath the bladder that produces some components of semen), causes symptoms that can be mistaken for UTI in men.
What causes UTI?
In healthy men and women, urine is sterile (contains no micro-organisms). The most important factor in maintaining the sterility of the urinary tract is emptying the bladder completely and frequently.
The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Several factors can make this process more likely to occur:
Obstruction:
enlarged prostate
gland urethral stricture (narrowing).
Neurological conditions:
spina bifida
multiple sclerosis
spinal cord injury.
Structural bladder disease:
diverticula (small sacs or bulges) in the bladder wall
tumour.
Abnormal urine drainage:
horseshoe kidney
obstruction by kidney stones or bladder stones
polycystic kidney
bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys).
Foreign body:
instrumentation (ie during a procedure)
catheters and stents.
Underlying disease:
diabetes
steroid therapy.
UTIs are classified as either community acquired or hospital acquired. 70 per cent of infections are community acquired, usually caused by the bacteria Escherichia coli (E coli) from the patient's own bowels.
Hospital acquired infections are usually E. Coli, but Pseudomonas and Staphlococci are important causes, particularly when a surgical instrument such as a catheter is used; instrumentation is the predisposing factor.
Hospital infections can often be due to multiple organisms, and antibiotic resistance is a common problem.

Recurrent UTI
If UTIs keep occurring, identification and treatment of the underlying cause is essential.
Patients who have the same infection coming back can be managed successfully by attending to 'bladder toilet' (drinking 2 to 3 litres of fluid daily and always passing urine at bedtime and after sex).
Drinking 250 to 500ml of fluid daily and avoidance of bubble baths may also help. If these measures fail, six months of continuous therapy with low dose antibiotics is usually required.
