Just want to throw a question out there.
You know when you chat to someone and they tell you something that sounds so ridiculous it could be true, well the other day a lady told me her Dad used to spray WD40 onto his joints to help with his Arthritis. Has anyone ever heard of this before or was she winding me up?
Thanks
Daneko.

I have read something like this before;
In America, and a man asked a mechanic friend if he knew of anything he could use for his arthritic joints, the mechanic replied that he used WD40 on rusty joints, and joked perhaps he should try it. The man had used everything else, and decided to give it a go. He said it worked.
However, like you, I wondered if it was a wind up.
Doesn't appeal to me though ......

Its not a wind up ,as far as I know . I say that because my wife delivers papers to an elderly farmer widower , who does the same with WD 40 , and still does ,I believe .

Hi
I recall seeing a series of programmes on the TV last year where unusual methods were used to treat ailments; I clearly recall a man who used WD40 on his joints and swore by it.

I know that some types of rust prevention products contain a type of fish oil, so maybe its not so ridiculous. Not sure I'd try it myself.

Of course it won't work, except on a psychological level.
WD40 isn't actually a lubricant, that's a common misconception; it's actually a substance that dissolves grease and dirt which can help loosen up things where rubbish/rust has built up, as well as dispersing any water.
Even from a normal mechanical perspective, the joints would still need to be properly greased/lubricated after using WD40.
