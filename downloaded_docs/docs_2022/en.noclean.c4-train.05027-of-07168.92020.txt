Metabolic and Genetic Screening of Electromagnetic Hypersensitive Subjects as a Feasible Tool for Diagnostics and Intervention
Growing numbers of "electromagnetic hypersensitive" (EHS) people worldwide self-report severely disabling, multiorgan, non-specific symptoms when exposed to low-dose electromagnetic radiations, often associated with symptoms of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) and/or other environmental "sensitivity-related illnesses" (SRI). This cluster of chronic inflammatory disorders still lacks validated pathogenetic mechanism, diagnostic biomarkers, and management guidelines. We hypothesized that SRI, not being merely psychogenic, may share organic determinants of impaired detoxification of common physic-chemical stressors. Based on our previous MCS studies, we tested a panel of 12 metabolic blood redox-related parameters and of selected drug-metabolizing-enzyme gene polymorphisms, on 153 EHS, 147 MCS, and 132 control Italians, confirming MCS altered (P < 0.050.0001) glutathione-(GSH), GSH-peroxidase/S-transferase, and catalase erythrocyte activities. We first described comparablethough mildermetabolic pro-oxidant/proinflammatory alterations in EHS with distinctively increased plasma coenzyme-Q10 oxidation ratio. Severe depletion of erythrocyte membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids with increased ω6/ω3 ratio was confirmed in MCS, but not in EHS. We also identified significantly (P = 0.003) altered distribution-versus-control of the CYP2C19∗1/∗2 SNP variants in EHS, and a 9.7-fold increased risk (OR: 95% C.I. = 1.374.5) of developing EHS for the haplotype (null)GSTT1 + (null)GSTM1 variants. Altogether, results on MCS and EHS strengthen our proposal to adopt this blood metabolic/genetic biomarkers' panel as suitable diagnostic tool for SRI.
Having previously found no significant difference between MCS patients and controls, in the distribution of GST isoenzyme genotypes [23], in the GST study we now compared EHS and healthy controls. Differently from our previous results on MCS, we here identified a mutated (null) allele combination of GSTT1 and GSTM1 variants able to predict risk of developing EHS by a 9.7 fold versus CTR
Our findings will hopefully contribute, in combination with the so-far putative genetic-risk factors, a better molecular definition of environmental-borne sensitivity-related illnesses and a tool to discriminate single SRI comorbidities, based on sufficiently proven molecular evidences able to gain clinical consensus.

The Alarming Ways EMFs Are Changing Your Brain
Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans.
Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.

Parents of schoolgirl Jenny Fry are campaigning to have WiFi restricted in schools following her Death
During the inquest, Mrs Fry said Jenny had first started showing symptoms of electro-hypersensitivity (EHS) around November 2012, including tiredness, nausea, headaches and bladder problems. It was the time Jenny's parents briefly had WiFi connected to their home and, said Mrs Fry, that Chipping Norton School had WiFi installed.
"Jenny was getting ill and so was I. I did some research and found how dangerous WiFi could be so I had it taken out of the house. Both Jenny and I were fine at home but Jenny continued to be ill at school in certain areas.

Toxic Mold and Electromagnetic Radiation
The unprotected mold plate showed a dramatic increase in the number of biotoxins produced  more than 600 times! Dr. Klinghardt concludes that indoor mold contaminants as well as other biotoxins (such as those found in Lyme Disease), are highly sensitive to electromagnetic fields. EMFs therefore easily step up neurotoxin production and have a major impact on the immune system.

Arizona Smart Meters Only Last Seven Years
Epic Fail!  APS Is Replacing All Its "Smart" Meters
Information & Perspective by Warren Woodward
Sedona, Arizona ~ November 22, 2015
Several points I have made about APS's toxic "smart" meter boondoggle have been verified once again. Last week I received news from an alert Phoenix couple that APS was already replacing all the "smart" meters it had installed in their neighborhood only seven years previous.
Upon hearing this news I phoned APS and learned that APS has hired subcontractors from a company headquartered in Virginia called Apex Covantage to replace all of APS's Elster brand "smart" meters with Landis & Gyr ones. The explanation I was given for this so-called "upgrade" is that the 2G cellular system that the Elsters use will soon be obsolete. APS informed me that they intend to change out the "smart" meters in their entire service territory by December of next year.
With roughly 1.2 million customers, this so-called "upgrade" will be quite a payday for APS.
The so-called "upgrade" is really an upgrade to APS's rate base.
The rate base is the sum total of APS's expenditures on which by law APS gets a guaranteed rate of return. In other words, the more APS spends, the more money they make. The enormous and never ending costs of the "smart" grid are why customers always get a hefty rate increase whenever and wherever the "smart" grid is installed. Count on a sizable rate increase at APS's next rate case.
I have long made the point to the corrupt and incompetent Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), who are supposed to be regulating APS, that APS has a perverse incentive to spend money, and that this perverse incentive was a motivating factor behind APS's "smart" grid boondoggle. I proved that the "smart" grid would never pencil out for ratepayers by providing the ACC with the statements of several state attorneys general who had done cost/benefit analyses, a cost/benefit by accounting firm Ernst & Young for Germany, and an evaluation by Massachusetts' largest utility. I also provided the ACC with plenty of examples of utilities that had received rate increases after installing the "smart" grid. The ACC cared not.
Additionally, I have long made the point that "smart" meter technology, unlike the tried and true analog (electro-mechanical) system, would be the gift that keeps on giving to APS due to the endless costly "upgrades" the "smart" grid would require. For example, last January I wrote the ACC (on page 12, here: http://images.edocket.azcc.gov/docketpdf/0000159183.pdf ):
Then there's the shorter lifespan that "smart" meters have. According to electric meter testing equipment and services company, Tesco:
"Electro-Mechanical Meters typically lasted 30 years and more. Electronic AMI meters are typically envisioned to have a life span of fifteen years and given the pace of technology advances in metering are not expected to last much longer than this. This means entire systems are envisioned to be exchanged every fifteen years or so."
(Meter Operations in a Post AMI World, Slide 5, http://www.slideshare.net/bravenna/meter-operations-in-a-post-ami-world-36336258?related=1 )
There's a big financial difference between meters that last "30 years and more" and meters  plus "entire systems"  that "are envisioned to be exchanged every fifteen years or so," especially when the meters that last half as long cost about 10 times more!
Even a 15 year lifespan is probably wishful thinking. APS has admitted to replacing 32,000 faulty "smart" meters from January 1st through August 31st in 2014 alone (see p. 4 here: http://images.edocket.azcc.gov/docketpdf/0000156835.pdf ).
The ACC has lost sight of the fact that APS has an incentive to spend money since they get a guaranteed return on their rate base. All of the above should have been considered before the first "smart" meter was installed.
As it turns out, APS's Elster "smart" meters did not even last 15 years. The ones just replaced in Phoenix lasted 7 years. APS's Elster "smart" meters installed in Sedona and the Verde Valley in 2014 will end up being replaced in 2016, a two year life. Be sure to thank the corrupt and incompetent ACC when your electric bill increases to pay for this foolish, colossal waste, waste that the ACC was warned about repeatedly but, negligently, only encouraged.
The ridiculously short life of "smart" meters is not a fluke unique to APS's Elsters. Testifying just last month before a joint hearing of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Energy and the U.S. House Subcommittee on Research and Technology, Bennett Gaines, Senior Vice President, Corporate Services and Chief Information Officer of FirstEnergy (the nation's largest investor owned utility with 6 million customers) said this about "smart" meters: "These devices have a life of between 5 to 7 years." (See him say it at 1:40:56 in the hearing's video minutes, here: https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-energy-and-subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing .)
By the way, Gaines is not a "smart" meter critic. His company uses "smart" meters (not the Elster brand), and his company got a federal "stimulus" grant for them.
There's more.
APS's new Landis & Gyr "smart" meters will be transmitting microwave radiation at roughly four times the strength of the Elsters, a 300% increase. So watch for more people getting sick, and watch for more interference with other wireless stuff. For example, our ceiling fans are already getting their speed and direction adjusted  thanks to our neighbor's APS "smart" meter  from a distance of more than 30 yards away. I wonder what else we'll have to look forward to when our neighbors get their "upgrade."
By the way, using a Gigahertz Solutions HF35C microwave analyzer, I have measured the microwave radiation of our neighbor's APS "smart" meter from inside our house. In our house it is three times the intensity of the microwave radiation that the huge cell towers one half mile away on Airport Mesa transmit into our house. So, utility claims of how weak "smart" meter microwave radiation is are just lies.
There's more.
The explanation I was given by APS  the one about the 2G cellular network becoming obsolete  could be a reason for APS to replace its collector "smart" meters (what APS calls "Gatekeepers"), but not all its "smart" meters everywhere. According to previous statements by APS, there is roughly one Gatekeeper for every 500 regular, or "Node," "smart" meters. The Gatekeepers collect the data from the other 500 and send it to APS via the 2G network. Since Node meters don't use 2G to communicate, and since Landis & Gyr and Elster are compatible as far as communication goes, it would not be necessary for APS to replace any of its Elster Node "smart" meters, just the Gatekeepers. So, typically, APS's explanation is sorely lacking. Perhaps APS will not even be using any Gatekeepers or cellular system at all. Many other utilities use pole mounted routers and repeaters, and have no need for Gatekeepers or the cellular system.
One explanation for the "upgrade" not given by APS but obvious to me is that the new Landis & Gyr "smart" meters have an additional microwave radio transceiver, something the Elsters did not have. Zigbee microwave radio transceivers are in the new Landis & Gyr "smart" meters to communicate with your "smart" appliances in the so-called Home Area Network (HAN). Don't have any "smart" appliances? That doesn't matter; the Zigbee may still be calling for them 24/7/365.
According to a study by Richard Tell Associates and commissioned by Vermont's Department of Public Service:
"... the HAN radios in the smart meters periodically issue a very brief signal lasting approximately1.75 ms once every 15 seconds plus a group of four closely spaced signals once per minute for a total of eight pulse emissions per minute. These signals are presumably related to the HAN radio searching for IHDs [In Home Devices] in the vicinity that have been commissioned to wirelessly connect to the meter. This characteristic of the HAN radios ... means that one expects to observe periodic pulsed signals from the radio even if there is no IHD in range; in the case of multiple meters located together, as in a meter bank, more pulsed signals should be observed over time simply due to the greater number of meters, each sending out a periodic signal.
(Page 38, An Evaluation of Radio Frequency Fields Produced by Smart Meters Deployed in Vermont, http://publicservice.vermont.gov/sites/psd/files/Topics/Electric/Smart_Grid/Vermont%20DPS%20Smart%20Meter%20Measurement%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf )
In other words, in addition to the four times more intense microwave transmissions of the new Landis & Gyr "smart" meters, another layer of microwave radiation may be added on top of that to pollute people's environments  at least 8 times per minute (11,520 times per day)  and much, much more for those living near banks of meters.
There's more.
Looking for work? With just one to two weeks training, you can make $32.61/hr. as a "smart" meter installer for APS's subcontractor, Apex Covantage! See their online ad here: http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Apex-CoVantage/jobs/Meter-Installer-9c5a9473f0a1982e?sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvZCOgIjHMX8i3TwzvkIGNA2u-WecIicAgsSvG56GM9y_d777tpREBQkcpBfVoPu3KkXOq91dk4BBtkjBTUDq0Gw .
The use of subcontractors in other states to install "smart" meters has a sorry record of rushed and substandard work. As of this writing I have not been able to ascertain if Apex installers, in addition to their salary, are working on a daily quota or worse, an incentive plan whereby the more meters they install the more money they make. Such a system has seen widespread use in other states, and has resulted in shoddy, dangerous work.
Remember that the meter clips that hold the meter in place are on your side of the meter and therefore they are your responsibility not APS's, likewise the wiring in the meter box. Any fire attributed to them is your problem. If the clips do not grasp the meter thoroughly  which can happen if they are old  then "hot socket" can occur which can result in fire. Old and worn meter box wiring has also caused fires after "smart" meter installations. APS has already admitted to such "smart" meter related fires but the ACC was too slack to thoroughly investigate. (For more information see: http://images.edocket.azcc.gov/docketpdf/0000159029.pdf )
Bottom line question: Do you trust someone inexperienced and with one to two weeks of training  and quite possibly in a rush  to thoroughly inspect your meter clips or meter box wiring before installing an APS "smart" meter? I know I don't.
There's more.
The Phoenix couple who brought APS's statewide "smart" meter "upgrade" to my attention also caught the subcontractors in the act of replacing the meter of one of their neighbors (a recent cancer survivor) who had refused a "smart" meter and so did not have one, but who was not at home to protest the subcontractors' violation. Despite being told of their mistake by the Phoenix couple, the subcontractors refused to stop installation, neither did they leave a note or door-hanger informing the homeowner of the switch.
That scenario has been played out by APS repeatedly in the past. Even former ACC commissioner Brenda Burns had a "smart" meter installed at her home despite her notifying APS not to install one. I expect such incompetence to only increase with the employment of these subcontractors.
Warning: If you have refused a "smart" meter already, be sure to keep an eye on your existing meter. You may find Apex has come when you weren't home and changed yours. We are only at the beginning of this latest chapter in the Great APS Toxic "Smart" Meter Boondoggle and it's already happened.
Lastly, recall that people who refuse "smart" meters have been constantly framed as "cost causers" by both APS and the ACC. Over the years I have proved that's not in the least bit true, and that in actual fact people who refuse "smart" meters should be getting a refund for subsidizing "smart" meters and a "smart" grid they don't want and never asked for. Now, with the epic fail of APS's Elster "smart" meters, can there be any doubt about who the real "cost causers" are? They are APS and their enablers, the ACC.
P.S.  When ACC commissioner Doug Little was on his APS money-lined campaign trail, one of my contacts who heard Little at a campaign event told me that Little, in response to a question about "smart" meters, said removal of "smart" meters already installed would be too expensive to undertake. It should be quite obvious now that Little's statement was a lie.

Cellphone Industry Product Liability Lawsuit
D.C. court considers how to screen out 'bad science' in local trials
The case before the appellate court involves the question of whether cellphones can cause brain cancer. Plaintiffs have sued cellphone manufacturers and providers in D.C. Superior Court alleging that long-term exposure to cellphone radiation causes brain tumors.

Cell phone health risks suit heads back to court
By Ryan Knutson
Alicia Mitchell was 15 years old when her father sued Motorola Inc., alleging the company's cellphones caused his brain tumor. She'll turn 30 in February and the lawsuit is still winding its way through court.
In the years since the lawsuit was filed, other plaintiffs have brought more than two dozen similar cases, the most recent one in October. Defendants include almost all the major cellphone and wireless companies, including AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
Representatives for Motorola and the other defendants referred questions to the CTIA, the wireless industry trade group, which said in a statement that "peer-reviewed scientific evidence has overwhelmingly indicated that wireless devices do not pose a public health risk for adults or children."
So far, the cases have mostly been a battle over legal procedure, not science. Ms. Mitchell's father's lawsuit, Murray v. Motorola, faces another testTuesday when the sides argue over what legal standard should be applied when evaluating evidence brought by scientists.
The case is being closely watched, as it would have ramifications not only for what evidence could be admitted in other cellphone cases, but it could also set a new precedent in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Ms. Mitchell's father, Michael Murray, was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999, after spending several years working at Motorola as a handset technician. He and his wife sued Motorola in 2001. He died in 2003.
Jeffrey Morganroth, a lawyer representing the Murrays, has brought several other cases against Motorola and other defendants. A total of 13 cases have been consolidated into the Murray case, and the plaintiffs are seeking more than $1.9 billion in damages combined.
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, cellphone manufacturers and wireless carriers specifically acknowledge the risk posed by health-related lawsuits. "We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits," Verizon wrote in its 2015 annual filing. "In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements."
Through the years, the Murray case has withstood several motions to dismiss and an effort to transfer it to federal court.In August 2014, Judge Frederick H. Weisberg of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia ruled that testimony from five scientists could be admitted to the trial.
The defendants appealed, arguing the court should have used a different legal standard, known as Daubert, when deciding whether to admit the testimony from scientists. Judge Weisberg relied on a evidentiary standard known as Frye. On Tuesday, a panel of judges at the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is expected to hear oral arguments on the matter. Under the Frye standard, the court may only look at the methodology researchers use to determine whether their testimony can be admitted. Under the Daubert standard, judges have more discretion to consider other factors.
"This is a marathon," said Mr. Morganroth, the lawyer for the Murrays. Eight of the plaintiffs in other cases have died while the lawsuits have been pending, he said. A decision in favor of Motorola and the other defendants, which are pushing for the Daubert standard, would send ripples beyond the Murray lawsuit. Seventeen of the other cellphone-health cases are stayed pending a ruling in this case.
Judge Weisberg wrote in his August 2014 decision that testimony from the scientists he found admissible under Frye would "almost certainly be excluded under Daubert."
"The consensus throughout the scientific community is that the present state of science does not permit any definitive answer to the question of whether cellphone, [radio-frequency] radiation causes cancer or any other adverse health effects," Judge Weisberg wrote in that decision.
If the plaintiffs prevail, discovery will begin on the broad issue of whether cellphones can cause brain tumors, specifically, glioma and acoustic neuroma. In addition, the plaintiffs would need to prove cellphones caused the cancer in their specific cases.

EHS Disability Award Confirmed in France
http://informations.handicap.fr/art-electrosensibilite-mdph-justice-51-8349.php
Summary:
Assigned to pay a handicapped adult allowance to an electrosensitive person in July 2015, the MDPH had appealed. It has just been rejected, confirming the "situation of disability".
By Handicap.fr / Emmanuelle Dal'Secco the Talk 27-10-2015 on this article!
In July 2015, the French courts had recognized the existence of a serious disability due to hypersensitivity to electromagnetic waves, which had forced Marine Richard, 39, to live in the mountains and to become desocialized (article link below below). A judgment of the Dispute at the Tribunal for inability in Toulouse had confirmed, after medical expertise in support, that the complainant was suffering from a syndrome whose "description of the clinical signs is irrefutable." She then obtained the payment of AAH (adult disability allowance) in the amount of 800.65 euros per month.
But the MDPH (Departmental Centre for the Disabled) appealed; it has just been rejected. The judgment stating the "syndrome of hypersensitivity to electromagnetic waves" and functional impairment of Marine Richard, estimated at 85%, is therefore definitively confirmed!

Why the FCC's safety guidelines for Wi-Fi need to be re-evaluated
FCC guidelines for maximum allowed transmit power of Wi-Fi Access Points are based on the assumption that Wi-Fi signals are received by a human body from a distance for one transmitting Wi-Fi antenna. However, we are not exposed to just one transmitting Wi-Fi antenna anymore.

Company to Blanket City Streets With WiFi Connected "Smart Pavement"
So what happens when your entire city becomes one giant WiFi signal?
Telecom giant Virgin Media has been given the green light to begin doing just that. Coverage will be enabled by "discreet street furniture" and the "UK's first Smart Pavement."

Ontario Smart meters are vulnerable to hacking and present a threat to personal privacy,
There are online tutorials instructing people how to "hack" their own smart meter to lower their power, but that could also be used for more nefarious purposes. Tabuns said there are international examples: in Puerto Rico in 2010, hacked smart meters cost electricity companies $400 million in lost revenue. It might sound like Robin Hood, but Tabuns said we all end up paying in the long run. A BBC report found smart meters in Spain could both be hacked to cut power bills, but also to potentially disrupt the whole grid.

No smart meter could mean no forgiveness for Bay City residents
Commissioner Lynn Stamiris, 1st Ward, is in favor of terminating the forgiveness program and hopes the new commissioners don't derail those efforts.
http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2015/11/smart_meter_bay_city_noncompli.html
Bay City wants to put a device that emits a 'possible carcinogen' into every home. Perhaps they should change the name from 'The Forgiveness Program' to the 'Bay City Cancer Causing Program' or 'The Bay City Harm To Health Program'.
Are these civic leaders receiving bribes to do such a stupid thing, or are they just plain stupid? Why are they not reading the science which shows these devices are dangerous. Why are they not looking at the harm that has been found in other jurisdictions, where smart meters have been installed?

Residents rally to opt out of smart metering
Smithville residents attending a recent citizen-led meeting at Central School were vocal in their desire to opt out of having a smart meter, which would monitor water and electrical use, installed at their home.
Those against the digital utility meters at the Nov. 5 forum were even more adamantly against the move after two speakers gave presentations on potential health hazards.

Council considers opt-out plan for smart meters
At a citizen-led forum last week, many raised concerns over higher rate charges during high-usage times, fire hazards, potential for cyber-attacks to the electric grid, personal information being stolen, remote disconnect and health concerns.

Is wifi harming our health? A Stroud conference looks for answers
"There are so many little things you can do that make a difference and it doesn't mean that you can't have access to the internet," said conference organiser Skeena Rather.
She explained that there is evidence that the non-ionising radiation emitted by wifi affects our central nervous system, and could cause nausea, headaches and other systems.

The Danish Cancer Society was caught in a serious lie
We just caught Danish Cancer Society in a serious lie!
There's just been a big campaign to collect money for cancer research and for that campaign, a large Danish TV-news channel website ran an article about "cancer myths" where they quoted D.C.S for this statement (translated):
"It has long been speculated whether the radiation from mobile phones increases the risk of cancer, but there are currently no studies that show that this is the case.".
Wow! We contacted the TV-channel and they immediately removed the false statement and apologized in the article that the part about cellphones had not been factual. So now the TV-news editors have to come to terms with the factthat D.C.S has mislead them! We then called D.C.S and asked them to publicly inform that their quote was false, because people that read the original article got wrong impression that cellphones are cancer-risk free. Theycompletely refused to do so.
We then called Christoffer Johanssen, told him the quote and he responded by saying: "D.C.S is just an NGO with a political agenda". Yes, those were his real words. He's distancing himself from D.C.S!
I'll keep you informed on this matter...but please don't send this out on mailing list yet, until we get to "grill" D.C.S some more :)
Link to TV-news "cancer myths" article:
http://programmer.tv2.dk/knaek-cancer/2015-10-16-sandt-eller-falsk-kan-stramme-bher-og-stress-give-kraeft
(google-translate and see bottom of article for the editors note. Note that the top graphic still shows a cellphone but all mention of cellphones is removed from the article text).
The Editor note with google translation: "Because there are divergent studies about whether mobile phone radiation can cause cancer, the editors have removed this point, after the article was published."

Troubling data: about third of parents use cell phones to put their children to sleep
A study (in Pediatrics) of 350 parents who visited the public hospital in Philadelphia at the end of 2014: 97% of them owned TV, most of them had also tablets (83%) and smartphones (77%). More than half had also game devices (56%), computers (58%) and access to the internet.
97% of the children to these parents were using cell phones, 44% of the children under the age of 1 year used cell phones daily in order to play, watch video games or use different applications, and the percents increased to 77% at the age of 2 years old.
28% of the 2 years old knew how to control the cell phones by themselves without help, and about 61% had to receive help once in a while. Half of the 4 year old did not need help at all in activating the cell phone. Parents reported that they enabled their children to use the cell phone to calm them down in public places. 28% of the parents reported that they used cell phone in order to put the child to sleep.
Children psychologist, Dr. Shai Chen: "There are thousands of Apps for children under 2 years old, promising to improve the development of the child and his coordination. It seems that the child enjoys, the parent many times receives some silence, and the child learns to use advanced technologies, and it seems that everyone is satisfied. But in recent years we know that the influence of smartphone use in young ages is tough and has long term effects. The smartphone use replaces the human contact. Children who use it for long term and continuously, have more problems in creating personal contacts and friendships. There are significant difficulties in personal communication, that causes to distress and it increases the will of the child to run away from the external world and focus on the smartphone".
"The continuous use of smartphone can cause harm to eyesight and orthopedic damage. Also the connection of the child is harmed, and instead of creating interaction and quality time with the parent, the child passes the time in front of the screen. Studies even showed that smartphone can encourage ADHD, and harm sleep quality because of the light emitted from the smartphone screen".
So when is it recommended to enable the child to use cell phone or a tablet? Dr. Chen Gal recommends avoiding exposing the child to these devices before the age of 3: "If anyway you expose him the it is needed to make sure it's maximum for an hour, to make sure that the smartphone use does not come at the expense of other activities of the child, not to enable the use of smartphone during meals or while all the family is together. "It is important that the parents understand that the use of smartphone can cause damage, and part of their responsibility as parents is to oversee and minimize exposure as much as possible, mainly in the first years".

Many babies exposed to smartphones, tablets, study finds
Apr 26, 2015. Up to half of very young children use smartphones and tablets in some way before their first birthday, a new study finds.
"Although mobile devices are ubiquitous in young children's lives, we don't yet know the impact mobile devices can have on young children," Kabali said.

Protect Children from EMF
There is no way to assess and predict the potential damages of children brain, vision and hearing under exposure to RF radiation. The WHO precautionary principle and IARC classification must be applied in discussing the potential hazard of the use of today's and tomorrow's communication devices.

The Attention-Sucking Power of Digital Technology

Cell Mast to be Removed - Ireland
"We are breaking down their dam of denial." The most recent is that an egregious mast - a public eyesore and danger - has been ordered to be removed by the national planning body of Ireland, An Bord Pleanala. It sets a country-wide precedent.
It is the result of a process. The timeline is:
Magda Havas wrote a letter outlining the dangers of microwaves
The letter was published in the Liffey Champion local newspaper
Olle Johansson was invited to address the community with members of the Irish Environmental Radiation Victims Network (IERVN)
An Irish politician, Catherine Murphy, attended Johansson's lecture. She, along with others, opposed renewal of the planning permission for this very large mast.
Desmond Guinness had a mast removed from his lands
The community was leafleted several times.
Joshua Hart, from California, of Stop Smart Meters addressed a group at Leixlip Castle
All county councillors and elected officials at the central government receive weekly Updates
Paediatric Consultant Dr. Hilllary Hoey (whose historic home is beneath the mast) came forth in opposition to the mast
The national planning authority requires removal (albeit within a two year time frame)
It is important for residents and village passers-through because the mast must go before the introduction of 5G technology.
________________
In addition to microwave radiation from masts and cell phones, a worrying issue has arisen which threatens the exchange of ideas and a free internet which ultimately affects freedom of speech and democracy itself. Legislation is being considered in Europe which would prevent passing along text and hyperlinks. Thus it would become unlawful to pass along information about the microwave threat to humanity. While this would definitely affect aggregate sites, the proposal threatens the very purpose of the internet. Please notify your MEP of the proposed legislation.
And again, thank you to Martin Weatherall for his work from Canada with the W.E.E.P. Initiative.
Kind regards,
John Weigel
Ireland

Subject: Generation Zapped! is seeking stories
Hello Friends of Generation Zapped!
My name is Sarah Newman- I am a documentary casting director, and am thrilled to be working with Sabine and Carolyn on a segment of their film, Generation Zapped!. They are in the final stretch and just need to find a few more individuals whose health has suffered as a result of living in the Wireless Age to share their stories.
I understand that all of you have been a support to these ladies / the film throughout the process, and I am hoping you can help me get the word out about this last phase of casting.
As you know, GENERATION ZAPPED! (www.generationzapped.com) is a documentary film investigating the growing body of research suggesting that wireless technology can pose serious health risks  from headaches to infertility to cancer. We are interested in hearing from individuals who have experienced the negative effects of wireless technology, as well as industry professionals who bear witness to such.
Specifically we are interested in the following individuals who have been affected by Electromagnetic Radiation:
-Adults and Children suffering from Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Syndrome
-Cancer patients and survivors
-Individuals experiencing Infertility problems
-Children with Autism
I have attached a flyer to this effect, and would be so grateful if you would forward it on to your network. And of course, if you have any suggestions, referrals, stories of your own to share, etc., please let me know!
Thanks, and all the best to you!
Sarah
