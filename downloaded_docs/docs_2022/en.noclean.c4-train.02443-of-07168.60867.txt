What is Cavity?
In the current era, Cavity and Tooth decay are one of the most common dental issues faced by people around the world. Mostly these issues are seen in teenagers, children, and aged people. However, there is no specific age; one can get cavity at any point of time. Our mouth is usually a busy place with all those bacteria constantly moving on our lips, teeth, gums and tongue. Bacteria are a normal thing, and not all of them are bad, some bacteria are helpful while others can prove to be harmful.
Few bacteria get attached with the hard coating of the teeth which is known as enamel. If not removed they might multiply in numbers and form a colony. Different type of bacteria gets attached on teeth with the growing colony on enamel. The proteins inside our saliva mix with bacteria which forms a whitish film which is known as plaque.
Plaque results into the cavity on teeth. The plaque that has been formed on the teeth does not get washed away quickly by saliva or while brushing and instead produces acid since it eats the sugar. This acid inside plaque is difficult to be washed away by saliva, and it makes the enamel weak as it dissolves the minerals which keep the enamel hard. This leads to tiny holes appearing on the surface of enamel. The acid makes the small holes bigger, and in a few days, it becomes a large hole. This is known as a cavity.
Cavities are mainly caused by tooth decay which affects both the outer layer called enamel and the inner layer called dentin. The cavities usually grow deep with the passage of time. Cavities are also termed as dental caries. It is important to get the cavity repaired in the initial stage to avoid further damage.

Causes of Tooth Decay
When food items like Milk, fruits, cereals, cake, bread or candy are consumed, they stay on the teeth. There are bacteria present in our mouth which convert them into acid. Further, the food remnants combined with saliva, bacteria and acid forms plaque on teeth. The acid creates a hole in enamel which leads to the cavity.

Old age can also cause cavities as when you start ageing the teeth pulls away from gums. This may also happen because of certain gum disease which exposes the plaque to roots of teeth.
People who have a sweet tooth are more likely to suffer from the cavity issue.
It has been noticed that older people get decay around the fillings which have been done as a part of the dental The fillings get weak with the passage of time might lead the teeth to break. The gap caused by tooth breakage gets filled with bacteria causing decay.

It has been observed that disorders related to eating habits such as bulimia or anorexia can also lead to dental issues because of repeated purging.
Factors Contributing to Tooth Decay and Cavity
There are mainly four factors which result in decaying of the tooth which is as follows:
Lack of minerals in diet such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorous. Deficiency of these minerals is said to cause tooth decay.
Lack of vitamins A, D, E and k which are fat soluble in nature. The deficiency of Vitamin D mainly causes tooth decay.

However, common symptoms of the cavity consist of tooth sensitivity, visible holes on infected tooth, toothache, mild or severe pain while drinking or eating and stain on the teeth in black, white or brown color.
