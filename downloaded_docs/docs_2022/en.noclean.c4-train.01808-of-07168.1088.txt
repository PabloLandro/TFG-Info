High Cholesterol? The Apt Workout
Exercise improves blood circulation thus improving the efficiency of the heart in pumping blood. Exercise can help keep the cholesterol at a healthy level. Regular exercise affects cholesterol and triglycerides in two ways:
Exercise helps lower triglycerides
Exercise also raises the HDL levels.
The type of exercise you do is not as important for cholesterol control, as to how often or how regularly you do it. The frequency and the amount of time spent exercising are important. A combination of three forms of exercise gets you the most health benefit:
Aerobics gets your heart rate up
Strength training builds your muscle
Flexibility exercises keeps you limber.
Apart from these there are other options which can help lower your cholesterol:
Walking
Jogging or running
Swimming
Biking
Playing tennis, basketball, or other sports
