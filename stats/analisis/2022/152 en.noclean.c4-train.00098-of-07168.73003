Crystal Healing for Wellbeing
For thousands of years, humans have used crystals and stones in the promotion of positive energy and healing. Today, practitioners are utilising these crystals to facilitate and restore balance and wellbeing. Bernie Giggins is a certified practitioner who is passionate about working with and facilitating the healing process for her clients.
What is crystal healing and energy?
Crystal healing is the use of crystals or stones in the promotion of physical, mental or emotional healing. This style of healing works due to the high levels of vibrational energy in these crystals. These vibrations then work with our own natural energy flow to restore and stimulate healing. Doing this can rejuvenate and rebalance our mind, body and soul.
Although the general ideas behind crystal healing are the same, different crystals can be used for different purposes. Bernie can work with you and the particular areas you would like to heal. She will create a session that will encourage healing and clarity that is specific to you.
How does crystal healing work?
Humans are made up of a number of different minerals and elements. One of these minerals is silicon dioxide, which is the same mineral that is found in quartz. This means that humans are receptive to the vibrations that are emitted from these crystals. When the stones or crystals are placed on our body, the vibrations work with our natural energy flow. This synergy can encourage healing and rejuvenation. It can also assist with changing the direction of your energy towards a more positive flow.
What can crystal healing provide for me?

How is crystal healing performed?
There is a diverse selection of stones that are used during the crystal healing sessions. Generally crystal types are selected that correspond with the type of healing being undertaken. During the treatment, the crystals will work with the energy of the client. Many clients report a sense of wellbeing or clarity during or after the treatment.
