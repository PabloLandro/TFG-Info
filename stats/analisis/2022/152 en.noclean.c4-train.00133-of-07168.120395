Crystals 101: Your Guide to Everything Crystals!
The crystal trend is here to stay, and whether you want to test out the healing and good fortune properties, or simply add a little something extra to your decor, we’ve got you covered with our easy tips for to how to incorporate crystals into your life! Read on for your simple guide to everything you need to know about crystals!
The Basics: Crystals were originally thought to have healing, energy, and health benefits by ancient cultures such as the Mayans and Egyptians. They made crystals into jewelry and even incorporated them into buildings and architecture in an attempt to harness their power. This ancient practice had been pretty much forgotten until the recent resurgence of crystal awareness. Here are a few ways you can get in on the trend and incorporate crystals into your day-to-day life!
– Do a Crystal Grid: First, set an intention (a crush perhaps? maybe a raise at work?), then lay out specific types of crystals and stones in a predetermined pattern. These patterns are designed to receive and transmit energy. Check out this article from Energy Muse that breaks down the step-by-step process of building a crystal grid!
– Wear Crystal Jewelry: Why not check out a local rock shop and pick out a cute crystal ring or necklace to spice up your accessory game? Wearing crystals is said to balance energy, (try pink quartz to attract love) and everyone will be dying to know where you got your unique piece!
– Place Crystals on your Body for Healing: This ancient practice is making a comeback! A quick search for crystal body layouts will give you different examples of which stones to use and where to place them. For example, blue lace agate is said to be good for stress. Another option is to try placing your favorite crystal on you while meditating.
How Does Crystal Healing Work? If you’re still feeling skeptical, you’re probably thinking, “Sure, crystals are fun to look at, but can they really cure a headache, or help me find love?” Here’s the thinking behind it: everything is made up of energy, including crystals that come from the earth, so crystals have the ability to absorb negative energy or put out positive energy based on your needs. (More on this from Huffington Post here.) Like we said, believer or nonbeliever, surrounding yourself with pretty crystals couldn’t hurt, so why not give it a shot?! Try gathering all your girlfriends to trade gems or do a crystal grid for a fun and unique experience that’s different than your average brunch or happy hour!
Our Top Picks: Ready to start your collection? Some of the crystals we love are lepidolite, known as “the peacemaker” is great for calming anxiety, selenite for cleansing and purifying, and black tourmaline, like a security blanket, is for protection and positive energy. Crystal Age has a great crystal guide with plenty of visuals and info to help you get started.

5 ways to try crystal healing with kids
Keep the little ones amused this summer holiday with the power of Ashley Leavy’s gemstone therapy
Teaching kids about crystal energy can nurture their connection with crystal energy, but how can you explain some of the difficult concepts of healing and energy to a young mind? Below are some simple ways to explain crystal healing to the children in your life, encouraging their minds to grow spiritually. They’ll be so much calmer and more tuned in after these activities, you won’t even recognise them – and so will you!
1 Feel the amplification
Sit where you are right now and think about things that make you happy. Now, pick up your crystal and think about your happy thought again. Do you feel even happier when you’re holding the crystal? This is because the crystal is amplifying your happy feeling!
2 Charge yourself up
Crystals can hold energy for us to use later on when we need it. This stored energy will stay inside of the crystal until you want to use it. Place your crystal on your windowsill where it will be in the light from the moon or the sun. Leave the crystal there to charge. The next day, pick up the crystal and see if you can feel the energy it has stored from the sun or the moon. How do you feel? Can you feel the energy the crystal has shared with you?
3 Transfer energy to others
Hold a Quartz crystal point on your forehead with the point sticking straight out from your body like a unicorn horn. Think about love and joy and fill your heart with happy thoughts. Try to send these thoughts to someone near you and see if they can feel them!
4 Listen to your crystals’ stories
Hold your crystal in your hands. Where do you feel the energy in your body? Do you feel hot or cold? Do you feel calm? Or happy? Now hold your crystal up to your forehead. Imagine that the crystal is telling you a story. What do you see and hear? How does the crystal make you feel?
5 Meditate
Hold your crystal in your hands or over your heart. Imagine your crystal growing bigger and bigger until it is as big as a house. Imagine a tiny doorway that you crawl through until you are inside of your crystal house.
Look around at the inside of your crystal. What do you see? What colour is your crystal house? Imagine feeling the floor and the walls. How do they feel? Listen very carefully. What do you hear inside of your crystal? Do you hear any sounds at all? Do you hear your favourite music? What does your crystal house smell like? Does it smell like flowers or freshly-baked cookies? Imagine a big comfy chair inside of your crystal house. Sit on the chair and have some quiet time inside of your crystal house. Feel the peaceful energy all around you. The longer you sit inside of your crystal, the happier you become. When you are very calm and happy, imagine crawling back through the door of your crystal house and back into where you are sitting right now.

Crystal Healing for Stress and Anxiety
The range of crystals that can be used for healing is huge but when it comes to conditions such as anxiety and stress there are some that are more preferred than others. So if you are shopping for stones to help you with these conditions you might want to check out some of the ones below.
Amethyst is one of the crystals that are known to be able to help with a wide variety of conditions. For anxiety issues and relaxing this is one of the most popular. This is known to be the Master Healer and it has a calming effect on the body and mind, plus it is one of the better looking crystals for placing around the home.
Aquamarine the Calming Stone
Aquamarine is a lovely looking crystal that can help with issues related to anxiety and panic attacks. This is well known for being able to help the person to relax and calm along with quieting the mind. Aquamarine is known for its properties of helping to lower the levels of stress.
Clear Quartz crystal may be able to help people to manage anxiety as it has properties of dispelling negative thinking along with turning negative thoughts into more positive thoughts. This is one of the symptoms that people often complain about when suffering panic attacks.
Panic attacks can have a devastating effect on the life of a person and one of the crystals that many people associate with them is Moonstone. This stone helps to stop over reaction to situations and so it is often the choice of those who use crystals for healing panic and anxiety.
Smokey Quartz Alleviates Stress
Smokey Quartz is often used by people who use healing crystals as it is known for its properties related to being able to relieve stress that is associated with anxiety.
There are many ways that you can use any of the above crystals for easing anxiety and making your life less stressful. Typical ways include meditation and lighting a candle and allowing it to flicker on the crystal of your choice. You can use them for holding in the palm to help to reduce stress levels or you might want to sleep with them under your pillow to help bring down the levels of stress and anxiety.
There really isn’t any one way that works when using crystals for healing, so you might want to try various ways before settling on the one that is right for you.
There is a more unconventional way of healing and this is by using crystals. They have the power to help in many ways to improve your life.

Four Crystal Healing Treatments to Enhance Your Spa’s Menu
As further evidence that crystals are all the rage this year, such as being noted as one of our 2018 trends, The Ritz-Carlton Spa, Los Angeles is teaming up with House of Intuition, a local metaphysical shop, to debut three Crystal Clarity treatments and a Custom Clarity Package ($450, 80 minutes). The limited-time package features a consultation to select three crystals that will be integrated into a personalized Clarity Massage and gifted to the client and a House of Intuition gift box containing a selection of signature items, such as an intention candle, a smudge kit, raw crystals, beauty products, and a bath bomb. Relying on crystals, stones, essential oils, and other holistic ingredients, the following treatments, available through the summer, combine House of Intuition teachings with the spa’s pampering practices.
Rose Quartz Mani ($80, 50 minutes) and Pedi Treatment ($85, 50 minutes) indulge hands and feet with an aromatic soak infused with rose oils, Himalayan sea salt, and pieces of raw rose quartz. Feet are then exfoliated with a rose-quartz crystal scrub and misted with House of Intention Awaken Organic Spray to inspire the flow of harmony. The treatments conclude with a choice of polish.
The lounge at The Ritz-Carlton Spa, Los Angeles is ideal for relaxing after a crystal treatment.
Jade Facial Treatment ($260, 80 minutes) begins with a gentle exfoliation using a jade crystal scrub from House of Intention and continues with an age-defying massage with a jade facial roller. After an application of ESPA Skin Radiance Mask and a spritz of calming mist, the esthetician places three healing stones—amethyst, clear quartz, and moonstone—on the high points of the skin to promote mind-spirit balance.
Chakra Balancing Massage ($260, 80 minutes) features a relaxing massage before curated crystals are placed on each of the seven chakras. Designed to ease muscle tension, soothe the mind, and promote energy flow, the treatment, which incorporates an oil from ESPA, finishes with a citrus-infused spritz over the body to encourage wellbeing.
“Working with House of Intuition founders Marlene Vargas and Alex Naranjo, we created therapies that complement the two schools of healing belief,” says spa director Tamara Ische. “Crystal therapy offers another natural method to rebalance our mind and body, and we’re excited to explore the power of these tools in our pampering treatments.”

9 Ways to Do Your Own Crystal Healing
It’s easier now than ever before to get your hands on some beautiful crystals. But how do we work with them to consciously empower ourselves? From cleansing your crystals under moonlight to programming them with Reiki, there are many ways to harness their energy and do your own crystal healing.
Discover the rituals and tips that I use to tune into crystal energy…
1. Elevate your space
After cleansing your crystals in the moonlight, feel the pulse of the crystals and determine which crystals would go well on your desk, in your car and on your nightstand. Crystals help elevate and protect these spaces. Citrine is a great one to put on a desk as it helps you find motivation, will power, self-esteem and joy. Black obsidian, black tourmaline and amethyst work well in cars but tune in to see what the crystals have to say.
2. Selenite on your heart chakra
Selenite wands help me remember to call upon a strength beyond my own, divine love and light. The white color reminds me of white light. I like to place a selenite wand in the middle of my chest while breathing deep into my belly and expanding my diaphragm. Selenite crystals don’t need to be cleansed and cleared as they are very high in vibration, making it an ideal choice for daily healing.
3. To clear your aura
“Comb” your aura with a selenite wand, while asking the crystal to help you release and transmute any energies that aren’t serving the highest good of all. Observe where you are releasing. You might notice tingling, warmth, coolness or simply a movement of energy. If you’re a Reiki practitioner, feel free to chant one of the Reiki mantras while combing your aura.
4. To cut cords with anyone and anything that isn’t serving you
Selenite wands can also be used to help cut the cords of attachment to beings, situations, events, or feelings that aren’t serving your highest good. Comb a selenite wand through your aura, noticing where you feel dense energy. Comb through, while setting the intention to release, until your aura feels lighter.
5. To balance the vibration of your chakras
A night-time ritual that I go to often, is intuitively placing crystals on my chakra centers. I hold my hands over crystals and choose the ones that feel the most high-vibe or energetic. To me, that means that the crystal wants to work with me, and help heal a physical, mental, spiritual, emotional or energetic issue. I then place the crystal on its corresponding chakra. For example, I would place a black obsidian on my root chakra center if that is one the crystals that calls out to me.
6. To support your meditation experiences
I’ll often choose a crystal to hold during meditation to help clear my mind, and elevate the quality of my thoughts and emotions. In meditation, I like to work with rose quartz to help bring my thoughts back to love and amethyst to help open my higher chakras. Working with crystals during meditation is especially great if you’re seeking to raise your vibration.
7. As a touchstone – at the end of a long day…
At the end of a long day, I like to hold a crystal and know that piece of nature is grounding me and bringing me back to my true essence. I choose crystals intuitively and by that I mean, I pick up whichever crystal is calling out to my eyes. If a specific color, shape, or texture is fascinating you, take that as a call from the crystal! I also like to hover my hands over the crystals, “scanning” their energies to see which crystal is grabbing my attention.
8. To send distant Reiki
Crystals are a great way to send Reiki to someone who’s not physically present with you. I often use 7 crystals that correspond with the main chakra centers to send Reiki to my clients who may even be on another continent. The crystalline structure helps to magnify Reiki, and transport it. You don’t have to be an energy healer to send blessings through crystals. Simply cleanse a crystal, put your hands over the crystal and send your love to a person, situation or event.
9. To program with Reiki
Even though I don’t ask them to, my clients often bring their crystals to their in-person Reiki sessions. While sharing Reiki with my clients, I charge their crystals with the energy and the best intentions, so my clients can receive Reiki healing even after their session is over. Crystals are recordkeepers and can be programmed with Reiki to help us when we need it. If you’re seeing a Reiki practitioner, ask them to program your crystals. If not, visualize how you would like to feel in the next 3-6 months while holding your crystal. The crystal will now help you attract more of those feelings into your life.
These rituals and tips will empower you to do your own crystal healing.
Tap into your intuition, and set intentions with clarity.
The most important components to crystal healing are your consciousness and willingness to be guided by your intuition.
Allow for the crystals to raise your vibration and for them to transform your chakras.
Choose one ritual and practice for 21 consecutive days!

Mystic beauty: unpacking the crystal healing make-up trend
From perfumes supercharged with sacred stones to crystal healing manicures, we examine the latest trend of incorporating ancient pagan practices into modern beauty routines
While certain sceptics might dismiss crystals as hippy dippy nonsense, the metaphysical stones and their healing powers are no longer a new age niche reserved for tree-huggers. Mysticism has officially gone mainstream, and now that the beauty industry has jumped on the holistic bandwagon, spiritually-supercharged beauty is the new normal.
Recently, it feels that everyone and their mum has been touting the benefits of healing crystals, whose powers can allegedly cleanse negative energy, uplift your mood, nurture relationships and manifest your dreams. With promises like those, it’s no wonder we’re grinding, infusing and soaking our beauty routines in gemstones and minerals.
Between healing skincare and crystal laden make-up, there’s a wide range of products and treatments that have worked the occult into their formulas. Glossier’s Haloscope highlighters come in the shades “Topaz”, “Quartz” and “Moonstone”, all eponymous of the crystals they’re infused with, giving you that Kardashian glow while simultaneously providing you with internal enlightenment. Herbivore’s Pineapple and Gemstone mask is infused with Brazilian white tourmaline that promises to “illuminate and energise” your complexion. Walk into any Urban Outfitters and you can buy perfume “supercharged with sacred stones to channel inner strength, balance and luck.” Or if you’re looking for something more hands-on, L.A.-based celebrity nail stylist Mazz Hanna offers a Crystal Healing Manicure for £265. The list goes on.
“Consumers are drawn to mystic beauty because they’re seeking a connection with something benevolent, like an external source of support that may help them cope with the constant hustle we find ourselves in, trying to keep up with modern life” – Tama Driessen, healer and author of The Crystal Code
Of course, it was only a matter of time before beauty brands started catering to a generation so obsessed with the esoteric. From meditation and tarot, to crystals and astrology, these hallmarks of the occult have become the pseudo-religion of the Instagram age. Although there is little to no scientific evidence of crystals’ healing powers, we’re prioritising faith over facts if it means finding serenity in a chaotic world, and it’s translating into our beauty and wellness routines too.
“Consumers are drawn to mystic beauty because they’re seeking a connection with something benevolent, like an external source of support that may help them cope with the constant hustle we find ourselves in, trying to keep up with modern life,” says Tama Driessen, healer and author of The Crystal Code, a modern guide to crystal healing. “The concept of products infused with crystals, charged by the moon or designed to associate with the zodiac makes them a convenient way to add some mystic energy into people’s daily routine when they might be too busy to do something else that might help them find some inner peace – such as meditation, practising yoga, going for a crystal healing treatment, having a massage.”
As more and more brands tap into this mysticism craze, it raises questions about the authenticity of their intentions. “It’s wonderful that spirituality is having such a powerful moment right now, and that the beauty industry is embracing spiritual practices,” says New York-based seeress and shaman Deborah Hanekamp (aka Mama Medicine). “That being said, we have to be a bit careful of spiritual materialism and thinking that there is something we need to buy to feel spiritual, rather than simply recognising that just through our ability to love ourselves, others, and the world we live in, we are already magnificently spiritual.”
Wicca and other pagan-based faiths are more than just a trend or marketing ploy, and while this surge of mystic grooming products may seem recent to many of us, their purported significance is not. Both brands and consumers shouldn’t be so quick to appropriate what is an ancient and sacred belief just because the amethyst you bought in a Shoreditch boutique looks good in your Instagram flatlay.

“The beauty industry, like any industry, needs newness to keep innovating. They will probably move onto something else when the hype dies down,” says Sushma Sagar, reiki healer and founder of The Calmery, a London energy healing practice. “But spirituality is here to stay, because it isn’t a bandwagon. People are craving connection and finding meaning in their lives, it’s a modern malaise because we aren’t taught to look within for our answers. The irony is that we shouldn’t be reliant on products for our own healing.”
While Sagar and Hanekamp believe this fresh new take on pagan practices can only make spirituality more accessible, we should remain weary of the beauty industry’s attempt at co-opting it. “Some people, including the beauty industry, are once again trying to claim something in order to make money,” says beauty and self care blogger Grace Victory. “It blows my mind that people can try to profit from something so natural and sacred. Discernment is an act we should practice, but even more so with corporate businesses and capitalism. Consumers are sucked into anything and everything if it is marketed right [and] advertising is geared towards promising women a way to ‘fix’ themselves. Sometimes these things are just the same shit, covered by incense.”
That said, Victory is all for incorporating crystals in beauty rituals, although there’s a caveat. “I use them in my ritual baths, to meditate with and to make elixirs with. But it’s all about your intention. Healing and getting closer to Spirit/God/Source/Universe is an act that transcends ‘beauty’, it is simply who we are. Crystals just amplify and help.”
“It blows my mind that people can try to profit from something so natural and sacred. Discernment is an act we should practice, but even more so with corporate businesses and capitalism” – Grace Victory, beauty and selfcare blogger
Hanekamp explains that the best way to benefit from the grounding and calming properties of stones is to use them in their most natural form possible as massage tools. Take for example Jade facial rollers, one of Cult Beauty’s best selling products and a staple in Driessen’s beauty routine. “I don’t think crushed rose quartz does much for the skin, and I could see it blocking pores if too much is used,” Hanekamp explains. “That being said, I love the idea of putting the frequency of crystals into beauty products [and] letting crystals soak in the product on an auspicious date. Crystals ground and calm us and a relaxed look is a radiant one.”
If mystical skincare provides a feeling of ethereal escapism to counteract the cynicism of modern life, should that be something that’s encouraged? As Driessen herself concedes, “it raises awareness of mystical and spiritual practices and may act as a gateway for some people to seek a deeper connection that they wouldn’t have heard of otherwise…”

Crystal Healing, Crystal Therapy and Energy HealingPick the Brain
Healing Crystals used in Spiritual Healing, Holistic Healing, and Chakra Balancing
When people think of crystal healing, they usually visualize precious gemstones or mythical talismans being used by a New Age practitioner. Crystals and healing gemstones have fascinated humans for centuries because of their unique colors, complexities and their functional use for making tools and artifacts. They were mined as far back as Ancient Egypt and possibly earlier still. Crystals were used in the Great Pyramids and temples, and as talismans and amulets to ward off demons and to bring good luck and prosperity.
What Makes Crystal Healing So Special?
Healing crystals are solid, complex structures, formed deep underground and in mountainous caves. They are part of the strength of Nature, resonating with the energy and power of life. Crystals are formed from igneous or sedimentary rock. Igneous rock is formed when a volcano erupts and the molten lava mixes with dust and rock particles. After it cools and solidifies, it mixes with natural gases and minerals and creates crystal.
Sedimentary rock is formed when river water drags dust particles along in the current and out into the sea. When the dust particles settle on the seabed they form larger, solid rocks pieces and eventually develop into crystals.
So these naturally formed crystals for healing and crystal balls are both beautiful and mysterious. Although healing crystals from the same family share the same basic structure, they will each have different imperfections or inclusions which make each piece unique. Diamonds are a good example of this. The size of a diamond is measured by its carat weight. Different grades of diamond will reflect different colors or have different patterns on their surface. It is these patterns and colors which fascinate humans.
Diamonds are revered because of their physical strength, and this might be why they are symbolic as engagement rings, to represent a strong relationship between humans.
Crystal Therapy and Healing Stones
People are attracted to crystal healing stones for their beauty, their pretty colors and intricate patterns. It can be very calming to the mind just to stare at a crystal, to gaze at its structure and follow the patterns of its ‘veins.’ To hold a piece of healing quartz crystal against human skin or in a person’s hand can be soothing. The physical strength, weight and texture of the crystal are all believed to be part of the crystal healing process.
Crystals can be placed in a home or workspace to provide a calming focus and energy healing for people, offering crystal therapy. The Chinese believe that crystals bring orderliness and clarity into life and often use them to aid in Feng Shui.
Crystals have also been adapted for more practical purposes. They were used as tools in ancient times, especially obsidian, because it is strong and solid. In modern culture crystals have been adapted for use in technology, to aid laser cutting and as time movements in wrist watches (Quartz).
The Spiritual Healing Paradigm
The Spiritual Healing Paradigm is the practice of using crystals to channel, direct and amplify energy from the healer into the patient. A spiritual healer will use a collection of healing crystals to channel energy from spirit or from angels. Crystal pendulums are popular for this purpose, particularly healing quartz and amethyst for their general cleansing abilities. The healing stones will clarify and amplify the vibrational healing needed at that time.
North American Indian healers use quartz crystal to diagnose and then remove a problem in a person’s body or mind. Again healing quartz is a popular stone because of its energy and its ability to channel and amplify the necessary healing. It is universal and versatile. The Spiritual Healing Paradigm is very much about believing in spirit and angel energies and allowing them to aid in the healing process.
The Resonance Placement Paradigm
The Resonance Placement Paradigm does not require a belief in the world of spirit. It relies on the power of the crystals alone, and the healing intuition of the practitioner. A variety of healing crystals might be used, and they would be chosen for their perceived individual healing qualities. They would then be combined to increase their power and energy to aid in the healing process.
Sometimes a particular crystal might resonate with a patient so the healer will choose to work solely with that one. The healer could then use a collection of the same crystals, or just work with one larger or specially shaped gemstone. The crystals would be placed on or around the human body in a specific format to correspond with the areas that need healing. The color, shape and composition of crystals are believed to create an energy vibration that encourages the natural healing process.
This practice is linked with the idea of carrying crystals as talismans or good luck charms. India’s Ayurvedic tradition has a history of using crystals and gemstones for similar purposes. Crystals have captivated humans for many thousands of years and there is so much potential in what they can offer for healing and mental and spiritual wellbeing.

The Art of Crystal Healing by Renee Starr
Crystals, gemstones, and many types of stones are potent sources of subtle energy that can be used to support healing on many levels, such as emotional, physical, and spiritual. There are many reasons why crystals are so powerfully effective in this way, and one of these reasons is that crystals can conduct, and emit electricity.
Science has known for quite some time that some crystals, such as quartz, are able to hold onto, and send out electrical energy, and we see this ability utilized in quartz timepieces, and with computer, and laser technology. This electrical ability of quartz is called piezoelectricity, which means that under stress, or pressure, quartz will expand slightly and then contract just enough to create a mild electrical charge. As humans, and animals are electrical beings: the heart and brain use electricity for healthy functioning, a crystal’s electrical nature can affect our own on a very subtle level, and this affect is the basis of crystal healing.
Crystals can be technologically programmed, and then used to conduct electrical energy, such as with a computer processor, which is made with a type of crystal called silicon, and so we can also use crystals to program, and direct energy for healing. It is thought that during a crystal healing session, universal, or cosmic energy is channeled through the healer, and then magnified, and directed through crystals placed on and/or around the client’s body. This crystal placement can be random, intuitive, or designed, and acts as a grid for energy to flow into, and out of the body.
For centuries, we have been associated certain crystals with unique healing properties to help deal with specific health issues, to help support physical, and emotional healing, and to bring harmony, peace, and balance to the psyche with their resonance, and vibration. A traditional example of this is the use historical use of copper to reduce swelling and inflammation. As the crystal malachite has a high concentration of copper within it, this crystal may help to relieve aching joints, and muscles.
Crystal healing is an art, and a practice that can be very effective to relax, calm, and open the channels of the body, mind and spirit to receive deep healing. Any, and all crystals can be used in healing sessions, and while there is no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ way to do this, it is a good idea to have a step-by-step guide to follow. Below I have provided one for you to use.
Crystal healing session
Create sacred space using sage, sound vibrations, incense, energy, or intention.
Ground and cleanse yourself with sage smoke.
Choose the crystals you will be using.
Arrange the recipient on a massage table, or the floor with soft blankets underneath. Support the knees, and neck with pillows, or bolsters. Place an eye pillow over their eyes.
Create a crystal grid, or design with the crystals on and around their body.
Stand at the feet of the recipient with your arms at your side, palms facing up towards the sky.
Ground yourself to the earth, by sending your energy down, and out through your feet.
Imagine that you are surrounded with white light, and this light is all around you, sealing your aura.
Ask for permission to perform this healing work from the recipient’s higher self.
Ask for angels, guardians, and the guides of both you, and the recipient to be present.
Then, with palms facing the soles of the recipient feet, but not touching them; wait for the feeling of the client grounding. Visualize their energy streaming from their soles to the earth. Watch for foot twitches to indicate this is complete. If no foot twitching, continue on.
Guide the recipient into a trance state using soothing words, or a brief meditation.
Move, and sweep your hands softly, gently, and slowly, all around the body without touching it, keep your hands about 10 inches above the body. Pause wherever there are crystals, or wherever you feel moved to do so, and make notice of any feelings, sensations, or information that you may receive.
When you feel complete; remove the crystals from on, and around the body.
Fluff and smooth the recipient’s aura with your hands by making gentle sweeping motions all around their body.
Seal the auric field with your hands by moving them in crisscross patterns from head to toe above the body, and then all around the edge of the recipient’s body without touching them, as you visualize that you are sealing the auric field.
Ground the recipient and yourself by standing at their feet once again, with palms out towards the soles of their feet, and waiting for the feeling of grounding. Visualize their energy streaming from the soles to the earth. Watch for foot twitches to indicate this is complete. If no foot twitching, continue on.
Make circular motions at the soles of their feet visualizing that you are sealing energy here.
Let the recipient know the session has ended, and move your body away from theirs. Ground yourself, and imagine that your energy is clean and clear.
Give thanks.
At this time, you may discuss any findings that you wish to share from the session with the recipient.

Colour Therapies – Gemstone & Crystal Healing
Colour Therapies – Gemstone & Crystal Healing
Gemstones and crystals play a big role in Arkrealm The Apprentice. In the novel all the Arketykes use crystals to access their powers and you can do the same. We will start with the simplest techniques and build up week by week. I will mention auras and chakras here, but I will go into more depth about these in later weeks. For now—an aura is an energy field, like a bubble, that surrounds every living thing and a chakra is a spinning wheel of energy, which is located at various spots in the body. Each chakra represents a different colour.
Gemstones are such an affordable way to begin with crystal therapy. I started my collection of gemstones with basic tumble-stones, available in New Age shops and markets at very affordable prices. The thing I like about them is that they are small and can fit into a pocket, in your bag or purse, be left on your desk to roll through your fingers to help thought processes, or even tucked into your pillow at night. Sometimes I tuck one into my bra for extra supportive energy. When you become a more advanced crystal user you can incorporate it with your meditation practises and chakra work, which we will cover in weeks to come.
How do crystals work? It’s one of those intangible things where it’s hard to prove, but they have been used throughout history with countless pieces of literature written about them. Of course science still turns its head on them. I for one can tell you I feel the energy resonating from them. Crystals, rather than gemstones are used in watches so they certainly do have energy, but they are generally more expensive. So let’s start off on the lower scale. Once you feel the changes happening in your life you will be thrilled to spend the money on an elegant crystal.
Here is a simple list of the most readily available gemstone for each colour and their healing properties. When you go into a shop to choose an individual crystal try and notice any changes you feel as you touch them. This may be a change in temperature, a sound in your head, that’s how Sandy Miller chooses hers and I choose mine, or maybe you are just drawn to one colour or shape in particular.

Black:Obsidian is not associated with any chakra but it is associated with our shadow side—our fears and phobias. Used correctly it can bring problems to the surface so that they can be processed. It can give you the power and determination to face your fears. This is a very powerful stone and should be used with professional assistance. Obsidian is sometimes polished into a sphere to aid clairvoyance. It can aid the digestive system, by releasing blocked energy.

Custom Crystal Healing Kits
Healing crystals have been used since ancient times, and there is a wealth of knowledge as well as experience that has been handed down from generation to generation about them. Everything in life has a vibration, including our own thoughts. When we focus on these thoughts sometimes they come true , or in other words we’ve manifested the thoughts. If you’re having a horrible day and that’s all you focus on, chances are you’ll only be getting more of that negative energy back as you are sending it out into the universe. When you are feeling love, that love comes back to you as you have manifested it .
Crystals have energy properties that can work within our own energy systems, so with use, those positive vibes from the crystals will amplify our own positive thoughts. These crystals remind us to quiet the chaos in our mind and reconnect to the universal healing energy, vibrations of the Earth itself.
This is Black Obsidian, sometimes you get lucky ( which I was!) and you get a Rainbow Black Obsidian which when highly polished you can see vibrant colors of the rainbow. This stone is a highly protection stone shielding again negativity.
Many people use healing crystals , and there are endless ways to use them, from crystal therapy, mediation, to protection grids in the home. Their energies are amazing and to add to that, there’s the pure beauty of the crystals themselves. I have collected crystals since I was a child without real knowledge of what each meant. Whether it was the color, the shape or the feel of it, I collected without really knowing what exactly was pulling me towards certain crystals. I finally did some research and was surprised to find out about the healing properties as well as energy crystals could offer. It was a delight to find out that intuitively I had picked stones with meanings that were needed in those moments of my life.
The last several years, during my spiritual journey I have collected even more crystals for certain situations or needs within my life. My kids as well have enjoyed learning about crystals , what they mean and have become very good at picking up their energies. From holding a stone daily for courage , or focus, to crystals under pillows to help ward off nightmares we’ve all enjoyed the benefits of healing crystals in our life.
A couple months ago I came across an amazing Etsy store, called Mystical Serenity, you can check it out here. This lovely shop is full of high quality crystals for any and all occasions, but the one thing I found and am completely hooked on- are her healing kits! There are kits created with specific needs in mind. There are some for better sleep, some for mediation, serenity, housewarming , even crystal gridding. I had already gotten kits from Jenny, the shop owner awhile back , but recently asked her for two custom kits which she did an amazing job on.
These kits were gorgeous! The pictures do no justice let me tell you! She finds unique containers to hold the crystals and nest them in their own moss and dried flowers, so everything is safe and ready for you upon arrival.
They are so beautiful!!
An amazing Cleanse & Clearing kit, and an Emotional Healing kit. The emotional kit I asked to be made for the entire family, so there were some really great crystals that the kids can grab-n-go with to keep in their pockets. Each crystal has a unique vibration that works to clear blockages and ward off negative energy while lifting the positive vibes up within us and around us. Depending on your mood and what your guided too, you may pick up the same or a different crystal each time you reach for one. I find them calming and grounding in times I need to refocus from the day.
Sage was added to the Cleanse & Clearing kit which is always a must for the house! The container is a heart shaped planter ( it’s so cute!) As soon as I find a cute house plant to put in it, it’ll hold my sage !
There was a cheat sheet if you will, for the crystals and their meanings which was great because more than half the crystals I’ve not had before, nor knew their meanings. It was a great learning experience and a joy to unbox! I often find myself grabbing the same crystals day to day while I’m working or doing some art for inspiration, or grabbing crystals for mediating that feel more grounding and calming then others.
This is a FUN box! Besides the crystals in it, it’s just an all around cheerful colorful box. My daughters took it to put their own crystals in for safe keeping.
Jenny did an amazing job with these, and you can tell she puts a lot of care and dedication into making all of her kits. Not only should you check out her shop, you should check out Mystical_serenity’s Instagram right here, She holds live sales in which are very addicting! Jenny is able to answer all your questions about crystals, can easily suggest the best match for you if you ask, and is more than willing to create any kit you ask for.
For some unique and beautiful one of a kind gifts check out her shop! There is something for everyone, you won’t be disappointed!
