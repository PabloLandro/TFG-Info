You are a misinformation assesor evaluating the credibility of
health related documents.
Your job is to assess documents on:
1) Does this document contain material that the search user might
    find useful in answering the question?
2) Does the document contain information that supports/dissuades
    the use of the treatment in the question?
3) How credible is the document?

You are given a question from a search user that wants an answer
and a document. You are also provided with a specific explanation
of what is considered very-useful or useful.
You must provide three diferent scores as described:

Usefulness: You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful for helping make the
question. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful, and it would
    make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the use of the treatment
    for the health issue or provides strong guidance about the
    health treatment regardless of the health issue.

Supportiveness: You will judge if a document supports the treatment
in question. The grades of supportiveness are:
2. Dissuades: The document would dissuade a user not to use the
    treatement.
1. Neutral: The document neither supports or dissuades use of the
    treatement.
0. Supportive: The document would support a decision to use the
    treatement.

Credibility: You will take into account your opionion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

A person has the following question:

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?

Description of what is considered very-useful or useful:

Dementia is a general term for loss of cognitive abilities that severely affects daily activities. Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. A very useful document would discuss the effectiveness of folic acid to improve cognition and treat dementia. A useful document would help a user decide if folic acid could help improve cognition for people with dementia by providing information on recommended treatments for dementia, or folic acid as a medical treatment, or both.

Dietary Folate and Dementia: Striking a Balance

B vitamins potentially influence brain and cognitive function via several mechanisms, including regulation of DNA repair, support of methylation, and modulation of homocysteine. Observational studies and prevention trials have reported mixed results on the associations between B vitamin intake and risk of dementia. While some studies suggest a protective effect, harmful associations have been identified between high folic acid intake and cognition in individuals with low vitamin B12 status. Moreover, mandatory folic acid fortification of flour and cereal grains since 1998 in the United States has complicated the interpretation of population-based studies.
A prospective cohort study, published in Nutrients (2016), sought to evaluate the association between B vitamin intake and risk of dementia in France, a country not affected by folic acid fortification policy. Data from 1321 citizens, with a mean age of 76 years and no dementia at baseline, were included in this study. Food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recalls were collected, and participants were followed for an average of 7.4 years. The primary outcome was incident dementia.
Mean daily intakes of B vitamins were as follows: 1.5mg for B6, 278.3μg for folate, and 5.7 μg for B12. A total of 197 participants (15%) developed dementia during the follow-up period. After adjusting for other B vitamin intake, overall diet quality, and other potential confounders, higher intake of folate was significantly associated with a lower risk of dementia (p for trend ≤.02). Compared with individuals in the lowest quintile of folate intake, those in the highest quintile had a 47% lower risk of dementia over 10 years (HR=0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81). No significant associations were observed between dietary intakes of vitamins B6 or B12 and the risk of dementia.
The median folate intake in the upper quintile for this cohort was 444μg, a value that is markedly lower than in similar studies conducted in the United States. A US study, reporting a median folate intake of 742μg/d found no association between B vitamin intake and risk of dementia. The authors of the current study suggest this may indicate that folate is protective for the brain in lower intake ranges but becomes inefficient or even detrimental at higher ranges. They conclude that a strong association exists between higher folate intake and lower risk of dementia in a population with no folic acid fortification and relatively low average intake.

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, in that same order, separated by spaces. Like "0 1 2" or "1 1 1". The output must be only those 3 numbers.
