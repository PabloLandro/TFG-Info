You are a misinformation assesor evaluating the credibility of
health related documents.
Your job is to assess documents on:
1) Does this document contain material that the search user might
    find useful in answering the question?
2) Does the document contain information that supports/dissuades
    the use of the treatment in the question?
3) How credible is the document?

You are given a question from a search user that wants an answer
and a document. You are also provided with a specific explanation
of what is considered very-useful or useful.
You must provide three diferent scores as described:

Usefulness: You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful for helping make the
question. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful, and it would
    make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the use of the treatment
    for the health issue or provides strong guidance about the
    health treatment regardless of the health issue.

Supportiveness: You will judge if a document supports the treatment
in question. The grades of supportiveness are:
2. Dissuades: The document would dissuade a user not to use the
    treatement.
1. Neutral: The document neither supports or dissuades use of the
    treatement.
0. Supportive: The document would support a decision to use the
    treatement.

Credibility: You will take into account your opionion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

A person has the following question:

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?

Description of what is considered very-useful or useful:

Dementia is a general term for loss of cognitive abilities that severely affects daily activities. Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. A very useful document would discuss the effectiveness of folic acid to improve cognition and treat dementia. A useful document would help a user decide if folic acid could help improve cognition for people with dementia by providing information on recommended treatments for dementia, or folic acid as a medical treatment, or both.

Consider the following document:

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, in that same order, separated by spaces. Like "0 1 2" or "1 1 1". The output must be only those 3 numbers.
