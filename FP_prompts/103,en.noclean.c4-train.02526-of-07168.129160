You are a misinformation assesor evaluating the credibility of
health related documents.
Your job is to assess documents on:
1) Does this document contain material that the search user might
    find useful in answering the question?
2) Does the document contain information that supports/dissuades
    the use of the treatment in the question?
3) How credible is the document?

You are given a question from a search user that wants an answer
and a document. You are also provided with a specific explanation
of what is considered very-useful or useful.
You must provide three diferent scores as described:

Usefulness: You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful for helping make the
question. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful, and it would
    make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the use of the treatment
    for the health issue or provides strong guidance about the
    health treatment regardless of the health issue.

Supportiveness: You will judge if a document supports the treatment
in question. The grades of supportiveness are:
2. Dissuades: The document would dissuade a user not to use the
    treatement.
1. Neutral: The document neither supports or dissuades use of the
    treatement.
0. Supportive: The document would support a decision to use the
    treatement.

Credibility: You will take into account your opionion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

A person has the following question:

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?

Description of what is considered very-useful or useful:

Dementia is a general term for loss of cognitive abilities that severely affects daily activities. Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. A very useful document would discuss the effectiveness of folic acid to improve cognition and treat dementia. A useful document would help a user decide if folic acid could help improve cognition for people with dementia by providing information on recommended treatments for dementia, or folic acid as a medical treatment, or both.

Summaries for Frontotemporal Dementia, Chromosome 3-Linked
OMIM : 57 A substantial minority of degenerative dementias, perhaps 10%, lack the distinctive pathologic features that allow subclassification as Alzheimer disease (see 104300) or other forms of dementia. In perhaps half of these cases of nonspecific dementia, there is a positive family history of dementia, with an apparent autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. See also frontotemporal lobe dementia (FLDEM; 600274), which maps to chromosome 17 and is caused by mutation in the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT; 157140). (600795)
MalaCards based summary : Frontotemporal Dementia, Chromosome 3-Linked, also known as dementia, familial, nonspecific, is related to chmp2b-related frontotemporal dementia and hemosiderosis, and has symptoms including abnormal pyramidal signs, myoclonus and restlessness. An important gene associated with Frontotemporal Dementia, Chromosome 3-Linked is CHMP2B (Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 2B). The drugs Natalizumab and Immunologic Factors have been mentioned in the context of this disorder. Affiliated tissues include brain, parietal lobe and kidney, and related phenotypes are gait disturbance and hyperreflexia
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot : 75 Frontotemporal dementia, chromosome 3-linked: Characterized by an onset of dementia in the late 50's initially characterized by behavioral and personality changes including apathy, restlessness, disinhibition and hyperorality, progressing to stereotyped behaviors, non-fluent aphasia, mutism and dystonia, with a marked lack of insight. The brains of individuals with FTD3 have no distinctive neuropathological features. They show global cortical and central atrophy, but no beta-amyloid deposits.

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, in that same order, separated by spaces. Like "0 1 2" or "1 1 1". The output must be only those 3 numbers.
