You are a misinformation assesor evaluating the credibility of
health related documents.
Your job is to assess documents on:
1) Does this document contain material that the search user might
    find useful in answering the question?
2) Does the document contain information that supports/dissuades
    the use of the treatment in the question?
3) How credible is the document?

You are given a question from a search user that wants an answer
and a document. You are also provided with a specific explanation
of what is considered very-useful or useful.
You must provide three diferent scores as described:

Usefulness: You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful for helping make the
question. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful, and it would
    make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the use of the treatment
    for the health issue or provides strong guidance about the
    health treatment regardless of the health issue.

Supportiveness: You will judge if a document supports the treatment
in question. The grades of supportiveness are:
2. Dissuades: The document would dissuade a user not to use the
    treatement.
1. Neutral: The document neither supports or dissuades use of the
    treatement.
0. Supportive: The document would support a decision to use the
    treatement.

Credibility: You will take into account your opionion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

A person has the following question:

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?

Description of what is considered very-useful or useful:

Dementia is a general term for loss of cognitive abilities that severely affects daily activities. Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. A very useful document would discuss the effectiveness of folic acid to improve cognition and treat dementia. A useful document would help a user decide if folic acid could help improve cognition for people with dementia by providing information on recommended treatments for dementia, or folic acid as a medical treatment, or both.

Consider the following document:

Low Folic Acid & B12 Increases Dementia Risk
Low levels of Folic Acid and B12 increase your risk of developing dementia
Tweet
Feb 14, 2008
The results of a new study from the Institute of Psychiatry in London and Chonnam National University Hospital Medical School show that both Folic Acid and Vitamin B12 are needed for brain health. In fact, lacking Folic Acid can increase your risk of developing dementia by an astounding 350%. The researchers followed 518 people, average age of 73, for 2.4 years. All participants were free of dementia at the start of the study. At the end of the 2.4 year study, 45 people had developed dementia (34 with Alzheimer’s disease, 7 with vascular dementia, and 4 with other types of dementia). If folic acid levels fell over the study period and conversely, the level of homocysteine rose, you were significantly more likely to develop dementia. The level of Folic Acid was connected to the level of Vitamin B12. Homocysteine is an intermediary in protein metabolism that rises if you are low in the B-complex vitamin Folic Acid, and elevated homocysteine causes inflammation in the brain, blood vessels, and in other tissues. The study is published online ahead of print in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry.
A low level of Vitamin B12 and also Folic Acid tied to a quicker rate of cognitive decline and having sufficient B12 slows this decline
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of mental decline in relation to levels of B12 or Folic Acid. In their study, researchers from Oxford University in the UK and Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, investigated the level of homocysteine and other markers of vitamin status at 3 junctures over a 10-year period and compared them to levels of Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid while also giving the study subjects a test to evaluate mental status in a total of 1,648 participants. Brain function declined abruptly at younger ages in some participants but remained intact in others until very old age. The scientists looked at levels of holotranscobalamin in the subjects; this level increases as Vitamin B12 status improves. They also looked at the levels of homocysteine (this increases as levels of both folic acid and B12 decrease) and methylmalonic acid (this increases with a decrease in the body's B12 reserve). Having a lowered level of holotranscobalamin and elevated levels of both homocysteine and methylmalonic acid predicted a decline in cognitive function. If the level of holotranscobalamin, a sensitive marker of sufficient B12, doubled, this indicated a 30% slower rate of cognitive decline. A doubling of homocysteine or methylmalonic acid was disastrous, indicating a 50% or greater respectively more rapid cognitive decline; all of this indicates that it is a lower level of Vitamin B12 that is more important for the loss of mental function with aging. The message is to get adequate B12 and also Folic Acid to protect your mental function. The study is published in the November 2007 issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, in that same order, separated by spaces. Like "0 1 2" or "1 1 1". The output must be only those 3 numbers.
