You are a misinformation assesor evaluating the credibility of
health related documents.
Your job is to assess documents on:
1) Does this document contain material that the search user might
    find useful in answering the question?
2) Does the document contain information that supports/dissuades
    the use of the treatment in the question?
3) How credible is the document?

You are given a question from a search user that wants an answer
and a document. You are also provided with a specific explanation
of what is considered very-useful or useful.
You must provide three diferent scores as described:

Usefulness: You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful for helping make the
question. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful, and it would
    make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the use of the treatment
    for the health issue or provides strong guidance about the
    health treatment regardless of the health issue.

Supportiveness: You will judge if a document supports the treatment
in question. The grades of supportiveness are:
2. Dissuades: The document would dissuade a user not to use the
    treatement.
1. Neutral: The document neither supports or dissuades use of the
    treatement.
0. Supportive: The document would support a decision to use the
    treatement.

Credibility: You will take into account your opionion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

A person has the following question:

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?

Description of what is considered very-useful or useful:

Dementia is a general term for loss of cognitive abilities that severely affects daily activities. Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. A very useful document would discuss the effectiveness of folic acid to improve cognition and treat dementia. A useful document would help a user decide if folic acid could help improve cognition for people with dementia by providing information on recommended treatments for dementia, or folic acid as a medical treatment, or both.

Dementia Symptoms and Treatment Options - Step 4
Treatment Options
Potential treatment options are listed below in order from most effective to least effective, as determined by TeddyCanHeal's advanced software. Not every treatment will work for everyone, so talk to your doctor to determine what will be best for your individual needs. Many treatments may also be used in combination with one another or with medication.
7: Folic Acid
General Information:
Folic acid is similar to some of the other treatments on this list in that it helps to break down the chemical homocysteine, which can be harmful in large amounts and may contribute to the development of dementia. Similar to vitamin B12, folic acid deficiency can lead to cognitive decline, depression, and other neurological problems.
It should be noted that folic acid is not quite as harmless as some of its relatives further up this list. Folic acid supplements have the potential to interact with other conditions, including epilepsy and vitamin B12 deficiency, and it is not safe to take in large doses. In most cases, only those who know for certain that they have a folic acid deficiency (which many with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia do) should be taking these supplements.
Additionally, like vitamin B12, the response time to treatment with folic acid can be slow, so one should not expect immediate results.
Scientific Studies:
In 2004, researchers investigated the relationship between mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, and levels of folate (folic acid is a form of folate). They found that folate deficiency may be a precursor to Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, and that high levels of homocysteine may also be a risk factor for cognitive problems. The following year, a similar study looked at whether levels of homocysteine and folic acid could act as predictors of age-related cognitive decline. According to their report, ...concentrations of homocysteine and folic acid were significantly associated with cognitive performance. Specifically, they found that high concentrations of homocysteine and low concentrations of folic acid were correlated with cognitive decline, though they note that this imbalance could be a symptom of neurodegenerative disease rather than a cause.
Like other vitamins on this list, not all studies have reported notable positive effects of incorporating folic acid into the diet, so it may not be an effective treatment for all people.
8: Magnesium
General Information:
Magnesium is a mineral important to many parts of the body, and it plays a key part in the function of enzymes. It can be taken as a supplement or found in foods such as spinach, almonds, cashews, soy beans, black beans, yogurt, and brown rice. Low levels of magnesium can lead to behavioral changes and problems with the nervous system. While its relationship to dementia is still being investigated, preliminary research has shown that there may be a correlation between low magnesium (and other mineral) levels and the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. While it is unlikely that magnesium deficiency is the root cause of these diseases, it could increase the risk of developing them or cause symptoms to be more severe.
Magnesium is generally safe to take, though it can interact with certain medications, so make sure to talk to your doctor about it and the other meds that you are taking.
Scientific Studies:
In 2005, scientists set out to investigate a possible link between low intake of minerals and the development of Parkinsons disease. They found that reduced magnesium intake led to the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons (a hallmark of Parkinsons disease). A paper published the following year noted that Mg [Magnesium] in the treatment of dementia facilitates learning and contributes to improvement in other symptoms.
In 2012, a Japanese study looked at whether higher intake of magnesium and other minerals could help lower the risk of dementia. More than 1000 people participated, and in their 17-year follow-up, the researchers found that those who reported taking higher concentrations of the mineral supplements (which also included calcium and potassium) had a reduced risk of developing dementia, particularly vascular dementia.

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, in that same order, separated by spaces. Like "0 1 2" or "1 1 1". The output must be only those 3 numbers.
