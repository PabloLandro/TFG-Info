The upper is made with genuine leather and consists of a wide single hook and loop strap that is easily adjustable and fastens over the instep for a flexible fit.  The soft leather lining adds comfort and breathability while the padded collar can aid with preventing blisters. A 1/2" depth insole is made with special AnitShox Gel material that not only reduces the weight of the insole but is shock absorbing to prevent ankle pain, heel pain, and back pain; and since it's removable it can accommodate custom orthotics and diabetic insoles.  This orthopedic shoe is also constructed with a lightweight polyurethane rocker sole to provide stability and offers added traction to help resist slippage.  The Ambulator collection is internationally recognized by foot health professionals for common foot problems such as foot pain, arthritis , and diabetes ; and because the Ambulator Single Strap is biomechanically designed, one will feel less stress at the foot areas that are most susceptible to pain.
