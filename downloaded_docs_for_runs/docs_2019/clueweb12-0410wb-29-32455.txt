		centuries the healing art of acupuncture has been practiced on animals. 
		The origin of acupuncture dates back to ancient China. The Chinese 
		regularly practiced acupuncture on horses then gradually tried it on 
		other farm animals and finally dogs, cats and birds. This form of 
		healing work is based around bio-energy or Qi (See Shiatsu for a more 
		detailed explanation of Qi). Acupuncture serves to unblock Qi energy and 
		in so doing boosts the immune system which aids in self-healing. 
		Acupuncture causes the body to release endorphins and hormones while at 
		the same time decreasing inflammation both internally and externally. Overcoming 
		Insomnia - How To Achieve Peaceful, Quality Sleep Proper rest is essential to good health, 
		and sleeplessness is a sign of imbalance. If your sleep is habitually 
		disturbed it can be very damaging to the vital energy of the body and 
		immune system. If this is the case it is important that you inform your 
		acupuncturist so that you can work together to determine the cause of 
		the imbalance and treat it appropriately. You will be amazed at how a 
		good night's sleep can change your life. With more rest your energy and 
		focus improve, the immune system and your body's ability to deal with 
		stress are strengthened, and nagging health conditions resolve more 
		easily. Qi 
		Soup for the TCM Soul By Dr. Bruce Eichelberger So I'm sitting around late one night and it occurs to 
		me that some of you reading this forum may still be wondering exactly 
		what this funny foreign concept, "Qi" really means... Of course I already know you can easily go to 
		Amazon.com or some search engine and find dozens, possibly hundreds of 
		books and other references for Qi (Chi) and Qi Gong (Chi Kung or 
		qigong), but you're here now, so what can I tell you that you are 
		unlikely to find in some book or video... Hmm... RECENT RESEARCH The
