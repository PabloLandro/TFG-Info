Originally a plant native to the Balkan mountains of Eastern Europe, feverfew—a short bush with daisy-like flowers—now grows throughout Europe, North America, and South America. Migraines are often the result of blood vessel spasms in the brain that block oxygen flow. Feverfew—an herb grown in Europe—reduces these spasms by slowing the production of inflammatory compounds. When German scientists gave migraine sufferers 6 mg feverfew daily for 4 months, the frequency of their headaches was cut in half. Feverfew also helps reduce eczema inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis.  Other supplements that help migraines:  riboflavin (vitamin B-2), butterbur, and Coenzyme Q10.
