Relieves muscle cramps and spasms Supports the production of energy during exercise Prevents magnesium deficiency Maintains cardiovascular health and healthy function of the nervous system Great tasting orange flavour Magnesium is essential for many cellular functions, particularly those functions involved in energy production, and for the normal functioning of muscle and nerve tissue. Signs of low magnesium levels can include fatigue, mental confusion, irritability, muscle cramps, problems with nerve conduction and muscle contraction, insomnia and predisposition to stress. If the blood is low in magnesium it takes it from the muscles and without enough magnesium in muscles they stiffen up or contract. The result may be painful cramps, irritability, twitching or even tremors. Some people may develop muscle cramps at rest, while others develop them at night, along with a difficulty sleeping. Magnesium may help to relieve night leg cramps and helps all muscles in the body to function optimally. One third of Australians over 18 years do not get their recommended daily intake of magnesium and a deficiency may be exacerbated by stress, strenuous exercise and poor absorption. Blackmores Magnesium Powder contains a highly absorbable form of magnesium to enhance cellular uptake. Blackmores Magnesium Powder also contains a range of other ingredients including amino acids which are important for energy production, muscle function and repair, as below: Contains: Magnesium Taurine - plays a role in maintaining healthy cardiovascular function Glutamine - Exhaustive exercise or intense training sessions decrease glutamine in the blood.
