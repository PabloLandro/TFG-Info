Some glaciers, mostly ice caps. Sea level’s up. Did some media miss the point? » Phil Inquirer: Ahem. Cough-cough-uch-uch-hmmm. Got your attention? That’s the topic: cough cough. You ever wonder if that lineup of syrups, lozenges, and such-all at the drug store really has something to tame a cough? So do a lot of people. The Inquirer ‘s Tom Avril has a consumer health story of the sort we don’t see enough. It doesn’t have the credulous tone of so much writing that blathers on about some or other therapy without offering a shred of evidence from skeptical-by-nature scientists that it might be hocum. He talks to various sources about a common ailment, touts no miracle cure or the cold-cough equivalent to a fad-diet or other empty verbiage. It turns out, says here, that while the cough is perhaps the most common ailment encountered (sniffly runny nose may exceed it) by humanity, it hasn’t gotten much research lately. But there is some, and it is interesting. Reasons include that most ordinary coughs clear up and usually aren’t that bad in the meantime, hence don’t hold a lot of fascination for medical researchers. Plus, it can be tough to measure efficacy of an anti-cough strategy when the cough is so naturally erratic in its persistence. As Avril writes, making it even more slippery as a research topic is that people can, usually, decide to suppress a cough. Not always. I had a cough recently that lasted for weeks, a full-diaphragm explosion that rattled my airway and couldn’t be denied. But it vanished. The gist here is that some research is underway, some new therapies may emerge, some old wives tales about what might work are being verified, and some strange treatments (aerosolized chile peppers?!) are getting a look. He cites a study indicating that plain honey, a spoonful, did more for hacking children than did a drug store cough syrup containing a time-honored ingredient (which did nothing at all).  This will be a very heavily-read story by parents in and around Philadelphia, one wagers. - Charlie Petit This entry was posted
