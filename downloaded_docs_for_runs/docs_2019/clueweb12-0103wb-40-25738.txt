Mid Back Pain Relief Tips If you are one of the many people that suffer with mid back pain then you will know what little relief there is from this condition; for most people, their only concern is to receive back pain relief medication to dull the pain. Although some medication may be effective and bring pain relief, it doesn't really help with the underlying problem of the condition causing the distress. Any type of medication should only be used with the supervision of a doctor but especially when it is taken on a regular basis. The problem with the back is just how strong it is and at the same time how easily it can become damaged. Once spinal injury has occurred, it can be a permanent condition, often caused by something as simple as bad posture. However, back pain is usually caused by a lifting accident or from lifting incorrectly and it is normally the mid to lower back that suffers. Fortunately there are a number of natural back pain relief remedies that can help without a reliance on prescription medication. Tense muscles in the back can be eased just by gentle stretching; this provides relief and is simple to carry out. Some people are now discovering the benefits of reflexology. Massaging the feet in certain areas bring relief to a number of back pain sufferers. Often to compensate for the pain, the back muscles over compensate. Reflexology can help provide relief by improving the circulation which in turn relaxes these hard worked muscles. Acupuncture is used frequently by people suffering spinal agony by giving them back pain relief just as it has for thousands of years, although, only recently in the West. The Chinese believe that all humans have an energy force called qi and by inserting needles in specific parts of the body, it can help to unblock qi and restore the flow. Like reflexology, acupuncture seems to be used by people who suffer with chronic conditions like back pain. Tai Chi is also another ancient Chinese discipline which is basically a type of exercise similar to yoga, except it is a little slower. The most important aspect of tai chi is that almost anyone can participate as it uses gentle breathing exercises and techniques to help relax the body. It would be a shame not to finish by remembering that exercise can provide mid back pain relief and that regular exercise is also one of the best preventative medicines available. Upper Back Pain In order to understand upper back pain causes, we must first understand the upper back. Unlike lower back pain, pain from the upper back is not that common. The upper back region is where you will find the thoracic spine, which in turn contains twelve vertebrae. These vertebrae are linked to nine of the twelve ribs. Sitting perpendicularly to the spine is the breastbone, which also is connected to the ribs. These bones all form part of what is know as the thoracic or "chest" cage. This cage sole responsibility is to protect the organs found in our upper body. The three remaining ribs at the low end of the "ladder" are not attached to the breastbone and therefore do not form part of the thoracic or "chest" cage. Upper back pain, though rare, does occur. This article will explain the causes and treatment of upper back pain. What Causes Upper Back Pain The human spinal web is divided in three major sections 1. The thoracic spine which exists to not only give the body its stability but also to protect the major organs and for that reason, is much stronger that the other two. 2. The cervical spine is closely related to the neck area and its main purpose is to allow the body to move and flex. 3. The lumbar spine is associated to the lower back and its main role, as with the cervical spine, is to give the body its flexibility and movement. It is mainly for these reasons that most back injuries tend to occur in the lumbar and cervical spines, as they are not as strong as the thoracic spine. However back pains, as rare as they may seem, still do occur in the thoracic spine and can be traced back to either myofascial pain and joint dysfunctional pain. Myofascial pain - Is basically an irritation of the muscles brought about by muscle strains. Strains usually occur during sporting activities, over use of a muscle or even extreme sudden movements as in when the body is thrown forward in a car crash. In these cases, it is the larger muscles that support the shoulder blades that are affected. Joint dysfunction - Joints are the connection between each rib and the thoracic spine. Sustaining an injury to the joints can cause them to stop functioning properly and cause upper back pain. How To Treat Upper Back Pain The recommended treatment for myofascial pain is deep tissue massage, manipulation of the spine by a qualified physiotherapist, very light shoulder exercises and even a dose of acupuncture. Stretching and strengthening your shoulder muscles are a must if you want to be finally free from upper back pain. Joint dysfunction is usually best treated by direct injections of steroids in the problem area or areas, light aerobic exercises, prescribed medication and manipulation of the spine by a qualified physiotherapist Upper back pain causes are very hard to diagnose and should you be unfortunately suffering from it, the best professionals to see are firstly pain management specialists like chiropractors and physiotherapist and if the pain still persists, an orthopedic surgeon.
