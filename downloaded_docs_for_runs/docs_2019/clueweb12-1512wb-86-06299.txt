Schedule an Ayurveda Consultation Ayurvedic Recipes Food Medicine Eating with the Seasons Recipes Ayurvedic Recipes Chinese Medicine Recipes Natural Food Recipes Vegetables Spices Contact Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine Over the millenia Chinese physicians developed a very effective and scientific (empirical) model for assessing health and disease. Practitioners assess a person’s health by feeling the quality of the pulses at each wrist, and by observing the color and form of the face, tongue, body, voice, and manner of expression. This information gleaned from looking, touching, listening, and smelling (The Four Pillars of Diagnosis)  is integrated with an elaborate series of questions (asking, or The Ten Questions) about digestion, elimination, sleep, mood, body temp, pain sensations,  menstrual cycle, relationships, work habits, living habits, and prior health history that, considered together,  portray the specific expression of health and disease that manifest in a given  individual at a specific moment in time. This specific expression of illness in an individual is called the Pattern of Disharmony, called Bian Zheng in Chinese Medicine.  Each specific Bian Zheng corresponds to  a specific base  therapeutic protocol of  acupuncture, herbal formula, diet and or lifestyle modification that is, in turn, specially tailored  to accommodate and improve the individual’s unique ecology and terrain. Consider, for example, two people with the bio-med defined disease of Asthma. One, is a happy-go-lucky, overweight, red-faced, 45 year old man with an excessive  appetite, a frequent craving for iced beverages, but with reasonable elimination, sleep and rather oily skin. His tongue is swollen and red with a greasy yellow  coating. His pulse is bounding and slippery. His blood pressure is slightly high and his voice is louder than it needs to be for the room he is in.  He laughs a lot during the interview and his body odor is quite strong. His asthma is worse after eating and is complicated by seasonal allergies to ragweed and pollen. The other asthmatic is an anxious, nervous, underweight 31year old woman with dark rings under her sad-looking eyes, dry skin and hair, fatigue, poor appetite and a tendency towards constipation. Her tongue is shrunken and red with many cracks and is dry and without coating. Her pulse is fine, rapid, and weak, and her voice soft and uncertain. She has difficulty answering questions about herself and exhibits a somewhat flattened affect. Her menstrual periods are brief, painful, and lighter than normal. Her asthma, which began in childhood, is worse at nighttime, when she is restless and suffers occasional palpitations. She has a history of late bed-wetting. While these two patients both have the same “disease” named Asthma by western medicine, their diagnoses in Chinese medicine are quite different. In Chinese medicine they both have signs  of “heat,” but one is combined with signs and symptoms of “dampness” and is a replete or full heat, while the second is a function of vacuity or empty heat with yin vacuity and lack of fluids. Both have additional complicating factors that will be addressed by their individual acupuncture treatment and herb formulas. So while both have what Chinese medicine calls wheezing and panting, each has a different pattern of disharmony (Bien Zheng)  that is at the root of their disease called  Asthma by modern bio-medicine, and “wheezing and panting” in the  nomenclature of traditional Chinese medicine.
