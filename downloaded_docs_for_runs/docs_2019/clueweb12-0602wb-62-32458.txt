                    data satisfactorily addressing the basic questions 
                    of effectiveness and acceptability of hand 
                    acupuncture in a pediatric population. The 
                    overall efficacy was 96%. This rate of success 
                    included the treatment of a variety of clinical 
                    conditions both acute and chronic, painful 
                    and not painful. The majority of children, 
                    79% of the sample, were treated for pain, 
                    particularly of muscular and/or skeletal origin. 
                    Half of these children had experienced acute 
                    pain for fewer than 7 days. The remainder 
                    of the patients exhibited chronic, nonpainful 
                    diseases such as allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, 
                    and asthma. The limitations inherent 
                    to a nonrandomized, uncontrolled study affect 
                    the interpretation of the results. However, 
                    the data provide evidence that mitigates this 
                    study's methodological constraint; the findings 
                    persuasively argue in favor of the healing 
                    validity of hand acupuncture in children. Table 5 lists the timing 
                    of symptom improvement as a function of the 
                    presenting conditions. Clinical improvement 
                    occurred in most patients; 70% reported an 
                    improvement of their symptoms in fewer than 
                    3 days, 52% within 24 hours. The findings 
                    are strengthened by the fact that many times 
                    after only I treatment, most children with 
                    muscular and/or skeletal pain were able to 
                    resume their routine activities immediately, 
                    avoided taking excessive doses of analgesics, 
                    did not require radiological examinations, 
                    and had no need for orthopedic or physical 
                    therapy consultations. The majority of patients 
                    with chronic conditions experienced a significant 
                    attenuation of their symptoms within 2 weeks. 
                    The children and parents reported the use 
                    of fewer medications for these conditions. 
                    Children with recurrent abdominal pain appeared 
                    to respond to the treatment the quickest of 
                    the group with chronic symptoms. This group 
                    reported surprise that a seemingly simple 
                    manipulation of their hands would significantly 
                    decrease or abolish their long-standing, frustrating, 
                    annoying symptoms. The children with chronic 
                    sinusitis and allergic rhinitis often reported 
                    experiencing relief of their resistant nasal 
                    obstruction and itching. The children with 
                    chronic asthma universally experienced fewer 
                    or no exacerbations, and their need for bronchodilators 
                    was reduced, even at the time of an exacerbation. 
                    None of them needed to use steroids during 
                    the study period. Thus, conventional wisdom 
                    would argue that this rapid improvement or 
                    complete resolution of symptoms, and the positive 
                    feelings experienced by the majority of the 
                    children, was not likely due to exclusive 
                    chance, natural course, or pure placebo effect. None of the children 
                    reported any adverse effects, local or systemic, 
                    from the treatments. All children and their 
                    parents readily accepted the treatments. Many 
                    of them expressed amazement at the dramatic 
                    clinical improvement that was seemingly due 
                    to a treatment technique so disparate from 
                    conventional medicine. The initial readiness 
                    to consent to the treatment should be understood 
                    within a larger context: the preexisting trust 
                    and rapport between patient and physician, 
                    and the patient's reassurance upon learning 
                    the physician's view of acupuncture as not 
                    being exclusionary of, but unambiguously complementary 
                    to, traditional medicine. Experience suggests 
                    that hand acupuncture can be well accepted 
                    in a pediatric practice setting with the characteristics 
                    discussed above. Moreover, the patient's acceptability 
                    is likely to be further solidified by positive 
                    clinical outcomes. This article is the 
                    first part of a larger research endeavor that 
                    will comprise 3 sequential stages. The progress 
                    and final conclusion of this project will 
                    depend on the stepwise fulfillment of each 
                    part's specific research objectives. The second 
                    stage of this project will examine the effects 
                    of hand acupuncture on a group of children 
                    with a nar rower scope of chronic diseases 
                    such as asthma, chronic functional abdominal 
                    pain, and nocturnal enuresis. Standardized 
                    and validated acupuncture research instruments 
                    will be used to collect and evaluate data. 
                    The final section of this project aspires 
                    to study children with the chronic diseases 
                    identified in part 2 in a randomized, well-controlled 
                    fashion. CONCLUSION This study offers 
                    preliminary evidence suggesting that pediatric 
                    hand acupuncture is a safe, cost-effective, 
                    and well-accepted integrative treatment modality 
                    in pediatric practice surroundings. REFERENCES 1. Jodorkovsky
