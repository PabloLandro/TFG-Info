Namibian Health Insurance Board Approves Male Circumcision Fee | SHOPS US AID | From The American People Home About SHOPS Resource Center Meeting Place Search this site: Namibian Health Insurance Board Approves Male Circumcision Fee Submitted by Montana_stevenson on Mon, 2011-12-19 18:25 AIDS health financing HIV/AIDS Left Yes Super Featured Namibia On October 15, the Namibian Association of Medical Aid Funds (medical insurance schemes) approved a uniform tariff for male circumcision. Winning approval for this fee structure, proposed by the SHOPS team, is the first step in an effort to have adult male circumcision covered as an explicit HIV preventative benefit by Namibian medical aid plans. Namibia is the first country in southern Africa to reach this milestone. The decision allows private providers, like the one pictured here, to be reimbursed at a fixed rate for performing male circumcisions for HIV prevention using the clinical guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the Namibian Ministry of Health and Social Services. A recent meta-analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that male circumcision reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38 to 66 percent over 24 months. In addition, according to Centers for Disease Control, studies in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda have shown that male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection by up to 60 percent . The recommended and approved tariff was generated from analysis completed by Deloitte & Touche South Africa. Jhpiego, an affiliate of John Hopkins University and a partner on the SHOPS project, validated the accuracy of the clinical assumptions used in calculating the fee. The next step for SHOPS Namibia is to work with medical insurance plans to make certain that the health benefits of male circumcision are understood and that the service is widely covered. Simultaneously, the SHOPS team is working with the Ministry of Health and Social Services Male Circumcision Task Force to ensure that training opportunities in male circumcision clinical skills are offered to private providers.
