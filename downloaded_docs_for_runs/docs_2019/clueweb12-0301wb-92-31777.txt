Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary
studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. An herb is primarily supported by traditional use,
or the herb or supplement has little scientific support and/or minimal health benefit. What are the symptoms of migraine? Migraines are commonly
preceded by warning symptoms (prodrome), that may include depression , irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, and a characteristic
“aura”—usually a visual disturbance such as flashing lights or a localized
area of blindness that follows the appearance of brilliantly colored shimmering lights.
Migraines may also involve nausea, vomiting, and changes in vision. Conventional treatment options: The most common drugs
prescribed for acute migraine symptoms are sumatriptan (Imitrex®), dihydroergotamine (DHE®), and ergotamine- caffeine (Cafergot®). Many different drugs have been
prescribed for migraine prevention, most commonly propranolol (Inderal®), verapamil (Calan®,
Isoptin®), and amitriptyline (Amitril®, Elavil®). Dietary changes that may be helpful: Some migraine sufferers
have an abnormality of blood-sugar regulation known as reactive hypoglycemia . In these people, improvement in the frequency
and/or severity of migraines resulted from dietary changes designed to control the blood
sugar. 1 2 For the treatment of reactive hypoglycemia, many healthcare
practitioners recommend strict avoidance of refined sugar , caffeine , and alcohol, and eating small,
frequent meals (such as six times per day). Migraines can be triggered by allergies and may be
relieved by identifying and avoiding the problem foods. 3 4 5 6 Uncovering these food allergies with the help of a doctor is often a useful way
to prevent migraines. In children suffering migraines who also have epilepsy , there is evidence that eliminating offending foods
will also reduce the frequency of seizures. 7 Some people who suffer from migraines also react to salt, and reducing intake of salt is helpful for some of these
people. 8 Some people with migraines have been reported to improve after removing all cows’ milk protein from their diet. The
presence of lactose intolerance was found to
be a strong predictor of improvement in that study. 9 In addition, some migraine
sufferers have an impaired capacity to break down tyramine , a substance found in many foods 10 that is known to trigger migraines
in some people. 11 People with this defect are presumably more sensitive than others
to the effects of tyramine. 12 Ingestion of the artificial sweetener, aspartame , has also been reported
to trigger migraines in a small proportion of people. 13 14 L-tryptophan, an amino acid found in protein-rich
foods, is converted to serotonin, a substance that might worsen some migraines. For that
reason, two studies have investigated the effect of a low-protein diet on migraines; in these
studies some people experienced a reduction in migraine symptoms. 15 16 However, in a small double-blind trial, four of eight people had marked improvement in their
migraine symptoms while receiving L-tryptophan (500 mg every six hours). 17 Moreover, some preliminary evidence discussed below suggests that 5-hydroxytryptophan , a supplement related to L-tryptophan, may reduce symptoms in some
migraine sufferers. Therefore, the idea that a low-protein diet would help migraine patients
due to its low L-tryptophan content appears doubtful. Lifestyle changes that may be helpful: Some doctors have found
that reactions to smoking and birth control
pills can be additional contributing factors in migraines. Infection with Helicobacter pylori ( H.
pylori, an organism that causes peptic ulcers )
may predispose people to migraine headaches. In a preliminary trial, 40% of migraine sufferers
were found to have H. pylori infection. Intensity, duration, and frequency of attacks
of migraine were significantly reduced in all participants in whom the H. pylori was
eradicated. 18 Controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm these preliminary
results. Nutritional supplements that may be helpful: Compared with
healthy people, people with migraines have been found to have lower blood and brain levels of magnesium . 19 20 21 22 Preliminary research in a group of women (mostly premenopausal) showed that
supplementing with magnesium (usually 200 mg per day) reduced the frequency of migraines in
80% of those treated. 23 In a double-blind trial of 81 people with migraines, 600 mg
of magnesium per day was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing the frequency
of migraines. 24 Another double-blind trial found that taking 360 mg of magnesium
per day decreased the number of days on which premenstrual migraines occurred. 25 One double-blind trial found no benefit from 486 mg of magnesium per day for three months.
However, that study defined improvement according to extremely strict criteria, and even some
known anti-migraine drugs have failed to show benefit when tested using those
criteria. 26 Intravenous magnesium has been reported to produce marked and sometimes
complete symptom relief during acute migraines, usually within 15 minutes or
less. 27 One group of researchers treated 49 migraine patients with large amounts of vitamin B2 (400 mg per day). Both the frequency and severity of
migraines decreased by more than two-thirds. 28 In a follow-up three-month,
double-blind trial, the same researchers reported that 59% of patients assigned to receive
vitamin B2 had at least a 50% reduction in the number of headache days, whereas only 15% of
those assigned to receive a placebo experienced that degree of improvement. 29 The
effects of vitamin B2 were most pronounced during the final month of the
trial. 30 The cause of migraine headaches is believed to be related to abnormal serotonin function in
blood vessels, 31 and 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ,
which is converted by the body into serotonin) may affect this abnormality. In one study, 40
people with recurrent migraines received either 5-HTP (200 mg per day) or methysergide (a drug
used to prevent migraines) for 40 days. Both compounds reduced the frequency of migraines by
about 50%. 32 Larger amounts of 5-HTP (600 mg per day) were also found to be as
effective as medications for reducing migraine headache attacks in adults in two double-blind
trials. 33 34 Migraine attacks were reduced in frequency, severity, and
duration in 90% of those taking 400 mg per day of 5-HTP in a double-blind placebo-controlled
trial, 35 though another trial found no benefit of 5-HTP. 36 In another
controlled study, 400 mg of dl-5-HTP (another form of 5-HTP) led to reduced consumption of
pain-killing drugs and pain scores after one to two
months. 37 Children who suffered from migraines and had problems sleeping responded well to a daily amount of 5-HTP
equal to 20 mg for every 10 pounds of body weight in a controlled trial, 38 though
an earlier study showed 5-HTP had no better effect than placebo for children with
migraines. 39 Fish oil containing EPA and DHA has been reported to reduce the symptoms of migraine headaches in a double-blind trial
using 1 gram of fish oil per 10 pounds of body weight. 40 41 Fish oil may
help because of its effects in modifying prostaglandins (hormone-like substances made by the
body). Taking large amounts of the combination of calcium (1,000
to 2,000 mg per day) and vitamin D has been reported to
produce a marked reduction in the incidence of migraines in several women. 42 43 However, the amount of vitamin D given to these women (usually 50,000 IU once a
week), can cause adverse reactions, particularly when used in combination with calcium. This
amount of vitamin D should be used only under medical supervision. Doctors often recommend
that people take 800 to 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D per day. However, it is
not known whether theses amounts would have an effect on migraines. Preliminary research also suggests that oral supplements of SAMe (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) may reduce symptoms for some migraine
sufferers. 44 The function of the pineal gland and its cyclic secretion of melatonin may be disturbed in people with migraine
headaches. 45 Preliminary evidence suggests that 5 mg per day of melatonin, taken 30
minutes before bedtime, may reduce symptoms of migraine headaches. 46 Are there any side effects or interactions? Refer to the individual supplement for
information about any side effects or interactions. Herbs that may be helpful: The most frequently used herb for
the long-term prevention of migraines is feverfew . 47 Three double-blind trials have reported that continuous use of
feverfew leads to a reduction in the severity, duration, and frequency of migraine
headaches, 48 49 50 although one double-blind trial found
feverfew to be ineffective. 51 Studies suggest that taking standardized feverfew leaf extracts that supply a minimum of
250 mcg of parthenolide per day is most effective. Results may not be evident for at least
four to six weeks. Although there has been recent debate about the relevance of parthenolide
as an active constituent, 52 it is best to use standardized extracts of feverfew
until research proves otherwise. Anecdotal evidence suggests ginger may be used for
migraines and the accompanying nausea. 53 Ginkgo biloba extract may also help because it inhibits the action of a substance
known as platelet-activating factor, 54 which may contribute to migraines. No
clinical trials have examined its effectiveness in treating migraines, however. A standardized extract of butterbur (Petasites hybridus) was shown in a
double-blind trial to reduce the incidence of migraine attacks for three months. 55 People in the study took 50 mg of the extract twice per day. It should be noted that butterbur
contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs)—constituents that are potentially harmful to the
liver. The extract used in this study lowered the amount of PAs to a level deemed safe by the
German health authorities. There is preliminary evidence that capsaicin, the active constituent of cayenne , can be applied inside the nose as a treatment for acute
migraine. 56 However, as intranasal application of capsaicin produces a burning
sensation, it should be used only under the supervision of a doctor familiar with its use. Are there any side effects or interactions? Refer to the individual herb for
information about any side effects or interactions. Other integrative approaches that may be helpful: Many reports
have shown acupuncture to be useful in the treatment
of migraines. In a preliminary trial, 18 of 26 people suffering from migraine headaches
demonstrated an improvement in symptoms following therapy with acupuncture; they also had a
50% reduction in the use of pain medication. 57 Previous preliminary trials have
demonstrated similar results, 58 59 60 which have also been
confirmed in placebo-controlled trials. 61 62 Improvement has been
maintained at one 63 and three 64 years of follow-up. In preliminary
research, patients suffering from chronic headaches of various types (including migraine, cluster , or tension headaches ) have also experienced an improvement
in symptoms following acupuncture treatment. 65 In a trial comparing acupuncture to
traditional drug therapy, a significantly greater cure rate was achieved in the acupuncture
group relative to the drug treatment group (75% vs. 34%). 66 Dry needling is a form of acupuncture that does not utilize traditional Chinese medicine
diagnosis or traditional acupuncture points for treatment. Instead, acupuncture needles are
inserted into painful muscle areas (trigger points). A study of 85 patients comparing dry
needle acupuncture to conventional drug therapy found a similar reduction in frequency and
duration of migraine attacks in both treatment groups. 67 Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS) is an electrical nerve stimulation
technique that has become increasingly popular in the complementary and alternative management
of pain syndromes. PENS involves insertion of needle probes,
similar to acupuncture, at specific therapeutic points and then applying low levels of
electrical current. In one study, PENS was significantly more effective than needles alone at
relieving pain in migraine headaches (tension headaches and post-traumatic headaches were also
improved). 68 Practitioners of manipulation report success in
treating migraine with manipulation. 69 Migraine sufferers are reported to often
have neck pain, tenderness of the spinal joints of the neck, 70 and limited ability
to move the neck, 71 all of which suggest the presence of neck problems that could
respond to manipulation. Two preliminary trials reported significant benefit to 75–80%
of migraine patients treated with manipulation, 72 73 while a third
preliminary trial reported reductions in headache frequency and duration, nausea, and sensitivity to light one year after the completion of a
two-month course of manipulation. 74 A controlled trial compared three types of
manipulation and found all three provided significant improvement in headache frequency,
severity, and duration. 75 76 Another controlled trial compared two
months of manipulation to sham (“fake”) manipulation and to placebo treatment with
a non-functioning electrical unit. People in the manipulation group had significantly more
improvement of headache frequency and duration, and of ability to function in daily life; they
also used less medication. 77 The largest controlled trial to date compared eight
weeks of manipulation, drug therapy, or both treatments in combination. Manipulation was as
effective as the medication in reducing an overall score of migraine suffering, but had fewer
reported side effects. 78 References: 1. Wilkinson CF Jr. Recurrent migrainoid headaches associated with
