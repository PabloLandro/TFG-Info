According to Chinese medical theory, the passage of water is controlled by three organs, namely Lung, Spleen and Kidney. Lung regulates the water passages in the thorasic area, the Spleen transports and transforms water in the abdominal region, and the Kidney dominates water metabolism in the lower part of the body. Imbalance of Yin and Yang in any of these three organs may lead to stagnation of water circulation, which then causes the production and storage of fluids in the Lung. The Chinese medical practitioner needs to find out the cause of the asthma. He will treat your asthma according to the appropriate pattern with acupuncture and an herbal formula.
