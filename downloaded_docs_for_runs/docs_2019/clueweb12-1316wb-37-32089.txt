< 0.0001).  Additionally, the honey treated sites achieved complete healing significantly faster that SSD sites (21 days vs. 24 days, p < 0.0001). At this time the evidence addressing the use of honey for skin wounds is lacking.  The current studies are mostly small, unblinded controlled studies, but the choice of controls used has a great variety, making the effectiveness of comparing study outcomes difficult.  Further investigation with large well-done blinded trials using standardized controls is warranted. IV. Composite Autologous / Allogeneic / Xenographic Products The development of advanced in vitro culturing techniques has allowed the development of new products which combine human dermal cellular materials with those derived from animals (e.g., Epicel ® ).  These products involve the harvesting of human epidermal cells which are then cultured with animal cells to produce sheets of biosynthetic skin which have been proposed for use in treating human skin conditions.  At this time there are no peer-reviewed published articles addressing such products. Background/Overview Skin Wound Care The skin is the largest organ of the body. It is composed of two layers, the epidermis and the dermis, and provides functions critical to survival. The skin acts as a protective barrier to fluid losses and dehydration and it protects against infection and injury by providing a barrier to repel bacteria and other organisms. The skin provides sensory contact with our environment that tells us whether we are feeling light touch, pressure, pain, heat, or cold.  Damage to the skin that is extensive or prolonged may interfere with these functions or with those of other body systems and may become life threatening in some circumstances. The treatment of burns and wounds that have failed to heal despite conservative measures, referred to as chronic wounds, pose a significant burden on the population in terms of pain, disability, and decreased quality of life.  Chronic wounds may be due to the effects of diabetes, venous insufficiency to the extremities, pressure due to prolonged periods in the same body position, and other types of skin injuries.  They can be difficult to treat and may require treatment with various coverings, such as skin graft or other materials to prevent infection, maintain an environment conducive to healing, or provide a medium for re-growth of new skin.  Such coverings come in a wide array of types, from synthetic materials, tissues from the individuals themselves (autologous), human donors (allogeneic), or from animals such as cows and pigs (xenographic), or any combination of these materials (composites). Synthetic Products Synthetic treatments include various forms of skin-like coverings and barriers, including antimicrobial silver wound dressings, silicone/nylon membranes, and even growth factors manufactured in a laboratory using recombinant human DNA technology. Antimicrobial silver wound dressings (e.g., Acticoat, Actisorb, Silversorb) involve a synthetic layer of nylon, rayon etc. coated with silver nanocrystals.  It has been proposed that such coatings act as a barrier to infectious agents and kill bacteria before they are able to reach the wound. Completely synthetic wound dressings (e.g., Biobrane) are composed of man-made materials to form a complex multilayer covering for wounds. This type of product may consist of a wide array of materials including silicone, nylon, and others, as well as collagen or other biologic materials. Human platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) (e.g., Regranex) are produced from genetically-engineered yeast cells, into which the recombinant human form of the gene for the B-chain of PDGF has been inserted.  The yeast cells read the inserted genes, as if they were their own and produce PGDF as a product of their metabolism.  The PGDF is then collected and purified for use in clinical care.  It must be noted that on June 6, 2008 the FDA required the following black box warning be placed on the label of Regranex: "An increased rate of mortality secondary to malignancy was observed in patients treated with 3 or more tubes of REGRANEX Gel in a post-marketing retrospective cohort study. REGRANEX Gel should only be used when the benefits can be expected to outweigh the risks. REGRANEX Gel should be used with caution in patients with known malignancy." Autologous Products Autologous wound care treatment may include a skin graft, which is a piece of skin from another site on the individual's body moved to the wound site.  This method is frequently the preferred treatment, however, this method actually creates a new wound at the site where the graft was harvested, adding to the risk of infection and other complications. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a substance derived from an individual's own blood, after high-speed centrifugation.  It functions by re-creating the final phase in normal blood coagulation that produces a fibrin clot, adhering to the application site and providing wound coverage and stabilization.  Additionally, PRP may increase the concentrations of beneficial healing factors within the application site, also potentially augmenting the healing effect.  PRP's other proposed benefits include that is it autologous and thus not immunoreactive, it is absorbable, and it is fairly simple to produce.  Research in various potential uses for PRP has been ongoing, including wound care, burns, orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, and others. Another autologous method involves products derived from the individual's own blood growth factors, which are collected from the blood (e.g., Autologel, SafeBlood).  To make these types of products, blood is drawn from the individual and is centrifuged at high speeds to separate the blood components from one another.  The platelet rich plasma portion of the blood is activated with various reagents to convert the blood protein fibrinogen into fibrin, one of the major components required to form a blood clot.  This fibrin-rich gel-like substance is then immediately applied to the wound to form a wound covering. Vitagel ® is a product that uses an individual's own blood mixed with microfibrillar collagen and thrombin to create an artificial scab on wounds.  It has been proposed that this product may assist in controlling bleeding during operative procedures and other circumstances where bleeding may be of concern. Allogeneic Products There are a currently two different types of allogeneic (human derived) wound care products available.  The first involves the use of donated human cadaver skin which is then treated with various methods to remove the cellular material and deactivate or kill pathogens (e.g., Alloderm, GraftJacket, and Neoform Dermis).  This process leaves only the collagen protein scaffold, which has been proposed as an acceptable medium for which new skin cells from the individual can populate and grow into when placed over a wound site. The other allogeneic products are composite products that may contain human skin cells, keratinocytes and/or fibroblasts (depending upon the product), derived from newborn foreskins which are imbedded into a decellularized collagen protein scaffold derived from either cows or pigs (e.g., Apligraf, OrCel).  Some of these products may also consist of layers of synthetic materials like silicone, nylon, or polyglactin (e.g., Dermagraft, TransCyte). Xenographic and Xenograhic-Related or Derived Products Many wound care and reconstructive products are made from materials derived from various animal sources including cow, horse and pig tissues.  Most of these products are created by harvesting living tissues (e.g., skin, intestines, tendons, etc) from a donor animal that is then processed to remove the cellular content to leave only the collagen protein scaffold.  As with such allogeneic products, this scaffold is intended to act as a welcoming environment into which new autologous cells (e.g., skin, tendon, cartilage) may grow.  Xenographic products may be composed of only the bare collagen scaffold (e.g., Mediskin, Oasis, PriMatrix) or may be combined with synthetic materials to create a composite product (e.g. Avaulta Plus, Integra matrix, Integra Bilayer Matrix). Another type of product involves the use of substance made by or derived from xenographic sources.  One such product is honey, which has been proposed as a topical treatment for a wide variety of skin conditions. Composite Autologous / Allogeneic / Xenographic Products The development of advanced in vitro culturing techniques has allowed the development of new products which combine human dermal cellular materials with those derived from animals (e.g., Epicel®).  These products involve the harvesting of human epidermal cells (either from the individual being treated or from donor tissue) which are then cultured with animal cells to produce sheets of biosynthetic skin which have been proposed for use in treating human skin conditions. Surgical Reinforcement Procedures In a wide variety of surgical procedures, there may be a need for additional reinforcement of soft tissues to strengthen the structures being repaired, such as in hernia repair or orthopedic reconstruction procedures. Traditionally this task is undertaken with the use of allogeneic cadaver-derived grafts or synthetic materials such as polypropylene and Gore-Tex ® .  However, in some cases such materials may not be appropriate, and other materials have been sought. In other instances, the use of either grafting materials has been suggested as an alternative to a surgical approach. One example of this is in the case of injection laryngoplasty, which has been proposed as an alternative to medialization laryngoplasty. Xenographic materials have been proposed for many such applications including reconstruction procedures of the breast, pelvic floor, abdominal wall, tendons and others.  These products are usually made from the decellularized collagen scaffold alone (e.g., Collamend, Cuffpatch, Pelvicol, Pelvisoft, Surgisis, OrthoADAPT, Unite) and are sewn onto the soft tissues where they are needed where they have been proposed to provide support and strengthen the underlying structures.
