When 30 women and men with type 2 diabetes added a sprinkle to their meals, blood sugar and heart-damaging blood fats (total cholesterol and triglycerides) fell 12 to 30% in just 40 days, say researchers at the USDA's Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center in Maryland. Cinnamon makes muscle and liver cells more sensitive to signals from insulin, an important blood-sugar-controlling hormone, says study author Richard Anderson, PhD. Have a little (about 1/6 teaspoon) at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, for a daily total of about 1/2 teaspoon, he recommends. Since cinnamon may reduce your need for diabetes or cholesterol medication, ask your doctor if you need to adjust your dose. Recommended Product Maintain
