        Weight Loss Gastroplasty The term "gastroplasty" may refer to any surgical procedure 
        designed to repair a defect in the stomach or lower esophagus, but here 
        it refers to restrictive bariatric stapling procedures to reduce stomach 
        size in order to treat severe clinical obesity. Gastroplasty Procedure In this weight loss operation, bariatric surgeons divide the stomach 
        into two parts - an upper small stomach pouch and a lower (distal) stomach 
        section - through the use of gastric staples. A small gap (stoma) in the 
        staple-line is left to permit digested food in the pouch to pass through 
        into the distal stomach. Because the upper stomach pouch is so small (egg-size, 
        compared to melon-size before the gastroplasty), the patient feels full 
        very quickly and therefore calorie-intake is drastically reduced. If patients 
        continue to eat, they develop nausea, vomiting, or pain, which naturally 
        constrains further eating. Vertical Banded Gastroplasty Surgery The latest type of gastroplasty procedure is called Vertical 
        Banded Gastroplasty . This overcomes certain complications resulting 
        from earlier gastroplasty methods, such as "stretching" of the 
        stoma. It achieves this by using a vertical row of staples across a less 
        stretchy part of the stomach and uses a gastric band or silastic ring 
        as a collar to maintain the width of the stoma. Health Complications A serious complication of gastroplasty is known as anastomotic leak - 
        a leakage in the staple line. This rare complication, arising in fewer 
        than 2 percent of patients, requires immediate hospitalization. Other 
        health side-effects include: stenosis with persistent vomiting, if untreated, 
        ulcer, incisional hernia, wound infection and band erosion. Weight Loss After Gastroplasty Weight reduction following bariatric gastroplasty is good in the short-term 
        (typically a loss of about 25 percent of initial weight) but long term 
        weight loss results are less successful than with gastric bypass owing 
        to the need for strict patient compliance with post-operative diet guidelines. 
        Weight regain after 2-3 years is common. One reason for this weight regain 
        is that patients can "cheat" by eating calorie-dense liquids 
        such as ice cream or regular soda. Unfortunately, long-term changes in 
        eating habits must take place for gastroplasty to be successful. Even 
        so, with proper patient dietary compliance, vertical banded gastroplasty 
        is a viable treatment alternative for severely obese individuals. See also: Gastric Stapling Surgery Stomach Stapling Procedure Benefits and Risks of Stomach

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
