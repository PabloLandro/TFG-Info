Pain Sciatica is a common cause of low back pain and leg pain
that occurs most frequently in people 30 to 50 years of
age. It is generally caused by pressure on the sciatic
nerve from a damaged or herniated disc. Approx 80 percent of people will experience bad sciatica and
low back pain at least once during their lives.
However, one of the difficulties with making sense of your
situation is that it can be unpredictable and often unrelated
to anything you (think you) have done until you educate
yourself and realize how to look after your back. The sciatic nerve is the largest and longest nerve in the
body that runs from the lower back region through the
buttock and continues all the way down the back of the leg.
When it becomes irritated or inflamed the result is
sciatica. Sciatica normally only affects one side of your body with
the pain starting in the lower back and travelling all the way
down the back of your leg an dmay even reach the your
toes. Taking a high level view, most back pain and siatica (which is correctly spelt as sciatica ) is the result of trauma or injury to your lower back a longer-term disorder such as arthritis an inherited weakness or condition poor lifestyle choices (diet, movement, exercise
    etc) old age Some of these conditions are easier to resolve
than others, but most will respond positively to the right program of exercise, diet and good "back habits".
These are the principles described in the Better Back
System which we suggest you buy if you want
to get fast results with ending your sciatica and back
pain. One of the confusing aspects of sciatica and back
pain is that: The causes of sciatica and back pain are often not
    obvious to an ordinary doctor, even with the benefit
    of X-rays (unless you have incurred an obvious, recent
    injury). Even back specialists are sometimes unable to pinpoint
    the precise causes of back pain (and I know this from
    specific experience). My wife and I have however consulted with several doctors
and back specialists over a period of more than 18 years about
sciatica and backpain and it has become clear
that the spine is a very complex structure which is
difficult to diagnose. So read on to understand more about sciatica and
how you can treat yourself. Read also about back pain and doctors . My Story: I started visiting a back specialist (a chiropractor) around
1990, after a few years of what I thought were 'hamstring
problems' when I was playing soccer. X-rays were taken that
showed I had some degeneration of the disks in my lower back
and neck areas - hence the siatica. Nothing too major, but clear signs of wear and
    tear. I began visiting a chiropractor regularly and each visit
definitely helped, but a common problem was that my siatica
quickly came back. Sometimes just a few days later, or even a
few hours later, my back would go 'out' again and the pain and
discomfort came back. I eventually learnt that the other part of my problem
    was that the muscles supporting my back just were not
    strong enough to support the back in doing what I wanted,
    which was why my sciatica kept coming back. Now, I admit that part of my problem is that I'm not
prepared to give up the things I love doing, but why
should we have to give things up - life is too short right? Who wants to spend their life worrying about their back? Not
me that's for sure and I got fed of wondering "If I do
this, is it going to put my back out and start the pain all
over again?" So after much trial and error I found out what works best in
terms of looking after my back and staying activbe and its all

However, a holistic view of the body can begin to sort out the confusion. By evaluating the relationship between the body's overall structure in gravity and it's function in movement, the causes of lower back pain begin to reveal themselves. Where Does Siatica Come From?
