Other Benefits Of Health Drinks These days, health drinks are reported to react differently to people who are using them. Experts say that the health drinks available in the market today can be categorized depending on the need of the consumers. There are those that are made to just deliver essential mineral and vitamins in the body.

What if the medicine causes unwanted side effects?Â  Those who are allergic to asthma medicines find themselves in a predicament. There are a number of reportedly effective natural asthma remedies. Of course, since the FDA does not endorse these, it may take more time to be accepted by the general public. The point is, that you do have choices if you are willing to try them. As a overall statement, Mother Nature has provided a cure for every disease known to mankind. Sometimes, humans underestimate the force of Mother Nature and proportionately overestimate their capacity to intervene. It is true that modern science has achieved the capacity for miraculous results. However, it is still far behind the breathtaking power of nature. One of the most popular natural remedies is homeopathy. This can be given over many years without any fear of having any harmful reactions. There are also a number of herbs that can be used as an alternative asthma treatment. However, their ability will be proportionate to the capability of the person who specializes in herbal medicines. Hypnosis and acupuncture are also viable natural treatments. Though they cannot be labelled strictly as natural asthma remedies, they can provide natural long-term relief to both children and adults. The only thing that one must consider in this case of trying out a hypnotherapy session is the certification of the hypnotist. You will find hypnosis listed under natural cure for asthmaÂ  and many find it a good alternative. The success of this method of treatment depends upon the therapist and the patientâ€™s state of mind. Some find acupuncture a very effective method to treat asthma. This medical care involves stimulating of internal chemical reaction with the application of needles at particular nerve points. There is acupuncture, which involves needles to stimulate chemical reactions within the body to correct the existing imbalances. Many people reported that acupuncture is extremely helpful. One should be very careful however regarding the sterilization of the needles. A possible option is to to carry your own set with you, which can be thrown away after each session. For those who are squeamish about the use of needles, one can choose the use of acupressure, which acts on the same concept; however, instead of needles (puncturing of the skin) it uses pressure. This form of treatment is considered much safer than acupuncture. Another supposedly effective alternative remedy for asthma is yoga.Â  Yoga is an ancient science originating from India, whereby one does some particular exercises (the positions of which are called asanas) by which the problems inside the body and mind can be cured. Some people find it highly effective, while the strange body positions that the yoga involves horrify some people. It depends upon you if you would like to choose this type of any other natural cure for asthma. How do you choose the right alternative asthma treatment for you? Before making up your mind, it would be good if you do your own research and judge for yourself. The best method to find out what could be the best choice for you is by asking friends and relatives. Another good manner of gathering accurate information is the utilization of the internet. Do some research and find out the merits and demerits of all the alternative remedies for asthma that you are interested in. One vital thing is to ensure is that none of the methods of treatment have any adverse effects that could act detrimentally against your asthma instead of alleviating symptoms.Â  It would be better if you consult a doctor before you embark on any â€˜unconventional course of actionâ€™ with the proposed natural asthma remedy. Most family doctors have a good and up-to-date knowledge of the best available options. The author, Gregory De Villiers, writes on a variety of health and wellness topics.

I am qualified to share Noni with you, not only because I am a youthful looking, handsome, and sexy guy, but also because I have a Noni plant growing in my back yard. Yes, right here behind my house in the Philippines, and many of my neighborâ€™s yards have noni plants also. The black volcanic soil here is excellent for growing the noni plants. My wife went outside this afternoon and picked a small basket of fresh Noni fruit for me for later today. Lucky me!!! When I drink the noni fruit juice, I like to mix it with a little pineapple juice and 7-Up to make the taste easier to swallow. The seeds are very spicy – like hot peppers — and burn my tongue when I suck on them to get loose the flesh of the fruit. Was I surprised â€¦ The very first time I ate some of the fresh Noni fruit and drank the juice it had an immediate effect on my health. The very next day, I noticed that my back pains had vanished – gone away – and stayed away, as long as I consumed Noni fruit and juice every day. I have had lower back pains for over 40 years. Chiropractors helped, but the pain still did not go away. Guess what – the cravings I had always had for snacks, junk foods, and sweets disappeared the very next day after taking Noni. I was definitely eating too much and gaining weight. After using Noni, my weight loss problems are gone. I know – this is all only anecdotal evidence, and not based on any scientific study involving my use of Noni – but I am convinced of the benefits of using Noni. For me – it helps tremendously in making me feel better. It has cleared up a lot of medical and health problems that previously were dogging me. This all started about 20 years ago. The noni fruit that I have eaten for many years has helped me feel healthier, look younger, lose weight, given me youthful skin, with fewer aches and pains of old age. You might call me a â€œhealth nutâ€ because of all the health information I am constantly digesting about alternative medicine, vitamins, supplements, minerals, antioxidants, folk medicine, herbals, and so forth. My body is over 60 years old, but most folks think I am in my late 40â€™s. My youthful looks are likely due to the various herbs, vitamins, and supplements, including noni, that I take every day. I have been a serious â€œhealth nutâ€ for about 20+ years now. My studies, research, and use of herbal products have convinced me of the tremendous health value and benefits of herbs in my diet. I have seen my own health and well being improved, sometimes slowly, but always surely. Try Noni yourself – you will see positive changes in your body. A physician trained at Johns Hopkins studied the affects of Noni on 25,000 Noni juice drinkers and found very positive effects for 29 health conditions in their lives. What can Noni do for you? Try it for yourself, and see the changes in your body. Imagine feeling good again, looking younger, smoother and softer skin, improved digestion, fewer aches and pains, feeling healthier, lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar levels, strengthen your bodyâ€™s natural ability to fight tumors, viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, having more energy, feeling more alert, more energetic, and more balanced. What more could you ask for! Research studies suggest that the compounds found in Noni may work at the cellular level in the human body to help abnormally functioning cells resume normal function and help normal cells maintain regular function. There are several theories that may explain why Noni works so very beneficially in the body. Some believe it is a selection of polysaccharides, giving Noni fruit its beneficial effects. Other theories, based on research study findings, suggest that Noni promotes the production of nitric oxide in the body, which has been shown to strengthen the bodyâ€™s natural ability to fight tumors, viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. A more popular explanation is called the â€œxeronine systemâ€ developed by the forerunner in Noni research, Dr. Ralph Heinicke Ph.D. who teamed up with Dr. Neil Solomon, a medical doctor. The Heinicke-Solomon Theory explains Noniâ€™s wide range of effectiveness in the human body. The ancient Aryan physicians of India especially valued Noni fruit because it protected the skin from becoming dry and cracked from the sun. My investigation of the published scientific literature on Morinda citrifolia yielded more than 100 articles pertaining to this medicinal Noni plant. After I started taking Noni, I found that I was more alert, more energetic, more balanced, my skin was glowing more than I could ever recall, my hunger for junk foods was gone, and my digestion was greatly improved. I attributed the benefits of noni to the interaction of the known components along with the unknown components, which perhaps work synergistically with all the other nutrients to give me optimum health. Researchers have reported that significant reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides were seen in smokers who drank a product containing juice from the fruit of the noni tree every day for a month. Here where I live in the Philippines, and elsewhere, natives use Noni for digestive problems such as diarrhea, intestinal worms, nausea, food poisoning; respiratory problems such as congestive cough, dry cough, tuberculosis, cholera, infant chest colds and sore throat; cardiovascular problems, hypertension; inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, abscesses, mastitis, gout and other inflammatory joint conditions. It is a noted analgesic or pain reliever. One of the most common uses of noni has been in the area of skin conditions, being utilized for wounds, ulcers, abscesses, ring worm, boils, cellulitis, swellings, scalp conditions, including lice, and sores. It has been used in the treatment of tumors and broken bones, jaundice and other forms of liver disease, as well as treating asthma and dysentery, hypercholesterolemia, menstrual cramps, gastric ulcers and diabetes.

Dementia is a disorder of the nervous system that affects the ability to reason, speak, remember, and move. In some cases, this condition grows worse over time and cannot be cured. Other types can be treated and reversed. What are the causes of dementia? The most common causes of dementia are diseases such as the following: (1) Alzheimer disease – A loss of nerve cells in the brain affects memory and other mental functions. This disease is progressive, and the exact cause is unknown. Ten percent of Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer, and the percentage increases to nearly half for those 85 and older. (2) Parkinson disease – This disorder affects physical movement, and symptoms include tremors, speech impairment, and a shuffling gait. In later stages, some people develop dementia. (3) Lewy body dementia – This form of dementia occurs when abnormal round structures, called Lewy bodies, develop in the cells of the midbrain. This condition shares characteristics of both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson disease. (4) Vascular dementia – This form of dementia occurs when arteries to the brain become narrow or blocked. This type often occurs after a stroke. The symptoms may appear abruptly or progress slowly over time. Vascular dementia may be prevented by treating the underlying diseases, such as high blood pressure. (5) Huntington disease – This hereditary disorder begins with mild personality changes, but in later stages it can develop into dementia. Other conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including severe nutritional deficiencies, emotional problems, infections of the brain such as meningitis, reactions to some medications, and metabolic abnormalities such as decreased thyroid function or hypoglycemia, a lack of sufficient sugar in the bloodstream. Some are reversible with treatment. Can you prevent dementia? You can prevent some forms of dementia, such as dementia due to a vitamin B-1 deficiency, by ensuring that you eat a nutritious, balanced diet. You may also be able to prevent vascular dementia by taking good care of your heart with the help of your physician. And if you are diabetic, controlling your diabetes is critical. In many cases, though, there is no sure-fire way to prevent dementia. A recent study at the Mayo clinic indicates that people who do not have psychiatric problems but who score very high on a personality test’s pessimism scale have a 30 percent increased risk of developing dementia several decades later. The same holds true for those people who score very high on the depression scale of personality test. For people who score high in both anxiety and pessimism, the risk of developing dementia later in life rises to 40 percent or more. So developing a positive attitude and getting help if you suffer from depression may be helpful. Doctors also recommend keeping your mind sharp by reading, writing stories, playing games, or starting a new hobby. Staying connected with friends and family also helps stimulate your memory and mental processes. How to cope with dementia? If you are providing care for someone with dementia, it is important to honor and recognize your own feelings of frustration and helplessness. However, when you feel frustrated, it is also important that you learn to express that feeling appropriately and ask for help when you need it. You must also take care of yourself and make time for yourself. Seek outside support to help you through the process. Even if you are not the primary caregiver for someone with dementia, trying to communicate with them can still be a frustrating experience. Patients with dementia understand what you say in the context of their own world. Trying to convince them that their world is incorrect or “not real” can make matters worse. Instead, it helps to remain calm and be sensitive to what they perceive to be reality.

Natural Remedies to Boost Memory, Improve Mental Clarity and Concentration Â Filed under: Aging , Dementia , Health Information , Health News , Holistic Health , Natural Health Remedies , Stress Relief Counteract Anxiety Attacks August 25, 2006  | By priyashah In Health Information , Holistic Health , Natural Health Remedies , Stress Relief | Comments(0) Sometimes life is hard and can cause you to feel out of control. Does anyone know what I’m talking about? Things are going well for a while and then it seems like out of no where comes something hard and unexpected that throws you into an anxiety attack? I have had this experience all too many times in my adult life, but it wasn’t until recently that I began to be aware of the symptoms before they hit so that I could counteract the anxiety attacks. Anxiety attacks are brought on by many different things and can affect people in vastly different ways. An event that may send someone into an anxiety attack may be handled with ease by another person. There is no telling what will or will not cause an anxiety attack to occur. We can, however, learn our own bodies and responses so that we can be better prepared when anxiety attacks occur. For me, anxiety attacks seem the most likely when I am dealing with health issues with myself or my family. For some reason, I have always felt anxious about health related issues and potential health problems in the people I care about most. My husband, on the other hand, takes health related issues in stride yet finds himself dealing with anxiety attacks over financial issues that threaten our family. I am so thankful that while anxiety attacks are a normal part of life, that not everyone deals with them the same or gets them at the same time. Can you even imagine a world like that? I have learned myself pretty well over the years, so that now I know how to counteract anxiety attacks. The biggest thing that I need to do is to get away and get alone. This could mean walking into another room or getting outside for a walk or run. I know thatÂ my anxiety attacks are made worse when I am forced to deal with them in front of people. Another key for me in counteracting anxiety attacks is to get active. Taking time regularly to exercise is one of the best methods of stress control and hence anxiety attack prevention for me. The more active I am, the less the little things seem to stress me out. Figure out the things that cause anxiety attacks in you and look for good ways to counteract them. Your life will be a lot more manageable if you can learn to take things in stride and to not let small things lead to big anxiety attacks. Talk with a doctor or a counselor for more advice.
