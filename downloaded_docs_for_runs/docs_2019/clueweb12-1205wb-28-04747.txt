Hypnotherapy for change Dundee...alleviate stress and anxiety...promote weight loss...quit smoking... Hello my name is Veronica Penman and welcome to my website. Hypnotherapy can help you relax, alleviate stress and have a positive effect on your physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing. It can help you achieve your goals and make the changes you want to make in your life. If you want to quit smoking, lose weight, alleviate stress and anxiety then hypnotherapy can help you achieve this. Hypnotherapy is a recognised complementary therapy which can assist you to gain relief from pain, help with the healing process and manage other conditions. When you are hypnotised it feels like being in a very deeply relaxed state. Using hypnotherapy, I will assist you to become deeply relaxed and using suggestion I will guide you to make the changes you want to make to achieve your goal. Just remember that you are in control at all times and that you cannot be hypnotised to do anything against your will. Sessions are person centred and everyone is treated as an individual, you may only require one session or several depending on your circumstances and needs.
