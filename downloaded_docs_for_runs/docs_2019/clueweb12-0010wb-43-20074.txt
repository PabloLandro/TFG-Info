Hypnosis for Smoking Cessation Take Back Your Health Smoking Cessation Program is how you can stop smoking. Our carefully planned hypnotherapy smoking cessation program course is provided over a 4 week period, with a one hour session each week. Sessions are at our convenient New Haven, CT location. Each session includes: A hypnotherapy session specifically designed to help you stop smoking A short counseling session Questions answered Friendly and helpful support Complete confidentiality You will also be given a personalized Stop Smoking CD for private daily reinforcement of your smoking cessation goal. Each CD is custom made to address your specific needs. The Simple Way It Will Work For You In the first session, a quit date is chosen. After each hypnotherapy session you are given simple, easy homework - things to do to begin changing smoking behavior, such as for one week  not smoking while driving, another week to get rid of all lighters and use matches only. By the quit date, you are ready, willing, and able to quit. You will use the reinforcement of the CD to remain a non-smoker for life. The sessions are provided by Judith OConnor, a trained hypnotist who has many years of experience with smoking cessation programs. All sessions are at our convenient New Haven location. You will realize that to quit smoking you are not giving up tobacco, you are taking back your life! Your Success in Stopping Smoking Former smokers say that a support network of family and friends is very important in learning how to stop smoking. Co-workers and your family doctor may offer support and encouragement. Tell your friends about your plans to quit, and then your success in stopping smoking. Try to spend time with non-smokers and ex-smokers who will support your efforts to quit. Talk with them about what you need -- for instance, patience as you go through cravings, taking your late-night or early-morning phone calls, and plans for doing things in smoke-free settings. Find out what you can count on each friend or family member to do. 4 Comfortable and Safe Sessions at our New Haven Clinic Only $500 The Center Phone: 203-787-0869 20 Audubon Court New Haven, CT info@amadeuscenter.com Standard Hours 10 - 6 / M T W F 10 - 8 / Th 10 - 4  / Sat Sun by appointment Special appointment time?
