Search This Website Login Login Valerian Root Capsules 1500 mg The modern day therapeutic use for valerian stems from  traditional Greek medicine which was originally documented by  Hippocrates (ca. 460-377 B.C.E.) and later by Dioscorides (first  century), author of the De Materia Medica. During World War I, Europeans afflicted with "overwrought nerves" from artillery, frequently took valerian. It is considered nature's most powerful sedative and is included in  many over-the-counter sleeping drugs. Unlike some of its chemical  counterparts, valerian is non-habit-forming and enables a person to wake  up feeling refreshed. Medicinal Use Valerian, a clinically-proven sleeping aid, has been traditionally  used in western herbal medicine as a reliable sedative for centuries to  relieve nervous unrest, excitement, tenseness, restlessness  and anxiety-induced sleep disorders. Studies have shown that valerian not only shortens the time taken to  get to sleep and improves sleep quality. It is non-habit-forming without  strong sedative or hypnotic effects.
