Migraines | Chelsea Gimby, Fusion Bodyworks, Victoria BC home articles contact Phone or email for an appointment with Chelsea Gimby, R. Ac. Migraines Migraines are characterized by an intense throbbing pain that affects either or both sides of the head. Frequently it is felt behind the eyes. There may be nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea. Sufferers often experience visual disturbances such as flashing lights, auras or blurred vision. It is not uncommon to see this type of headache on the weekend after working excessively long hours during the week under pressure. In Chinese medicine this type of headache is referred to as ‘Liver Yang Rising’. Basically, excess energy rises to the head along the gall bladder meridian and this causes pain. ‘Liver Yang Rising’ is usually due to chronic stress. Acupuncture treatment regulates the energy of the liver and balances the Yin and Yang energies. Often great results are achieved. Normally I would treat this condition once a week unless the migraines are particularly debilitating, in which case more frequent treatment may be necessary until the severity and frequency of the migraines decrease.
