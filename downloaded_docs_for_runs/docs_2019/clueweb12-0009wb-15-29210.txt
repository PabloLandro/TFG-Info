Pain «  Transparent Eye Transparent Eye February 4, 2008 Antidepressants and Back Pain Filed under: Pain , Uncategorized —  Rick Heller @ 11:47 am Antidepressants for non-specific low back pain There is no clear evidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the management of patients with chronic low-back pain. These findings do not imply that severely depressed patients with back pain should not be treated with antidepressants; furthermore, there is evidence for their use in other forms of chronic pain. Comments Off January 23, 2008 The Placebo Effect Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 10:21 pm A new Science Based Medicine blog has a discussion of the placebo effect. The author thinks its mostly reporting bias, but concedes that there is physiological evidence for it with regard to pain. Comments Off January 2, 2008 Minorities less likely to get pain relief Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 12:44 pm A major study finds that minorities are underprescribed opiod pain medication. In a look at 375,000 emergency room visits over 13 years, a study found 31 percent of whites in pain received opioid drugs — a broad class of narcotic painkillers dispensed only by — a broad class of narcotic painkillers dispensed only by prescription — compared to 23 percent of blacks and 24 percent of Hispanics. Comments Off December 23, 2007 Misuse of pain patch Filed under: Neuroscience , Pain , Uncategorized —  Rick Heller @ 1:41 pm US issues new warning on misuse of J&J pain patch | Reuters Despite a July 2005 warning, the Food and Drug Administration “has continued to receive reports of deaths and life-threatening side effects after doctors have inappropriately prescribed the patch or patients have incorrectly used it,” the agency said. The patch delivers a potent narcotic called fentanyl through the skin. The product was approved in 1990 for patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe pain and whose bodies are used to opioids. That means they have used another strong opioid pain medicine around the clock for a week or longer.

His last name is pronounced with a hard G, not like the synonym for betting. Comments Off October 5, 2007 Chili peppers shows promise in local anesthesia Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 10:23 am Pain gate guru Clifford Woolf et al have come up with a method of selective local anesthesia working back from theoretical knowledge of the pain system. The work on lab rats, described in the scientific journal Nature, breaks from the standard approach to local anesthesia, which usually involves anesthetics delivered by IV tubes or injections that silence all neurons in a given region of the body, not just those that sense pain. Shutting down just the pain neurons means that patients could still feel a light touch and other nonhurtful sensations. “This could really change the experience of, for example, knee surgery, tooth extractions, or childbirth,” said Dr. Clifford Woolf, senior author of the study and a researcher in anesthesia and pain management at Mass. General. “The possibilities are almost endless.” Comments (2) October 1, 2007 DEA After Pain Docs Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 2:51 pm The Phoenix has a piece by Harvery Silvergate on the DEA’s prosecution of pain doctors . I do think that some doctors mistakenly favor a pharamcological approach over one that includes talk therapy, but I don’t think they should be prosecuted for that. Comments Off September 28, 2007 Doctors suppress response to patients' pain Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 10:53 am Doctors learn to distance themselves from their patient’s pain. Doctors learn to shut down the part of the brain that empathises with the pain their patients suffer during treatment, so they can avoid becoming distressed by conducting unpleasant medical procedures. Brain scans have revealed that doctors show a different pattern of neural activity to other people when watching videos of painful therapies. Comments (3) September 26, 2007 Hypnosis + pain research Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 11:06 pm Excellent resource on Hypnosis + pain research , including references to studies of hypnotically-induced pain, which in an fMRI activates similar regions to pain induced physically. However, when subjects who have not been hypnotized are asked to imagine feeling pain, it’s much less intense than what is experienced under hypnotic suggestion. Comments Off September 25, 2007 Acupuncture, real or sham, reduces back pain Filed under: Pain —  Rick Heller @ 1:13 pm Report on a study of treating back pain with acupuncture In trials among 1,100 patients with chronic lower back pain which had lasted for an average of eight years, almost half (47 per cent) of those who received acupuncture showed significant improvement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ compared with barely a quarter (27 per cent) of those given conventional treatment. The effects lasted for at least six months, long after the treatment was completed. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Regensberg, in the spa town of Bad Abbach in Germany, who randomly allocated patients to receive ten 30-minute sessions of sham acupuncture, real acupuncture or conventional treatment. Sham acupuncture involved sticking needles in randomly over the lower back, avoiding the meridians and points that dictate where the needles are placed in traditional acupuncture. The results showed that 44 per cent of volunteers suffering from back pain showed a significant improvement with sham acupuncture. 1. The study suggests that the philosophy of acupuncture, the meridians, etc, is bogus. It’s about sticking needles into the skin. 2. The gate control theory of pain sensations shows that counter-stimulation can reduce pain by tricking the pain gates in the spine. This is the principal used in transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Tens). In addition, there is probably a psychological component. Acupuncture, because of its bizarre appearance, may well have an impressive placebo effect. Placebo pain relief is real, and releases opioids in the brain.
