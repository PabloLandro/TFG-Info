The UK                               has socialized medicine. This is important because                               if the government can save money they will be willing                               to do research on techniques that may be able to                               avoid expensive procedures. In the U.S. medicine                               is a profit oriented industry that may not always                               look for solutions to problems if those solutions                               reduce the need for expensive and maybe even dangerous                               procedures. If you look into who funds much of the                               medical research in the U.S. you will find it is                               drug companies and other industries associated with                               the medical establishment. Even government research                               is tied in with the Medical Industrial Complex which                               is similar in many ways to the Military Industrial                               Complex - which President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned                               us about. Western medicine has developed countless                               miracle drugs and procedures. However, in many areas                               of health and medicine simple non-invasive, inexpensive                               techniques are not only overlooked and not researched                               but may even be illegal. Medical doctors who look                               into some of these techniques and promote them may                               have their licenses revoked and may even be imprisoned.                               One only has to read a few books on cancer cures                               the medical profession does not want you to know                               about to become quite angry at what seems to be                               going on. If this sounds like paranoia please see                               the film 'Hoxey,                               Quacks Who Cure Cancer' . Or learn a little about                               the incredible suppression of the research into                               alternative cancer cures suffered by Stanislaw                               R. Burzynski, MD, PhD . These alternative therapies                               may or may not be effective but when you read about                               how vicious and aggressive the FDA, the AMA and                               other agencies has been about suppressing even harmless                               research into these alternatives you will see that                               one Bill Of Rights our Founding Fathers should have                               added was Medical Choice. The chiropractic profession                               is often associated with medical alternatives. However,                               it has been our experience that although there are                               a small percentage of chiropractors that have been                               using inversion therapy for decades to help their                               patients, the chiropractic industry and chiropractic                               colleges have willfully and intentionally ignored                               this extraordinary therapy for more than 40 years                               because it was perceived as a threat to their practices. Dr. Robert Martin a chiropractor himself as well as a doctor of osteopathic                               medicine was heavily promoting inversion therapy                               in the 1970's. Instead of viewing it as a benefit                               to their patients the chiropractic industry viewed                               it as a threat to their incomes. It would not have                               been seen as a threat if it did not work. Now that                               they have the DRX 9000, the Spine Med Decompression                               system and other decompression machines where they                               can charge a lot for the therapy they are promoting                               Decompression Therapy as one of the greatest therapies                               ever developed. Well, what do they think inversion                               therapy does? And we know the chiropractic colleges                               knew about inversion therapy going back at least                               to 1980 when our company demonstrated it to some                               of the major colleges. Yet we know that even to                               this day most chiropractic colleges will not even                               mention it to their students. Up until the late                               1970's or so traction was still very common in medical                               hospitals. Then everything changed when drugs and                               surgery became the rage and the medical profession                               who had been using weighted decompressions                               therapy commonly for hundreds or even thousands                               of years all but forgot that simple traction                               is often the best therapy for compressed disc problems.                               Disc compression is a mechanical problem and simple                               gravity inversion therapy is a mechanical solution.                               Our company has heard from many people who had been                               taking analgesics such as oxycontin, oxycodone,                               percocet, percodan, dilaudid and other narcotics                               and have been able to reduce their pain enough using                               inversion therapy to wean themselves from these                               drugs. One person we spoke with got such rapid pain                               relieving results from her inversion table that                               she had to be hospitalized to get off the narcotic                               drugs she was addicted to for her pain. Even Dr.                               Dean Edel who has a national radio program and says                               he follows the evidence and research is amazingly                               naive about the benefits of traction and inversion                               therapy. It is stunning to those in the field of                               inversion therapy who have been seeing the benefits                               to those suffering with compressed discs, degenerative                               discs, ruptured discs and other issues being helped                               by inversion therapy and then to hear Dr. Dean Edel                               on the radio say the research shows the decompression                               therapy, traction therapy and inversion therapy                               are no better that just letting time pass and the                               problem will just go away. The amazing ignorance                               of this attitude makes us question the veracity                               of Dr. Dean Edel's other positions on serious health                               issues. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people                               have avoided surgery (or avoided their next surgery),                               been able to get off narcotics and in other ways                               improved the quality of their lives using inversion                               therapy and someone as well read as Dr. Dean Edel                               is telling millions of people that it does not work.                               We at energycenter.com have worked with orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists,                               chiropractors, sports medicine doctors and other                               health professionals since 1980. And talk with speak                               with people who have received magnificent results using inversion tables as well as those recommended                               to our company by people who swear by inversion                               therapy. For about 30 years we have witnessed in                               our showrooms and in doctors offices and well as                               results on x-rays and MRI's that when Dr. Dean Edel                               and others question the effectiveness of this simple,                               logical, inexpensive, safe and effective therapy                               we feel they are doing a grave disservice to those                               suffering with this problem. Disc herniations, sciatica                               etc. are largely a mechanical problem - COMPRESSION                               and inversion therapy is a mechanical solution -                               DECOMPRESSION that if done                               properly and safely can have amazing results.                               If used in conjunction with proper                               exercises to balance and stabilize the pelvic region the results can be effective and long lasting. We                               have been hearing about the fantastic results people                               are having with inversion therapy nearly every single                               day since 1980. Now that the military                               is actively using inversion therapy we have                               had reports from soldiers being able to get back                               on their feet after a back or neck injury that otherwise                               would have ended their careers. We at energycenter.com have seen inversion therapy help MMA fighters with                               back and neck injuries as well. So those who state                               categorically that it does not help are either intentionally                               deceiving people or have not done proper research. In 30 years we have not heard                               of or read one single inversion therapy study that                               did not show positive results . • Sheffield,                               F.: Adaptation of Tilt Table for Lumbar Traction.                               Arch Phys Med Rehabil 45: 469-472, 1964. 175 patients who were unable to work due to back                               pain were treated. After eight inversion treatments,                               155 patients were able to return to their jobs full                               time. Study concluded that the main basis for improvement                               was the stretching of paraspinal vertebral muscles                               and ligaments and possibly the widening of intravertebral                               discs. Study found significant improvements in a variety                               of diagnosis including spondylolisthesis, herniated                               discs, lumbar osteoarthritis with sciatica, and                               coccygodynia. Patient experienced traction in a                               modified hip flexed position. It is worth noting that previous to his use of inversion                               therapy, Dr. Sheffield regularly used mechanical                               traction with weights and pulleys. He considered                               inverted traction much more effective than mechanical                               traction. • Nosse,                               L.: Inverted Spinal Traction. Arch Phys Med Rehabil                               59: 367-370, Aug 78. Study found emg activity (an indicator of muscle                               pain) declined 35% within the first 10 seconds of                               inversion. Study found that inversion increases                               the spinal length. Study concluded there is a correlation                               between a reduction in emg activity and an increase                               in spinal length. • Gianakopoulos,                               G, et al: Inversion Devices: Their Role in Producing                               Lumbar Distraction. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 66: 100-102,                               Feb 85. Study found all subjects experienced intravertebral                               separation in the lower lumbar vertebrae. Study                               concluded that although mechanical traction has                               been used for centuries, only gravity assisted traction                               (inversion) offers an effective means of achieving                               pelvic traction at home. • Ballantyne,                               Byron, et al: The Effects of Inversion Traction                               on Spinal Column Configuration, Heart Rate, Blood                               Pressure, and Perceived Discomfort. Jour of Orthopedic                               Sports Phys Ther. 254-260, Mar 86. Study concluded that inversion can be an effective                               means of spinal traction. Subjects inverting in                               the hip flexed position experienced greater separation                               between the lumbar vertebrae. • Kane,                               M, et al: Effects of Gravity-facilitated Traction                               on Intravertebral Dimensions of the Lumbar Spine.                               Jour of Orthopedic and Sports Phys Ther. 281-288,                               Mar 85. Study found gravity-facilitated traction (inversion),                               produces significant intravertebral separation in                               lumbar spine. Study concluded gravity facilitated                               traction may be an effective modality in the relief                               of low back pain. • Goldman,                               R, et al: The Effects of Oscillating Inversion on                               Systemic Blood Pressure, Pulse, Intraocular Pressure,                               and Central Retinal Arterial Pressure. The Physician                               and Sports Medicine. 13: 93-96, Mar 85. Study concluded that full inversion using oscillation                               procedure presents no risk to normotensive healthy                               subjects. • Dimberg,                               L, et al: Effects of gravity-facitliated traction                               of the lumbar spine in persons with chronic low                               back pain at the workplace. 116 people were enrolled in the randomized controlled                               trial which lasted for 12 months. A randomized controlled                               trial with two training groups and one control group                               was conducted to asses the effect of gravity inversion                               on pain level and absenteeism due to LBP. Average                               age = 44 years. 77% men Group 1: used inversion for 10 minutes 1/day Group 2: used inversion for 10 minutes 2/day Group 3: control group Results after 12 months of training program: 1.                               The employees in Group 1 and 2 decreased sick days                               due to back pain by 33%. 2. Average sick days to                               due back pain fell by 8 days per individual in the                               treated group. 3. "Inversion is an efficient                               and cheap way to improve employee health and possibly                               reduce sick day costs to the employer." • Nachemson,                               Alf, et al: Intravital Dynamic Pressure Measurements                               in Lumbar Discs. 1970. Study measured internal disc pressure (in the 3rd                               lumbar disc) through a range of activities, including                               standing, sitting, bending and vertical and supine                               traction. The study suggests that a traction load                               of 60% body weight is sufficient to reduce the residual                               pressure of 25% standing body weight to zero. • After                               several years of evaluation, the US Army Physical                               Fitness School has decided to incorporate Inversion                               into its world-wide physical training doctrine.                               The Army Rangers at Fort Benning, GA use gravity                               boots to invert, "reversing" the damage                               done to their bodies during their demanding training.                               To them, Inversion represents the "Quiet Side                               of Fitness"-a restorative fitness tool to help                               decompress and mobilize joints to prevent injuries.                               Soldiers use gravity boots to stretch while inverted,                               moving joints through their full range of motion.

The Journal of CCA 29: 138-140. Sep 85. Study found a general reduction of emg (an indicator                               of muscle pain) after three minutes of inversion.                               Study found the flattening of the lumbar spine involved                               a stretching of spinal muscles and ligaments which                               lead to a 25% increase in forward spinal flexion. Study found significant intravertebral separation                               (posterior and anterior). Study concluded that an                               inversion chair may be sufficient to reduce the                               majority of intravertebral disc protrusions. Study concluded that the cardiovascular system (heart                               rate and blood pressure) remained stable through                               three minutes of seated partial inversion. Authors                               conclude this stability is due to the full comfort                               and support of the chair during partial inversion. • Meshino,                               J.: The Role of Spinal Inverted Traction in Chiropractic                               Practice. ACA Journal of Chiropractic 18:63-68,                               Feb 84. Study stated the hip flexed position facilitates                               lumbar traction by flattening the lumbar spine and                               decreasing the loading effect of the psoas muscle                               on the lumbar spine during traction. Study stated inversion therapy is preferred over                               mechanical traction because there is no need for                               a constricting harness and the safe and simple operation                               of an inversion chair allows the patient to administer                               traction. Study stated inversion helps to negate the effect                               of gravity on the spinal column. Study stated inversion                               offers promise as a form of prevention, maintenance,                               and therapy.
