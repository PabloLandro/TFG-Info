What Natural Remedies Can You Take for Migraine? by Anna Hart Filed under Treatment of Migraines Leave a Comment A natural remedy for migraine headaches is often preferable to over-the-counter medications or prescription treatments. Some people try them first, while others try them as a last resort after over-the-counter and prescription drugs fail. Choosing a Natural Remedy for Migraine If you want to try a natural remedy for migraine treatment, you have a number of options. For best results, try these when you first feel a migraine beginning. 1. Shiatsu Shiatsu may be described as acupuncture without needles. Shiatsu, an ancient Japanese technique, is applied by using thumbs and fingers on migraine pressure points as explained elsewhere on this blog. It relieves migraines in many cases. 2. Acupuncture The Chinese used acupuncture with needles to trigger relief through migraine pressure points. Delicate needles are inserted just beneath the skin, and gently manipulated. At least two studies indicate that acupuncture relieved migraine symptoms in many patients. 3. Herbal Remedy Gentle herbal remedies can be very effective. “MiGone Plus” is an example of a natural remedy for migraine that is based solely on herbs. Restoring proper functioning to your organs, it follows the naturopathic line of reasoning that says migraine headaches are a toxic condition. Your body is shouting that there is an imbalance in organ function. Herbal preparations such as this may set things straight. 4. Mineral Remedy Magnesium is another natural remedy for migraine. Magnesium is already found in your diet, but you may not be getting enough of this mineral. Magnesium maintains blood vessels tone which is very important in the treatment of migraines. Magnesium is available in tablet or powder form. Ask your doctor how much magnesium you should take. 5. Riboflavin Remedy Vitamin B2, called Riboflavin, can also be used as a natural remedy for migraines. Studies show that migraine sufferers who took Vitamin B2 got ongoing migraine relief: headache intensity lessened considerably; and they experienced less nausea as well as vomiting. An inexpensive Riboflavin supplement will supply, within a month of use, what you need for migraine relief. If you are pregnant, be sure you ask your health care professional before using any natural remedy. All migraine sufferers should seek professional care if headaches are intense or frequent.
