		nerves in the lining of the respiratory passages - the tubes we use to breathe. When a person coughs, there is a short intake of breath and the
		larynx (the voice box) closes momentarily. The abdominal and chest muscles used
		for breathing contract, which in turn increases the pressure needed to drive
		air out the lungs when the larynx re-opens. The resulting blast of air comes out at high speed, scrubbing
		and clearing the airway of dust, dirt or excessive secretions. Coughing is a
		common symptom when the airways are 'tight', as in asthma . The cough reflex is a vital part of the body's defence
		mechanisms. Normally, the lungs and the lower respiratory passages are sterile.
		If dust or dirt get into the lungs, they could become a breeding ground for
		bacteria and cause
		pneumonia or
		infection in the breathing tubes. What causes coughing? Coughing usually means there is something in the respiratory
		passages that should not be there. This can be caused by breathing in dust
		particles in the air or when a piece of food goes down the wrong way. It could also be a sign that an infection in the lungs is making
		the respiratory passages produce phlegm. Coughing can be provoked by: the common cold , which is
		  a frequent cause of acute cough that usually settles in less than three weeks. sucking material into the breathing tubes from your
		  mouth. more severe illnesses, such as
		  pneumonia, acute
		  heart failure or
		  pulmonary embolism (a
		  clot in the blood vessels of the lung). smoking, which often causes chronic cough (smoker's
		  lung). asthma - particularly
		  in children who may only cough and show no wheezing. stomach acid coming back up the gullet and spilling over into
		  the windpipe ( gastro-oesophageal
		  reflux ). medicines used in heart disease called
		  ACE inhibitors. bacterial or viral infections in the lungs, eg
		  acute bronchitis,
		  pneumonia,
		  whooping cough,
		  croup in
		  children rarely coughing can be provoked by psychological
		  illness damage to the nerves that supply the vocal chords (known as
		  vocal chordpalsy) and chronic cough can occur. Coughing is more efficient when preceded by a full intake of
		air. For this reason, patients with weak muscles, poor coordination
		of airway closure and re-opening, or who have airflow obstruction (as in COPD) will have a
		poor cough and be susceptible to complications including infection in the lower
		respiratory tract and pneumonia. How can coughing be treated? Coughing is a symptom, not a disease. It is the underlying cause
		of the cough that needs to be treated. You should consult your doctor if any of the following symptoms
		accompany a cough, so that possible underlying causes can be investigated and
		treated where necessary: coughing up phlegm that is green, rusty brown, yellow,
		  blood-stained or foul smelling chest pain shortness of breath or wheezing pain and swelling in the calf recurrent night-time cough whooping cough or croup worsening smoker’s cough sudden weight loss fever and sweating hoarseness of the voice with a chronic cough that doesn’t clear
		  up spontaneously. If you can't cough but need to, problems soon arise. Equally,
		when coughing is painful (for example, because of a broken rib), patients try
		not to cough and this can be dangerous. Ineffective clearance of the airway can lead to a chest
		infection and possible pneumonia. In these circumstances, pain-relieving
		medicine can be useful to permit an efficient cough. Airways infection Infections in the breathing tubes can be caused by both
		  bacteria and viruses,
		  although the most common cause in children is a virus. Bacterial infections can
		  be treated with
		  antibiotics, but viral infections cannot. Vaccination has greatly diminished the incidence of whooping
		  cough (pertussis), but if this is the diagnosis, antibiotic treatment with a
		  macrolide antibiotic such as erythromycin decreases the severity of this
		  illness within the first week of treatment. Asthma Asthma may cause coughing without wheeziness. This tends to be
		  worst through the night, disturbing sleep. It may be the first sign of asthma
		  in children, or a warning sign that asthma is worsening or not controlled
		  properly. Conventional
		  asthma treatment with
		  inhaled anti-inflammatory preventative medicines and relievers will usually
		  relieve a cough that is due to asthma. However, a metered-dose inhaler may itself induce cough, and
		  you may need to use a large volume spacer device or a dry powder inhaler
		  instead. Gastro-oesophageal reflux Gastro-oesophageal
		  reflux requires treatment with antacids to neutralise the stomach acid,
		  or H 2 antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors to reduce
		  the production of stomach acid. Smoking Giving up cigarettes
		  will lessen or abolish smokers' cough in 94 per cent of people within four
		  weeks. ACE inhibitors If an ACE inhibitor is the cause of coughing, switching to
		  alternate treatment such as an
		  angiotensin II receptor
		  antagonist will help. How effective are cough medicines? In cases where a cough is particularly annoying, but not
		life-threatening, a simple
		cough mixture may be useful. There are a range of
		over-the-counter medicines that can be helpful in such circumstances. Taking these can be justified when there is no special reason to
		suspect any serious underlying disease, such as the symptoms listed above. You
		should ask your pharmacist for advice on which of the many available
		over-the-counter cough remedies are suitable for you. A productive, chesty cough, in which phlegm is coughed up,
		should be treated with an expectorant cough mixture to help loosen the phlegm
		and make it easier to cough up from the airways. Expectorants contain
		ingredients such as guaifenesin, ipecachuana or ammonium citrate. A non-productive, dry, tickly or irritating cough, in which no
		phlegm is coughed up can, be treated with a cough suppressant to reduce the
		cough reflex. Cough suppressants include pholcodine, dextromethorphan and
		codeine. Other cough suppressants include simple linctus, glycerin and lemon
		and honey, which coat and soothe the back of the throat. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and promethazine reduce
		the cough reflex and also dry up nasal secretions, which can be useful for
		coughs that are caused by a postnasal drip (mucus running down the back of the
		throat), or are associated with a cold. Ipratropium bromide nasal spray also reduces watery nasal
		secretions that can cause postnasal drip and contribute to a cough. Some cough remedies also contain sympathomimetics such as
		ephedrine, for their airway relaxing and decongestant effects, and can be
		useful if you have a blocked nose as well as a cough. Patients should not treat themselves with cough mixture for any
		longer than two weeks. If the cough persists, a visit to the doctor is
		definitely required - informed medical assessment will help identify the
		underlying cause and allow treatment. What if a young child has a cough? Older children and adults usually have some idea whether their
		cough is caused by a foreign body, dust or smoke particles, or an infection in
		the breathing tubes. Clinical inspection will reveal features that may suggest
		a specific cause. If a young child coughs, parents need to be able to tell whether
		the cough is a sign of disease or whether their child has a foreign body in
		their respiratory passages. If your child also has a
		  fever or a cold , the cough is a
		  sign of an infection. If nothing else seems to be wrong, wait for the cough to
		  go away. If the coughing goes on for more than a couple of days, consult a
		  doctor. In the meantime, if you want to give your child a medicine to
		  help soothe the cough, it is best to use a simple cough syrup containing
		  glycerol, honey or lemon. Other over-the-counter cough and cold remedies are no
		  longer recommended for children under six years of age, because there is no
		  evidence that they work and they can potentially cause side effects, such as
		  allergic reactions, effects on sleep or hallucinations. For children over six
		  years of age other cough and cold medicines are still available from pharmacies
		  - ask your pharmacist for advice. Any medicine you give should be administered
		  carefully using the spoon or measuring device supplied to ensure the maximum
		  dose is not exceeded. You should avoid using more than one cough and cold medicine at
		  the same time when treating your child's symptoms. Different medicines may
		  contain the same active ingredient(s) and using more than one may lead to you
		  exceeding the maximum recommended dose(s). Ask your pharmacist for more advice. If the coughing comes on suddenly, and is very forceful,
		  it's likely your child has swallowed something that's causing the cough.
		  This could be life-threatening for your child, who could choke. Lift your child
		  by the legs so their head points downwards, then slap their back with a cupped
		  hand. If this doesn't help, call an ambulance immediately. If at any point your child seems very ill, you should consult
		  an emergency doctor immediately. Diagnostic testing for chronic cough If you suffer from a chronic cough, tests will need to be
		carried out to determine the cause. After initial assessment, a
		  chest X-ray is taken
		  to ensure that serious diseases such as
		  lung cancer or
		  tuberculosis (TB) are
		  unlikely. Blood and skin tests
		  are of little help, although they may reveal an allergic tendency. Sputum (phlegm) examination for bacteria, TB and cancer cells
		  can be ordered, together with non-invasive heart tests such as an ECG or even
		  echocardiography. In difficult cases, further tests can be considered, including
		  fibre optic bronchoscopy,
		  CT examination of the
		  chest and sinuses and even methacholine inhalation challenge or oesophageal pH
		  monitoring. These are only available in special centres. Whether a particular factor is responsible for chronic coughing
		can be determined when treatment for a specific cause achieves some benefit for
		the patient. But often there is more than one cause for the cough, in which
		case treating only one factor will not succeed in completely relieving the
		symptoms. This is frustrating for both you and your medical
		adviser. In such a case, a progressive and incremental approach is
		appropriate. Treatment directed at a specific cause is started and the result
		assessed. If there is a partial but incomplete response, other treatments
		are then tried in turn. Eventually, the vast majority of coughing can be
		successfully managed in this manner. If treatment is fruitless with no realistic chance of working -
		for example in the case of advanced lung cancer, the use of powerful cough
		suppressants may be justified. Based on a text by Dr Ole Davidsen, specialist Last updated 02.03.2009 The materials in this web site are in no way
