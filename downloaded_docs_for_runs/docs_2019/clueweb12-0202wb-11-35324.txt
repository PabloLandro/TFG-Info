<18 mo vs. <6 mo)." A quantitative analysis of fish consumption and coronary heart disease mortality. (Am J Prev Med. 2005) "Our analysis estimated that consuming small quantities of fish is associated with a 17% reduction in CHD mortality risk, with each additional serving per week associated with a further reduction in this risk of 3.9%. Small quantities of fish consumption were associated with risk reductions in nonfatal MI risk by 27%, but additional fish consumption conferred no incremental benefits." Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma, especially in women. (J Gastroenterol. 2005) "BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest that Helicobacter pylori infection can potentially increase the risk of colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between H. pylori infection and the risk of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma, and to evaluate any differences on the basis of sex.  CONCLUSIONS: The results therefore suggest that, in patients aged 40-80 years, H. pylori infection increased the risk of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma, with significantly higher risks for female patients." Cognitive profile of patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease. (Neurology. 2005) "CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairments are common even in newly diagnosed Parkinson disease patients, with deficits being most prominent in the domains of memory and executive functions. Older age at disease onset is likely to be an important determinant of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson disease." Your Pillows Are Full of Fungus "'You have a small zoo in there  It is thought that human skin scales in bedding are used as a food source for fungi, and the fungi are eaten by mites. And the fungi might sit on the mite feces as well.' " Resistance training improves gait kinematics in persons with multiple sclerosis. (Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training may be an effective intervention strategy for improving walking and functional ability in moderately disabled persons with MS." Using Search Engines to Find Online Medical Information (PloS Medicine 2005) "  as many a doctor will point out, the bigger problem with medical knowledge today is not its paucity, but the difficulty of navigating what there is. Finding the right answer quickly for a patient is difficult, and perhaps nothing will replace a good medical librarian in finding that information.   All of these freely available search engines have their limitations, and they rarely give you the perfect answer to your clinical query. But they do at least help to reduce the obstacles to finding medical information online." Should ß blockers remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension? A meta-analysis (The Lancet 2005) "In comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of ß blockers is less than optimum, with a raised risk of stroke. Hence, we believe that ß blockers should not remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension and should not be used as reference drugs in future randomised controlled trials of hypertension." Twelve-year course and outcome predictors of anorexia nervosa. (Int J Eat Disord. 2005) "RESULTS  Based on a global 12-year outcome score, 27.5% had a good outcome, 25.3% an intermediate outcome, 39.6% had a poor outcome, and 7 (7.7%) were deceased.  CONCLUSION: Mortality was high and symptomatic recovery protracted. Impulsivity, symptom severity, and chronicity were the important factors for predicting the 12-year outcome." C-reactive protein in atherosclerotic lesions: its origin and pathophysiological significance. (Am J Pathol. 2005) "C-reactive protein (CRP) is frequently deposited in the lesions of the arterial intima; however, the origin and pathological significance of CRP in these lesions are not completely understood.  These results suggest that there is a link between plasma CRP and the degree of atherosclerosis and that inhibition of plasma CRP may represent a therapeutic modality for the treatment of cardiovascular disease." Quick, What Do You Do for A Heart Attack? "JUST about everyone in medicine agrees that a patient who shows up in the emergency room with a heart attack should be given aspirin. That simple treatment has been proven to cut death rates by nearly a quarter." Heart Attack, Stroke & Cardiac Arrest Warning Signs Age at Natural Menopause and Cause-specific Mortality. (Am J Epidemiol. 2005) "Several studies have suggested that a young age at menopause may be associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Few studies have examined the influence of age at menopause on specific causes of death other than coronary heart disease.  all-cause mortality rates were higher among women who reported that menopause occurred at age 40-44 years compared with women who reported that menopause occurred at age 50-54 years  This increased risk was largely due to higher mortality rates from coronary heart disease  respiratory disease  genitourinary disease  and external causes." Effect of Fish Oil on Heart Rate in Humans. A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (Circulation 2005) "Background--The effect of fish oil on heart rate (HR), a major risk factor for sudden death, is not well established. Conclusions--In randomized controlled trials in humans, fish oil reduces HR, particularly in those with higher baseline HR or longer treatment duration. These findings provide firm evidence that fish oil consumption directly or indirectly affects cardiac electrophysiology in humans." Brain reserve and dementia: a systematic review. (Psychol Med. 2005) "conclusions. this study demonstrates robust evidence that complex patterns of mental activity in the early, mid- and late-life stages is associated with a significant reduction in dementia incidence." Mediterranean Diet and Survival Among Patients With Coronary Heart Disease in Greece (Arch Intern Med. 2005)       "Conclusion  Greater adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a significant reduction in mortality among individuals diagnosed as having coronary heart disease." The epidemiology of pesticide exposure and cancer: A review. (Rev Environ Health. 2005) "Agricultural and industrial workers are high-risk groups for developing cancer following pesticide exposure. Children of farm workers can be exposed to pesticides through their parents. Maternal exposure to pesticides can pose a health risk to the fetus and the newborn. The organophosphates are most the commonly used compounds, but the organochlorines are still permitted for limited use in developing countries. Pesticide exposure, independently or in synergism with modifiable risk factors, is associated with several types of cancer." Missing the Point!  The mysteries of Autism "One of the common first indicators of autism is the inability of the 18-month-old child to point with their index finger. Autism shapes behaviour and severely limits a person's ability to form relationships and communicate. But the complex causes of this disorder are obscure. We look at some of the research seeking answers, and a mother with a 3-year-old autistic son portrays life with this mystery." Prediction of Longitudinal Brain Atrophy in Multiple Sclerosis by Gray Matter Magnetic Resonance Imaging T2 Hypointensity (Arch Neurol. 2005) "Background  Gray matter magnetic resonance imaging T2 hypointensity, a marker of iron deposition, is associated with clinical impairment and brain atrophy in cross-sectional studies of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with intramuscular interferon beta-1a limits brain atrophy in the second year of treatment.  Conclusions  Gray matter T2 hypointensity predicts the progression of brain atrophy in placebo- but not interferon beta-1atreated patients. This predictive effect is seen as early as the first year. We hypothesize that interferon beta may exert its effect on brain atrophy in part by reducing a cascade of events that involve iron deposition as a mediator of neurotoxicity or as a disease epiphenomenon." Dietary Recommendations for Children and Adolescents (Circulation. 200) "It is estimated that 75% to 90% of the cardiovascular disease epidemic is related to dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and obesity; the principal causes of these risk factors are adverse behaviors, including poor nutrition. The atherosclerotic process begins in youth, culminating in the risk factorrelated development of vascular plaque in the third and fourth decades of life. Good nutrition, a physically active lifestyle, and absence of tobacco use contribute to lower risk prevalence and either delay or prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease. These observations have established the concept of prevention of the development of cardiovascular risk factors in the first place, now called primordial prevention." Coffee a top source of healthy antioxidants "Dates, cranberries and red grapes are among the leading fruit sources of antioxidants  while many people have faith that antioxidants will reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and more, the evidence has not always panned out. Most experts are looking beyond antioxidants to the combination of vitamins, minerals other nutrition in specific foods  " Teaching evidence-based medicine: should we be teaching information management instead? (Acad Med. 2005) "To encourage high-quality patient care guided by the best evidence, many medical schools and residencies are teaching techniques for critically evaluating the medical literature. While a large step forward, these skills of evidence-based medicine are necessary but not sufficient for the practice of contemporary medicine. Incorporating the best evidence into the real world of busy clinical practice requires the applied science of information management.  All students, residents, and practicing physicians need three skills to practice the best medicine: the ability to select foraging--"keeping up"--tools that filter information for relevance and validity, the skill to select and use a hunting--"just in time"--information tool that presents prefiltered information easily and in a quickly accessible form at the point of care, and the ability to make decisions by combining the best patient-oriented evidence with patient-centered care, placing the evidence in perspective with the needs and desires of the patient." The use of evidence-based medicine in the management of acutely ill children. (Pediatr Emerg Care. 2005) "OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which emergency medicine physicians are exposed to and implement evidence-based medicine (EBM).  Ninety-three percent of respondents felt "time constraints in a busy ED" was the most prominent obstacle to the use of EBM. CONCLUSIONS: Although a majority of emergency medicine physicians report having been exposed to EBM, respondents tended not to use EBM in the management of acutely ill children, regardless of years of experience." Stroke prevention. (CMAJ. 2005) "Some risk factors for stroke, such as age, gender, ethnicity and genetic factors, cannot be modified. Others, if moderated, can greatly reduce both the likelihood of stroke and the severity of its outcomes: physical inactivity, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes and heavy use of alcohol." Snoring predicts hyperactivity four years later. (Sleep. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: This 4-year prospective cohort study shows that snoring and other symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are strong risk factors for future emergence or exacerbation of hyperactive behavior. These findings support the hypothesis that untreated childhood sleep-disordered breathing contributes to development of hyperactivity." Urinary melatonin levels and breast cancer risk. (J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005) "Exposure to light at night suppresses melatonin production, and night-shift work (a surrogate for such exposure) has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. However, the association between circulating melatonin levels and breast cancer risk is unclear.  These prospective data support the hypothesis that higher melatonin levels, as measured in first morning urine, are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer." High homocysteine and low B vitamins predict cognitive decline in aging men: the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2005) "Background: Elevated homocysteine concentrations may contribute to cognitive impairment. Most elevations in homocysteine result from inadequate folate, vitamin B-12, or vitamin B-6 intake. It is not clear whether the observed associations between homocysteine and cognitive measures are causal or whether they are due to homocysteine, to independent actions of the B vitamins, or to both.  Conclusions: Low B vitamin and high homocysteine concentrations predict cognitive decline. Spatial copying measures appear to be most sensitive to these effects in a general population of aging men." New Combinations in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: What Are Our Expectations? "Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. [1]. Almost a third of patients already have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and half the patients diagnosed and resected with early-stage disease subsequently develop metastases [2]. Nearly all patients with metastatic cancer die of their disease.  In the last 5 years, we have seen the addition of several new treatments for a disease that was once considered untreatable, and survival has nearly doubled in that time; there are now five additional agents approved for use in metastatic colorectal cancer, with median survivals now approaching 2 years " Vitamin deficiency warning for vegetarians "Vitamin B12 is essential for maintaining healthy nerve cells and red blood cells; a deficiency in the vitamin can cause symptoms ranging from the subtle, including fatigue and mild dizziness, to the more severe, including nerve damage, anemia and dementia.  Vegetarian and vegan women who breastfeed should be especially careful to get enough vitamin B12, according to Dr Komaroff. Deficiency in an infant can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system and serious developmental problems." Evidence-based medicine: Arguments for and against. (Emerg Med Australas. 2005) "Although randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses are at the top of the evidence hierarchy, they are not always necessary, might not be the most appropriate forms of evidence for some clinical questions, and have their own limitation that need to be understood. Best available evidence, applied to individual patients, is the corner stone of EBM. Although there are valid criticisms and limitations of EBM, if these are understood then the practice of EBM can provide guidance to the clinician and enhance patient care." When does atherosclerosis become irreversible? Chronological change from an early to an advanced atherosclerotic lesion observed by angioscopy. (Angiology. 2005) "  early lesions of atherosclerosis are reversible and cholesterol-lowering therapy is an effective treatment; however, since advanced lesions seem to be irreversible, cholesterol-lowering therapy may not be effective for such lesions. The results of angioscopic examination showed that EPA slowed the progression of atheromatous lesions, and probably suppression of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells is the mechanism of such effect." Mould/dampness exposure at home is associated with respiratory disorders in Italian children and adolescents: the SIDRIA-2 Study. (Occup Environ Med. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory disorders such as wheeze and asthma can often be explained by exposure to home mould/dampness, especially early in life. The association seems more evident in children than in adolescents. These findings may suggest the need for environmental prevention strategies." Effects of prolonged combined strength and endurance training on physical fitness, body composition and serum hormones in women with rheumatoid arthritis and in healthy controls. (Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2005) "It is an important aim in the prevention of osteoporosis to stop or decelerate bone loss during the early postmenopausal years. Here we report on results of the 3-year EFOPS exercise trial in osteopenic women. The exercise strategy emphasized low-volume high-resistance strength training and high-impact aerobics.  In summary, over a period of 3 years our low-volume/high-intensity exercise program was successful to maintain bone mineral density at the spine, hip and calcaneus, but not at the forearm." Childhood abuse and familial violence and the risk of panic attacks and panic disorder in young adulthood. (Psychol Med. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to childhood sexual and physical abuse was associated with increased risks of later panic attack/disorder  These data suggest the need for clinicians to be aware that patients with histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse may be at increased risk for panic during young adulthood." Cutaneous Melanoma: Update on Prevention, Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (Am Fam Physician 2005) ""Numerous risk factors for the development of melanoma have been identified, including sun sensitivity, white skin, fair hair, light eyes, tendency to freckle, family history of melanoma, dysplastic nevi, increased numbers of typical nevi, large congenital nevi (Figure 1), and immunosuppression. The risk associated with sun exposure is not completely clear. Although sun exposure is a risk factor for melanoma, cutaneous melanomas can arise frequently in areas of the body not exposed to the sun (Figure 2)." Oral vitamin C administration reduces early recurrence rates after electrical cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation and attenuates associated inflammation (International Journal of Cardiology  2005) "Inflammation and oxidative stress have been recently implicated in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to examine the potential benefit of vitamin C on the early recurrence rates and on inflammatory indices after successful cardioversion of persistent AF  Conclusions: These findings suggest that vitamin C reduces the early recurrence rates after cardioversion of persistent AF and attenuates the associated low-level inflammation. These effects indicate that therapeutic approaches targeting at inflammation and oxidative stress may exert favourable effects on atrial electrical remodeling." Generalized atherosclerosis, cognitive decline, and depressive symptoms in old age (NEUROLOGY 2005) "Conclusion: In the population at large, generalized atherosclerosis contributes to cognitive decline in old age but not to depression." Washing our hands of the congenital cytomegalovirus disease epidemic. (BMC Public Health. 2005) "Each year in the United States, an estimated 40,000 children are born with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving more than 8000 children with permanent disabilities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation.  Congenital CMV is a prime target for prevention not only because of its substantial disease burden but also because the biology and epidemiology of CMV suggest that there are ways to reduce viral transmission.  Given the present state of knowledge, women deserve to be informed about how they can reduce their risk of CMV infection during pregnancy " New UC study shows 'stop and go' traffic increases infant wheezing " ... study suggest that the type of traffic and distance from it-- not just traffic volume--are associated with infant wheezing. … ' During the first year of life, an infant's lungs and immune system are still developing,' … ' Overexposure to harmful particulates at such a young age may play a role in the development of allergic conditions.' … Research showed that infants living within 100 meters of "stop and go" traffic wheezed twice as often as those living within 400 meters (about 400 yards) of interstates, and more than three times as often as unexposed children." Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (Am Fam Physician 2005) "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by the effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable form of FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The consequences are lifelong, and the behavioral and learning difficulties are often greater than the degree of neurocognitive impairment." Tanning Beds, Sunlamps, and Risk of Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma (Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention 2005) "Conclusions: Results indicate a significantly increased risk of cutaneous melanoma subsequent to sunbed/sunlamp exposure." Did Merck target doctors critical of Vioxx? "ANGLETON, Texas - Merck & Co.s marketing team targeted doctors viewed as unfriendly toward Vioxx to bring them into the fold, neutralize or discredit them, the plaintiffs lawyer ..." Combination diet and exercise interventions for the treatment of dyslipidemia: an effective preliminary strategy to lower cholesterol levels? (J Nutr. 2005) " At present, dyslipidemia is most commonly treated with drug therapy. However, because safety concerns regarding the use of pharmaceutical agents have arisen, a need for alternative nonpharmacological therapies has become increasingly apparent. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) recommends lifestyle therapies, which include a combination of diet and exercise modifications, in place of drug treatment for patients who fall into an intermediate range of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk  These findings suggest that combination lifestyle therapies are an efficacious, preliminary means of improving cholesterol levels in those diagnosed with dyslipidemia, and should be implemented in place of drug therapy when cholesterol levels fall just above the normal range." Body mass index as a predictor of prostate cancer: development versus detection on biopsy. (Urology. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: After taking into account the clinical characteristics that influence the likelihood of finding an existent cancer, a higher BMI was positively associated with being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Also, among the men with cancer, a higher BMI increased the odds of high-grade disease. These findings suggest that obesity may be biologically associated with prostate cancer development and, in particular, with high-grade disease." Vioxx aggressively marketed despite concerns " 'Disinformation and censorship' - Instructions were as detailed as how long to shake a physicians hand  three seconds  and how to eat bread when dining with doctors  one small bitesize piece at a time. - One memo, on Feb. 9, 2001, told sales reps, Do not initiate discussions on a study that raised heart concerns. Another document describes obstacle handling to overcome physician concerns. - When it comes to the one thing doctors most needed to know about Vioxx  its health risks  Mercks answer seems to be disinformation and censorship, said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif." Merck failed to test safety of Vioxx on heart Physical exercise capacity is associated with coronary and peripheral vascular function in healthy young adults. (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2005) "Short-term exercise training has been shown to improve cardiovascular function, while long-term effects of a physically active life-style on coronary artery function in particular, are still not well studied. We explored possible relationships between physical exercise capacity and coronary and peripheral vascular function in healthy young adults.  High exercise capacity due to a physically active life-style is associated with high coronary and peripheral artery function, indicating an early protective role of physical exercise for cardiovascular health." Exposure of Arctic populations to methylmercury from consumption of marine food: an updated risk-benefit assessment. (Int J Circumpolar Health. 2005) "Recent and powerful epidemiological studies have been used as a basis for revising international and domestic guidelines for human exposure to mercury. Long-range transport of mercury into the Arctic makes some Arctic peoples consuming traditional marine foods, especially newborns, children and pregnant women, very vulnerable to harmful exposures.  Considering the benefits of marine fatty acids (n-3 fatty acids) and guidance that populations consume 300-400g fish/week, consumers face a reality that most open ocean and relatively 'unpolluted' fish species contain levels of mercury that would lead to exposures at current guidance levels. Clearly, there is no more room for further mercury pollution and there is an urgent need for international action to reduce mercury emissions." Cigarette smoking and the progression of multiple sclerosis. (Brain. 2005) "These results support the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis, and suggest that smoking may be a risk factor for transforming a relapsing-remitting clinical course into a secondary progressive course." The effects of physical activity and body mass index on cardiovascular, cancer and all-cause mortality among 47 212 middle-aged Finnish men and women (International Journal of Obesity (2005)) "OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of physical activity and body mass index (BMI), and their combined effect, with the risk of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. CONCLUSION: Regular physical activity and normal weight are both important indicators for a decreased risk of mortality from all causes, CVD and cancer. Physical activity had a strong independent effect on mortality, whereas the effect of BMI was partly mediated through other obesity-related risk factors." Meat, Fish, and Colorectal Cancer Risk: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2005)  "Conclusions: Our data confirm that colorectal cancer risk is positively associated with high consumption of red and processed meat and support an inverse association with fish intake." Statin Use and the Risk of Incident Dementia (Arch Neurol. 2005) "  statin therapy was not associated with a decreased risk of dementia." Body Burden  The Pollution in Newborns "Of the 287 chemicals we detected in umbilical cord blood, we know that 180 cause cancer in humans or animals, 217 are toxic to the brain and nervous system, and 208 cause birth defects or abnormal development in animal tests. The dangers of pre- or post-natal exposure to this complex mixture of carcinogens, developmental toxins and neurotoxins have never been studied." The role of the pharmaceutical industry in teaching psychopharmacology: a growing problem. (Acad Psychiatry. 2005) "RESULTS: The pharmaceutical industry currently plays an extensive role in teaching psychopharmacology to trainees, both directly and indirectly. Attendance at industry-sponsored lectures and drug lunches, meetings with pharmaceutical representatives, and interactions involving the acceptance of various gifts are the most obvious venues.  CONCLUSIONS: In light of these findings, the medical profession must reassert control of medical education and draw a firm barrier between commercial and professional pursuits." Teratogen update: Lead and pregnancy. (Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol. 2005) "This review focuses on the impacts of lead exposure on reproductive health and outcomes. High levels of paternal lead exposure (>40 mug/dl or >25 mug/dl for a period of years) appear to reduce fertility and to increase the risks of spontaneous abortion and reduced fetal growth (preterm delivery, low birth weight). Maternal blood lead levels of approximately 10 mug/dl have been linked to increased risks of pregnancy hypertension, spontaneous abortion, and reduced offspring neurobehavioral development.  A special concern with regard to the pregnant woman is the possibility that a fetus might be exposed to lead mobilized from bone stores as a result of pregnancy-related metabolic changes, making fetal lead exposure the result of exposure to exogenous lead during pregnancy and exposure to endogenous lead accumulated by the woman prior to pregnancy. By reducing bone resorption, increased calcium intake during the second half of pregnancy might reduce the mobilization of lead from bone compartments, even at low blood lead levels." Association between the Current Use of Low-Dose Oral Contraceptives and Cardiovascular Arterial Disease: A Meta-Analysis (The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 2005) "In conclusion, a rigorous meta-analysis of the literature suggests that current use of low-dose OCs significantly increases the risk of both cardiac and vascular arterial events, including a significant risk of vascular arterial complications with third generation OCs." Episodic air pollution is associated with increased DNA fragmentation in human sperm without other changes in semen quality. (Hum Reprod. 2005) "CONCLUSION: Exposure to intermittent air pollution may result in sperm DNA damage and thereby increase the rates of male-mediated infertility, miscarriage, and other adverse reproductive outcomes." Diet Makes an Impact on ADHD "  the top five foods that aggravate ADHD are wheat, dairy, citrus, eggs and corn. Eliminating one or more of these foods can make a big difference. Dr. Weber says, There are some foods that aggravate some kids; the hard part is that not the same food will aggravate every child.  Supplements can also help. Dr. Weber says when kids are deficient in essential fatty acids, they can appear to have ADHD.  Those big changes came by adding Ginkgo and fish oil to Austins diet." Nonsevere Acute Otitis Media: A Clinical Trial Comparing Outcomes of Watchful Waiting Versus Immediate Antibiotic Treatment (PEDIATRICS 2005) "Objective. The widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that are difficult to treat. However, it has been shown that most children with nonsevere AOM recover without ABX." Why babies should never sleep alone: A review of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS, bedsharing and breast feeding. (Paediatr Respir Rev. 2005) "We will examine the conceptual issues related to the biological functions of mother-infant co-sleeping, bedsharing and what relationship each has to SIDS. At very least, we hope that the studies and data described in this paper, which show that co-sleeping at least in the form of roomsharing especially with an actively breast feeding mother saves lives, is a powerful reason why the simplistic, scientifically inaccurate and misleading statement 'never sleep with your baby' needs to be rescinded, wherever and whenever it is published." Evaluation and Prevention of Diabetic Neuropathy (Am Fam Physician 2005) "Diabetic neuropathy can affect any part of the nervous system. This nerve disorder should be suspected in all patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients who have had type 1 diabetes for more than five years.  Early detection and control of diabetes and coexisting risk factors for neuropathy (e.g., smoking, alcohol abuse, hypertension) can prevent, delay, or slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy." Meniscal tear and extrusion are strongly associated with progression of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging. (Ann Rheum Dis. 2005) "OBJECTIVES: To quantitate the cartilage volume changes in knee osteoarthritis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and determine whether meniscal alteration predicts cartilage volume loss over time." Fruit and vegetable consumption and cognitive decline in aging women. (Ann Neurol. 2005) "Fruits were not associated with cognition or cognitive decline. However, total vegetable intake was significantly associated with less decline. Specifically, on a global score combining all tests, women in the highest quintile of cruciferous vegetables declined slower  compared with the lowest quintile. Women consuming the most green leafy vegetables also experienced slower decline than women consuming the least amount  ..." Dietary and serum vitamins and minerals as predictors of myocardial infarction and stroke in elderly subjects. (Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: From the items in the dietary interview, low intakes of vitamin D and certain flavonoids emerged as the sole predictors of AMI and stroke. In biochemical analyses, on the other hand, these disorders were predicted only by low levels of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D and iron in the serum." Calculated, Risk Is Worth Benefit of Eating Fish " pregnant women can boost their baby's intelligence by eating fish a couple of times a week, but only if they avoid varieties with large concentrations of mercury." All teas are not created equal The Chinese green tea and cardiovascular health. (Int J Cardiol. 2005) "Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, next only to water. It can be categorized into three types, depending on the level of fermentation, i.e., green (unfermented), oolong (partially fermented) and black (fermented) tea. In general, green tea has been found to be superior to black tea in terms of antioxidant activity owing to the higher content of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate.  The cardioprotective effect of flavonoids from green tea can be attributed to not only antioxidant, antithrombogenic and anti-inflammatory properties but also improvement of coronary flow velocity reserve." Report from SNM: PET reveals cardiovascular risks of obesity "PET evaluation of myocardial blood flow adds ammunition to fears that increased obesity rates in the U.S. may lead to an epidemic of cardiovascular disease." Habitual exercise program protects murine intestinal, skeletal, and cardiac muscles against aging. (J Appl Physiol. 2005) " moderate running in treadmill during animal life span exhibited a reversion of all the observed aging effects on intestinal, skeletal, and heart muscles. The introduction of this lifelong exercise protocol prevented the enhancement of lipid peroxidation and sarcopenia, and also preserved cellular and ultra-cellular structures of the ileum." Secondary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease in Elderly Patients (Am Fam Physician 2005) "Coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States, with 84 percent of persons 65 years or older dying from this disease." Aspirin for everyone older than 50? AGAINST "  recommendation that aspirin be used for primary prevention of vascular disease in unselected people over a certain age could result in net harm, and we must have very good evidence to the contrary before instituting such a policy." Aspirin for everyone older than 50? FOR "Evidence is growing that regular aspirin may reduce cancer and dementia as well as vascular events. A low incidence of cancer has been reported in habitual aspirin users" Noninvasive Assessment of Coronary Plaque Burden Using Multislice Computed Tomography (The American Journal of Cardiology  2005) "Plaque was classified as large in 33% of segments and small in 67%. Overall, 65% of plaques were calcified, 24% were noncalcified, and 11% were mixed. Plaques were predominantly located in the proximal and middle segments of the main coronary vessels." Risk-Based Consumption Advice for Farmed Atlantic and Wild Pacific Salmon Contaminated with Dioxins and Dioxin-like Compounds (Environ Health Perspect.  2005) "Many farmed Atlantic salmon contain dioxin concentrations that, when consumed at modest rates, pose elevated cancer and noncancer health risks. However, dioxin and DLCs are just one suite of many organic and inorganic contaminants and contaminant classes in the tissues of farmed salmon  and the cumulative health risk of exposure to these compounds via consumption of farmed salmon is likely even higher." Analysis of Risk of Bleeding Complications After Different Doses of Aspirin in 192,036 Patients Enrolled in 31 Randomized Controlled Trials (The American Journal of Cardiology  2005) "  low-dose ASA was associated with the lowest risk, and moderate doses caused a relatively high hemorrhagic event rate, especially with regard to minor, gastrointestinal, and total bleeding, and stroke. These findings should be considered when using combination antiplatelets, anticoagulant therapy, or both, with ASA, especially with the daily dose of >100 mg. Plasma homocysteine predicts progression of atherosclerosis. (Atherosclerosis. 2005) "Three emerging risk factors potentially useful in predicting future cardiac events are electron-beam computed tomography (EBT), homocysteine(HCY), and C-reactive Protein (CRP).  CONCLUSION: Presence of elevated HCY (>12mumol/L) strongly and independently predicts progression of coronary plaque burden." Decrease of carotid intima-media thickness in patients at risk to cerebral ischemia after supplementation with folic acid, Vitamins B6 and B12. (Atherosclerosis. 2005) "OBJECTIVE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with atherosclerotic risk. Although vitamins can lower homocysteine (Hcy), information about effects on atherosclerosis is scarce.  patients  received daily 2.5mg folic acid, 25mg Vitamin B6, and 0.5mg Vitamin B12 or placebo for 1 year. RESULTS: In the treatment group, Hcy decreased  CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin supplementation significantly reduces IMT in patients at risk." Fish oil supplementation and risk of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in patients with implantable defibrillators: a randomized controlled trial. (JAMA. 2005) "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether omega-3 PUFAs have beneficial antiarrhythmic effects in patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).  CONCLUSION: Among patients with a recent episode of sustained ventricular arrhythmia and an ICD, fish oil supplementation does not reduce the risk of VT/VF and may be proarrhythmic in some patients." Peripheral Arterial Disease and the Older Adult: More Sinister than It Appears (Clinical Geriatics) "CONCLUSION: Peripheral arterial disease is a common disorder, especially in the older adult, and is associated with a high rate of vascular comorbidity, claudication, and declining functional status." A Descriptive Hospital Based Study of Children with Autism (Indian Pediatrics 2005) "The sensory processing abilities are aberrant in 42% to 88% of autistic individuals(14). Absence of imaginative play was seen universally. This is characteristic of autism. Motor stereotypes like hand flapping and rocking were commonly observed. ... Since there is no pathognomonic sign or laboratory test to detect AD, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence or absence of a constellation of symptoms. Pediatricians must increase their knowledge and their ability to recognize this disorder for early diagnosis." NICE guidance to prevent strokes and heart attacks lacks evidence "The NICE guidance recommends that a combination of modified release dipyridamole and aspirin should be used in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke or a transient ischaemic attack for two years from the most recent event." Physical activity, plasma antioxidant capacity, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in young and older men. (Am J Hypertens. 2005) "BACKGROUND: Sedentary aging is associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that regular physical activity is associated with preserved antioxidant defenses and endothelial function in older individuals." Vitamin B12, homocysteine and carotid plaque in the era of folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grain products. (CMAJ. 2005) "Carotid plaque area was associated with elevated homocysteine levels and low vitamin B12 levels.  Our findings also suggest that "folate therapy," the term commonly used for vitamin therapy for lowering homocysteine levels, is no longer appropriate." Epidemiological modelling of routine use of low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke in those aged >70 (BMJ  2005) "Conclusion: Epidemiological modelling suggests that any benefits of low dose aspirin on risk of cardiovascular disease in people aged = 70 are offset by adverse events. These findings are tempered by wide confidence intervals, indicating that the overall outcome could be beneficial or adverse." Comparison of the antioxidant activities of nine different fruits in human plasma. (J Med Food. 2005) "These results suggest that the consumption of fruits or fruit juices may reduce damage from oxidative stress, and that this effect may be a consequence of the antioxidant activity of fruits in scavenging the reactive oxygen species generated in human plasma." Early Carotid Atherosclerosis in Subjects With Periodontal Diseases (Stroke. 2005) "Conclusions The present results indicate that periodontal disease is associated with the development of early atherosclerotic carotid lesions." Magnetic resonance imaging and low back pain in adults: a diagnostic imaging study of 40-year-old men and women. (Spine. 2005) "RESULTS: Most "abnormal" MRI findings were found at the lowest lumbar levels. Irregular nucleus shape and reduced disc height were common (>50% of individuals)." NGC - ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT OF OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT IN ADULTS Guidelines RNAO - Interventions for Postpartum Depression 2005 Nursing Best Practice Guideline Systematic Overview of Warfarin and Its Drug and Food Interactions (Arch Intern Med. 2005) "... the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil, suggests that coadministration with warfarin should be avoided or closely monitored." When is the Brain Enlarged in Autism? A Meta-Analysis of All Brain Size Reports. (Biol Psychiatry. 2005) "CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a period of pathological brain growth and arrest in autism that is largely restricted to the first years of life, before the typical age of clinical identification."
