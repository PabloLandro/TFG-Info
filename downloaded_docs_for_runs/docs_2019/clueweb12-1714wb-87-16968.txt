When To Go In For Surgery To Cure Obesity Home About Our Doctor How to Reach Monterrey Dieting – Eating – Cooking Subscribe When To Go In For Surgery To Cure Obesity by Ruth Rosa Lenox on April 19, 2009 When To Go In For Surgery To Cure Obesity Have you tried diets and exercise programs without any positive results? If nothing worked, weight loss surgery may be the best option when it comes to losing weight. You might be a candidate for surgery if you have not been able to lose weight with diet, exercise and drugs (Read our guide: Are you a Good Candidate for Bariatric Surgery ). Weight loss surgery is not for every one who is severely obese. Whether you are a good candidate for weight loss surgery or not is a decision that you and your doctor will make together. One of the most important measures of eligibility that your doctor will use is your body mass index (BMI) – a calculation based on your height and weight. Your BMI will classify you whether you are overweight, obese and severely obese and determine if you are a candidate for surgery or not. The BMI measurement categories weight as follows- BMI between 19 and 25-healthy BMI between 25 and 30-overweight BMI over 30-obese BMI more than 40-severely obese A person with a BMI of 40 or more is at a much higher risk of suffering from obesity-related disorders such as diabetes, reduced mobility and high blood pressure. Surgery may be right for you if- 1.You are an adult (at least 18 years old) 2.Your BMI is 40 or more or your weight at least twice of your ideal weight 3.You have been overweight for more than 5 years 4.Your various attempt to lose weight had only short term results 5.You don’t drink alcohol in excess 6.You don’t have an illness that has caused you to be overweight. 7.You are committed to making changes in your lifestyle and diet Your surgeon may consider whether surgery is right for you if your BMI is between 35 and 40 and you have a health related problem due to obesity. It is better to discuss these criteria with your doctor. Weight loss surgery is a serious consideration, not a quick fix or easy option. This is a part of life-long weight management program that makes you more realistic to lose weight and maintain it afterwards. Weight loss surgery reduces the amount of food you can eat by either reducing the size of your stomach or bypassing your stomach. There are various techniques of obesity surgery include stomach stapling, gastric banding, gastric bypass. Mainly there are two types of surgeries are done that can help you to lose weight-gastric band, or the lap band surgery , and gastric bypass surgery and lap band surgery is one of the most advanced adjustable gastric banding systems approved by FDA.
