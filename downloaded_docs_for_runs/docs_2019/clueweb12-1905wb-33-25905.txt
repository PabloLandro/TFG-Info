This stone-ground Gyokuru green tea powder is not your average green tea! This is finely-ground powder of the best quality part of the shade-grown green tea plant, Gyokuru, which is carefully grown, selected, dried, stone-ground, and prepared according to the traditions of ancient Japanese. It does not come in tea bags because the whole green tea leaf itself is consumed in powdered form that is mixed with hot (not boiling) water, becoming bitter sweet. This powder is rich in chlorophyl and is bright (frog) green. The effects on the brain are calming and focusing, while stimulating – perfect for traditional meditation by Buddhist monks. Matcha contains antioxidants, EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) which posseses anti-cancer and anti-aging properties, vitamins A and C, and L-Theanine (for calming yet focusing effects on the brain). Just be careful to find a high quality product that has been stone-ground and does not contain artificial coloring or flavors. Acai Berries are our next superfood. The native berry of South America has a unique combination of health properties. Acai berries contain all the antioxidant, vitamin, and brain benefits of other purple berries (blueberries, blackberries), as well as essential fatty acids (like omega-3s) and even protein. In order to get the full benefits of this berry, it must be quickly processed – flash-frozen, flash-freeze dried. Otherwise, the health properties can be lost. Of course, organic fresh blueberries are also a nice option containing beneficial antioxidants and vitamins. Believe it or not, coffee beans are also part of the brain food list. Fresh-ground, gently roasted coffee bean powder actually has many benefits, such as antioxidants, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Even the caffeine content has been shown to be beneficial in small quantities because it reduces risk of mention decline, dementia, and Alzheimer’s. The problem comes when you add unhealthy things to your coffee drink or use over-brewed, low quality products loaded with artificial cream and sweeteners. This negates all the health benefits of the original coffee bean. As well, if you have caffeine sensitivity or gastrointestinal problems, coffee may be better avoided.

It is part of the immune system that is called the lymphatic  system.  One type of lymphoma cancer is called Hodgkin disease and the  others are called Hodgkin lymphoma.  Hodgkin lymphoma is the type that  moves from one set of lymph nodes to the next; and non-Hodgkin lymphoma  is the type that spreads disorderly, through out the lymphatic system. When non-Hodgkin begins a B cell or T cell, which are white blood cells,  becomes abnormal.  The cell continues to divide which make the cells  become more abnormal.  These cells then many spread to other areas of  the body.  In most instances, physician can not make determination as to  why an individual develops non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Symptoms of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma * Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the groin, armpits, and neck * Sudden and unexplained weight loss * Night sweats * Chest pain, breathing trouble and coughing * Tiredness and weakness that sticks around * Abdominal swelling, pain or feelings of fullness Risk Factors of Lymphoma While the basic causes of lymphoma are currently unknown, research shows  that individuals who are infected with HIV also known as the human  immunodeficiency virus, are at greater risk of lymphoma development.   There are other viral agents that create risks of developing lymphoma  such as Epstein Barr virus which is connected with some types of  lymphoma and the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus. Treatment Choices An individual with lymphoma can have their doctor describe for them  choices in treatment and specific results that may come from such  treatments.  A doctor may refer an individual to a specialist who treats  non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These specialists include radiation oncologist,  medical oncologists, and hematologists. Choices in treatment are  dependant on: * The particular type of non-Hodgkin an individual has * The stage the lymphoma is in * The rate at which the cancer is growing * An individual’s age * Additional health problems Filed Under: Medical Questions Tagged With: Cancer , Conditions and Diseases , Epstein-Barr virus , Health , Hematologic , Hodgkin's lymphoma , Lymphoma , Non-Hodgkin lymphoma The Low-Down on Diabetes December 13, 2010 By admin Leave a Comment Image via Wikipedia A recent report submitted by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention suggests that one out of three Americans will become Type 2  diabetics by 2050 if the country continues on its current path. With  such startling statistics as this, diabetes is rapidly becoming an  important issue in America today, and knowing the basics of this  increasingly relevant disease is more pressing than ever. Here are some  basic details about diabetes. At its most simple, diabetes is related to the level of glucose (sugar)  within the blood and the production of insulin within the body. After  food has been eaten, it turns into glucose in the blood stream.  Hyperglycemia is when a high level of glucose is found in the blood,  while hypoglycemia is when a low level of glucose is found in the blood  stream. An easy way to remember which is which is to remember that  someone is â€œhyperâ€ when he has too much sugar. In diabetes, insulin production is controlled by the pancreas. Insulin  is the hormone that breaks down the glucose in the bloodstream into  energy that the body can use. The body needs a balanced amount of  glucose and insulin in order to continue performing its daily functions.  Too much or too little of either is harmful to the body. Diabetes is broken into three different types. In Type 1 (sometimes  called juvenile diabetes), the pancreas no longer produces enough  insulin to keep the body’s glucose levels in check, and it must be  injected instead. In Type 2, the pancreas may still produce insulin, but  the body is more resistance to it. The third type of diabetes is called  gestational diabetes, and occurs only in women during pregnancy. Diabetes is often genetic, but it can also be diagnosed in people who do  not have a history of diabetes in their family. Some of the warning  signs of diabetes are frequent need to increased thirst, urinate,  fatigue, and weight loss.

The most common type of hyperthyroidism, Graves’ disease, is only life threatening in rare instances. First diagnosed in the early 19th century by Sir Robert Graves, it tends to be more common in women than men, and generally doesn’t manifest until after the age of 20. Graves’ disease begins when your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland. This causes your body to overproduce thyroxine, a hormone that increases metabolic rate, causing such symptoms as anxiety, irritability, fatigue, sleeping difficulties, rapid or irregular heart rate, tremors in hands or fingers, increased perspiration, heat sensitivity, brittle hair, weight loss, menstrual changes, and frequent bowel movements. Another fairly common side effect is called Graves’ ophthalmopathy, which is the bulging out of the eyes as the muscle tissue behind the eyes swells. An uncommon side effect is a skin condition called pretibial myxederma, a painless lumpish red thickening of the skin by the tibia. Symptoms to Look For You should see your doctor if any of the following symptoms occur: protruding eyes, an enlarged thyroid, heat intolerance, anxiety, tremors, or weight loss despite normal eating habits. Causes of Graves’ Disease Doctors are unsure what causes Graves’ disease; no single gene causes it. Researchers believe that environmental factors such as stress, in addition to pregnancy, smoking, and a family history may contribute. For instance, identical twins both tend to get the disease. As well, females older than 20 years of age are statistically more likely to get Graves’ disease. Treatment for Graves’ Disease According to Web MD, once Graves’ disease is diagnosed correctly, it is considered easily treatable with drugs that suppress the thyroid gland’s oversecretion of antibody production. The symptoms often cause discomfort and the eye complication can lead to partial blindness or double vision. However, If left untreated, Graves’ can lead to serious complications or even to death.

None of these represent a miracle-producing panacea that can take the place of a healthy lifestyle (including physical exercise, daily diet, and brain exercises), but when consistently consumed in moderation over time, the foods cited here can prove to have beneficial results. Top Brain Food Choices Let’s take a look at the top choices in brain foods. The first food to mention is wild salmon (not farm-raised salmon!). Wild salmon is an incredible brain health food because it is full of omega-3 fatty acids; in fact, it is one of the best sources. Essential fatty acids can help your arteries, help your mood, and reduce risk of stroke, dementia, and Alzheimer’s. Salmon is low in saturated fat and a rich source of high quality protein, containing lower amounts of ocean contaminants (such as mercury) than other types of seafood. Again, even if it costs more make sure to eat WILD salmon (orange in color), not farm raised which do not contain the benefits of the wild variety. Secondly – Chocolate! But not your typical chocolate-flavored, candy bars – this must be real chocolate without add the other additives. Minimally processed cacao beans have been shown to help with mood and cognition, while providing antioxidants, flavonoids, catechins, and other brain-enhancing elements. Use 100% organic non-alkalized high quality cocoa powder or a dark chocolate bar that uses at least 85% cacoa. You can take the powder and mix it with unsweetened almond milk (for quality protein), cayenne pepper (for digestion, brain and respiratory enhancement) and cinnamon (to stabilize blood sugar) for a tasty morning drink (add a bit of espresso if you are a coffee drinker). No sweetener needed! Keep reading for Part 2 of Brain Foods…coming up!

He does this by by studying patients that have experienced brain damage from head injuries or have unusual brain disorders. Ramachandran discussed his findings in a TED presentation given in 2007. In his presentation, Ramachandran speaks of several different case studies. There is a pathway going from the visual center to the brain that makes a connection. In patients whose pathway is cut, they cannot recognize people they know, such as their mother. Some patients who are missing limbs have pain from phantom limbs or have paralyzed phantom limbs. Ramachandran found that this was caused by learned paralysis. He used visual input – a mirror that simulates the amputated limb using the intact limb. This has helped relieve the phantom pain his patients were feeling. Similarly, stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis and can be helped using visual stimulation. Another interesting subject Ramachandran spoke of during this speech was synesthesia. This is the phenomena of seeing numbers or music tones in color – it is a mingling of the senses. For instance, the number eight may be associated with yellow or purple. Synesthesia is hereditary and is eight times more common among artists than in the general population. It is related to the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking, or a form of abstraction and creativity. In addition to his position at UCSD, Ramachandran is also an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute and the author of Phantoms in the Brain, A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness and The Man with the Phantom Twin: Adventures in the Neuroscience of the Human Brain.

Stephen Palumbi’s work focuses on evolutionary questions and the use of molecular genetic techniques to learn more about ocean ecology. ‘The Evolution Explosion’, Palumbi’s first book for non-scientists, documents how humans have impacted evolution. Palumbi spoke on www.ted.com – this article contains the highlights of his speech. The Problem The ocean is becoming progressively more polluted with toxins. Bacteria, sewage, heavy metals, and PCBs are getting into the ocean despite increased environmental legislation. It is a question of public health. The circle of life comes into effect as dolphins eat plankton, which contain PCBs. These PCBs get passed to the dolphin’s offspring through mother’s milk. The death rate among contaminated dolphin’s offspring is then 60 to 80 percent. In Japan, dolphin meat was incorrectly labeled and being sold as whale meat. Then people were eating it, including nursing mothers who pass toxins to their babies through mother’s milk. There has been a 50 percent increase in seafood-related vibrio parahaemolyticus infections in the United States (statistic from NOAA Oceans and Human Health Initiative), and this number is likely to continue rising. Cholera bacteria is being spread by copepods, sparking cholera epidemics in port cities. Case Study Monterey Bay is the case study mentioned by Palumbi as an unusual environmental success story. The situation in Monterey Bay was due to canneries that were introducing toxins to the environment, and has improved since 1932 with a marine protective mandate. How to Address the Problem According to Palumbi, we must understand and focus on evolving codependence and keep in mind the notion that the health of the ocean’s ecosystem is important and must be protected. Even though we live on land, our lives are integrally connected to that of the ocean.

The term regenerative medicine is the  concept of accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a  clinical relevant time schedule. Instead of trying to eliminate symptoms  with drugs and such, regenerative medicine wants to find a way for the  body to heal itself.  Part of the research is using a process that can  signal the body to rebuild itself. He uses a newt as an example – if  they can regrow a limb, why can’t we? asks Russell. Instead of treating,  we can refer to regenerative medicine. Regeneration is a wild concept,  but one that is being worked towards in scientific circles. How to do  this? We need to develop a conversation with the body that goes back to  being a fetus. If a fetus loses a limb in the womb, it regrows it. If a  child younger than six months of age loses a fingertip, they have the  ability to regrow that fingertip. The richer we are, the  longer we live. This is a challenge because if the average age in a  country is over 40 to 45, the associated symptoms are more expensive to  treat than the issues associated with a younger population. After age 40  to 45, there is a big spike in the amount spent on healthcare. There  are very few things you can do to treat these diseases and allow for  healthy aging.  Russell believes that prevention is the key. It is  important to diagnose the disease early enough to treat the disease  itself rather than just treating the symptoms of the disease. The research his team is doing includes: 1. Cellular therapy 2. Material-induced Regeneration – the ability to invent, design or extract materials that help the body to heal itself 3. Smart devices See Part 2 for more on regenerative medicine and the rest of Russell’s talk.

December 3, 2010 By admin Leave a Comment Image via Wikipedia Birth control can be effective for preventing pregnancy, regulating  periods, and even treating some diseases such as endometriosis. However,  like anything else, birth control–no matter what method is used–can  have side effects. When birth control pills are used, it is the  combination of hormones, usually estrogen and progestin, which work to  prevent pregnancy, regulate periods, or treat endometriosis (birth  control pills can do all three–sometimes at the same time). Even though  hormones occur naturally in the body, the combination of these hormones  or the amount of hormones in the prescription can cause side effects  such as weight gain, nausea, breast tenderness, and even a darkening of  the skin–a condition called chloasma. Birth control pills may  also cause an increased risk of breast cancer, especially in those women  with a strong family history of this disease. Other serious side effects of birth control pills may include strokes or blood clots, although these side effects  are usually rare. However, they can occur, which is why women who smoke  while taking birth control pills are urged to quit. Other types  of birth control, such as external birth control, can also cause side  effects, even if they do not contain hormones or ingredients such as  spermicidal or additional lubrication. Condoms that are made from latex  rubber may trigger an allergic reaction in those who are allergic to  this material. Even those made from sheepskin or other materials can  cause an allergy if a person is sensitive to the material. The  presence of spermicide on a condom or diaphragm (another form of  external birth control used by women) can cause irritation, both on the  outside and inside of the body. Internal birth control, such as  an intrauterine device (IUD), may cause side effects such as bleeding  between periods, abdominal pain, and in some instances, ectopic (tubal)  pregnancy or other serious side effects. Filed Under: Medical Questions Tagged With: Birth control , Hormone , Intrauterine device , Pregnancy What is Gestational Diabetes? November 30, 2010 By admin Leave a Comment Many people do not realize how common gestational diabetes is.  Nearly 5 percent of all pregnant women get this condition during their pregnancy.  Almost all, if not all pregnant women get tested for gestational diabetes.  Generally this testing happens between weeks 24-28.  Occasionally the testing will be done early.  The reasons for early testing include a family history of diabetes or gestational diabetes, personal history, or other possible concerns, such as being overweight before the pregnancy. So, why is gestational diabetes such a problem?  Having too much sugar in the blood, or glucose, is not good for the growing baby, and can in fact, cause some major health problems.  Many times, the baby may be too large, which can result in a medically necessary c-section.  The problems can even be fatal, if the disease is not controlled at all. When a woman is pregnant, there are many things that do not pass between her body and the placenta.  Unfortunately for many, glucose is not one of these things.  When you are pregnant, if your blood sugar is high, so is your baby’s.  Luckily, for most women, gestational diabetes goes away after the baby is born, though it can increase your risks of developing diabetes later in life. If you have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, it is generally fairly easy to control.  Many women are able to control their blood sugar with just diet and a little exercise.  There are medications available for those that are unable to control it this way, including pills and insulin shots.  After being diagnosed, you will most likely meet with a dietitian who will be able to help you understand what you need to be doing with your diet.  You will also most likely be monitored more closely by your doctor.  To make sure that the baby is doing alright, many times extra ultrasounds and non stress tests will be done during your pregnancy, as well.
