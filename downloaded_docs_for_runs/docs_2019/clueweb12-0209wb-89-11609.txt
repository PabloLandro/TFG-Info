"I just completed my medical expense itemization for my tax return for the year, it is not lost on me that I would have spent double that amount elsewhere, so a very big thank you to you and your staff and students. The treatments I've received is top notch!" -Kathleen, Boston, MA "I'm needle phobic so, it has been wonderful to have an alternative to try Japanese acupuncture. I tend to feel more relaxed and balanced after a session." -Sue, Dorchester, MA "I have found acupuncture to be very effective in treating my pain, I want to have more treatments." -Sandra "Within the first few weeks of the clinic, it became apparent that I was not dealing particularly well with the stress associated with my job, and thus I began being treated for that as well. I found that I had a significant response to the treatments centered on my stress levels. My experience with the clinic really peaked after my treatment on week four. I found that I had increased energy levels that lasted well into the following weeks. I also found myself sleeping more deeply, and waking less often. In particular, the additional energy really allowed me to approach stressful situations at work more positively, and work through them without becoming overwhelmed." -Elizabeth, Newton, MA "I initially brought my daughter to the clinic because the pamphlet advertised its benefits for asthma. The fall winter season is her worst time of year as her asthma is triggered by colds. Usually by now she has missed at least four days of school due to her breathing difficulties. I am happy to report that she has not yet had any absences. I am most pleased that we have not had to up her medication to compensate for the colder weather. As a parent, I was desperate to find some alternative to continuously increasing her medications." -Frances, Watertown, MA "Several members of my family and I have been attending the NESA clinic for several years for treatment of numerous chronic pain and physical problems. And we've had very successful results and continue to find the students extremely caring and professional. Our treatments have helped us to avoid some Western medical interentions and medications. These treatments have helped me tremendously to function and perform necessary tasks. Before treatment I was in a wheelchair with no signs of improvement. I now attend a sports club, swim and generally enjoy life more fully. I could not survive without NESA! " -Barbara, Boston, MA 150 California Street, Newton, MA 02458,
