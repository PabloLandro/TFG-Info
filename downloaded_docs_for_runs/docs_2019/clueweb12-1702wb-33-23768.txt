Unfortunately, this has a price. As we continue to live our lives in a world that no more sleeps, a lot more people are suffering from mild forms of sleep disorder. A sleep disorder, however mild, could cause potentially serious complications in any person's health largely because it badly affects the body's immune system and leaving us prone to sickness.
