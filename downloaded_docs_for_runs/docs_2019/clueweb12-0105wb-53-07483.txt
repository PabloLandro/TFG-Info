Ads by Google Muscle Mineral #1 Friday, 19 May 2006 Do you feel tired and sore most of time and don’t have the energy to work out? Do your muscles cramp and twitch without any particular reason? If you answered ‘yes’ to these questions, you may be deficient in one of the most overlooked minerals – magnesium. Sufficient magnesium supplementation can make a big difference in your training and strength levels by maximizing energy production, facilitating protein synthesis and speeding up recovery. So keep on reading if you want to know how you can boost your workout, improve relaxation and break through your strength platoes. You will also learn how to choose the right kind of supplement, its precise proportions and combinations and at the best times for more efficient absorption. When you think about muscle minerals, which ones first come to mind? Calcium, Zinc, Iron, Potassium have been popularized in the media and featured in sports supplements for many decades now. Especially if you followed the latest interest in taking a lot of calcium for fat loss, osteoporosis, or for intense muscle contractions and filled your cupboards with enough calcium for the next ten years or so – you might be jeopardizing your muscle growth to say the least. And why is that? – you sigh in confusion. Well, for starters, you might be facing a real mineral imbalance. What’s more, magnesium stores may become borderline low due to high calcium intake. That is because these two minerals work together in synergy: calcium makes the muscles contract and magnesium helps them to relax. Besides lifting weights, the two key components of muscle-building are rest and nutrition. And neither one of these would be possible if your magnesium stores are running low. Magnesium, Diet and Muscle Building Second only to potassium in terms of concentration within the cells, Magnesium averages to 0.05 percent of body weight, or 40g for an 80kg person. Needed by every cell of your body, magnesium participates in over 300 enzymatic reactions including protein synthesis, creatine-phosphate formation, glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, nucleic-acid synthesis, amino-acid activation, and cardiac function [1]. This mineral helps turn food into usable energy by “turning on” enzymes for digestion, absorption and metabolism. Carbohydrates, lipids and proteins cannot produce the source of muscle energy ATP (adenosine triphosphate) without the presence of magnesium. It is involved in every step of energy production including the control of blood sugar and insulin levels. Deficiency of this mineral will set the fertile ground for insulin spikes and uncontrollable appetite. This is not a good thing if you are watching your waist line [2, 3]. If you are seeking to facilitate so hard to earn hypertrophy, magnesium will help. It assists protein synthesis by activating amino acids and making them available to the body. Low magnesium levels may negatively effect protein metabolism and lead to weakness and fatigue. But note that eating more protein-rich foods will only worsen the situation by increasing mineral excretion and thus reducing your body’s capacity to absorb and utilize amino acids. Magnesium also facilitates the delivery of all nutrients and oxygen to working tissues. A study published in the journal Metabolism has shown that magnesium combined with creatine can significantly boost strength [4]. This shouldn’t be a surprise because the mineral link to creatine optimization has been known for a long time. In short, magnesium is a co-factor to the enzyme creatine kinase, which converts creatine into its storage form phosphocreatine, and helps it to resynthesize ATP for energy production. Therefore, magnesium is very important in optimizing creatine function. Recently, there has been a surge of various supplements appearing on the shelves of drugstores featuring creatine and magnesium powders in precise proportions with other added compounds. Creatine MagnaPower™, developed by Albion Laboratories, is the first ingredient to link the two molecules together, creating a bioavailable chelate. Building lean tissue occurs only after muscle breakdown imposed by contracting and relaxing these muscles against resistance.  And magnesium literally makes it happen – it helps transmit electrical impulses across nerves and muscles generating what's called neuromuscular contractions causing all of your muscles to flex and relax. Take away magnesium, and your muscles will cramp. All muscle tissues, including skeletal, cardiac or heart, and soft muscles of your digestive tract, directly depend on the presence of magnesium and contain about 40% of its total amount. The most metabolically active tissues have the highest concentration of this vital mineral which emphasises the necessity of magnesium for the strength of your muscles. Ever felt your muscles cramp or twitch? The sharp irritating pain you feel in your hip or in your calf muscle when you suddenly stand up, or just change you position may be caused by magnesium deficiency. Low levels of magnesium in body fluids increase the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, which may cause muscular irritability keeping muscles in a state of contraction longer causing them to cramp. Because of its nerve and muscle support, magnesium is essential for recovery and recuperation, and may even lessen the feeling of stress caused by excessive training. It’s a fact that muscle growth occurs only during complete rest and recovery. So, facilitating muscular response to recovery with proper nutrition, supplementation and reduced physical load will positively alter your hormones and induce growth. You probably have noticed the presence of magnesium in many sports supplements marketed specifically for recovery and muscle growth, such as ZMA. Magnesium was added to the formula in specific proportions with Zinc and vitamin B6, which has been clinically proven to significantly increase anabolic hormone levels and muscle strength in trained athletes. Studies have shown that supplementing with 30mg of Zinc and 450mg of Magnesium per day can elevate testosterone levels up to 30%! [5] If you try to psyche yourself up with caffeine or similar active agents before a good blood-pumping workout, you may find that relaxation doesn’t come easy. And sleepless nights are the price you have to pay for your overly energized lifts. Even though magnesium is not an antidote to all stimulants, it has shown to help anxiety, nervousness and insomnia. Considering that the only time you grow muscles is during sleep and relaxation, the importance of magnesium becomes even more paramount. Digestion and Absorption Usually, about 40-50% of the magnesium we consume is absorbed, but most of us rarely fall into the “usual” category. The time and amount of magnesium you absorb depends on the type of supplement, levels of stomach acid, specific needs of your body, when and in what combination you take magnesium, your dietary habits, transit time through the gut. All these variations will broaden the amount of magnesium you absorb from 25 to 75 percent. If it is not retained in tissue or deposited in bone, then it would be excreted with feces and urine. So, if you take the recommended 300mg of magnesium, you will effectively absorb anywhere from 75mg to 225mg. You can see that the range is quite wide, but there are certain things you can do to come closer to the upper end. Magnesium is an alkaline mineral and requires acidic environment for best absorption. It is best to take it when stomach acidity levels are high, such as between meals or on an empty stomach, especially with a little vitamin C as ascorbic acid.  Magnesium citrate or aspartate have a greater percentage of absorption due to the acidic environment they create in the stomach. Magnesium chelated with amino acids is probably the most absorbable form and include magnesium glycinate and taurate, followed by magnesium malate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate and oxide. Inorganic forms of magnesium, such as magnesium chloride or magnesium carbonate, are poorly absorbed and may cause gastric disturbances, so it is best to stay away from these. If you want to make magnesium supplementation more effective for muscle support and energy production, then take it with a specific range of supporting nutrients that may improve cellular uptake of magnesium: -Minerals Selenium, Molybdenum -Malic acid -Vitamins B6, B12, folic acid, vitamin C -Amino acids Taurine, Glutamine, L-Carnitine Don’t take magnesium with calcium and phosphorous – these minerals compete for the same absorption sites. Dietary fiber also impairs magnesium absorption. Natural Sources Green vegetables are excellent sources of magnesium. The central atom of the chlorophyll structure is magnesium which gives plants their green colour. Magnesium to chlorophyll is what hemoglobin is to iron – the “blood” pigment of plants. Most nuts, seeds, and legumes have high amounts of magnesium; soy products, fish and seafood are good examples. The whole grains, particularly millet, wheat (especially the bran and germ), brown rice, and fruits such as avocado and dried apricot are other sources [6]. Deficiency and Toxicity Your body becomes tense, muscles start to cramp more often, your sleep becomes shallow, rest and relaxation lose its intended meanings and your strength gains go down the drain. You find yourself in the gym being tired and weak instead of feeling energized and alert. This is the road of diminishing returns where every stop sign reminds you to check magnesium status. Physical and mental stress causes your body to excrete more minerals than usual through sweat and urine. This chronic stress can lead to magnesium deficiency and may be aggravated by low supplementation and poor absorption of the mineral. Since your body uses magnesium for all its functions, it requires constant supply. If magnesium loss is not replenished, the resulting depletion puts additional stress on all organs, including heart and muscles. As the last resort, your system will draw magnesium from stored supply found in bones jeopardizing bone integrity. The following factors are found to be the greatest contributor to magnesium deficiency: -Physical and mental stress -Processed-food diet -Meals high in protein, fat and sugar -Caffeine -Diuretics and laxatives -High Calcium intake How do you know if you are deficient? Only 1% of magnesium of the body is distributed in the blood, which makes a simple blood test inaccurate at determining magnesium levels. For that reason, it is advisable to pay attention to the symptoms of magnesium deficiency. These include fatigue, lethargy, muscular weakness, irritability, insomnia, poor appetite, dizziness, muscle tremors or twitching, writhing movements of the hands, exaggeration of the reflexes, apathy, apprehension, decreased learning ability, confusion, and poor memory. If deficiency becomes more extreme, then you will notice tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) and other cardiovascular changes, numbness, tingling, and tetany (sustained contraction) of the muscles as well as delirium and hallucinations [7]. Magnesium toxicity is almost unknown as excesses are usually eliminated in the urine and feces. However, symptoms of magnesium toxicity can occur if calcium intake is low. The symptoms may include depression of the central nervous system, causing muscle weakness, fatigue, sleepiness, or even hyperexcitability. In extreme states, magnesium overload can cause death. How Much Current recommendations of magnesium intake coming from nutritionists and dieticians is about 300-450 mg. But if you rank yourself as a workout-thriving endorphin junkie, then magnesium intake should be above the grossly underestimated requirements. Remember, with increased stress your body’s needs of magnesium also increase, and the more muscles you have – the more magnesium is demanded by these muscles. As a rule of thumb, take 6mg of magnesium for every kilogram of body weight.  So, for an 80kg bodybuilder the intake should come at approximately 480-500mg per day. Research has shown that taking 500 to 1,000mg of magnesium per day may optimize your exercise performance while preventing deficiencies [8]. It may take six weeks or more to absorb adequate amounts of magnesium to benefit stressed body parts and notice a difference in your condition. References 1.	Wester PO. Magnesium.
