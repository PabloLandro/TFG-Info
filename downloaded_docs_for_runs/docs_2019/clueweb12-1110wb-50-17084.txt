I have been going to ACLJ for over 10 years now. Before I started I was taking lots of medication from Immitrex for migraines, Ambien for insomnia, Zyrtec and Flonase for allergies, Xanax for anxiety, and being in the health industry I didn't like putting what I thought were toxins in my body. A friend suggested I try to meet with Donna and see what she could do do help me. I was a bit skeptical when I first went but Donna made me feel at ease. She listened to my concerns and then explained her course of action. Within the first month I noticed a huge difference, I was sleeping longer, headaches were not as frequent and I didn't need my allergy meds as much. After 3 months I was off all of my meds. When I was trying to get pregnant I spoke to Donna and she and Julie helped me out. I was by no means experiencing any fertility issues, it was just time for me. They suggested diet changes, some herbs, and after 2 months of treatments I was pregnant. I am absolutely impressed by the people in the office. From Ned and Jessica at the front to my acupuncturists Donna and Julie, these are genuine people with a real desire to help you with whatever ails you.
