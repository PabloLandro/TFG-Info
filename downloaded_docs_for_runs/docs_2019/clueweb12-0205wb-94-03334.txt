Publish Date: Apr 21, 2009 Tweet Share Benjamin Bakudaala GIVEN our statistical data of the already existing HIV/AIDS strategies, we can easily predict the prevalence rate at least for the next two decades to come. So far we know that Abstinence (A) equals 100% protection. Be faithful (B) equals 100% protection. Condom use (C) equals 98% protection. Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission equals at least 50% protection and Using sterilised or new sharp objects equals 100% protection from HIV/AIDSâ€. Before we can push for circumcision or the ABC plus campaign, we may need to look at the 1990 Rakai District report that talks about the discordant couples who have continued to have unprotected sex and in the long run became infected. Dr. Ponsiono Kaleebu talked about this report recently in an interview with The Saturday Vision April 4. However, Dr Kaleebu should throw more light on how many times one can have sex before being at risk of getting infected. Because individual y may get infected at his first or fifth time while individual x may get infected at his tenth or twentieth time. The ABC plus HIV/AIDS control campaign that is calling for more funds so that it is effectively and efficiently implemented should have some viable statistical data from discordant couples who were already infected from the time the supposed discovery of the infection started in Uganda (1982 in Rakai District) and the husband who was circumcised did not get HIV. If the trend is to promote circumcision as the best HIV/AIDs control measure, then the trained HIV/AIDS counsellors are now going to alter the massage from encouraging the other control measures which are better than circumcision. In my opinion promoting circumcision as an HIV/AIDS preventive measure is to encourage adultery, and thus high HIV/AIDS cases within the country especially among couples. Instead of coming up with less effective HIV/AIDS control measures, let us make a review of the initial control measures and request for more funding to promote them. It is better to promote the methods that have been tested and proved credible in HIV/AIDS prevention.
