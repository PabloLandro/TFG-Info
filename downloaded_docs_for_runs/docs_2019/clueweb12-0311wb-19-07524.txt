Many people claim to be poor while actually they are more than rich. Some things are considered minor but they are of value. Let us an example of an  aloe Vera plant. This is one plant that  is useful but people consider it as a weed. Its grown as an ornamental plant in other countries because of its good flowers ,  form and succulence. Due to this characteristic of being succulence it fits even dry spells. Locally can be used to heal wounds, burn healing, minor skin infections, sebaceous cyst, diabetes  and elevated blood lipids in humans. These is because they are believed to contain compounds such as polysaccharides, mannans, anthraquinones, and lectins. Those who have known its importance have gained a lot. The small  plant is considered as medicine regarding the soothing ,moisturizing and healing properties. Its gel is an ingredient of what we use daily like lotion, yogurt, breve-rages and some desserts. The juice is used to reduce heartburn and  irritable bowel syndrome. Cosmetic companies add aloe Vera to products such as makeup, tissues, moisturizers, soaps, sunscreens, incense, shaving creams. Aloe Vera extracts are used in dilution of semen for the artificial fertilization of sheep,  fresh food preservative, and  water conservation. Its also effective for genital herpes and psoriasis. It also cures digestive problems. I dont see the reason why people are complaining of the economy going up. If people can make use of the available resources and utilize them well, we can be somewhere. Last edited by nancyshanice; 05-12-2011 at 02:37 AM .

It is a very quick reactant with malaria, common cold, skin acne, burns and other wounds. It is very cheap and readily available.
