I'm dealing with something slightly uncomfortable right now. You see, at this very moment, there's a tampon soaked in tea tree oil inside me. It's diluted almost to nothing with water though...because, I'm not trying get vaj blisters (or burns). Recently I have been (self-)diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis. There's an overproduction of one bacteria and less of the good kind. You can get all the info on it right here: http://www.cdc.gov/STD/BV/STDFact-Bacter ial-Vaginosis.htm Home treatments include tea tree oil and yogurt with live cultures! The yogurt: if it's plain, apply directly to affected area. If not? Eat it. So! I'm doing both. We'll see what happens. There's just like a constant tingling and cool feeling inside me right now. Like my peppermint soap. Or menthol...but if I used menthol I would DEFINITELY get a burnt vaj. I didn't think I had BV, but everyone over at vaginapagina agrees that I do! Going to my first gyno appointment in a few days. Ah. This isn't the sexy type of sex post I wanted to launch off with. Actually...self-care is sexy and awareness is sexy. Let's get busy!

Also the gyno should be able to give you a list of the usual differences between BV and yeast if you ask. Oh and there are these self pH tests you can get made by monistat I think, good idea if you don't want to go to the doctor for something you can treat over the counter.

I've only ever used yoghurt and tea-tree for yeast - but then I've never had BV and both seem appropriate given that yoghurt has probiotics and tea-tree is a mild antibacterial. I get crazy yeast infections when I take antibiotics (or accidentally have too much sex) because I'm diabetic - so I have a battery of preventions/curatives including diflucan, garlic, undiluted tea-tree oil, Canesten, yoghurt and acidophilus pills. Argh infections can be crazy painful. Self-care is sexy - doubt it'd be much of a turn-on to go down only to discover for your unaware partner in crime that they had undiagnosed infections. And it links to self-awareness an
