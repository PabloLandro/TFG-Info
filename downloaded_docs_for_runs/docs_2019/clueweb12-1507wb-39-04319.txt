Average Rating Customer Reviews Sole DK - Softec Series - Heat Moldables 6/30/2010 Reviewed by: Ernesto Torres from New York City. Purchased for my wife who has real issues with heel pain. These helped right off the bat. The heel cup provides much needed support - she is able to walk/run without the pain she used to have. Had purchase custom orthodics but these are much better at a fraction of the cost. Give them  a try - comfortable even with out the heat molding. great stuff 1/22/2009 Reviewed by: sherman from SoCal. i was surprised... the silver fibers really do keep odor to a minimum.
