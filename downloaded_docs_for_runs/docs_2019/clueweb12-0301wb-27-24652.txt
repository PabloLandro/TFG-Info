Gastric Sleeve Operation SEARCH Latest news Gastric Sleeve Operation ... The First Surgical Obesity Center In Malaysia Is Born ... Child Obesity Threatening Asia, Warns US Expert ... Home News Gastric Sleeve Operation Gastric Sleeve Operation The gastric sleeve operation is available as a gastric restrictive procedure and has all the disadvantages of such procedures, in that it only restricts solid foods to some extent and not liquids. The stomach remaining can be expected to gradually stretch and permit larger meals. In addition there is no band or other permanently restrictive device. However the operation does remove the fundus or upper part of the stomach which produces Ghrelin, a chemical that stimulates appetite. When first introduced it was reserved for the treatment of truly massive individuals (500 to 600 lbs. or more) as a first stage of a BPD (bilio-pancreatic diversion) or its modification, the duodenal switch, or possibly a gastric by-pass, in cases where it would be too dangerous or difficult to perform the secondary or main operation in one stage. Â For experienced bariatric surgeons it should rarely be necessary to perform a gastric bypass in 2 stages. Recently it has become more popular as a stand alone procedure, but there are as yet (2009) no long term studies regarding its efficacy.
