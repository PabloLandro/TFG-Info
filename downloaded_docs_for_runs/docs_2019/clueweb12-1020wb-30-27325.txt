Although our feet are in part responsible for taking us from Point A to Point B, they seldom get the treatment and pampering they deserve. Yes, some of us may go to the spa and get a foot soak or a pedicure, but to be quite honest not everyone has that kind of time, so what can you do if dry, cracked feet are plaguing you? Well, having a foot cream as a daily part of your skin care routine especially if you have damaged and cracked heels is one of the best things you could do for your skin, but simply walking into your local pharmacy or supermarket and purchasing any old foot cream won’t cut it if you are seriously trying to heal your tender feet. When the feet become deprived of moisture and nourishment the can become incredibly dry, resulting in painful cracks with a high risk for infection. Your irritated and inflamed feet will only be exacerbated by chemical additives or artificial fragrances even more so if you feet are dry to the point of cracking. Make sure that when searching for the perfect foot cream for you that avoid products that are made with harsh ingredients like alcohols, Parabens, synthetic perfumes, Propylene Glycol, and Lanolin just to name a few. All of the aforementioned ingredients are common place in everything from deodorants to wrinkle creams despite the fact that each is also well known for being irritating to the skin or linked somehow to long term damage. Simple skin rashes and itching are common yet cases of things like swelling, severe burns, difficulty breathing and inflammation have been reported as well kidney failure and cancer in rare occasions. The best foot creams are always going to be made out of top of the line organic ingredients that are world renowned for their healing and rejuvenating nature. Super Sterol Liquid is only found in top of the line foot creams, as it is a completely safe, effective and organic combination various fatty acids and cholesterols that thoroughly moisturizes the skin. Super Sterol is so special because it hydrates the skin by literally mimicking the skin’s lipid system which is responsible for keeping the skin moisturized. It also creates a barrier that locks in moisture without suffocating the skin. Other essential ingredients in the most effective foot creams are things you’d never expect. Eucalyptus and Peppermint Oils, which are well known for their use in aroma and stress therapy due to their rejuvenating and relaxing scents but did you know that they are also quite an exceptional combination when it comes to soothing dry, cracked feet? Peppermint contains a substance known as Menthol which cools irritation as well as adding some sort of pain relief. Eucalyptus Oil calms and nourishes inflamed and irritated feet as well as providing a relaxing aroma. Just make sure that whichever foot cream you choose that it is going to be safe and effective. Make sure you avoid products that are made with harsh chemical ingredients or artificial perfumes that could cause further irritation. Look for a foot cream that is made with things like Super Sterol Liquid and Eucalyptus and Peppermint Oils, all of which are safe and effective alternatives to chemicals. Mark A.

Many people with arthritis foot pain benefit from orthotic inserts.  Orthotics is the science of constructing or custom designing foot appliances such as arch supports, shoe inserts, shoes, etc., to aid in preventing and correcting deformities that may inhibit normal, comfortable movement in a person.  Orthotics also assists in supporting and properly aligning the foot to help improve the overall function of the body’s moveable part. Although you may think a good athletic shoe (I.E. walking, running) provides you with enough support, this is untrue for someone who suffers or is prone to foot pain.  The reason is because while an exceptional shoe can provide your feet with cushioning and motion control, it doesn’t provide adequate arch or heel support, or shock absorption. Therefore, after you purchase a well-made pair of shoes, you need to take out the insole that came with the shoe, and replace it with an orthotic insole. What types of foot pain benefit from orthotics?  Orthotics are generally recommended for treating those who suffer from the following foot problems causing pain - - Arch strain and pain - Bunions - Calluses - Corns - Crooked toes - Hammer toes - Heel pain - Heel spurs - Metatarsalgia (pain in the ball of the foot) - Over-pronation - Plantar fasciitis Is there more than one type of orthotic insole? Yes.  Orthotics come in various sizes and can be used for a number of different shoe styles.  However, before we take a look at the different orthotics, keep in mind that not all insoles are orthotics.  If the word “orthotic” is not on the packaging, the insoles are not made with the same science.  Unlike other insoles, orthotics are designed to mold themselves to the foot when worn.  The following are the different types of orthotics - Functional orthotics – This type of orthotic is designed to correct defects of the arch including over-pronation, common in people with flat feet, and supination, common in people with high arches.  Both foot problems can cause heel pain (plantar fasciitis) and puts excessive strain on muscles and joints throughout the back, hip and leg.  Functional orthotics provides proper correction of these foot problems. Supportive orthotics – These orthotics are designed to fix problems that occur in the arch, and provide the arch with proper support. Weight-dispersive or accommodative orthotics -These orthotics are designed to provide padding and help support sesamoid bones (bones embedded in a tendon) metatarsal heads, collapsed tarsal bones, inflamed toes and sores.  They help relieve pain and pressure from these areas. Where can you obtain orthotic inserts?  There are two ways a person can obtain orthotic insoles - 1. Ready-made orthotics -There are a variety of ready-made orthotic insoles sold online and in local super centers, drug stores and pharmacies.  Most ready-made orthotic insoles provide arch support and a certain level of correction and cushioning to a person’s step. The following is a list of ready-made orthotic product brand names you can look for – Dr. Scholls, Spenco Insoles, and Footlevelers. 2. Custom orthotics – Custom orthotics will provide you better relief than ready-made orthotics because they are designed specifically for your foot and to treat your specific foot issue.  The only problem is custom orthotics are hundreds of dollars, making them significantly more expensive than the ready-made variety. Custom made orthotics are prescribed by health care professionals such as a family practitioner, chiropractor or podiatrist.  The actual fitting of orthotic insoles is done at an orthotics lab by a pedorthist.  The pedorthist constructs custom orthotics based on the diagnosis of the doctor and by taking a plaster cast of the patient’s foot. Despite the type of orthotic insoles you decide to obtain for your feet, remember that you should always have your doctor diagnose your foot pain and ask for recommended treatment options.

Posted in foot pain | No Comments Tags: Consider , Orthotics , Should 12 Feb 12 Who Should Use Orthotic Insoles? Orthotic insoles have many uses. They help to restore the foot to a more natural state, curing heel pain, foot pain and knee pain. A good insoles will even help to correct posture and align the spine properly. It does by using a combination of shock absorption and repositioning of the foot. So who can benefit from the use of orthotic insoles? Well, in my opinion, there are basically three types of people. First and foremost, I’d say that anyone who spends a ton of time on their feet should consider a shoe insert of some kind. If you work in a plant or warehouse, chances are you’re standing or walking on concrete all day. This can really take it’s toll on your feet. Furthermore, if you don’t sort this problem out early, you may develop more serious health issues down the road. Poorly supported feet have been known to cause knee pain, back pain and even neck pain. Athletes are another group of people who often use orthotics. If you’re an avid runner, jogger or walker, chances are you’re familiar with a condition known as shin splints. If you’re not sure what this is, consider yourself lucky! They’re extremely painful. A high quality set of orthotic shoe inserts can prevent and even cure this condition though. Lastly, overweight people often experience many benefits from using insoles. Just the nature of their body size puts extra stress on the feet. If they don’t add a bit of support to their shoes, it can cost them in a big way later on. James Wikman knows a lot about orthotic insoles for shoes . Read his article on orthotic inserts for more information.

This type is the one used in foot massage stalls. They can deliver a satisfying amount of pressure to both the legs and feet which can really help the blood flow. On the other hand, there are some models that concentrate on pleasuring the feet. These include the foot spa bath which is used in spa parlors, the warming foot massager which has a sock-like pouch where the feet will be warmed and inserted- perfect for cold winter nights, and the Shiatsu massager which may be hot or cold.

The most surprising part of it is how so many of these people are willing to suffer in silence and not really do anything about it. Perhaps they don’t wish to call any attention to their little problems. Enduring pain in silence and ignoring the first signs of a painful heel condition can be about the worst thing you can do though. Identify the cause of the problem, initiate steps for heel pain relief early enough, and you’ll save yourself so much trouble down the line. The exercises you need to do for seriously good heel pain relief are pretty simple. Just a few stretching exercises done regularly every day should get you well on your way to living life pain-free again. Your first area focus stretching for heel pain relief are your calves. What you need to do is to stand close to a wall, say about a foot away, and put your arms out so that your palms are pressed flat against the wall at chest level. Now placing both feet firmly flat on the ground, bend one knee ever so slightly and stretch the other back a bit. If you are doing this right, it should end up looking like you’re trying to push at the wall. This is when you actually do begin to push at the wall. You’ll feel your calf muscles stretching a bit. Hold the pose for half a minute and then switch legs. Do this 10 times each, three times a day, and you should be on your way to calf muscles that are more relaxed and that don’t tug at your heel like they usually do. Doing exercises that help you achieve a degree of control with your toes can be really great for heel pain relief. You’ll need a prop for this – a towel. Sit in a chair, place a towel on the floor before you, and put both feet flat on it. Using one foot to anchor the towel in place, use the other foot to begin to scrunch up the towel with your toes. Keep scrunching and pulling at the towel with your toes until there is no more towel left. Spread the towel out again and start over with the other foot. Somehow towels really work well for exercises for heel pain relief. This next exercise should really help you. You need to sit down on the floor with your legs stretched out. Loop the towel around one foot, hold both ends of the towel in your hands and pull your foot towards you to help stretch your foot and calf muscles. Heel pain relief is all about strengthening and relaxing the muscles in your calves and your feet. For most regular kinds of heel pain, at-home exercises like these can easily be all you need. For anything more serious though, you should probably consult a physiotherapist who can teach you more intensive exercise regimes.

If you have diabetes, here’s why caring for your feet could save your life Diabetic Foot Pain is just one of the many worrying symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus Complications – because of what it could foretell. Other diabetes complications can lead to several diseases in which (typically), high blood glucose levels bring about damage of the nerves and nerve-endings, kidneys, blood vessels and eyes, usually developing over quite long periods. Effective Diabetes Management If your diabetes is not carefully managed, permanent organ damage and impairment of your immune system is likely too. And as if these problems aren’t bad enough, diabetes complications can also reduce a body’s ability to fight even mild infections. And infections of the feet can be the most difficult to contain. Your Diabetic Foot Problem Diabetic Foot Pain is just one of a wide range of diabetic foot problems which are extremely common in diabetes patients, but remember, even minor diabetic foot problems can rapidly become very serious indeed. If diabetes brings about damage to your nervous system, this is usually most evident in your feet. You may not even be able to properly feel your feet, and sweat and oil production that is essential to lubricate the skin of the foot is usually impaired too. These factors can produce abnormal pressure on the skin, bones, and joints of the feet. These problems can then lead to a total breakdown of the skin of the foot, and sores (or even diabetic ulcers) can then develop. Diabetes and An Impaired Immune System Diabetes can lead to a dangerously weakened immune system, which can then make it difficult to for even small wounds to mend. Again, this is a particular problem for lesions on the feet or legs. This can lead to bacterial infection of the skin or connective tissue, as well as to the muscles and the bones. If not promptly and properly treated, these diabetic infections can ultimately develop into gangrene. The Results of Poor or No Circulation Because diabetics invariably suffer from poor circulation in their feet, normal antibiotics can’t always find their way to the location of an infection. In some extreme cases this can take a sufferer to the point where the only effective treatment is the total amputation of a foot – or (worse still) a foot and part of the leg. Worse still – if the infection should spread, it can eventually reach the bloodstream, and this cause a wide range of life-threatening problems. Diabetes Management Becomes a Full-Time Necessity Diabetes sufferers must be totally aware that diabetic foot pain may be an early indicator of a looming serious diabetic foot infection and take every possible measure to prevent foot problems developing. They must watch out for potential problems, and to get immediate treatment if and when a diabetic foot problem should occur. Modern treatments for diabetic foot pain and infections continue to improve, but (as ever) prevention – including controlling blood sugar levels – remains the single best way to stop diabetic foot infection becoming more than a minor nuisance. Regularly Examine Your Feet If you are a diabetes sufferer, you must learn to effectively examine your feet and how to recognize any early indications of diabetes-related foot problems. You should also have an effective routine for regular personal foot care, and be ready to call in or visit a doctor if a problem even looks as though it MAY become serious enough to seek expert help. So What Can I Do? Well, the “regular” medical fraternity – mainstream doctors and the big pharmaceuticals, will tell you that there is not cure, (so keep paying our enormous bills, even though we can’t help you!). But at least one man claims to have evolved his own cure, which he’s written up and made available in a downloadable ebook. If you would like to learn more, you’ll find links in the final paragraph of this article. Scott V Schofield is a natural health therapist and author who writes widely on alternative health matters. His Diabetes-Treatment-Secrets web site features and reviews a recently developed “natural diabetes cure” using widely-available and entirely natural ingredients. There you’ll also find lots of free, helpful diabetes information.

Do you or your spouse have painful feet? The pain of flat feet can be avoided. Unfortunately due to misinformation handed down through the generation of doctors, many pediatricians tell everyone that they will “grow out” of flat feet. This is a terrible misjustice to the millions of children who have symptomatic, structural flat feet that they will not “grow out of” and often leads to many years of pain and disability when treatment can significantly decrease their suffering. Flat foot is common in children and actually stands for several types of inherited foot types. Although these foot types differ in many of their characteristics, they all share a common flattening or collapsing of the arch. Many children with flat foot have no symptoms, but some can have serious aches and pains. Symptoms of pediatric flat foot include: - pain and tenderness in the foot, leg and knees - outward tilting of the heel - difficulty running and walking or just “funny looking” running - excessive shoe wear and difficulty fitting shoes - constant complaining when running or participating in sports What are the different kinds of flat foot? - symptomatic or asymptomatic - flexible (meaning they look like they have an arch when non-weightbearing but it fully collapses on weight bearing); this is the most common and associated with many overuse injuries in child athletes. - rigid (arch is always stiff and flat); less common and usually due to abnormal bone structure or bone growth during development. How is flat foot diagnosed? In pediatric flat foot, the podiatric foot and ankle surgeon will do a complete biomechanical exam to see how the foot, knees and hips function. X-rays are taken to evaluate the growth plates and bone growth. Often, an MRI or CT scan are needed to fully evaluate this complex deformity. How is flat foot treated? In asymptomatic flat foot, no treatment is needed except sturdy appropriate shoe gear to relieve stress. Secondary symptoms of “Charlie horses” or leg cramps, tired feet, and knee and hip pain should be discussed with parents. In painful flat feet, treatment is required. No child should be in pain from their feet. Activity modification, shoe gear, stretching exercises, anti-inflammatories and arch supports are the mainstay of therapy. Mant times, significant flat feet require custom functional orthotics and physical therapy for more aggressive symptomatic relief. Obesity increase pain in flat feet. Weight loss is always recommended prior to surgery due to the high incidence of painful flat feet in the obese child. Surgery should only be an option for pediatric flat foot if the child is having severe difficulty walking or running, has undergone at least 6 months of aggressive therapy and has a significant deformity. Contact your podiatric foot and ankle surgeon for a biomechanical exam if your child is experiencing fatigue, cramping or pain associated with flat feet. No child should suffer from painful feet!
