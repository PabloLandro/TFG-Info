Posted February 21, 2012 turboaholic Quality 4 / 5 Effectiveness 4 / 5 Taste 1 / 5 Overall Satisfaction 3 / 5 I was so eager to receive this product and be able to have a supplement that I could take daily in conjunction with my new workout routine. I was very disappointed to find how badly the vitamin smelled and how bad it tasted. There are several times when I cannot even take it because they make me gag(which is not usual because there are not many things that actually make me do this). Fitness Programs: Turbofire Cons: Poor taste Share: - 3 points 0 of 3 voted this as helpful. Overall rating 5 / 5 Easy to swallow even with their size. Posted February 20, 2012 Yogi from Michigan I started taking these vitamins over a year ago. What I discovered was that before taking these vitamins I would have daily headaches. I had literally suffered from daily headaches for over 20 years. All of a sudden they were gone! I wasn't tired and my head was not pounding. So now instead of buying aspirins and taking sometimes 3-6 everyday:( I take two of the Activit with my noon meal and I'm good to go for the rest of my day:) Fitness Programs: I bought the Gospel fitness program but I didn't connect to it like I hoped I would. So I'm walking my treadmill. Share: 0 points 1 of 2 voted this as helpful. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 next >> 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee We want you to be 100% satisfied or your money back!

Carl Daikeler Chairman & CEO Beachbody ActiVit ® Multivitamins—Metabolism Formula Beachbody designed ActiVit Metabolism Formula to be safe and effective, sourced with natural vitamins, minerals, herbs, and plant extractsand then we added extra ingredients to enhance your results from regular fitness training. This unique formulation was designed to give you maximum energy for an active lifestyle, but ActiVit Metabolism is great to take even if you aren't exercising as much as you'd like. You can take these vitamins even if you never work out! The key is to take ActiVit every day. Aside from the daily essential vitamins you need, we chose the following ingredients because they have been shown to positively affect your metabolism and energy levels while burning off fat.* We made some inquiries into what scientists and researchers are saying about our ingredients. We invite you to read what they said: Green tea  Green tea extract has been demonstrated to safely increase human metabolism and provide excellent antioxidant activity. Researchers have studied the effects of green tea extract on subjects and found that the number of calories used was measurably higher for participants taking green tea extract than for those taking simple caffeine, a placebo, or no supplement. In clinical trials, green tea extract has consistently been proven to be one of the safest and most validated ingredients. Pyruvate  Pyurvate is a compound that occurs naturally in the body, and has been shown to have a profound effect on body fat and endurance. Research has shown that pyruvate can increase fat loss and can minimize the associated loss of lean muscle mass. (This is unusual, because we almost always lose muscle when we lose fat!) Pyruvate has even been shown to reduce fat without exercise. Pyruvate can improve exercise performance by enhancing the transport of glucose into the muscle cell (muscles need glucose during exercise or they can more easily become fatigued). Subjects using pyruvate reported sustained energy levels without the unwanted side effects of caffeine or other stimulants. Pyruvate also: Is 100% safe because it is a natural product of the body's metabolism May decrease cholesterol in subjects on high-fat diets Provides unique Super Antioxidant Protection Seems to improve cardiac function Alpha-lipoic acid: the metabolic antioxidant  Alpha-lipoic acid is a nonvitamin coenzyme that carries out important metabolic and antioxidant functions in the body. It helps burn carbohydrates, fat, and protein while disposing of free radicals. Vanadyl sulfate  Vanadyl sulfate is a trace mineral and antioxidant. Antioxidants are beneficial because they protect against tissue damage during exercise, helping recovery and maintaining higher energy levels. Vanadyl has been shown to reduce soreness after vigorous exercise. It is being used more and more to help prevent excess LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) and triglycerides (blood fat). Vanadyl sulfate is also popular with bodybuilders because it may improve insulin action or mimic insulin in the body. Insulin helps muscle grow and can therefore help maximize muscle definition. Thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid  These compounds have been found to boost the body's metabolism, helping convert fat to fuel and increasing muscle strength and tone. By enhancing metabolic energy, you can exercise longer and reduce fatigue. Also, thiamin helps to reduce the onset of lactic acid buildup, so you don't "hit the wall" during strenuous bursts of physical activity as easily. (The "burn" you sometimes feel is the onset of lactic acid.) Reducing lactic acid buildup can also decrease post-workout soreness. Magnesium  Magnesium lets you work out harder while decreasing the likelihood of cramping. It is also recommended by many doctors as a daily supplement for health of the heart. Magnesium is an essential mineral that helps to regulate the heart's neuromuscular activity and maintain normal heart rhythm. Because of this function and its nerve and muscle support, magnesium may also be helpful for fatigue, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and muscle cramps. Cayenne fruit  This natural herb can cause dilation of blood vessels in the microcirculation. This process speeds nutrient delivery to the tissues and allows for efficient removal of metabolic waste from the muscles. By eliminating waste and delivering nutrients, muscles can function more effectively. Chromium chelate  Chromium is found in the best exercise supplements because it is natural, it helps enhance muscle tone, and it aids in the reduction of body fat. Chromium is reported to lower cholesterol and help stabilize and regulate blood sugar levels. More than 90% of Americans are believed to be chromium deficient. Alpha-ketoglutaric acid  Alpha-ketoglutaric acid plays a vital role in the Krebs cycle, the system utilized by your body to release large amounts of energy. It also contributes indirectly to the stabilization of blood glucose levels during exercise, fasting, or a very low-calorie diet. Alpha-ketoglutaric acid may be an important adjunct to proper diet and training for the athlete who desires peak performance, and may reduce the loss of lean body mass. Choline  Choline is very important in controlling fat and cholesterol buildup in the body; it prevents fat from accumulating in the liver and facilitates the movement of fats in the cells. It is also thought to help improve memory. Warning: This product should be used as a dietary supplement only.

ActiVit ® Multivitamins—Body Toning Formula Beachbody designed the ActiVit Body Toning Formula to be safe and effective, sourced with natural vitamins, minerals, herbs, and plant extractsand then we added extra ingredients to enhance your results from regular fitness training. This unique formulation was designed to give you maximum energy for an active lifestyle and help you feel better while exercising, but ActiVit Body Toning Formula is great to take even if you aren't exercising as much as you'd like. You can take these vitamins even if you never work out! The key is to take ActiVit every day. Aside from the daily essential vitamins you need, we chose the following ingredients because they have been shown to either increase energy and stamina, or allow the muscles to perform and recover more efficiently.* We made some inquiries into what scientists and researchers are saying about our ingredients. We invite you to read what they said: Vanadyl sulfate  Vanadyl sulfate is a trace mineral and antioxidant. Antioxidants are beneficial because they protect against tissue damage during exercise, helping recovery and maintaining higher energy levels.

Chromium is reported to lower cholesterol and help stabilize and regulate blood sugar levels. More than 90% of Americans are believed to be chromium deficient. Cola root extract  Cola extract is a stimulant which also accelerates the burning of fat. It is a thermogenic enhancer, which means that body fat is used or burned more efficiently when it's present. Because of its caffeine content, cola may relieve some migraine headaches. It may also provide antioxidant activity. This is especially important in aiding muscle activity during physical exertion. It is also believed to be a natural "smart drug," enhancing mental activity. Extracts of Oriental ginseng root, Siberian ginseng root, American ginseng root, and red-rooted sage root  This herbal formulation and contains no added stimulants such as ephedra. This proprietary blend contains a specially balanced preparation of several types of ginseng. It is formulated to boost energy, enhance immunity, and promote blood circulation. Additionally, it helps the user more efficiently adapt to physiological changes such as exercise and recovery after exercise, so that higher energy levels can be achieved and recovery is more rapid. Cordyceps  Cordyceps fungus has the ability to increase the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production in human cell mitochondria and is used to help build strength, endurance, and stamina. Cordyceps is thought to increase energy and is said to be especially good for people who are involved in athletics or enjoy vigorous sports. In addition, cordyceps has been shown to: Support male potency and female vitality* Support the kidneys* Increase blood supply to the heart and brain* Copper and L-tyrosine  Copper and L-tyrosine are used to increase the metabolic rate, which lets you exercise harder and burn more fatmaking muscle tone more visible. The energy boost from these ingredients can increase the intensity of your workouts, and for this reason they are best taken before exercise. Magnesium  Magnesium lets you work out harder while decreasing the likelihood of cramping. It is also recommended by many doctors as a daily supplement for health of the heart. Magnesium is an essential mineral that helps to regulate the heart's neuromuscular activity and maintain normal heart rhythm. Because of this function and its nerve and muscle support, magnesium may also be helpful for fatigue, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and muscle cramps. Tribulus  Tribulus terrestris is a powerful yet natural herbal alternative to anabolic steroids. As a muscle toner, it has been shown to elevate levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH), both of which have positive effects on protein synthesis, muscle recovery, libido, and sexual function. Branched chain amino acids: L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-valine  The three branched chain amino acids must be present in muscle cells to promote protein synthesis. They let muscles build up instead of getting burned off, and reduce the breakdown of muscle protein so you can maximize the effect of your workouts.
