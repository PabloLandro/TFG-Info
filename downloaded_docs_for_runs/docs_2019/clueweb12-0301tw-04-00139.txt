And this is one of the reasons why we are talking about aloe vera juice today, it truly is an amazing versatile plant of nature at its finest. And one of the products we will review today is  ” Pukka Herbs” Aloe vera juice, which in short description is Organic ALoe Vera juice made from pure inner gel without any synthetic preservatives, sounds good enough ehh? Well let’s see what it contains. Components of Aloe juice drinks So what can we say about their product? It contains 100% organic Aloe Vera Barbadensis ( Miller) and is certified by Soil Association. That’s a + For Pukka Herbs product they use only inner leaf gel of aloe vera, well that is another good thing about this product, since the outer rind of aloe vera leafs contains harsh laxatives which need to go through a number of filtration processes before being removed. That’s a + By using only inner gel of the leafs, means all of the beneficial filament is retained without bitterness in the final product. And that’s another + Pukka Aloe Vera juice contains 1030mg/litre of mucopolysaccharides and these are one of the primary 200 healing components considered as a main healing active ingredients. That’s a + as well It also has a 5000mg/litre of Aloe Vera solids, which are the total active composition in the inner gel. And another + In their procedure they use only fresh Aloe Vera leaves for optimum potency and quality. There comes one more + In Pukka Aloe Vera juice they do not use synthetic preservaties as allergenic potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid, where in this case many other Aloe Vera juices may do. And that’s a + again Benefits of aloe vera juice So after a small review of one of the aloe vera juice products from ”Pukka” now it is time for us to show you the actual benefits of drinking aloe vera juice.

Aloe vera juice negativeness Taste - There are many different flavors of aloe vera juice out there and not all of them you will find tasty and easy drinking. That’s a minus right there Strong laxative effect – aloe latex which can be in high levels in aloe vera drinks can cause abdominal pain and cramping, thats why we also won’t advice a long term use of aloe vera drinks, this can be dangerous and cause diarrhea. Here comes another minus. Negative with variety of medications - Aloe vera juice not always would be the best combination with medications, however we recommend you to talk to your own doctor before we you take any judgment. And that’s another minus. This is how Aloeride stands out cause you don’t have to worry about any of above mentioned negative effects, Aloeride is Unique and made with special pharmaceutical standards to keep it in best and healthiest quality. Aloe Vera drinks VS Aloeride pills Well the answer is quite easy and simple, first of all ”Pukka” ( is taken as one of aloe vera juice examples) Aloe Vera juice is a liquid and has to be taken in the following Dosage: Adults - 1-2 tablespoons (25 to 50ml) every morning on an empty stomach. Repeat during the day as required. Children (2-12 years old) - 1 tablespoon (25ml) twice a day. Use long-term 1-12 months. How practical is this? Imagine you are on the bus, on the way, or even somewhere in Malta having a nice Holiday, would you possibly be willing to take a 1Litre bottle with you or keep in your purse? No , I wouldn’t think so either.
