< 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, 
respectively) and the total pain summary score (p < 0.0001). Symptoms reported 
in the SPNS were reduced during the 5 weeks of acupuncture. Scores for 
pain/aching/burning, pins and needles, and numbness in the hands and feet were 
reduced (all significant at less than p 0.0065), as well as the total summary 
score (p = 0.0001). Researchers concluded the results of this study indicate 
that subjective pain and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were reduced during 
the period of individual acupuncture therapy delivered in a group setting. While 
the study design did not allow for control of nonspecific placebo factors, the 
data support the hypothesis that acupuncture in a group setting can reduce pain 
and neuropathic symptoms in HIV-infected individuals. Stimulation of P6 for 
Preventing Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Lee A, Done M. et al. Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, The Chinese University of Hong 
Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, New Territories, HONG KONG. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications 
following surgery and anaesthesia. Drug therapy to prevent PONV is only 
partially effective. An alternative approach is to stimulate a P6 acupoint on 
the wrist. Although there are many trials examining this technique, the results 
so far are conflicting.: To determine the efficacy and safety of P6 acupoint 
stimulation in preventing PONV researchers searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane 
Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (January 
1988 to January 2003) and the National Library of Medicine publication list of 
acupuncture studies up to and including January 2003. Reference lists of 
retrieved papers and reviews were consulted for additional references. They 
selected all randomized trials of techniques that stimulated the P6 acupoint 
compared with: sham treatment or drug therapy for the prevention of PONV. 
Interventions used in these trials included acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, 
transcutaneous nerve stimulation, laser stimulation, acustimulation device and 
acupressure. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and 
extracted the data. Primary outcomes were incidences of nausea and vomiting. 
Secondary outcomes were the need for rescue antiemetic therapy and adverse 
effects. A random effects model was used and relative risk (RR) with associated 
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are reported. Egger's test was used to measure 
the asymmetry of the funnel plot. Reviewers included 26 (n = 3347), none of which reported adequate 
allocation concealment. There were significant reductions in the risks of nausea 
(RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89), vomiting (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91) and the 
need for rescue antiemetics (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00) in the P6 acupoint 
stimulation group compared with the sham treatment, although many of the trials 
were heterogeneous. There was no evidence of difference in the risk of nausea 
and vomiting in the P6 acupoint stimulation group versus individual antiemetic 
groups. However, when different antiemetics were pooled, there was significant 
reduction in the risk of nausea but not vomiting in the P6 acupoint stimulation 
group compared with the antiemetic group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98; RR 0.92, 
95% CI 0.65 to 1.29 respectively). The side effects associated with P6 acupoint 
stimulation were minor. There was some evidence of asymmetry of the funnel plot. 
Researchers concluded this review supports the use of P6 acupoint stimulation in 
patients without antiemetic prophylaxis. Compared with antiemetic prophylaxis, 
P6 acupoint stimulation seems to reduce the risk of nausea but not vomiting. This Month's
