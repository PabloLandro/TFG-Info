One of our favorites is the natural antibiotic, garlic!  If you catch the symptoms quick enough, some minced garlic coated with honey and swallowed with water, is a great natural healer.  Just don’t plan on having any close interactions with others for a while! Reply Tory January 10, 2011 at 9:48 am Our favorite is to use tea and honey.  It helps to soothe, but typically we use Hylands.  We love that it’s natural and it’s available at most natural markets.  Thanks for the opportunity! Reply Steph January 10, 2011 at 10:09 am A few natural home remedies we use for treating cold symptoms are garlic, drinking  hot liquids and inhaling steam. Reply Jupiter January 10, 2011 at 10:46 am I love Hyland’s products. great giveaway! My go-to remedies for cold & flu are ginger-lemon tea with honey, garlic & vitamin C. I’m also a fan of chest rubs. The one I use most has eucalyptus,peppermint,lavendar,sage,thyme and cyprus. Reply Julie Gibson January 10, 2011 at 11:35 am Honey and Lemon tea.  My girls love it! Reply Tracy January 10, 2011 at 12:44 pm I’ve been using Hyland’s products for my family for over 11 years and love them.  To prevent/treat colds & flu I keep up Vitamin D levels; drink lots of water; make homemade soups; mince raw garlic and put in a spoonful of raw honey; teas made with minced ginger, fresh lemon juice and honey. Reply Debbie G January 10, 2011 at 12:55 pm Great giveaway!   My favorite home remedies are Hot Tea with honey and soup made with lots of garlic. Reply susan varney January 10, 2011 at 1:05 pm we put honey and lemon in water and heat it up and breathe it in mverno@roadrunner.com Reply Laura January 10, 2011 at 1:32 pm We love the cold and cough formula!  The kids think it tastes great as well, which makes getting remedies in them alot easier! Reply Erinne January 10, 2011 at 1:50 pm Awesome giveaway! We just run the humidifier a lot, sometimes with eucalyptis oil in it. The NoseFrida snot sucker is great, too. Reply Andra Lelbret-Hogle January 10, 2011 at 2:24 pm We drink homemade ginger-lemon-honey tea, take Elderberry syrup and Astragalus tincture to boost immunity. Also mustard chest packs and mustard foot baths are greatly used for  colds. Reply Darcy January 10, 2011 at 2:26 pm I like to use tea and honey.  Perfect for sore throats! Reply Shannon Baas January 10, 2011 at 5:12 pm chicken noodle soup. Reply Holly January 10, 2011 at 5:47 pm Honey and lemon tea with plenty of rest! Reply Teegan Briggs January 10, 2011 at 7:37 pm The second I feel sickness coming on, I start chugging orange juice (and I mean, about 1/2 gallon or more per day)!  I swear it lessens the severity and the length of whatever bug is about to hit! Reply Mary January 10, 2011 at 8:38 pm I’m drinking lemon honey tea right now!  But my 1st line of defense is Hylands Aconitum Napellus.  It works best taken the first 24-36 hours of a cold/etc. starting.  My kids love any Hylands homeopathic.   They call it “aahh medicine” as they have to open wide and say “aahh” when I give it to them. Reply Carrie @ Rhubarb Sky January 10, 2011 at 9:13 pm Oh we love the hylands stuff too.  We’re big fans of vitamin C and echinacea around here. Reply Carla January 10, 2011 at 9:26 pm I really like hot water with raw honey and cinnamon.  I also load up on zinc and vitamin C.  My husband has been sick all week, and I am pretty much clear of symptoms so far!! Reply tiffany lane January 10, 2011 at 10:46 pm When I notice my kids getting sick. I load them down with Vit. C  and make sure they rest… Reply Laura aka Simply Green January 11, 2011 at 4:06 am My favourite natural homeopathic remedies have been mentioned, but I’ll stick them all together here: Hot water with a slice of lemon and some honey (for sore throat/mild congestion) Warm/hot bath (for fever control) Humidifier (at night, for mucous-y congestion) Drink lots of water Increase vitamin C and D consumption That about sums up the primary ways we fight illness around my house. Thanks for the great giveaway opportunity. Reply Denise B. January 11, 2011 at 6:51 am Lots of soup and orange juice. Reply Autumn January 11, 2011 at 7:40 am A steamy bathroom helps a lot of issues. Reply traci January 11, 2011 at 7:41 am Glad to hear about Hyland’s.  Our kids are still young enough we haven’t had to deal with too much, but the humidifier and saline spray have been fantastic. Reply Mama Eva January 11, 2011 at 7:58 am Raw garlic to chase away infections, Lemon/ginger/honey tea for sore throats and colds, homemade chicken stock and soup during a cold, and cod liver oil with butter oil daily.  We have used a number of Hyland’s remedies as well, most notably the teething tablets for my babies Reply Christine January 11, 2011 at 8:28 am We make Thyme tea with honey and take extra vitamin C and Echinacea.   We’ve also used Hyland’s Sniffles -n- Sneezes already this month! Reply Courtney S January 11, 2011 at 11:14 am hot tea and honey. Reply Terra Jones January 11, 2011 at 11:55 am Garlic. Reply Suzanne Denys January 11, 2011 at 12:21 pm I push vitamin c.  I stock up on oranges, clementines and/or tangerines.  We also use Ricola for sore/dry throats and tea with honey/lemon. I never knew Hyland made these products. They will replace current ones I use if I can find them. Thanks for posting this contest. Reply Jessica T. January 11, 2011 at 12:55 pm Garlic honey!  Roughly chop several heads of peeled garlic and simmer for a couple minutes in some raw honey.  Let cool and take by the spoonful (but be careful taking it on an empty stomach). Reply anna t. January 11, 2011 at 3:17 pm I drink lots of honey & lemon in tea,  fresh juices and eat chicken noodle soup. Reply alison james January 11, 2011 at 6:35 pm Hyland’s Cough and cold and when I cannot get this I use oscillo Reply trisha January 11, 2011 at 9:06 pm the BRAT diet. banana/rice/applsesauce/toast Reply Monique Rizzo January 12, 2011 at 2:28 pm I like good old chicken soup for colds. Thanks for the chance. mogrill@comcast.net Reply Rose January 13, 2011 at 1:31 pm Thanks for all advice in the comments! Reply Steph January 14, 2011 at 5:05 pm Heat.  For cold & flu, heat seems to go a long way… hot bath, steam, broth/tea, bundle up and rest. Reply Tricia Andrews January 15, 2011 at 8:30 am We do equal parts honey and lemon juice to relieve coughing for our daughter. We also use eucalyptis and peppermint essential oils to help open up her sinuses (and mine!) when we are stuffy. Reply Denise J January 15, 2011 at 3:35 pm Chamomile tea.  Also, black tea with honey and lemon in it. Reply Summer January 15, 2011 at 3:45 pm I don’t if this is considered a remedy but I always make sure I give my kids a warm bath when they are sick to help relieve some congestion. I also wipe their noses with a warm washcloth. Reply cindy January 15, 2011 at 9:32 pm I like to put minced garlic in our socks at night when something feels like it is brewing. I think it really helps reduce or even remove the symptoms!! Reply shawna January 16, 2011 at 10:46 am We do tea and honey and steam. Reply Lori Z. January 16, 2011 at 3:27 pm Steam and the hangover shower bar from LUSH. The mix of steam and herbs helps my son breathe well. Echinacea tea is good too. Reply Danielle M January 16, 2011 at 4:22 pm I like to make an elderberry syrup in the winter months. Reply Ai January 16, 2011 at 8:28 pm My favorite remedies for cold and flu are taking homeopathics and probiotics, drinking herbal teas and vegetable broth, and chewing on a licorice root (I don’t mean the candy). I also like to spray the rooms with Arbor Oil (eucalyptus). Reply Tammy Greer January 17, 2011 at 1:04 am We drink hot tea with lemon and honey. LuckyTJG@cs.com Reply anash January 17, 2011 at 4:14 am my remedy would be raw honey daily- a tablespoon daily Reply kathy pease January 17, 2011 at 8:29 am old fashioned chicken soup would be my choice Reply lilshuga2001 January 17, 2011 at 10:24 am chicken soup and using a vaporizer Reply Jane H January 17, 2011 at 10:27 am For me it’s hot tea and lemon for my hubby the lemon is replaced with brandy. Thanks so much for the opportunity to win. Reply sarah January 17, 2011 at 11:46 am Nothing like homemade chicken soup to ease cold symptoms. For a cough, my grandmother always gave us teaspoons of honey and lemon juice. Reply Saebbe Reidhead January 17, 2011 at 1:08 pm Our favorite homeopathic remedy is Arnica for bumps and bruises. We have 2 really wild kids who are ALWAYS getting hurt. We go through lots of arnica. I also love teething tabs. My kids only get sick once a year is that so I’ve never tried homeopathic cold remedys. Reply paige jagan January 17, 2011 at 4:05 pm we actually rely 100% on hylands everything, started with my oldest who we used the teething tablets on when he was a baby, other than hylands orange juice is great for vitamin c to keep the cold and flu away!

Reply Victoria November 9, 2011 at 9:27 am Our favorite natural remedies would be Echinacea with vitamin C, Elderberry syrup and hylands cold and cough syrup (which my kids love) … Thanks Hylands Reply Andra November 10, 2011 at 2:28 am Our commonly used supplements for cold are vitamin c with zinc, Astragalus and Elderberry syrup.
