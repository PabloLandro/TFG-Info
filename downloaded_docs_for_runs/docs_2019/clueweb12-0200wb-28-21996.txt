Red Flags warn us about possible serious spinal problems, yellow flags warn us about unhelpful beliefs that may lead to a poor outcome with treatment for chronic back pain If you are fearful of movement or worried that  you have a serious spinal problem go and talk to someone about it to put your  mind at rest.
