Prevention 19/07/2011 Antiretroviral prevention methods 'not in competition' with each other Antiretroviral prevention methods are not in competition, and policy makers and providers need to start to thinking about how antiretrovirals, pre-exposure prophylaxis and microbicides will be provided as part of a combination prevention package – and who will benefit most from each method.
