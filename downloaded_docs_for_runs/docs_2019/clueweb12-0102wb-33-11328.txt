        Stomach Bypass Types of Bariatric Operations Weight Loss Surgery Advice If you are morbidly obese and want to 
        find a weight loss clinic or surgeon in North Carolina, in order to discuss gastric bypass, lap-band or gastroplasty 
        surgeries, please see details in center panel. Bariatric Surgeons in North Carolina Gastric surgery to reduce morbid obesity is becoming an effective option 
        in the campaign to assist patients to reduce their weight and improve 
        weight-related health conditions. However, whether you choose stomach 
        stapling, roux-en-y bypass or adjustable gastric banding like lap-band, 
        you should realise that none of these bariatric operations will succeed 
        in the long-term unless you follow the necessary proper post-operative 
        diet and exercise rules. Due to the restrictive nature of the typical diet after surgery , be sure 
        to ask your weight loss surgeon about post-operative patient support groups 
        and online help services. Finally, before deciding on any type of bariatric operation, consult 
        your physician about all your options, including non-surgical weight reduction 
        methods. Clinics in North
