varicose ulcer wiki - Varicose Veins: Causes & Prevention varicose ulcer wiki - Varicose Veins: Causes & Prevention Varicose Veins: Causes & Prevention Varicose veins are those swollen veins right under the skin. They can be dark purple or blue-ish and look twisted, ropey and bulging - but what exactly causes them - and is there anything that can be done to prevent them? Prevention:          Unfortunately there are no medically proven ways to completely prevent varicose vein s - which means there is no miracle cream or pill you can use that will make them disappear. However, vein specialists say relieving pressure on the veins, as well as promoting muscle strength, helps to keep the blood flowing in the right direction. Exercising, losing weight, elevating your legs when resting, and not crossing them when sitting all have potential benefits. Wearing loose clothing and avoiding long periods of sitting or standing are also thought to be helpful. High-heeled shoes are a no-no as they don't allow the calf muscles to fully contract.

Varicose Vein Causes:        They form when valves in the veins that are supposed to direct blood flow towards your heart stop working correctly and, as a result, blood pools in the veins - causing them to enlarge. Normally these one-way valves work against gravity to direct blood towards the heart. When they become weakened or damaged and don't close properly the blood may start to flow backward - this is known as Venous Insufficiency or Venous Reflux. When veins near the surface of your skin can't handle the excess blood and pressure they engorge and turn into varicose vein s. Heredity, obesity, pregnancy, age trauma and standing or sitting for long periods of time all have the potential to cause damage to the one-way valves (and therefore cause varicose veins) There are many varieties of Prevent Varicose Veins found today.
