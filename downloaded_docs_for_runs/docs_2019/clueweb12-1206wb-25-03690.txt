Vitamin D (VD), is a steroid hormone with multiple functions in the central nervous system (CNS), producing numerous physiological effects mediated by its receptor (VDR). Clinical and experimental studies have shown a link between VD dysfunction and epilepsy . Along these lines, the purpose of our work was to analyze the relative expression of VDR mRNA in the hippocampal formation of rats during the three periods of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy . Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: (1) control group; rats that received saline 0.9%, i.p. and were killed 7 days after its administration (CTRL, n=8), (2) SE group; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 4h after SE (SE, n=8), (3) Silent group--7 days; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 7 days after SE (SIL 7d, n=8), (4) Silent group--14 days; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 14 days after SE (SIL 14d, n=8), (5) Chronic group; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 60 days after the first spontaneous seizure, (chronic, n=8). The relative expression of VDR mRNA was determined by real-time PCR. Our results showed an increase of the relative expression of VDR mRNA in the SIL 7 days, SIL 14 days and Chronic groups, respectively (0.060+/-0.024; 0.052+/-0.035; 0.085+/-0.055) when compared with the CTRL and SE groups (0.019+/-0.017; 0.019+/-0.025). These data suggest the VDR as a possible candidate participating in the epileptogenesis process of the pilocarpine model of epilepsy . Published 6 June 2008 in Brain Res Bull , 76(5): 480-4.
