              Urinary Tract Infections: Stop the Suffering! Although VÄXA’s natural 
              methods and homeopathic solutions can prevent and relieve urinary 
              tract infections (bladder infections, “cystitis”), we 
              shouldn’t allow urinary tract infections to linger as they 
              could spread to the kidneys (pyelonephritis), and we don’t 
              want to mess with our kidneys. Prescription antibiotics may be 
              needed for bacteria-caused urinary tract infections if there are 
              signs that infection has spread to the kidneys: Persistent stabbing pains or pounding aches 
                  in lower back Fever or sweats Sudden fatigue or exhaustion If this happens during urinary tract infections, 
              take antibiotics. Finish prescription as directed. Preventing Urinary Tract 
              Infections: 1. Avoid Bacteria in the Urinary 
              Tract and Vaginal Area: When urinating, be sure to thoroughly finish. 
                  Sometimes in a hurry, women tend to clench some back. Never “hold in” for a long time. Wipe from front to back after bowel movements, 
                  not toward the vagina. E. coli from feces can easily enter. Wear comfortable-fitting 100% cotton underwear. 
                  Avoid snug nylons or silks, tights and panty hose whenever possible 
                  - they build heat and moisture which invites bacteria. This 
                  goes for tight jeans too! If sexually active: Before and after intercourse, urinate and 
                    wash well. Avoid birth control spermicides with “non-oxynol 
                    9” in some diaphragm jellies, condoms and sponges – 
                    it irritates the bladder. 2. Build Immunities with Daily Nutrition 
              and Supplements: Take daily vitamins, minerals and other supplements. 
                  See the “ Women’s 
                  Daily Needs ” page Drink lots of water. At LEAST eight 8 oz. 
                  glasses per day. Limit carbonated sodas, coffee and tea (carbonation 
                  and acid are both harmful). Drink some sugar-free cranberry juice each 
                  week or take cranberry supplements (keeps bacteria away from 
                  bladder walls). Eat a sugar-free diet. Every time they’re 
                  eaten, sugary foods lower immunity about 1%, which can be cumulative! 3. Guard Your Kidneys, Bladder and pH Balance 
              (acidic/alkaline content): Douche seldom. It destroys good vaginal bacteria 
                  and messes with your pH balance. This encourages urinary tract 
                  infections. Resolving Simple Urinary 
              Tract Infections Naturally: For intense burning, drug store over-the-counter 
                  remedies work very quickly (but will not cure the infection). Restore pH balance with Buffer pH. Keep using VÄXA Kidney Formula. It contains 
                  the herb Uva Ursi, famous for natural antiseptic properties. Drink as much water as possible every hour, 
                  urinating frequently. Refrain completely from carbonated sodas, 
                  coffee, tea, sugars. Take cranberry supplements and the herbs 
                  garlic and pau d’arco (they’re naturally antibiotic 
                  and anti-inflammatory) in tablets or capsules - at least three 
                  times the recommended dosage spread throughout the day during 
                  an infection. If symptoms aren’t eliminated 
              within 72 hours, or they return soon, please see your doctor. Prescription 
              treatment may be necessary. Taking antibiotics for Urinary 
              Tract Infections or any other infection may result in yeast infection.
