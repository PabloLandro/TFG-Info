Hemorrhoids Symptoms And Treatment	 | Hemorrhoids - symptoms, diagnosis and treatments Hemorrhoids – symptoms, diagnosis and treatments Skip to content Home Privacy Policy ← Hemorrhoid Treatment Options Review Hemorrhoid Treatment At Home → Hemorrhoids Symptoms And Treatment Posted on December 11, 2011 by Marie Hemorrhoids (piles) are irritated and inflamed veins situated in the anus. If the piles are permanently affected, such as in chronic constipation, they increase and are gradually pushed out of the anus. There are many people who faced the same problem as I had. And one common issue we have in common is that this is one problem that we feel embarrassed with. Sad to say, there aren't many effective solutions out there in the market that can truly live up to their claims on effectively curing hemorrhoids . There are a couple of products which may be effective, but will likely burn a hole in your wallet. So what exactly is hemorrhoids or piles? What are the symptoms attached to it? Simply put, hemorrhoids is a lump that hangs outside the rectum. This lump is commonly due to over-straining while passing bowels, or in some cases with women, after their pregnancy. There can be some other causes, but these two are the most common. Hemorrhoids can be easily detected without the need for a doctor, or hospital visit. Most common signs of an internal hemorrhoid is bright red blood within your stool. You can see this on the toilet paper or within the toilet bowl. Other symptoms could include slight anal discomfort and/or a feeling of feeling full or bloated. During a medical examination for hemorrhoids, the patient must lie down so that rectum can be easily reached by the doctor. Sometimes he asks the parties to lay down on the side and legs (Sims' position). Or, the patient lies on his back and places his legs right and left. There is also a scenario, where the patient kneels on the examination table and stretches the buttocks in the air (knee-elbow position?. It is important that the posture is relaxed, so that the whole experience is not too unpleasant for the patient. Then, the doctor will feel and inspect the anal region. First, the physician examines the colon starting from the outside. He will be looking for such signs as inflammation, skin irritation, tearing and greatly enlarged hemorrhoids. Most doctors will also use an endoscope, to see the intestines, and inspect for any abnormalities such as lumps or scarring. If the doctor can make no definite diagnosis, then one can also get a detailed endoscopic examination, which requires an empty the bowel. This will obviously require a day or maybe two of fasting where the patient usually takes before a laxative, or, if an enema. For an endoscopy, the doctor can use various tools, depending on what he wants to see. Usually, they will use a proctoscope for the front areas of the anus. The device is a tube with a handle, 6-15 cm long. The opening of the front is beveled, sometimes located in the middle of a small window. Through the tube, the physician can push a lamp and other devices. This allows a proctoscope to extract tissue samples or deserted hemorrhoids. If this proctoscopy and rectoscopy provide no cause for the symptoms, the doctor may do a sigmoidoscopy. In this method he is able to see the bottom of the large intestine by introducing a flexible endoscope. The doctor enters a colonoscopy within the intestine, looking at the entire large intestine for the transition into the small intestine. This is done by a flexible hose, which sits at the head of a miniature camera. Additional tests may exclude fungi and allergies, and other possible infections. Remember, Hemorrhoids can be at worst relieved and possibly cured altogether. There are many treatments available, most of which only provide short term pain relief from the above symptoms but immediate attention must be made to your food intake and or diet plus an excercise campaign and this must be kept up with at all times because once you get rid of your hemorrhoids you do not want them to return. Always look for a natural solution and always take steps to prevent them happening in the first place. Apart from surgery, a natural hemorrhoid cure that acts as an anti -inflammatory has been proven to be most successful over time to treat, cure and remove hemorrhoids once and for all. What this does is to naturally calm,soothe and reduce the strained and swollen veins back to normal size thus relieving the pain, discomfort and irritation.

QUESTION: What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids ? And what causes hemorrhoids? And what are the treatments? ANSWER: Hemorrhoids symptoms are: - Bright red blood covering the stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. - Anal itching - Painful swelling or hard lump around the anus. Hemorrhoids are internal or external depends if they develop inside the passageway of the anus (internal) or around the anus (external). Since the skin is more sensitive, the external hemorrhoids are more painful than internal, unless we're talking about prolapse internal hemorrhoids , where the internal hemorrhoid prolapse (protrude) outside the anus and the pain is severe. Hemorrhoids don't just disappear by it self and bigger they are more problems they cause, so it is vital to treat them as soon as possible. It is also important to determine what the cause of hemorrhoids is. The most common cause is constipation. Other reasons are: significant overweight, pregnancy, overeating, acid/alkaline imbalance, vitamin B-6 deficiency, fatigue liver, genetically predisposition. Sitting or standing in one position for long periods of time can also contribute to development of hemorrhoids. Treatment options are: various creams, pills, medical injection, super freezing, tight rubber band placed around the base of each hemorrhoid, surgery or laser treatment. Whatever treatment you'll decide to do, remember to also treat the cause of your hemorrhoids, like take care of your digestion and regular soft bowel in case of constipation (fiber rich diet), if you're overweight - lose weight, in case of acid/alkaline imbalance pay attention by your food to eat food that through the digestion system is giving you proper acidity. You can buy a home test for acid/alkaline imbalance, if you don't want to visit your doctor. The vast majority of us are having low alkaline pH, due to improper nutrition. Unless you're having constipation (this you can know by yourself), before doing experiments and try to guess what is the cause of your hemorrhoids, go visit your doctor, make all proper test and than decide for the treatment of hemorrhoids including changing of your diet, if necessary. QUESTION: what are the common symptoms of hemorrhoids ?, and what are the possible treatments?, pls help? ANSWER: What are hemorrhoids? The term hemorrhoids refers to a condition in which the veins around the anus or lower rectum are swollen and inflamed. Hemorrhoids may result from straining to move stool. Other contributing factors include pregnancy, aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, and anal intercourse. Hemorrhoids are either inside the anus (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids? Many anorectal problems, including fissures, fistulae, abscesses, or irritation and itching (pruritus ani), have similar symptoms and are incorrectly referred to as hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids usually are not dangerous or life threatening. In most cases, hemorrhoidal symptoms will go away within a few days. Although many people have hemorrhoids, not all experience symptoms. The most common symptom of internal hemorrhoids is bright red blood covering the stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. However, an internal hemorrhoid may protrude through the anus outside the body, becoming irritated and painful. This is known as a protruding hemorrhoid. Symptoms of external hemorrhoids may include painful swelling or a hard lump around the anus that results when a blood clot forms. This condition is known as a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. In addition, excessive straining, rubbing, or cleaning around the anus may cause irritation with bleeding and/or itching, which may produce a vicious cycle of symptoms. Draining mucus may also cause itching. How common are hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids are very common in both men and women. About half of the population have hemorrhoids by age 50. Hemorrhoids are also common among pregnant women. The pressure of the fetus in the abdomen, as well as hormonal changes, cause the hemorrhoidal vessels to enlarge. These vessels are also placed under severe pressure during childbirth. For most women, however, hemorrhoids caused by pregnancy are a temporary problem. How are hemorrhoids diagnosed? A thorough evaluation and proper diagnosis by the doctor is important any time bleeding from the rectum or blood in the stool occurs. Bleeding may also be a symptom of other digestive diseases, including colorectal cancer. The doctor will examine the anus and rectum to look for swollen blood vessels that indicate hemorrhoids and will also perform a digital rectal exam with a gloved, lubricated finger to feel for abnormalities. Closer evaluation of the rectum for hemorrhoids requires an exam with an anoscope, a hollow, lighted tube useful for viewing internal hemorrhoids, or a proctoscope, useful for more completely examining the entire rectum. To rule out other causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, the doctor may examine the rectum and lower colon (sigmoid) with sigmoidoscopy or the entire colon with colonoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are diagnostic procedures that also involve the use of lighted, flexible tubes inserted through the rectum. What is the treatment? Medical treatment of hemorrhoids is aimed initially at relieving symptoms. Measures to reduce symptoms include tub baths several times a day in plain, warm water for about 10 minutes application of a hemorroidal cream or suppository to the affected area for a limited time Illustration reprinted with permission from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. Artist: Russell K. Pearl, M.D. Preventing the recurrence of hemorrhoids will require relieving the pressure and straining of constipation. Doctors will often recommend increasing fiber and fluids in the diet. Eating the right amount of fiber and drinking six to eight glasses of fluid (not alcohol) result in softer, bulkier stools. A softer stool makes emptying the bowels easier and lessens the pressure on hemorrhoids caused by straining. Eliminating straining also helps prevent the hemorrhoids from protruding. Good sources of fiber are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. In addition, doctors may suggest a bulk stool softener or a fiber supplement such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel). In some cases, hemorrhoids must be treated endoscopically or surgically. These methods are used to shrink and destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue. The doctor will perform the procedure during an office or hospital visit. A number of methods may be used to remove or reduce the size of internal hemorrhoids. These techniques include Rubber band ligation. A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days. Sclerotherapy. A chemical solution is injected around the blood vessel to shrink the hemorrhoid. Infrared coagulation. A special device is used to burn hemorrhoidal tissue. Hemorrhoidectomy. Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoids may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy. How are hemorrhoids prevented? The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep stools soft so they pass easily, thus decreasing pressure and straining, and to empty bowels as soon as possible after the urge occurs. Exercise, including walking, and increased fiber in the diet help reduce constipation and straining by producing stools that are softer and easier to pass.
