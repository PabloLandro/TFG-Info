Needless to say, there are a lot of people looking for solutions for that burning question: “How to relieve back pain?” There are many different forms of back pain-relief solutions out there, however most of the solutions require some type of invasive procedure, mechanical traction, or surgery. Inversion Therapy Inversion therapy has been widely recognized as one of the leading forms of back pain treatment for the past 30 years. Using an inversion table uses a gentle, passive form of decompression that relaxes the muscles in the spine, relieves pressure on all the weight bearing joints in your body, and relaxes tense muscles. This progressive form of  traction allows the joints and discs in your back to be decompressed by the same weight that compresses it while upright. To understand how to relieve back pain, you must first understand what is truly causing the pain and discomfort. The discs in your back are made up of soft tissue full of fluid and nutrients, much like small sponges, acting like shock absorbers for your spine. When you go through normal daily activities such as walking, running, bending over, exercising, or even sitting down, these sponge-like discs begin to expel fluid and nutrients, thus decreasing their ability to absorb gravity-induced compression on the spine. The average person loses two inches of height by the time he reaches seventy years old, and gravity-induced compression is the culprit. To get a better understanding of the daily impact of compression, you can just measure your height and waistline in the morning, then again right before you go to bed. The average person loses a half-inch to three quarters of an inch of height throughout the day! The compression put on the weight-bearing joints causes the nutrients inside the soft tissue of the discs to be expelled. Daily height loss is also evidenced in your increased waistline - gravity compresses the body throughout the day causing your body mass to shift toward your waist. How To Relieve Back Pain The Natural Way Teeter Hang Ups has been providing inversion therapy as an answer to the question of how to relieve back pain for over 30 years now. Using a Teeter inversion table can help reduce back pain in four main ways: rehydrating the discs, reducing nerve pressure, realigning the spine, and relaxing tense muscles. There have been numerous studies showing the overwhelming effects of a Teeter on how to relieve back pain. These studies have noted that using a Teeter helped in many ways such as: 89% of patients who were unable to work due to back pain were able to return to work after using inversion. Inversion reduced the need for sciatica back surgery. Inverted traction is more effective than mechanical traction machines found in doctor’s offices. Inversion reduces EMG activity – an indicator of muscle pain. Rhythmic traction such as inversion can lower blood pressure.
