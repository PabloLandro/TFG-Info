They demand more from their bodies and must compensate with the right nutrients from foods and supplements to optimize performance and recovery. The more intense the exercise or sport, the greater the body's nutrient needs. To keep your body performing optimally, make sure that you are getting adequate amounts of these 10 essential nutrients: 1. Calcium - In a recent survey of 10,000 male and female athletes ages seven to 50, fewer than half consumed 1,000 mg of calcium daily. The recommended dietary intake ranges from 1,000 mg to 1,500 mg daily. Osteoporosis is a threat to women who do not consume adequate calcium, and research shows that male endurance athletes can experience testosterone deficits that can cause osteoporosis in cases of calcium deficiency. 2. Iron - Athletes who train for six or more hours per week could be subject to low iron levels, and in severe cases even anemia. Side effects of low iron stores are increased fatigue and reduced V02max. Athletes use iron stores more quickly than sedentary persons. Sports nutrition expert Dr. Michael Colgan recommends that athletes get 20-25 mg of iron per day. Studies show that supplementation at levels higher than 20-25 mg are not beneficial and can be toxic. 3. Magnesium - Low magnesium levels can contribute to early fatigue, nausea, and muscle cramps. Athletes lose magnesium through sweat and urine. This, combined with the fact that modern day diets are often low in magnesium, generally leads to the need for magnesium supplementation. Recommended daily intake for endurance athletes is 500 to 800 mg daily. 4. Potassium - This element is rapidly lost during exercise at the rate of approximately 200 mg/kg of weight lost during exercise. Potassium supplementation after short events (less than 2 hours) and during and after long events is warranted, at the rate of 435 mg per hour of exercise, not to exceed 5 grams. Many energy drinks and recovery drinks contain supplemental potassium. 5. Selenium - Research shows selenium benefits athletes' immune function and helps repair cellular damage. Supplementation with 200 mcg of selenium is safe and warranted for endurance athletes. 6. Sodium - This element helps cells retain water, prevents dehydration, and enables the generation of ATP. For events lasting longer than 5 hours, especially in hot weather, dangerously low sodium (hyponatremia) is a real concern. During this type of exercise, athletes should aim for 100 to 300 mg of sodium per hour. Most energy drinks supply supplemental sodium. SUCCEED! electrolyte caps are a good source of supplemental sodium for longer events. 7. Zinc - This mineral aids in post exercise tissue repair. Both male and female athletes have lower serum zinc levels compared to sedentary individuals. Reduced zinc levels lead to fatigue and decreased endurance. Athletes should take in 30-60 mg of zinc daily. 8. Vitamin E - Research shows athletes have less cellular damage when they ingest more vitamin E. The amount of vitamin E necessary to benefit athletes is not obtainable through diet alone. Endurance athletes should take in 400-1200 I.U. of vitamin E per day. 9. Protein - Recent studies indicate that protein needs increase during strenuous activity. Endurance athletes primarily use protein for maintaining aerobic metabolism, and for tissue repair. Inadequate protein intake leads to reduced ability to recover from exercise, and can impair wound healing. Researchers recommend endurance athletes eat 1.2 g/kg to 1.4 g/kg of body weight per day of protein. For a 155 lb. person this amounts to 85-100 grams per day. 10. Glutamine - This amino acid helps fuel the immune system. Prolonged exercise consistently lowers glutamine levels, reducing the effectiveness of the immune system. Oral glutamine replacement after exercise has been shown to lower risk of infection in supplemented athletes. Recommended supplementation is from 2-5 grams per day.
