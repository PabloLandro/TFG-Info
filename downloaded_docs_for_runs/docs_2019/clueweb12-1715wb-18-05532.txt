I ended up with a pretty nasty hole in my knee from the fight and the infection became bad enough I needed an antibiotic. I have decided I don’t want to take any more antibiotics so I decided to do some research online. I found that honey is a natural antibiotic and has been used for centuries to heal wounds and infections. I’d prefer any form of natural healing over prescrioption drugs so that sounded just like what I wanted and lucky for me I had a bottle of pure Jamaican honey to pour over my wounds. The pictures here are the 3rd daily treatment and it looks much better than it did before the honey treatments. The honey cleared up the horrible infection in 4 days and the wound went on to heal just fine. The pics below are big and show how nasty the wound was. It’s gross so be warned. They are a part of my collection of scars received in Jamaica.
