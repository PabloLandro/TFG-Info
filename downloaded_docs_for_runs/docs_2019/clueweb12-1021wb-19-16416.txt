However, when people smoke, it does do some really bad things to       their body, and once they stop smoking, the body will start to recover       almost immediately.  This might produce some side effects. Here, I am presenting a list of the most common side effects ... Concentration Some smokers report that they have difficulty concentrating after they       stop smoking.  This is due to a psychological phenomena known as cognitive dissonance, and is actually nothing to do with nicotine.. Constipation For a short while after stopping smoking, you may                                 find that your bowel movements lessen, as the                                 nicotine is no longer stimulating the intestines.  Good old-fashioned fibre should help, as will                                 drinking plenty of water, and getting some                                 exercise. Coughing                                 and clearing of the throat Inevitably, despite the                                 bodies best efforts, most of the toxins, including                                 the tar present in the cigarette smoke still reach the lungs while you are smoking, and begin                                 to build up.  Over time, the tar in the lungs                                 block the alveoli, and the function of the lung is                                 damaged. But, after                                 you've given up the habit, the lungs seem to seize their new                                 opportunity to clear themselves of as much of this                                 dirt and material, as they can, and in the first                                 few days after you stop smoking, your ‘smokers                                 cough’ may even increase.  This will soon pass. Cravings                                 after stopping smoking Many of the cravings that new ex-smokers                                 experience, are due to the change of habit that                                 stopping smoking inevitably entails, and not just                                 to the addictive nature of the nicotine present in                                 the cigarette. For many                                 people, smoking will have been a habit for years,                                 maybe even for a large majority of their life.  If                                 someone was to stop doing ANYTHING that they have                                 been doing as many as 20 to 40 times a day, every                                 day, for most of their lives, they would find it                                 difficult, no matter what it was, and there’s                                 certainly no reason to think that smoking is any                                 different. The phenomena                                 is called ‘cognitive dissonance’, and it basically                                 means that your brain thinks that it should be                                 doing something that it isn’t… purely through                                 habit.  This will peak after about two to three                                 days, and will tail off from there. Stick with it                                 in the knowledge that this is a passing phase.                                  After a couple of weeks, this will probably only                                 reoccur on rare occasions. Be aware though, that                                 if you give in to your craving, you will have to                                 start the whole process over again from the start!
