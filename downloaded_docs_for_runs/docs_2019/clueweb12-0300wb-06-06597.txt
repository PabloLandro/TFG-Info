Frequently Asked Questions About Femtones Vaginal Weight Cones Here are some frequently asked questions
about Femtone Vaginal Weights: What are Femtone Vaginal Weights? Femtones are a set of 5 vaginal cones
of varying weights. These vaginal cones are designed to be used
to assist a woman with Kegel exercises. Kegel exercises are designed
to improve the tone of the pelvic floor muscle and provide improvements
to problems of incontinence and sexual function. Why would I want to improve the tone
of my pelvic floor muscle? After childbirth some women notice a
difference in the condition of the pelvic area. 1 in 4 women will
suffer from some for of incontinence related to pelvic floor condition.
This incontinence is described as the inability to hold your urine
until a convenient time. Improving the tone of the pelvic floor
muscle can restore the ability to hold your urine when you cough,
sneeze, laugh, or strain. Are there other reasons to improve
the tone of my pelvic floor muscle? Yes. Some women find that improving
the tone of the pelvic floor muscle restores lost sensation to
their lovemaking. Sometimes a degree of sensation is lost after
childbirth. Femtones vaginal cones can restore some of this lost
sensation by improving the muscular development of the pelvic
floor. How long does it take to see results
from using Femtones? Typically, patients will see results
after 3 months of using Femtones. Some patients notice a reduction
in leakage after 6 weeks or so. I am ** years old, are Femtones for
me? Women as young as 30 and as old as 70
have problems with stress related incontinence. Stress related
incontinence is described as the inability to hold your urine
when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or strain. Femtones can help these
women by identifying and strengthening these muscles. Why should I use Femtones and not
just try Kegel exercises on my own? This is an excellent question. Some
patients have great results with just trying Kegel exercises on
their own. Others have trouble determining if they are exercising
their pelvic floor muscle or their abdominal muscle while attempting
Kegel exercises. When you use Femtones properly they will travel
inward due to the contraction of the pelvic floor. If you contract
you abdominal muscles, the Femtone weight will travel in the opposite
direction letting you know that you should change your form. Femtones
also come in five different weights so that you can exercise with
varying levels of resistance. What are the five weights? We have been asked this one. There are
not specific weights, they are just numbered. #1 is the lightest,
number 5 is the heaviest. They are all the same size. What are femtones made of? The vaginal cones are made from a special combination of alloys surrounded by a double welded plastic case.
They are smooth with a plastic coated retrieval cord. What comes with the Femtones weights? Included are the five Femtone weights,
and a case to hold them.  We have tried to compensate for a lack of instructions with this web page. Why are Femtones expensive? Femtones are built to the strict requirements
of medical equipment. These items are sold under review
of the FDA and have been approved as medical equipment. They are
made with the finest materials available and are made in limited
quantities. Are Femtones available in a store
near me? We are not certain of every other retailer
of these items, we do know that there are not many retailers that
currently carry this product. Your OB/GYN might know of a local business that sells them. Many Gynecologists
send their patients to us to purchase Femtones. Click here to see a short video that may answer any other questions about Femtone Vaginal Weights.
