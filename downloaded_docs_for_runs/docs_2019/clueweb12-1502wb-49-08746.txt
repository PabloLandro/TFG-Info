Indeed, research suggests                 that acupuncture activates the homeostatic mechanism, modulating                 various physiological functions in either direction as necessary                 to achieve balance. With regards to the immune system, it has been                 observed that acupuncture can both stimulate the immune mechanism                 (e.g. to treat AIDS) (Chen et al 1992) and suppress the immune system                 (e.g. in the management of rhinitis, asthma or eczema) (see sections                 on EAR NOSE AND THROAT and DERMATOLOGY conditions above). Acupuncture appears                 to have the potential to modulate the immune system: it releases                 ß-endorphin from the pituitary in association with ACTH, and                 has been shown to modulate the sympathetic nervous system via the                 hypothalamus and at various other levels. Acupuncture influences                 specific and nonspecific cellular and humoral immunities. It activates                 cell proliferation, including blood, reticuloendothelial, and traumatized                 cells and activates leucocytosis, microbicidal activity, antibodies,                 globulin, complement, and interferon. The onset of a response                 to acupuncture is often delayed by 12 to 24 hours and lasts for                 7 days or longer. This time scale appears to be more like that of                 an immune response than that
