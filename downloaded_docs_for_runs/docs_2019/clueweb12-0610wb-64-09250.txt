interactions Food
interactions Interactions summary References Valproic acid, divalproex sodium, and sodium valproate are closely related drugs used to
control (prevent) seizures in people with epilepsy . Interactions with Dietary Supplements Antioxidants On the basis of the biochemical actions of valproic acid, it has been suggested that people
taking valproic acid should make sure they have adequate intakes of vitamin E and selenium . 1 The importance of supplementation with either nutrient has not yet
been tested, however. Biotin Several controlled studies have shown that long-term anticonvulsant treatment decreases blood
levels of biotin. 2 3 4 5 In children, a deficiency
of biotin can lead to withdrawn behavior and a delay in mental development. Adults with low
biotin levels might experience a loss of appetite, feelings of discomfort or uneasiness,
mental depression , or hallucinations. To avoid side
effects, individuals taking anticonvulsants should supplement with biotin either alone or as
part of a multivitamin . Calcium Individuals on long-term multiple anticonvulsant therapy may develop below-normal blood levels
of calcium, which may be related to drug-induced vitamin D deficiency. 6 Two infants born to women taking high doses of phenytoin and phenobarbital while pregnant developed jitteriness and tetany
(a syndrome characterized by muscle twitches), cramps, and spasms that can be caused by
calcium deficiency during the first two weeks of life. 7 Controlled research is
needed to determine whether pregnant women who are
taking anticonvulsant medications should supplement with additional amounts of calcium and
vitamin D. Carnitine Valproic acid causes depletion of carnitine in children, 8 and blood carnitine
levels are often low in people taking valproic acid for long periods of time. While there have
been several case reports of valproic acid-related carnitine deficiency causing abdominal pain
in children, there is controversy about the need for carnitine supplements in children taking
valproic acid. 9 10 11 Complete disappearance of severe valproic acid-induced abdominal pain was achieved in one
child with intractable epilepsy immediately following the introduction of 300 mg per day of L-carnitine . 12 Carnitine supplementation (50 mg
per 2.2 pounds of body weight) has protected children from valproic acid-induced increases in
blood ammonia levels in some research, 13 though other published work has questioned
whether the depletion of carnitine and the increase in blood ammonia levels (both caused by
valproic acid) are actually related to each other. 14 This last report found that
the depletion of carnitine was significantly more severe when epileptics were taking valproic
acid together with other anti-seizure medications. A double-blind, crossover study found that
carnitine supplementation (100 mg per 2.2 pounds of body weight) was no more effective than
placebo in improving the sense of well-being in children treated with valproic
acid. 15 To date, the question of whether carnitine supplementation is beneficial
for people taking valproic acid remains unresolved. 16 However, a panel of pediatric
neurologists and experts on L-carnitine supplementation strongly recommended oral L-carnitine
supplementation for all infants and children taking valproic acid, as well as for adults with
carnitine deficiency syndromes, people with valproic acid-induced liver and kidney toxicity,
people on kidney dialysis, and premature infants on total parenteral nutrition (intravenous
feeding). The panel recommended an amount of 100 mg per 2.2 pounds of body weight per day, up
to a maximum of 2 grams per day. 17 Copper and Zinc In various studies of children treated with valproic acid for epilepsy compared with control groups, serum zinc levels
remained normal 18 19 or decreased, 20 serum copper levels
remained normal 21 22 or decreased, 23 and red blood cell zinc
levels were decreased. 24 The importance of these changes and how frequently they
occur remain unclear. Folic acid Several studies have shown that multiple anticonvulsant therapy reduces blood levels of folic
acid and dramatically increases homocysteine levels. 25 26 27 Homocysteine, a potential marker for folic
acid deficiency, is a compound used experimentally to induce seizures and is associated with atherosclerosis . One preliminary study showed that pregnant women who
use anticonvulsant drugs without folic acid supplementation have an increased risk of having a
child with birth defects , such as heart defects,
cleft lip and palate, neural tube defects, and skeletal abnormalities. However,
supplementation with folic acid greatly reduces the risk. 28 Consequently, some
healthcare practitioners recommend that women taking multiple anticonvulsant drugs supplement
with 5 mg of folic acid daily, for three months prior to conception and during the first
trimester, to prevent folic acid deficiency-induced birth defects. 29 Other
practitioners suggest that 1 mg or less of folic acid each day is sufficient to prevent
deficiency during pregnancy. 30 One well-controlled study showed that adding folic acid to multiple anticonvulsant therapy
resulted in reduced seizure frequency. 31 In addition, three infants with seizures
who were unresponsive to medication experienced immediate relief following supplementation
with the active form of folic acid. 32 Despite the apparent beneficial effects, some studies have indicated that as little as 0.8
mg of folic acid taken daily can increase the frequency and/or severity of
seizures. 33 34 35 36 However, a recent controlled
study showed that both healthy and epileptic women taking less than 1 mg of folic acid per day
had no increased risk for seizures. 37 Until more is known about the risks and
benefits of folic acid, individuals taking multiple anticonvulsant drugs should consult with
their healthcare practitioner before supplementing with folic acid. In addition, pregnant
women or women who might become pregnant while taking anticonvulsant drugs should discuss
folic acid supplementation with their practitioner. Vitamin A Anticonvulsant drugs can occasionally cause birth
defects when taken by pregnant women, and their
toxicity might be related to low blood levels of vitamin A. One controlled study showed that
taking multiple anticonvulsant drugs results in dramatic changes in the way the body utilizes
vitamin A. 38 Further controlled research is needed to determine whether
supplemental vitamin A might prevent birth defects in children born to women on multiple
anticonvulsant therapy. Other research suggests that ingestion of large amounts of vitamin A
may promote the development of birth defects, although the studies are conflicting. Vitamin B6 Preliminary research has linked anticonvulsant therapy with possible depletion of vitamin B6
in children. 39 One preliminary study found that a combination of 10–50 mg per
2.2 pounds of body weight of vitamin B6 plus valproic acid was more effective than valproic
acid or vitamin B6 alone at treating children with recurrent seizures. 40 On the
other hand, supplementation with large amounts of vitamin B6 (80–200 mg per day) has
been reported to reduce blood levels of some anticonvulsant drugs, which could theoretically
trigger seizures. People taking anticonvulsant drugs should discuss with their doctor whether
supplementing with vitamin B6 is advisable. Vitamin B12 Anemia is an uncommon side effect experienced by people taking anticonvulsant drugs. Though
the cause may be folic acid deficiency in many cases, a
deficiency of vitamin B12 may also be a factor in some cases. Deficiencies of folic acid and
vitamin B12 can lead to nerve and mental problems. One study revealed that individuals on
long-term anticonvulsant therapy had dramatically lower levels of vitamin B12 in their
cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that bathes the brain) when compared with people who were not
taking seizure medications. Improvement in mental status and nerve function was observed in a
majority of symptomatic individuals after taking 30 mcg of vitamin B12 daily for a few
days. 41 Another study found that long-term anticonvulsant therapy had no effect on
blood levels of vitamin B12. 42 Despite these contradictory findings, people taking
anticonvulsant drugs for several months or years might prevent nerve and mental problems by
supplementing with vitamin B12. Vitamin D Though research results vary, long-term use of anticonvulsant drugs appears to interfere with
vitamin D activity, which might lead to softening of bones ( osteomalacia ). One study showed that blood levels of vitamin D in
males taking anticonvulsants were lower than those found in men who were not taking seizure
medication. 43 In a controlled study, bone strength improved in children taking
anticonvulsant drugs who were supplemented with the activated form of vitamin D and 500 mg per
day of calcium for nine months. 44 Some research
suggests that differences in exposure to sunlight—which normally increases blood levels
of vitamin D—might explain why some studies have failed to find a beneficial effect of
vitamin D supplementation. In one controlled study, blood vitamin D levels in children taking
anticonvulsants were dramatically lower in winter months than in summer months. 45 Another study of 450 people in Florida taking anticonvulsants found that few had drug-induced
bone disease. 46 Consequently, people taking anticonvulsant drugs who do not receive
adequate sunlight should supplement with 400 IU of vitamin D each day to help prevent
osteomalacia. Vitamin E Two studies showed that individuals taking phenytoin and phenobarbital had lower blood vitamin E levels than those who received no treatment for
seizures. 47 48 It is not known whether this same interaction occurs with
valproic acid. Though the consequences of lower blood levels of vitamin E are unknown, people
taking multiple anticonvulsant drugs should probably supplement with 100 to 200 IU of vitamin
E daily to prevent a deficiency. Vitamin K Some studies have shown that babies born to women taking anticonvulsant drugs have low blood
levels of vitamin K, which might cause bleeding in the infant. 49 Though some
researchers recommend vitamin K supplementation prior to delivery, 50 51 not all agree that supplementation for women taking anticonvulsant drugs is
necessary. 52 Until more information is available, pregnant women or women who might become pregnant while taking
anticonvulsant drugs should discuss vitamin K supplementation with their healthcare
practitioner. Interactions with Foods and Other Compounds Food Valproic acid, valproate, and divalproex may be taken with food to avoid/reduce stomach
upset. 53 Capsules, tablets, and sprinkles containing these drugs should not be
chewed, to avoid mouth and throat irritation. 54 Alcohol Valproic acid, valproate, and divalproex may all cause drowsiness and dizziness. 55 Alcohol may intensify these actions and increase the risk of accidental injury. People taking
valproic acid, valproate, or divalproex should avoid alcohol. Summary of
