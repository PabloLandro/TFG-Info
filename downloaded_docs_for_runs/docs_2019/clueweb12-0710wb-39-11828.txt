Acupuncture For Asthma Benefits Asthma Info Line Tips On Minimizing Asthma Attack Home Acupuncture For Asthma Benefits China has long used acupuncture successfully for treatment of many conditions. Now, acupuncture for asthma treatment is proving to be an effective treatment for respiratory diseases. In fact, acupuncture as an aid for respiratory ailments could even be a safer alternative than prolonged drug use. Acupuncture and asthma is an interesting “marriage. With energy flowing through people in opposing forces it’s determined that diseases are caused by an imbalane between these negative and positive forces. Acupuncture for asthma treatment research has shown benefits for asthma sufferers during the last fifteen years. Acupuncture Can Treat Symptoms In 1979, the World Health Organization listed 40 diseases that acupuncture is effective in treating. Acupuncture for asthma and bronchitis was on that list. The University Hospital of Vienna did a study that showed that 70% of patients with asthma reported significant improvement in their symptoms after 10 weeks of acupuncture treatments. Scientists at a Chinese hospital conducted a study that reported an immediate effective rate of 98.9% after patients received acupuncture for asthma symptoms. The rate of remission also dropped significantly and there was improvement in 76.5% of patients. Acupuncture Can Reduce Dependency on Drugs As studies have shown, acupuncture for asthma patients has shown benefits. Also, these patients were able to reduce their dosage of asthma medication. It is not advisable to quit any medication cold turkey, and your doctor should be consulted if you want to make any changes to your medication. However, some asthma medications have undesirable short- and long-term effects. Finding a safe alternative to high dosage medications can be beneficial to your health and wallet. Acupuncture Is Regulated In 1996, the Federal Drug Administration determined through several studies that acupuncture needles were no longer “investigational medical devices” and were approved for use by “qualified practitioners.” Each state has its own set of laws to regulate acupuncture and set up standards for qualified practitioners. In California, acupuncturists must graduate from an approved school, complete four years of academic education in the field, and pass a licensing examine. If you are seeking a qualified practitioner to perform acupuncture for asthma symptoms, be sure to do your homework and find out if the person is licensed by a state agency. So is there a place for acupuncture in asthma treatment? Following continual research over the last decade it does seem clear that acupuncture has an effect on the physiologic process of an asthma attack. Acupuncture for asthma is also deemed safe practice if performed by a licensed practitioner. If you are not getting the relief from traditional methods then acupuncture for asthma might be something you should seriously consider.
