Karanikiotis MD and Phil Rogers MRCVS Greek Version Contact Home APPLICATION OF ACUPUNCTURE AND ELECTROPUNCTURE IN CANCER PATIENTS N. Zubova (Russia) The use of acupuncture and electropuncture to cure different groups of cancer patients

has been started since 1977. 370 patients were treated and remote results were under

follow-up. The methods were used in the following cases: Patients with progressive cancer disease. Patients with late radiation injury (after radiation and combined treatments) Patients after radical operation of cancer. Clinical and laboratory results enabled to make a conclusion on the influence of

acupuncture and electropuncture on: degree of analgesia; recovery of sensitive and

locomotive disorders of the neurologic system; correction of disturbance of

vascular-thrombocytosis link; improvement of life quality On the basis of these

observations one should draw a conclusion that acupuncture and electropuncture effect

strongly. These methods do not result in reduction of life expectancy in the compared

groups of cancer patients. Abstracts of the 5th Baltic States
