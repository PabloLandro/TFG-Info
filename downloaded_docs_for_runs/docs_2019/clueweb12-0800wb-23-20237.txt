Whether you’re suffering from lower back pain due to muscle strain or a constant throbbing pain in your upper back due to an injury, there are dozens of prescription and over-the-counter medications that you can use to relieve the pain. However, it’s not advisable to turn to medications right away because of the negative side effects that these drugs can trigger. Natural Remedies for Back Pain Relief Back Pain Instead of automatically reaching inside the medicine cabinet for a pill every time your back starts to hurt, health experts recommend trying some natural back pain treatments first because these are not only safer but can be more effective as well. Mild back pain exercises and stretching routines, like those done in basic yoga, have been found to be very effective back pain treatments. It’s quite understandable if you are hesitant to do stretching exercises when you are currently experiencing severe back pain but you will be surprised at how effective they can be and how fast they can produce results. The exact type of stretching exercises that you should do would depend on how severe your back pain is and whether or not you have any other medical conditions. For example, the stretching exercises for a pregnant woman, a senior citizen with arthritis, and a perfectly healthy 20-year-old would be very different from each other. To find out what particular routine would work best for you, it is recommended that you consult with a doctor or physical therapist. Chronic Back Pain Treatments For the more serious types of back pain, like those due to a grave physical injury or an illness, more intensive or chronic back pain treatments may be required. Some of the treatments recommended for these advanced cases are chiropractic care and physical therapy and as a last resort, your doctor may suggest surgery. Back Pain Prevention As with every other health problem, the best way to deal with back pain is to prevent it from occurring at all in the first place. You can do this by exercising regularly, eating a balanced healthy diet, sleeping in a comfortable position, and avoiding straining your back muscles. In case you do overexert your muscles due to heavy lifting or strenuous sports activities, you may benefit from a deep tissue massage or some cold or heat therapy. As we know, prevention is always better than cure, so take care of your back and hopefully you won’t be in need of any back pain treatments at all.
