How can my baby catch measles? What are the symptoms of measles? How should I care for my baby if he has measles? Can measles cause any complications? Can I prevent my baby from developing measles if he's been exposed to the virus? When will my baby be offered a vaccination for measles? Is my baby at risk of getting measles? It is rare for children in Malaysia to get measles. This is because so many children are protected against measles by the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. If your baby hasn't received the MMR, he does have a small chance of catching this nasty viral illness. Despite the low rate of measles in developed countries and many parts of the developing world, the disease still breaks out all over the globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles infects over 30 million people worldwide each year. In 2005, 345,000 people, the majority of them children, were killed by the disease. So it's important to immunise your baby. How can my baby catch measles? Measles is caused by the rubeola virus . When someone who has the virus sneezes or coughs, tiny droplets containing the virus spray into the air. The droplets stay active for two hours in the air or on a surface. If your baby comes into contact with these droplets he can become infected. If your baby isn't immunised and hasn't had measles before, he has a 90 per cent chance of getting the virus if he's exposed to it. Once your baby has caught the measles virus it can take about 10 days for him to show any symptoms (CKS 2009) . What are the symptoms of measles? If your baby has measles, his first symptoms can include: runny nose; fever of about 38 degrees C; cough; sore, red, swollen eyes; small white spots in his mouth. Three or four days after these symptoms, you will notice red spots behind your baby's ears and on his face and neck. As the rash appears, his fever may rise. The spots will spread over his body and develop a bumpy texture. The rash may be itchy, and will last about five days. As it fades, it will turn a brownish colour and leave your baby's skin dry and flaky. See a photo of a measles rash in our rashes and skin conditions gallery . Your baby may also feel sick and tired and have aches and pains in his muscles. His cough may become troublesome, too, which may disturb his sleep . How should I care for my baby if he has measles? If you think your baby has measles, contact your doctor or paediatrician straight away. Measles is a notifiable disease, which means your doctor will need to report it (NHS 2010) . Once your doctor has confirmed that your baby has measles, there's not much you can do to treat it. Measles is a virus , so it can't be treated with antibiotics (NHS 2010) . The illness just needs to run its course. Your baby should get better in a week or so. There are some steps you can take to make your baby more comfortable and speed his recovery: Make sure your baby gets plenty of rest and keep him away from nursery and other children until at least four days after he develops the rash (CKS 2009, HPA 2010) . Offer your baby plenty of fluids to bring down his fever and prevent dehydration . Offer him regular breastfeeds , or formula milk and extra cooled boiled water . Give your baby infant paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease his fever and aches and pains, but only if he is three months or older. Check the dosage information on the packet or ask your pharmacist or doctor if you are unsure how much to give your baby. To help relieve your baby's cough, place a bowl of warm water in his room to make it more humid. If your baby is one year or older, you could give him a honey and lemon drink. Mix one teaspoon of lemon juice with two teaspoons of honey into a glass of warm water. There's no evidence that giving your baby a cough medicine will help his cough (NHS 2010) . Can measles cause any complications? Most babies and children recover from measles without any complications. However, occasionally measles can cause other problems such as: diarrhoea ; vomiting ; an ear infection ; an eye infection ; a febrile convulsion ; a swollen throat (laryngitis). Take your baby to the doctor if you are worried he is developing other symptoms as well as measles. Can I prevent my baby from developing measles if he's been exposed to the virus? If your baby hasn't yet received the MMR vaccine but has been exposed to measles, the course of action will depend on his age. If your baby is younger than six months and you have had measles before, your antibodies will have passed to him in the uterus (womb). This should make him immune to the virus. If you've never had measles, and your baby is less than six months, he may be given an injection of human normal immunoglobin (HNIG) (NHS 2010) . HNIG is a concentration of antibodies which can give short-term but immediate protection against measles. If your baby is older than six months and has been exposed to the measles virus, he may be given a dose of the MMR vaccine. This can prevent the virus from developing (NHS 2010) . When will my baby be offered a vaccination for measles? When your baby is about 12 months old he will be offered the MMR vaccine as part of his routine immunisations . This is between 90 per cent and 95 per cent effective at protecting your baby against measles, as well as mumps and rubella. A second dose (booster) will be offered when your baby is between three and five years old. This will increase his protection to 99 per cent. References CKS. 2009. Clinical topic: Measles .
