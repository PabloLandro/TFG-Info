Home Patient Care in Atlanta, GA Atlanta Sickle Cell Consortium Atlanta Sickle Cell Consortium Resources 2 - Patients and Families - Patient Care in Atlanta GA ATLANTA SICKLE CELL CONSORTIUM Introduction The members of the Atlanta Sickle Cell Consortium are deeply committed to conducting research that will advance the treatment and find cures for sickle cell disease. The history of research at the Georgia Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center and a list of publications is available by Clicking here. We are actively involved in research projects initiated by our own members and in national and/or international multi-center studies. The consortium represents  1200 adult and 1200 pediatric patients in the metro Atlanta area receiving care at 3 major locations, Grady Health System ( 1600 adults and children), Children’s at Egleston (400 children)  and Children’s at Scottish Rite (400 children) .
