Anxiety Anxiety Also indexed as: Nervousness, Panic Attacks Introduction Checklist Symptoms Treatments Dietary changes Supplements Herbs Integrative options References Anxiety describes any feeling of worry or dread, usually about potential events that might
happen. Some anxiety about stressful events is normal. However, in some people, anxiety
interferes with the ability to function. Some people who think they are anxious may actually be depressed . Because of all these factors, it is important for people who are anxious to
seek expert medical care. Natural therapies can be one part of the approach to helping relieve
mild to moderate anxiety. Checklist for Anxiety Rating Nutritional Supplements Herbs Inositol Multivitamin-mineral Passion flower (in combination with valerian) Valerian (in combination with passion flower) Magnesium Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) American
scullcap Chamomile Hops Linden Motherwort Oats (oat straw) Pennyroyal St. John’s wort Wood betony See also: Homeopathic Remedies for Anxiety Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary
studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. An herb is primarily supported by traditional use,
or the herb or supplement has little scientific support and/or minimal health benefit. What are the symptoms of anxiety? Physical symptoms of anxiety
include fatigue, insomnia , stomach problems, sweating,
racing heart, rapid breathing, shortness of breath, and irritability. How is it treated? Prescription drug treatment includes anti-anxiety agents such as lorazepam (Ativan®), alprazolam (Xanax®), and buspirone (Buspar®). Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac®), paroxetine (Paxil®), and venlafaxine (Effexor®), are often prescribed to treat generalized anxiety and panic attacks. Underlying medical conditions, such as excess hormone secretion from the thyroid or adrenal
glands, should be treated when present. Psychological counseling often accompanies drug
therapy. Dietary changes that may be helpful: All sources of caffeine should be avoided, including coffee , tea , chocolate , caffeinated sodas, and caffeine-containing
medications. People with high levels of anxiety appear to be more susceptible to the actions
of caffeine. 1 Nutritional supplements that may be helpful: Inositol has been used to help people with anxiety who have panic
attacks. Up to 4 grams three times per day was reported to control such attacks in a
double-blind trial. 2 Inositol (18 grams per day) has also been shown in a
double-blind trial to be effective at relieving the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive
disorder. 3 An isolated double-blind trial found that supplementation with a multivitamin-mineral supplement for four weeks led to
significant reductions in anxiety and perceived stress compared to placebo. 4 Many years ago, magnesium was reported to be relaxing
for people with mild anxiety. 5 Typically, 200 to 300 mg of magnesium are taken two
to three times per day. Some doctors recommend soaking in a hot tub containing 1–2 cups
of magnesium sulfate crystals (Epsom salts) for 15 to 20 minutes, though support for this
approach remains anecdotal. Niacinamide (a form of Vitamin B3 ) has been shown in
animals to work in the brain in ways similar to drugs such as benzodiazepines (Valium®-type drugs), which are used to
treat anxiety. 6 One study found that niacinamide (not niacin) helped people get
through withdrawal from benzodiazepines—a common problem. 7 A reasonable
amount of niacinamide to take for anxiety, according to some doctors, is up to 500 mg four
times per day. Are there any side effects or interactions? Refer to the individual supplement for
information about any side effects or interactions. Herbs that may be helpful: Several plants, known as
“nervines” (nerve tonics), are used in traditional herbal medicine for people with
anxiety, with few reports of toxicity. Most nervines have not been rigorously investigated by
scientific means to confirm their efficacy. However, one study found that a combination of the
nervines valerian and passion flower reduced symptoms in people suffering from anxiety. 8 In a
double-blind study, 45 drops per day of an extract of passion flower taken for four weeks was
as effective as 30 mg per day of oxazepam (Serax®), a medication used for
anxiety. 9 Other nervines include oats (oat straw), hops , passion flower , American scullcap , wood
betony , motherwort , pennyroyal , and linden . St. John’s wort has been reported in one
double-blind study to reduce anxiety. 10 An old folk remedy for anxiety, particularly when it causes insomnia , is chamomile tea.
There is evidence from test tube studies that chamomile contains compounds with a calming
action. 11 There are also animal studies that suggest a benefit from chamomile for
anxiety, 12 but no human studies support this belief. Often one cup of tea is taken
three or more times per day. Warning: Kava should only be taken with medical supervision. Kava is
not for sale in certain parts of the world. Until recently, the preeminent botanical remedy for anxiety was kava , an herb from the South Pacific. It has been extensively studied for this
purpose. 13 One 100 mg capsule standardized to 70% kava-lactones is given three
times per day in many studies. Preliminary 14 and double-blind trials 15 16 have validated the effectiveness of kava for people with anxiety, including menopausal women. 17 A previous study found kava
to be just as effective as benzodiazepines over the
course of six weeks. 18 The latest research shows that use of kava for up to six
months is safe and effective compared with placebo. 19 Although kava rarely causes
side effects at the given amount, it may cause problems for some people if combined for more
than a few days with benzodiazepines. 20 Are there any side effects or interactions? Refer to the individual herb for
information about any side effects or interactions. Other integrative approaches that may be helpful: Reducing
exposure to stressful situations can help decrease anxiety. In some cases, meditation , counseling, or group therapy can greatly
facilitate this process. 21 Acupuncture has been the subject of limited
research as a therapy for anxiety. In an uncontrolled study, eight patients suffering from
anxiety were treated with acupuncture three times per week for eight sessions. Six of the
eight patients achieved good to moderate improvement. 22 However, a trial of
acupuncture treatment for anxiety associated with quitting smoking did not provide any
evidence of benefit. 23 A double-blind study of acupuncture for the treatment of
anxiety associated with dental procedures reported that acupuncture and placebo were equally
effective. 24 Acupuncture remains unproven in the treatment of people with
anxiety. A form of counseling known as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be
superior to placebo for managing the symptoms of panic disorder. 25 In a controlled
trial, six months of CBT produced a response rate of 39.5%, compared to only 13% in the
placebo group. When combined with the tricyclic antidepressant drug imipramine (Tofranil®), response rates were even higher
(57.1%). For long-term management of panic disorder, imipramine produced a superior quality of
response, but CBT had more durability and was better tolerated. References: 1. Bruce M et al. Anxiogenic effects of caffeine in patients with anxiety
