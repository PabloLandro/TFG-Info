NOCIRC - POLICY STATEMENT ON CIRCUMCISION common.inc loaded POLICY STATEMENT ON CIRCUMCISION This document has been developed at the instigation of the Paediatrics 
                & Child Health Division of the Royal Australasian College 
                of Physicians (formerly the Australian College of Paediatrics) 
                following critical analysis of the literature by a working party 
                consisting of representatives of the Royal Australasian College 
                of Physicians, Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons, 
                New Zealand Society of Paediatric Surgeons, Urological Society 
                of Australasia and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. The policy represents an agreed position adopted by the following 
                professional organisations: Paediatrics 
                  & Child Health Division of the Royal Australasian College 
                  of Physicians Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons New Zealand Society of Paediatric Surgeons Urological 
                  Society of Australasia Royal 
                  Australasian College of Surgeons Paediatric 
                  Society of New Zealand The purpose of this document is to assist clinicians in their 
                discussions with parents who are considering having this procedure 
                undertaken on their male children, and for doctors who are asked 
                to advise on or undertake it. A separate parents' brochure is 
                available from the Paediatrics & Child Health Division Regional 
                Office, ph (02) 9256 5409. Routine Circumcision Of Normal Male Infants 
                And Boys - Summary Statement The Paediatrics & Child Health Division, Royal Australasian 
                College of Physicians (RACP) has prepared this statement on routine 
                circumcision of infants and boys assist parents who are considering 
                having this procedure undertaken on their male children and for 
                doctors who are asked to advise on or undertake it. After extensive 
                review of the literature the RACP reaffirms that there is no 
                medical indication for routine male circumcision. Circumcision of males has been undertaken for religious and cultural 
                reasons for many thousands of years. It remains an important ritual 
                in some religious and cultural groups. In Australia and New Zealand, 
                the circumcision rate has fallen considerably in recent years 
                and it is estimated that currently only 10 percent of male infants 
                are routinely circumcised. It is now generally performed with 
                some form of local or general anaesthesia, and usually outside 
                the neonatal period. The best recognised indication for circumcision 
                is phimosis. There have been increasing claims over recent years of health 
                benefits from routine male circumcision. The most important other 
                conditions where some benefit may result from circumcision are 
                urinary tract infections, HIV and later cancer of the penis. Urinary tract infections in boys are uncommon, affecting at 
                  most 1%-2%, and may be about 5 times less frequent in circumcised 
                  boys, whilst circumcision has a complication rate of 1% to 5%. 
                  Routine neonatal circumcision can not be supported as a public 
                  health measure on this basis. While there is some evidence, particularly from sub-Saharan 
                  Africa, that male circumcision reduces the risk of acquisition 
                  of HIV, evidence is conflicting and clearly this can not be 
                  seen as an argument in favour of universal neonatal circumcision 
                  in countries with a low prevalence of HIV. Penile cancer is a rare disease with an incidence of around 
                  1 per 100,000 in developed countries. Even though the evidence 
                  suggests neonatal circumcision may reduce the risk 10-fold, 
                  the rarity of the condition is such that universal circumcision 
                  is clearly not justified on these grounds. The complication rate of neonatal circumcision is reported to 
                be around 1% to 5% and includes local infection, bleeding and 
                damage to the penis. Serious complications such as bleeding, septicaemia 
                and meningitis may occasionally cause death. The possibility that routine 
                circumcision may contravene human rights has been raised because 
                circumcision is performed on a minor and is without proven medical 
                benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will be known 
                only if the matter is determined in a court of law. If the operation is to be performed, the medical attendant should 
                ensure this is done by a competent operator, using appropriate 
                anaesthesia and in a safe child-friendly environment. In all cases where parents request a circumcision for their child 
                the medical attendant is obliged to provide accurate information 
                on the risks and benefits of the procedure. Up-to-date, unbiased 
                written material summarising the evidence should be widely available 
                to parents. Review of the literature in relation to risks and benefits shows 
                there is no evidence of benefit outweighing harm for circumcision 
                as a routine procedure. [NOCIRC comment: When there is no evidence 
                  that potential (unproven) benefits exceed the known risks and 
                  harm of an operation, good medical practice dictates that the 
                  operation not be done. The RACP et al. says below 
                  that there are no medical indications for circumcision. It has 
                  also endorsed the position of the Australian College of Paediatrics 
                  and the Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons that 
                  "Neonatal circumcision has no medical indication," and it has 
                  endorsed the position of the Canadian Paediatric Society that 
                  "Circumcision of newborns should not be routinely performed." 
                  A routine procedure is one that is performed without 
                  medical indication. This means that the RACP and other represented 
                  medical societies are saying "Circumcision of newborns should 
                  not be performed without medical indication and that there are 
                  no medical indications for circumcision of the newborn." The 
                  RACP and other medical societies seem to be saying, in effect, 
                  that neonatal circumcision should not be done at all.] 1. Recent Literature and Policy Statements There is an extensive literature on circumcision in general, 
                and male neonatal circumcision in particular. This includes a 
                number of books 1,2 and recent reviews 3 including those by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) 4 and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 5,6 . The CPS recommended "Circumcision of newborns should not be routinely 
                performed" (reaffirmed February 2001: ( www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN ) 
                and the AAP concluded "we can not recommend a policy of routine 
                newborn circumcision". ( www.aap.org/mrt/factscir.htm ). Following the present review of the evidence, the RACP concurs 
                with these statements and endorses the 1996 statement of the Australian 
                College of Paediatrics (now the Division of Paediatrics and 
                Child Health of RACP) and Australasian 
                Association of Paediatric Surgeons that "Neonatal male circumcision 
                has no medical indication". 2. History of Circumcision Circumcision of males has been undertaken for religious and cultural 
                reasons for many thousands of years. It probably originated as 
                a hygienic measure in communities living in hot, dusty and dry 
                environments. It remains an important ritual in several religious 
                and cultural groups. Medicalisation of male circumcision seems to have occurred in 
                the 19 th century in English speaking countries. Being 
                circumcised was a sign that the individual had been delivered 
                by a doctor rather than by a midwife 1 . 
                Over the years, circumcision has been seen as a cure or preventative 
                measure for all manner of conditions including paralysis, insanity, 
                epilepsy, tuberculosis, enuresis, masturbation and phimosis, through 
                to the contemporary claims for prevention of urinary tract infections 
                in boys, and penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases in 
                adult males. During the last 50-100 years, routine neonatal male circumcision 
                became widespread in many English speaking countries. Until the 
                late 1960's or early 1970's, it was generally performed without 
                any form of anaesthesia. The rates of circumcision vary from country to country, being 
                about 60% in the USA (with recent data suggesting falling rates, 
                particularly amongst the growing Hispanic population), 30% in 
                Ontario, Canada, 6% in the UK (rates fell when circumcision became 
                unavailable on the NHS), and less than 2% in Scandinavia. Estimates 
                for Australia range between 10%-20% (most of which are now performed 
                under a general anaesthetic in boys older than six months), and 
                for New Zealand somewhat less than that. The procedure is more 
                common in Pacific Island communities where traditional circumcisers 
                are often used. 3. Anatomy of the Foreskin 3.1 Background The foreskin is a redundant fold of penile skin which overlaps 
                the glans penis 7 . It first appears 
                at eight weeks of fetal life and soon grows forwards over the 
                glans penis. By 16 weeks it covers the glans. At this stage the 
                epidermis of the under-surface of the foreskin is continuous with 
                the epidermis covering the glans. Both consist of squamous epithelium. 
                The foreskin (prepuce) and glans penis enclose a potential cleft, 
                the preputial sac. A preputial space is then formed by a process 
                of desquamation, and the prepuce increasingly separates from the 
                glans 8 . At the time of birth this process is incomplete in the vast majority 
                of boys, and the foreskin is non-retractable. Complete separation 
                of the foreskin with full retractability occurs in almost all 
                boys by the time of puberty 9 . [NOCIRC comment: This description of 
                  the foreskin improperly describes the foreskin as "redundant." 
                  The fold of preputial skin is needed for expansion of the penis 
                  during erection and provides mobility for the gliding mechanisim. 
                  The description omits information about innervation, 
                  vascularity, and the disease 
                  fighting functions of the foreskin.] 3.2 Care of the foreskin It is normal for the inner surface of the foreskin to be fused 
                to the glans in newborn males. Separation of the foreskin from 
                the glans occurs spontaneously during childhood. By five years 
                of age most of boys are able to retract their foreskin 9 . 
                A small percentage of boys are unable to fully retract their foreskin 
                until puberty. The foreskin requires no special care during infancy. It should 
                be left alone 10 . Attempts to 
                forcibly retract it are painful, often injure the foreskin, and 
                can lead to scarring and phimosis. Later in childhood, the foreskin can be gently retracted to the 
                point where resistance is met and the distal portion of the penis 
                and the urethral meatus become visible. The glans and the inner-surface 
                of the foreskin can be cleaned along with the rest of the body 
                once separation has occurred and the foreskin is fully retractable 11 . By around the time of puberty, all uncircumcised boys should 
                be able to retract their foreskin and clean underneath it in the 
                bath or shower. It is important that they always return the foreskin 
                to its original position after they have finished. If the foreskin 
                is left retracted behind the glans, it may swell up and become 
                painful (paraphimosis). As the foreskin separates from the glans, dead skin cells will 
                collect between the two layers. These dead cells appear as white 
                crumbly or cheesy material and have been termed smegma. Smegma 
                may produce a noticeable (and often asymmetrical) swelling beneath 
                the foreskin. This material rarely causes problems and usually 
                discharges spontaneously. Accumulation of smegma assists the normal 
                process of separation of the inner surface of the foreskin to 
                the glans of the penis in the young boy. Infection of smegma as 
                it is released may cause inflammation. Although there is evidence that boys who are uncircumcised have 
                a higher incidence of urinary tract infections, there is no evidence 
                that the increased incidence of infection is due to poor hygiene. 4. Medical Indications for Circumcision 4.1 Phimosis Pathological phimosis, which needs to be distinguished from the 
                normal non-retractile foreskin of early childhood 12 , 
                is an indication for circumcision 13,14 . 
                The condition occurs in at least 1% of boys 15,16 , is rare in the first five years of life and may be due to secondary 
                cicatrisation of the foreskin due to balanitis xerotica obliterans 
                (BXO) 17,18 . Topical application 
                of steroid ointment may resolve phimosis in the majority of boys 19,20 except in those with BXO where steroids are rarely successful. Physiological phimosis (normal narrowing of the foreskin that 
                may make visualisation of the glans difficult during infancy) 
                will normally resolve by the age of three to four years and requires 
                no treatment. If pathological (ie non-physiological) phimosis 
                fails to respond to steroid cream/ointment applied to the tight 
                part of the foreskin two to four times a day for two to six weeks, 
                there is a reasonable probability that it will cause problems 
                in the future and the child may well benefit from circumcision. 
                In a proportion of boys the phimosis redevelops after cessation 
                of applications of steroid treatment. 4.2 Recurrent balanoposthitis Recurrent balanoposthitis is a relative indication for circumcision. 
                The condition needs to be distinguished from the more benign ammoniacal 
                dermatitis 13 . Balanoposthitis affects 
                3%-4% of boys, and is recurrent in about 1% of boys 21 . 
                Balanoposthitis and balanitis may also occur in adults. Diabetes 
                may be a risk factor 22 . 4.3 Paraphimosis Recurrent paraphimosis is extremely rare and may represent a 
                relative indication for circumcision. In children, the condition 
                is usually secondary to forceful retraction of the foreskin and 
                is associated with a minor degree of phimosis. In adults, paraphimosis 
                typically occurs in the elderly. Men requiring frequent bladder 
                catheterisation are particularly at risk 23 . Treatment in children involves manipulation of the foreskin 
                forwards over the glans, and requires some form of analgesia (general 
                or local). In a minority of children, after reduction of paraphimosis 
                circumcision may be required, if topical application of a steroid 
                preparation fails to resolve the underlying phimosis, or if paraphimosis 
                recurs. 5. The Role of Circumcision In Preventing 
                Other Conditions 5.1 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) The cumulative incidence of UTI in boys by the age of about 10 
                is 1-2% 24,25 . Ginsburg and McCracken 26 first reported a higher incidence of UTIs in uncircumcised boys. 
                This is biologically plausible because uropathogens have been 
                shown to bind to the foreskin and then gain access to the renal 
                tract via the ascending route: removal of the foreskin would abolish 
                this mechanism. Other factors may be important in determining 
                the prevalent organisms. For example, rooming in with mother may 
                favour colonisation with non-pathogenic bacteria 4,27 , 
                and breast feeding has been associated with lower rates of UTI 
                than bottle feeding in one brief report 28 . There have now been ten case control and cohort studies published, 
                which have evaluated the association between circumcision and 
                UTIs 24,29-37 , but no randomised 
                controlled trials have been done. All have demonstrated a statistically 
                significant reduction in risk of UTI in circumcised males compared 
                with uncircumcised males, with most data concerning the risk of 
                UTI during infancy. The magnitude of the reported protective effect 
                varies from a three-fold reduction to a twelve-fold reduction 
                in risk of UTI due to circumcision. These data may be used to 
                assess possible benefits and harm from neonatal circumcision. 
                Assuming an annual incidence of UTI of 1% during the first year 
                of life for uncircumcised boys, the risk of UTI may be reduced 
                from 10 per 1,000 to 1-3 per 1000, a difference of 7-9 per 1,000, 
                or a need to circumcise between 110 to 140 boys to prevent one 
                UTI during the first year of life. On the other side of the equation, taking a mid-range figure 
                of 2% (20 per 1,000) for major complications from circumcision, 
                mainly from haemorrhage and infection (see earlier section), for 
                every 1,000 infants circumcised, about eight fewer will develop 
                a UTI but 20 will develop a significant complication. Assuming 
                that the harm of a UTI is about the same as a complication, 
                routine circumcision is difficult to advocate as a public health 
                measure. Other figures can be used to come to a different conclusion but 
                even then many parents and caregivers would believe this should 
                not be the only consideration 38 . The benefit-harm trade-off is also sensitive to the baseline 
                risk of UTI. Assuming the same protective benefits of circumcision 
                for the prevention of UTI extends to boys at higher risk of UTI, 
                such as those with underlying renal tract abnormalities, then 
                is it likely that a small group of boys, who continue to have 
                symptomatic recurrent UTI despite conventional clinical care such 
                as chemoprophylaxis, will benefit from circumcision. The risk 
                of UTI in these boys is not 1% as it is in the general population, 
                but closer to 30% 39,40 so that only 
                4-5 boys would need to be circumcised to prevent UTI, or 200-270 
                UTIs prevented for every 1000 circumcisions with about 20 complications. In summary, routine circumcision in boys cannot be justified 
                on the basis of preventing a UTI. On the other hand, there may 
                be a role for circumcision in boys with recurrent symptomatic 
                UTI and/or underlying renal tract abnormalities. 5.2 Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) The published evidence concerning the relationship between circumcision 
                and STD is often conflicting 41 . 
                An Australian study from 1983 42 suggested herpes genitalis, candidiasis, gonorrhoea and syphilis 
                were all more common in uncircumcised men. A more recent Australian 
                study 43 , however, suggested that 
                circumcision has no significant effect on the incidence of common 
                STDs. One study has suggested a higher risk of non-gonococcal 
                urethritis among circumcised men than among uncircumcised men 44 . 
                Genital ulcer disease, on the other hand, has been reported as 
                being more common among uncircumcised men, and those with a genital 
                ulcer are more likely to contract HIV. There is increasing evidence, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, 
                which suggests an increased risk of female to male transmission 
                of HIV in uncircumcised men 45-48 . However, how much circumcision could contribute to ameliorate 
                the current epidemic of HIV is uncertain 49 . 
                Whatever the future direction of this debate it can not be seen 
                as an argument in favour of universal neonatal circumcision in 
                countries with a low prevalence of HIV. 5.3 Human papilloma virus and carcinoma of 
                the cervix A recent international study reported an increased risk of human 
                papilloma virus (HPV) infection in uncircumcised men who indulged 
                in high-risk behaviours, compared with circumcised men 50 . 
                Monogamous women whose male partners had six or more sexual partners 
                and were circumcised had a lower risk of cervical cancer than 
                women whose partners were uncircumcised. Public health measures 
                aimed at early detection have been shown to decrease cervical 
                cancer fatalities; targeting sexually promiscuous men to decrease 
                risk taking and increase condom use may inhibit sexual transmission 
                of HPV and prophylactic vaccination against HPV is being developed. 
                At present there are no data to suggest advocating neonatal circumcision 
                would be of additional benefit to these strategies 51 . 5.4 Carcinoma of the penis Carcinoma of the penis is a rare condition, with an annual incidence 
                of approximately 1:100,000 men in developed countries, regardless 
                of whether there is a high or a low circumcision rate 4,5 . 
                There is evidence that neonatal circumcision confers protection 
                from carcinoma of the glans penis but not of the penis shaft 52-56 . 
                Even though the evidence suggests neonatal circumcision does reduce 
                the risk of carcinoma 10-fold, universal circumcision is clearly 
                not justified on these grounds 46 . Other risk factors for penile cancer include phimosis (which 
                is limited to uncircumcised men), genital warts, increased number 
                of sexual partners and cigarette smoking 57,58 . 
                It has been hypothesised that good penile hygiene may help prevent 
                both phimosis and penile cancer 59 . 6. Complications of circumcision Apart from pain and distress, and the side effects of local anaesthesia, 
                there have been many complications of circumcision reported 5,60,61 . 
                Most complications are minor, but some can be more severe, such 
                as penile amputation and even death. The overall reported rate 
                of complications after circumcision varies between 0.06% 62 to 55% 63 depending on the situation 
                in which it is performed and the precise definition of complication. 
                Most series describe a complication rate of about 2%-10% 64-66 . 
                A detailed summary of complications has been provided by Williams 
                and Kapila 61 , and includes the following: Haemorrhage Infection Glanular ulceration Meatal stenosis Inadvertent injury of the urethra (fistula) Too much skin removed Anaesthetic complications Psychological trauma Secondary phimosis Secondary chordee The true incidence of major complications after newborn 
                circumcision is unknown but is reported to be from between 0.2% 
                and 0.6% 5 to 2%-10% 61 . 
                The most frequent acute problem is haemorrhage, and may indicate 
                an underlying vitamin K deficiency or haemophilia. Infection is 
                usually minor, but rarely septicaemia and meningitis may occur. 
                Longer term complications include meatal stenosis, cutaneous tags, 
                poor cosmetic appearance, and psychological trauma. Children with 
                prominent prepubic fat may have a concealed penis following surgery 
                which tends to resolve at puberty. 6.1 Absolute contraindications to neonatal 
                circumcision Contraindications to routine neonatal circumcision include: Hypospadias and other congenital anomalies 
                  of the penis, eg epispadias Chordee (ventral angulation of the penis) Buried penis Sick and unstable infants Family history of a bleeding disorder or 
                  an actual bleeding disorder Inadequate expertise and facilities. 7. Legal and Bioethical Issues The legal and bioethical issues surrounding male neonatal circumcision 
                have been discussed in recent legal journal reviews 60,67 . 
                Parents have the right, indeed duty, to make informed medical 
                decisions on behalf of their children. It is equally established 
                in law that parents may not make decisions about their child's 
                medical care when such a decision is not in the child's best interests. 
                Many legal precedents exist to establish that Courts will deny 
                parents the right to refuse medically indicated procedures required 
                by their child that are contrary to their religious beliefs. The difficulty with a procedure which is not medically indicated 
                is whether it may still be in the child's "best interests" (that 
                is, in the case of circumcision, decreasing the risk of UTI and 
                penile cancer, and ensuring acceptance within a religio-cultural 
                group) on the one hand 60 or whether 
                it may constitute an assault upon the child and be a violation 
                of human rights on the other 67 . 
                Arguments to justify the best interests case are based upon 
                data to suggest a decreased risk of medical conditions later in 
                life, none of which, with the possible exception of UTIs in boys, 
                requires a decision in the neonatal period, and this could be 
                seen to be an argument to defer a decision until the individual 
                can express his own preferences. Generally the courts have avoided 
                jurisdiction in this area 60 . However, 
                there has been a 1999 
                UK case where separated parents disagreed on the question 
                of circumcision with the court finding circumcision not to meet 
                the paramountcy of welfare standard and not be in the best interests 
                of the child 60 . One issue, which 
                is agreed, is that before parents make a decision about circumcision 
                they should have access to unbiased and clear information on the 
                medical risks and benefits of the procedure. Whether this has 
                always been the case in the past is uncertain, and many parents 
                make such a decision on cultural and religious grounds alone 68 . 8. Analgesia Until recent times a majority of neonatal circumcisions were 
                performed without analgesia. Stated justifications for not using 
                analgesia include a belief that circumcision causes minimal pain, 
                that rapid expert circumcision causes less pain than that engendered 
                by local anaesthetic procedures and that newborns have no memory 
                of pain. There are good experimental data to refute the first 
                two of these contentions and, even though the third suggestion 
                can not be considered a sufficient reason to withhold analgesia, 
                there is an emerging body of evidence to show that painful neonatal 
                experiences do have long term consequences, even if not rooted 
                in conscious memory 69 . Taddio reported 
                that circumcised boys had higher pain and cry scores during routine 
                immunisation at 4-6 months of age than uncircumcised boys 70 and scores were again higher if circumcision was unaccompanied 
                by analgesia compared with those receiving topical anaesthesia 71 . Newborn infants subjected to a variety of noxious stimuli have 
                hormonal, physiological and behavioural responses 72 . 
                There have been two recent consensus statements on the prevention 
                and management of pain in the newborn 73,74 which should be used to guide the clinical approach to analgesia 
                for circumcision if such an operation should be deemed necessary . 
                Both statements emphasise that compared with older age groups 
                newborns may experience a greater sensitivity to pain, such pain 
                may have long term consequences, and a lack of behavioural response 
                (for example lack of crying) does not necessarily indicate a lack 
                of pain. Whilst general anaesthesia will often be used for circumcision 
                beyond the neonatal period it has rarely been considered as an 
                option for newborn circumcision. Local or regional anaesthesia 
                for newborn circumcision has been provided by local application 
                of a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA cream), dorsal 
                penile nerve block (DPNB), penile ring block (PRB) and caudal 
                epidural block. Recent trials have demonstrated that combined analgesia and local 
                anaesthesia (for example, pre- and post-operative paracetamol, 
                EMLA cream to the abdomen and foreskin, oral sucrose, and DPNB 
                or PRB 75 ), are more effective than 
                either alone 74,76,77 . In Australia, 
                most circumcisions are undertaken in boys older than six months 
                under a general anaesthetic, with local anaesthetic often being 
                administered during the general anaesthetic. 9. Technique of Circumcision When a circumcision is performed in an older child it is usually 
                performed under general anaesthesia and regional block 78 . There are numerous descriptions of circumcision but in most, 
                the following steps are undertaken 78 . Any residual adhesions between the inner surface of the foreskin 
                  and the glans are separated until the coronal groove is fully 
                  exposed circumferentially. Any smegma is removed. The foreskin is returned to its normal position and a dorsal 
                  slit is made, stopping short of the coronal groove. A similar manoeuvre is performed on the ventral surface as 
                  far as the frenulum. The foreskin is excised around each side leaving a rim of 
                  inner surface adjacent to the coronal groove. The edges of the foreskin are retracted to enable haemostasis. 
                  Usually the vessels are ligated with absorbable suture, or diathermied. The edges of the foreskin are sutured around the circumference 
                  with interrupted absorbable sutures. No circumferential dressing is applied, because of the risk 
                  of making the glans ischaemic if swelling occurs. Potential intraoperative problems include: Removal of excessive skin Removal of inadequate skin Haemorrhage Injury to the urethra Early postoperative complications include bleeding, infection 
                and glanular ulceration. References Gollaher DL. Circumcision: a history
