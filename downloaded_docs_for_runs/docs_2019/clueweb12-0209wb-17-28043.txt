Ask Dr. Scheiber in Plymouth, MA - E Morgan Scheiber DMD PC Sealants work to prevent dental decay in Plymouth area kids The addition of fluoride in toothpastes and water has been a great benefit to patients of all ages in helping  prevent tooth decay. Regular brushing and flossing lowers the chance of developing cavities as well. But kids  arenât known for their dedication to brushing and flossing, and that can lead to cavities. Fortunately, family  dentist Dr. E Morgan Scheiber in Plymouth, MA can help prevent cavities in your childrenâs teeth with the use of a  sealant. The grooves and depressions on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth are the most prone to decay, so itâs those  surfaces that require further preventive care. At E Morgan Scheiber DMD PC, Dr. Scheiber can apply a plastic-like coating  called a âsealantâ to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. The sealant is essentially painted onto the teeth,  which means itâs quick, easy, and painless for your kids. Studies have shown that sealants can reduce tooth decay by as much as 100 percent, so itâs no wonder that that  the American Dental Association recommends sealants as soon as the first adult back teeth come in at age 6 or  7. Dr. Scheiber will continue to apply a sealant as each back tooth comes in, up until about age 13, when most  kids have gotten all of their adult molars.
