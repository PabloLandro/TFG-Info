		        WISE Acupuncture
		      Treatment for Migraine Headaches For
		      most people in the west, the entire concept of voluntarily sticking
		      needles into your body is a bit insane. In fact, most people probably
		      have to
		      reach a certain point of no return to even consider the very idea
		      of acupuncture. Unfortunately, most migraine sufferers will reach that
		      point
		      of no return. Migraine headaches can be unbearable to the point
		      of excruciating and almost anyone who has ever suffered more than one
		      migraine has reached
		      a level of pain at which they would welcome a little pinprick if
		      it meant an ending to their migraine headaches. But does acupuncture actually relieve migraine headaches? Although several studies have concluded that acupuncture is an effective
		    migraine headache prevention strategy, nothing conclusive has yet been
		    determined, though much research is available to suggest that acupuncture
		    is effective for managing mild to moderate migraine headaches. How acupuncture treatment typically works is by inserting fine needles
		    in specific points on the body, which are then gently manipulated with
		    the needles. This supposedly increases blood flow in the tissues around
		    the migraine headaches. This blood flow is called the axon reflex. It works
		    by dilating the blood vessels around the needle area, allowing for an increase
		    circulation where blood flow had previously been poor. The process is called stagnation and is considered to be a very good response
		    for most chronic conditions for which one would seek acupuncture treatment,
		    including migraine headache prevention. This is not the only method of using acupuncture to treat migraines. Because the pain experienced during a migraine headache is associated
		    with the dilation of cranial blood vessels, prompting the reaction described
		    above by inserting needles into the head and neck might not be the best
		    thing to do during a migraine headache episode. In fact, it could worsen the pain and bring on nausea. For that reason,
		    some acupuncture practitioners try to reduce the amount of movement in
		    the blood vessels in the head and neck during a migraine attack by restricting
		    the acupuncture points to those on the arms and legs. To avoid unnecessary dilation of the cranial vessels, the head and neck
		    areas are rarely stimulated. In addition, rather than treating the patient
		    in a prone position as would normally be done, this method of treatment
		    is usually done with the patient sitting up because the blood vessels are
		    better controlled when in a sitting position. This greatly reduces the
		    possibility of undesired dilation of the blood vessels following acupuncture. Under some circumstances, a
		      high frequency electrical current is sometimes connected to the acupuncture
		      needles in order to help with constricting
		    of vessels. Of course, like most other treatments for migraine headaches,
		    acupuncture doesn’t come without its own side effects. When it comes to acupuncture,
		      it’s less a question of side effects
		    and more a question of side injuries. Unlike the most common side effects
		    of medication—nausea, vomiting, swelling, hives—when acupuncture
		    goes bad it can be life threatening. The most common serious injury associated with acupuncture involves the
		    accidental puncture of the lung, which often results in a partial collapse
		    of the lung. In
		      addition, one should also be aware of the dangers of infection. The most common infection associated with acupuncture treatments is viral
		    hepatitis, which can potentially develop into a serious infection of the
		    liver. Other possible side effects include bacterial infections developing
		    locally at the site of needle insertion in the skin and elsewhere in the
		    body. Generally, side effects seem to relate to poor hygiene and training of
		    the acupuncturist so make sure you see some qualifications of your acupuncturist
		    and get some recommendations beforehand if possible. Acupuncture
