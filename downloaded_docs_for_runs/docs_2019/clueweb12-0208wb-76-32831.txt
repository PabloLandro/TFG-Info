for the Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Glyburide is an oral medication of the sulfonyl-urea class  
used to lower blood sugar. The drug acts by stimulating pancreatic islet cells 
to increase insulin secretion. Glyburide is highly bound to proteins in the 
blood. The action of glyburide may be enhanced by other drugs that are also highly protein bound such as beta blockers. Pfizer lists glyburide (Micronase ®) as a pregnancy category B drug [1]. Other 
manufacturers list the drug as category C.
Older studies did not show significant levels of glyburide in the blood of 
newborns whose mothers had taken glyburide during pregnancy or while breast 
feeding [2-4]. However, a study by the Obstetric-Fetal Pharmacology Research Unit Network showed the average fetal glyburide level to be  70% of the maternal 
level in women who took glyburide while pregnant [13]. Although glyburide has not been shown to have  harmful effects on the fetus to date, and appears to be an effective 
alternative to insulin in the treatment of gestational diabetes for some women
the potential long-term effects on offspring are unknown. Patients with diabetes prior to 
pregnancy, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, liver disease, or a fasting blood 
sugar greater than or equal to 140 mg/dL are treated more appropriately with insulin 
[5-9]. Women with an OGTT less than 200 mg/dL, a fasting blood sugar less than 
110 mg/dL, and who fail dietary therapy after 30 weeks gestation do well on 
glyburide therapy [9-12]. The most commonly reported adverse events in patients taking glyburide have been nausea, heart burn, low blood sugar, muscle pain, joint pain, and allergic skin reactions including angioedema (swelling similar to hives) . Blurred vision has been reported with glyburide which is thought to be related to unstable blood sugar values. Liver problems including jaundice and hepatitis may also occur. Less commonly porphyria cutanea tarda, an abnormal sensitivity of the skin to sunlight, hyponatremia, a decrease in the number of agranulocyte white cells in the blood, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely.[1] Patients treated with glyburide for the control of gestational diabetes are 
classified as type A2 diabetes, and should receive the same antenatal 
surveillance as patients with A2 diabetes treated with insulin. REFERENCES 1. Micronase® package insert 2002 www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_micronase.pdf . Accessed 5/18/2007 2. Elliott BD, Langer O, Schenker S, Johnson RF. Insignificant transfer of
