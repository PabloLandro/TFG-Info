A balanced intestinal flora is made up in large part of “good bacteria” which work hard to promote digestion through enzyme production. These same “good bacteria” take part in many other activities, the main one being supporting the immune function. As such, the intestines play a vital defense role by acting as a barrier between the exterior and interior environments. The digestive system normally contains a sufficient quantity of the good bacteria, but under certain conditions (bad diet, stress, taking antibiotics, etc.) the internal balance between “good” and “bad bacteria” may be disturbed. Probiotic cultures are beneficial bacteria that maintain and restore the balance of our intestinal flora. Created through research at Immunotec, Probiotic with Cranberry dietary supplement is a revolutionary complex, which combines a blend of Probiotic, Prebiotic and “Superfruit” (a premium cranberry concentrate), in a unique symbiotic formula. This formula has been specially designed to naturally stimulate healthy digestive functions and natural defenses. Complementary Products Probiotic with Cranberry is part of your daily essentials, so you can take it with all of your Immunotec products to promote good health and wellbeing thanks to a better absorption of nutrients of each of these products. Immunocal®. Through its effect on three distinct yet intrinsically complementary biological mechanisms, Probiotic with Cranberry acts together with Immunocal® in complementary fashion. Regulation of intestinal immune system activity. -	Maintains immunity while weak. -	Reduces overactivity of the immune system (allergies or intestinal inflammatory diseases). Direct antimicrobial effects, mainly through inhibiting pathogenic bacteria from invading and adhering to inner intestinal walls. Daily Essentials Pack. Laboratory research has shown that probiotics improve the bioavailability of all minerals, notably calcium, iron, zinc and copper. Science of the Symbiotic Probiotic + Prebiotic = Symbiotic According to the World Health Organization, a probiotic is a “live, mixed culture of micro-organisms which beneficially affect the host organism (animal or human) by improving the properties of its indigenous microflora.” Recent studies have also shown that certain inactive cultures can be more effective than active ones. Immunotec® has developed a proprietary formula incorporating a detailed selection of Active and Inactive bacterial cultures, which work in synergy along with a Prebiotic source to restore, normalize and stabilize the intestinal flora, which is the corner stone of a healthy immune system. Science of the Cranberry The cranberry belongs to a unique category of “Superfruits” possessing exceptional nutritional and antioxidant properties. The highly concentrated extract present in this formula acts in synergy with D-Mannose and Probiotics and fights to prevent certain infection causing bacteria (Escherichia coli) from attaching themselves to the inner walls of the urinary tract. Due to these properties, it has been traditionally used in phytotherapy in order to prevent recurring urinary tract infections. Features Balanced formula supports a healthy diet. Contains a Symbiotic for digestive health: Probiotic: Six species of “good bacteria” scientifically proven to optimize functioning of the digestive system. Prebiotic: Dietary fibers that stimulate the growth and/or activity of “good bacteria,” helping them to thrive. Contains premium cranberry concentrate featuring outstanding levels of antioxidants, thus helping to keep the urinary tract healthy. Available in vegetable capsules. 100% vegetarian. Benefits Natural stimulator of a healthy intestinal flora and optimized digestion Probiotic with Cranberry brings continued support to the intestinal flora, whose proper functioning is critical to optimal health. Helps minimize lactose intolerance Helps minimize diarrhea associated with taking antibiotics Helps reduce constipation Improves absorption of minerals Improves the bioavailability of nutrients essential for proper physiological functioning Promotes general health improvement because of better absorption of minerals Urinary tract health The blend of Probiotic, Cranberry and D-Mannose is recognized for its synergistic effect on urinary tract health. Good to know If you are lactose intolerant, this is the product for you. Did you know that probiotic bacteria can increase your lactose tolerance? Indeed, they take care of the lactose in your intestines and help you minimize your troubles. Highlight Ingredients It has been observed that aging is associated with changes in the functioning of the gastro-intestinal and urinary systems. These changes promote bacterial infections, among others. Product description Probiotic with Cranberry dietary supplement is a revolutionary complex, which combines a blend of Probiotic, Prebiotic and “Superfruit” (a premium cranberry concentrate), in a unique Symbiotic formula. This formula has been specially designed to naturally stimulate healthy digestive functions and natural defenses. Probiotic. The addition of three billion active good bacteria (Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Casei and Bifidobacterium Longum) to inactive yogurt cultures (Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium Infantis) within the proprietary formula lets your body enjoy all the benefits of Probiotics. Prebiotic. A Prebiotic is a soluble fibre in the form of sugar which is not digested by our enzymes but acts as preferred nourishment to the Probiotics. Hence, the specific selection of short chains of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) allows to nourish the Probiotic blend without providing nourishment to bad bacteria, thus facilitating selective improvement of bacterial efficiency. Together, the Probiotics and Prebiotics combine in Symbiotic action and improve the products efficiency. Cranberry. Originating in rigorous standardization processes, the cranberry concentrate offers outstanding concentration of organic acids and polyphenols with natural antioxidant properties, whose health benefits have sparked off continued interest in connection with their role in preventing and treating inflammatory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancer. D-Mannose. D-Mannose is a simple sugar of vegetable origin, also found in its natural form in cranberries. While it is metabolized by the human body in small quantities, D-Mannose is in large part quickly excreted through urine. D-Mannose prevents the bacteria from attaching themselves to inner walls of the bladder, instead eliminating them directly through urine and thus preventing the formation of bacterial colonies, which could be at the source of urinary infections.
