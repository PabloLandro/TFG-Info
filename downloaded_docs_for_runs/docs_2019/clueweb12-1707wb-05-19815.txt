The consensus is that Ginkgo does support many folks increase a variety of brain functions. It has been shown to minimize age-related memory difficulties (affecting mastering, short-term memory, and recall), concentration difficulties, and absentmindedness.

A 1995 study located that high doses of Ginkgo helped Alzheimers patients as well. Another quite rigorous study published in 1997 in the Journal of the American Medical Association duplicated these results: Patients who took Ginkgo for 1 month enjoyed enhanced memory and attention span this improvement was even a lot more noticeable when patients took the herb for three months. However, many professionals believe its more substantial contribution may possibly be as a preventer of cognitive decline than as a remedy.

For prevention take 40 mg of standardized extract, or 120 mg of capsules daily, in divided doses. You may take up to three instances this dose if you have mild to moderate symptoms. Some men and women notice an improvement within two to 3 weeks of beginning treatment, but, in most instances, you need to have to take Ginkgo for at least 3 months before you enjoy the full advantages.  Gingko biloba is essentially devoid of any significant side effects.
