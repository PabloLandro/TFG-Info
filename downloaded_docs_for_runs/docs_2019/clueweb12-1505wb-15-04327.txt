Use Recovery e21 to prevent muscle cramps and charlie horses Get Flash here. What Doctors Say Dr Mike Bridges B.E (Chem) Ph.D (Biotech) "Muscle cramping is frequently experienced by people suffering from low electrolyte levels, including low magnesium levels. Common salt only contains sodium chloride and it is this form of salt that is found in our modern fast food diet. Most people know about the dangers of having too much salt in their diet, but without the other essential electrolytes people can suffer from muscle cramps. Magnesium supplements are one option for muscle cramps treatment, but this is not ideal, as they contain magnesium alone which is often in the synthetic, cheleated, or citrated forms. By taking just a magnesium supplement we again miss out on all the other essential electrolytes and elements that the body needs for muscle support. Recoverye21 is the only natural remedy for muscle cramps that is a fully balanced organic electrolyte supplement containing the full spectrum of electrolytes. It is a fast-working, effective muscle cramp treatment." What Doctors Say Adrian Adams. DC. "In my practice I have seen many patients who are unaware of the importance of electrolytes in preventing muscle cramps, not only among athletes but people in their every day lives. When it comes to muscle cramps remedies, I recommend Recovery e21 to my clients because it is an organic and natural electrolyte replacement supplement that will prevent cramps. I don't just tell my patients to use it, I also take it myself. I recently ran the New York City Marathon in my best-ever time. It was my seventh marathon and when I finished I had never felt so good. I couldn't believe it. I did not suffer from leg cramps or foot cramps during or after the race. When I woke up the next day and I felt like I could run it all over again. I took two capsules before the marathon and two on the hour during the marathon. Throughout the event my hydration was perfect and my electrolyte balance from Recovery e21 helped prevent muscle cramps."
