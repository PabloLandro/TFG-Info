By MARY SHEDDEN | The Tampa Tribune Published: April 23, 2012 Updated: April 23, 2012 - 12:00 AM » Comments | Post a Comment TAMPA -- Local health officials think adults are unknowingly responsible for the latest outbreak of a severe childhood respiratory disease. A total of 35 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been reported since Jan. 1 in Hillsborough County. The 112 cases reported statewide so far indicate a possible spike not seen in several years, according to the Florida Department of Health. The Hillsborough cases cropped up in the homes of seven local families, said Warren McDougle, epidemiology program director at the Hillsborough County Health Department. In one case, an adult infected six children in the family who did not have vaccinations, he said. "Pertussis has gotten in the adult population … and for them the experience is not unlike other respiratory illnesses where they cough and cough," he said. "It's not as severe as it is for children." The illness starts with a low fever, runny nose, sneezing and the cough. Children, in particular infants 7 months and younger who have yet to be immunized, are those most at risk. Two years ago, a local newborn died from pertussis. Antibiotics treat the illness, but little ones still spend six to eight weeks coughing and wheezing, McDougle said. "You have to listen to this horrible cough…They're literally sucking for air and trying to get air back in their lungs after coughing it all out," he said. This year-round illness is spreading beyond Florida. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reports recent outbreaks in Montana, North Carolina, Texas and Washington State. Cases could exceed the 27,550 reported in 2010, officials said. Pertussis travels in people who do not get vaccinated, or those who haven't had booster shots, McDougle said. In Florida, vaccinations, including for pertussis, are required for school children, unless they cite a religious exemption. Preteens attending public schools must get boosters prior to seventh grade. Adults who expect to be near young children also should get a dose, McDougle said. Aunts, uncles, grandparents and babysitters should be protected by the booster, which costs $56 at health department clinics, he said. "This is such a rough illness and the children are so sick," he said. mshedden@tampatrib.com (813) 259-7365 Member Agreement / Privacy Statement Share This: Email Facebook Google Twitter Favorites More Advertisement Advertisement Reader Comments *Facebook Account Required to Comment.
