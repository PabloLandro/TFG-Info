<< Previous Next >> December 13, 2003 A Spoonful of Cinnamon Helps Treat Diabetes Yahoo! News: People with diabetes can help keep their bodies healthy by simply adding a dash of spice to their diet, new research reports. In a study, diabetics who incorporated one gram -- equivalent to less than one-quarter teaspoon -- of cinnamon per day for 40 days into their normal diets experienced a decrease in levels of blood sugar, cholesterol and blood fats. And for people with diabetes, the less of those substances in the body, the better. ... Reporting in the journal Diabetes Care, [Dr. Richard A. Anderson of the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center in Maryland] and his team found that all cinnamon-takers experienced a drop in blood levels of glucose, fats and cholesterol by up to 30 percent. No change was seen in the people taking placebo capsules. Anderson explained that cinnamon contains compounds that help make insulin more efficient, improving the hormone's ability to bring glucose to the cells that need it. As an added bonus, cinnamon contains virtually no calories, Anderson said, allowing diabetics to add zest to their meals without adding to their waistlines. It seems obvious to me that cinnamon would also be good for people without diabetes, as insulin is a pro-inflammatory hormone. Since cinnamon makes insulin more efficient, the body needs to produce less insulin, which means less inflammation.  Add on reduced cholesterol and blood fats and you've got a real winner on your hands. Eat right. Live better. -Tim Posted by tim at December 13, 2003 11:42 AM Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 RE: Gift Ideas RE: CD Selections , Enter your e-mail address to receive a compendium of the week's top inspirational stories: Creators, King and Fredel Â© 2003-2006 Rugged Elegance, LLC.
