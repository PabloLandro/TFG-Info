Tables listing all current studies, and organized by Principal Investigator, are provided and updated on a monthly basis. Recently vitamin D3, but not its hydroxylated metabolites, has been found to inhibit hedgehog signaling, the pathway whose abnormal activity is responsible for the development of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the most common human cancer.  This would suggest that exposure to ultraviolet radiation, by producing high levels of vitamin D3, might restrain the growth of BCCs despite the contrary effect of increased pro-carcinogenic mutagenesis with increasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation. In addition, please feel free to review this page monthly for highlights of the most recently approved active clinical studies. Full List of All Active CHRCO Clinical Studies By Principal Investigator: A-C D-F G-I J-M N-R S-T U-Z Clinical Studies Approved Within the Last Three Months: Itraconazole For Treatment And Prevention Of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Tumors Of The Skin The primary goal of this study, led by Ervin Epstein, MD, is to determine the change in size of clinically appreciable BCCs (CABs) in subjects treated with 600 mg itraconazole for 6 months compared to placebo. Full Synopsis Postprandial Response to Almond Consumption in Pregnant Women The overall goal of this research study is to identify healthy sources of dietary fats and carbohydrates that reduce glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia during pregnancy. Currently, about half of all women entering pregnancy are obese.  The prevalence of metabolic disorders during pregnancy has increased concurrently with the rise in maternal obesity. Although dietary interventions are used routinely to reduce metabolic disease in non-pregnant obese individuals, no specific dietary advice is provided to obese, pregnant women unless they develop gestational diabetes mellitus. Full Synopsis Determinants Of Annual Transfusion Volume In Thalassemia Major And Sickle Cell Disease Patients On Chronic Red Blood Cell Ashutosh Lal, MD, is leading this study to measure transfusional iron loading in patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia major who are on chronic transfusion therapy. Factors affecting transfusion needs will be identified for each group of individuals. A knowledge of iron loading rates will help in improving rational design of iron chelation therapy. Full Synopsis Direct Quantification of HDL Properties in Plasma by EPR The goal of the study, led by Michael Oda, PhD, is to test the hypothesis that the binding rate of apoA-I to HDL is a determinant of a patient's plasma's abilty to efflux cholesterol. Full Synopsis A Phase I/II Study of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy for Young Adults with Severe Sickle Cell Disease The primary objective of this study led by Mark Walters, MD, is to determine event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year after Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) using bone marrow in patients with sickle cell disease 16-40 years of age.The study is a Phase I//II, single arm, multi-center trial.It is designed to estimate the efficacy and toxicity in patients with SCD and high risk features who are between 16 and 40 years of age. Full Synopsis A Randomized Double Blinded Trial of Topical Caphosol to Prevent Oral Mucositis in Children Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation This is a COG study, with Mark Walters, MD, leading the Children's Hospital Oakland study site. Currently, there are no approved treatments to prevent oral mucositis induced by chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both in pediatric patients. Caphosol has been identified as a promising agent that can decrease the incidence of severe oral mucositis in adults undergoing autologous HSCT for hematological malignancies. This study is a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial designed to determine if topically administered Caphosol rinsed orally four times daily, at the initiation of conditioning, reduces oral mucositis in children receiving HSCT. Full Synopsis A Multicenter Access And Distribution Protocol For Unlicensed Cryopreserved Cord Blood Units (Cbus) For Transplantation In Pediatric And Adult Patients With Hematologic Malignancies And Other Indications This study is an access and distribution protocol for unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood units (CBUs) in pediatric and adult patients with hematologic malignancies and other indications. The primary aim of this study is to examine the incidence of neutrophil recovery of ≥500/mm3 after cord blood transplantation in a multi-institution setting using CBUs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed. Mark Walters, MD, is leading the Children's Hospital Oakland study site. Full Synopsis Hypercalciuria in Overweight Patients The number of children and young adults with kidney stones appears to be increasing in the United States.  Most of these stones form because there is too much calcium in the urine.  Studies have suggested that one reason for this increase in kidney stones is because there is so much salt in the modern diet.  Barbara Botelho, MD, is leading this study to look at whether physicians should routinely check urine calcium levels in overweight children and young adults to prevent kidney stones and to maintain healthy bones. Full Synopsis Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program: The PROP Study This is a descriptive study, led by David Durand, MD, to evaluate biological and clinical predictors of respiratory morbidity in the first year of life in former premature infants.   Study sponsors are National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD). Full Synopsis Development of a Nanosecond Pulsed Electric Field System to Treat Skin Cancer BioElectroMed Corp. has developed a new medical device, the PulseCure System, which can ablate skin lesions non-thermally. This device applies non-thermal, ultrashort electric pulses to the skin to trigger apoptosis in the cells between the parallel electrode arrays. Most skin lesions begin to shrink within 24 h and disappear by 4 weeks after treatment. Ervin Epstein, MD, is leading this study to conduct a feasibility trial to identify the optimal pulse number for ablating basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and to determine the measure of efficacy of this nsPEF therapy for ablating human BCCs with minimal scarring. Full Synopsis Clofazimine Treatment for Mycobacterium Absesscus The purpose of this single patient IND is to treat a patient with Cystic Fibrosis and mycobacterium abscessus. This is an emergency use study. Full Synopsis Prevalence of Pain During Hip Impingement Test in Normal Non-Symptomatic Children Femoral Acetabular Impingement (FAI) is a condition where the range of motion in the hip is restricted by bony abnormalities located in between the acetabulum and the proximal femur. Friction in the joint triggers damage to the acetabular labrum and articular cartilage causing pain and progressive hip dysfunction. FAI is presently an under-recognized problem. Only 5-7% of individuals with an early form of FAI become symptomatic and are diagnosed. The aim of this study by Scott Hoffinger, MD, is to investigate the prevalence of hip impingement in normal non-symptomatic children. Full Synopsis Relation of Diet to Heart Disease Risk Factors in Children Metabolites of dietary phosphatidylcholine- choline and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-  were recently identified as being associated with myocardial infarction in a case-control study. The latter TMAO is a gut-microflora-derived choline metabolite that has been shown to be a potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This pilot study seeks to use information derived from a dietary questionnaire in children to test the association of dietary choline intake to plasma levels of TMAO as well as the relationship between plasma choline levels and components of atherogenic dyslidemia (increased triglycerides and small LDL, and reduced HDL cholesterol). Full Synopsis Complications in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Utilization of Iron Chelation Therapy:  A Retrospective Medical Records Review This study is a retrospective chart review led by Lynn Neumayr, of 450 sickle cell disease (SCD) patients ≥16 years of age from approximately six centers around the country which seeks to document these treatment and monitoring patterns in a diverse group of sickle cell patients. This data will significantly aid in understanding the impact of transfusions and iron chelation therapy (ICT) on clinical outcomes and comorbidities and identifying gaps in management of SCD patients and may help in the development of more affective standards of care for the sickle cell population. Full Synopsis Is Neuropsychological Evaluation Related to Individualized Educational Plan Procurement in Children Treated for Cancer? Katie Olson, MPH, is leading this study to determine whether or not neuropsychological evaluation is related to subsequent individualized education plan (IEP) procurement among children with cancer. Specifically, the study aims to 1) examine whether or not children with cancer referred by their oncologist/neurosurgeon for neuropsychological evaluation possessed an IEP prior to the evaluation and, 2) if they did not, to determine whether or not a caregiver used the evaluation findings to obtain an IEP. Full Synopsis Pilot Study to Determine if a Free Fruit and Vegetable Program can Facilitate Dietary Change for Weight Management in Low Income Individuals The working hypothesis for this project, led by Jodi Stookey, PhD, is that a food assistance program that provides ready-to-eat fruit and vegetables for free, in amounts consistent with the value of other foods offered by WIC or school meals, can faciliate dietary change for low income, overweight individuals counseled to increase fruit and vegetable intake for weight loss. Full Synopsis An Open Label, Dose Ranging Study of Prasugrel in Pediatric Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (Protocol H7T-MC-TACX) Study TACX is a Phase 2 open-label PK and PD study of prasugrel in approximately 32 pediatric patients with sickle cell diseae (SCD) led by Lori Styles, MD.The goal of Part A is to characterize the PK/PD relationship of Pras-AM during single-dose ranging in pediatric patients with SCD. Once known, this relationship will enable selection of appropriate once-daily multiple-dose regimens for further evaluations in Part B, the purpose of which is to assess active metabolite PK, PD response, efficacy, safety, and tolerability to prasugrel treatment during once-daily dosing to pediatric SCD patients. Full Synopsis Treatment of Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors (AT/RT) of the Central Nervous System with Surgery, Intensive Chemotherapy, and 3-D Conformal Radiation This is a COG, Phase III non-randomized trial study, with Joseph Torkildson, MD, leading the Children's Hospital Oakland site, to help provide insight into a standard treatment therapy for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/AR). Tumor tissue and patient serum will be required on this study and a biological database will be developed. This study will serve as a vital source of information on AT/RT and provide a platform on which to build future clinical trials. Full Synopsis A Phase II Study of MLN8237 (IND# 102984), a Selective Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor in Children with Recurrent/Refractory Solid Tumors and Leukemias This is a COG study, with Carla Golden, MD, leading the Children's Hospital Oakland site, which will evaluate a cancer-fighting medicine called MLN8237. MLN8237 is a drug that in laboratory studies can block a protein called aurora A kinase. Aurora A kinase is a naturally occurring protein found in the cells of the body. The medicine, MLN8237, will block aurora A kinase and may partly control the ability of certain cancers to grow. Full Synopsis Long Term Follow-Up of Open Reduction Femoral Osteotomy in Children with Cerebral Palsy Scott Hoffinger, MD, is leading this study to evaluate the long term (greater than 5 years) outcome of open reduction femoral osteotomy in children with cerebral palsy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the alignment of the hip joint at least 5 years after surgery by radiographic measurements, and to ask the patients about the function of their hip (e.g. pain, daily activities, etc). Full Synopsis Effects of a Modified Lower Carbohydrate, Higher Fat DASH Diet Plan on Plasma Lipids, Lipoprotein Particle Size, and Blood Pressure in Healthy Adults The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial has been shown to reduce blood pressure and plasma total and LDL-cholesterol compared to a Western diet, but shows no benefit on other blood lipid variables associated with cardiovascular risk, namely HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The overall objective of this study, led by Ronald Kruass, MD, is to determine whether modification of the DASH diet by substituting carbohydrate with fat will result in improvements in multiple biomarkers of CVD risk. Full Synopsis Saturated Fat and Protein Effects on Atherogenic Dyslipidemia The overall objective of this project, led by Ronald Krauss, MD, is to test the hypothesis that the effects of saturated fat (SF) on lipoprotein markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk are influenced by food sources of dietary protein. Investigators specifically hypothesize that increases in plasma levels of LDL cholesterol (C), and apolipoprotein (apo) B, induced by SF are greater when the major food source of protein is red meat rather than either white meat (poultry) or non-meat foods, and that this is due to increased levels of small and medium sized LDL particles. Full Synopsis Metabolic Genetics of Cleft Lip The working hypothesis of this study led by Edward Lammer, MD, is that genetic variants in vitamin-responsive genes are more common in children with cleft lip (with or without palate) and their mothers. Investigators aim to associate genetic polymorphisms of folate-responsive genes with the occurrence of cleft lip, including rare variants that are not polymorphisms. If the association is made, investigators believe that an increase in maternal serum folate from supplementation could prevent cleft lip with or without palate by overcoming the metabolic effects of genetic variants.
