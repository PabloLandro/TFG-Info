        Loss Surgery To Reduce Obesity - Research Into 
        Gastric Reduction Surgery Effect of Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding on Quality of Life Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Finnish morbidly obese individuals 
        was compared with that of Finnish age norms and prospectively with the 
        HRQoL and the disease-specific quality of life (QoL) at 12 months, and 
        cross-sectionally at 28 months, following laparoscopic adjustable gastric 
        banding, mainly with the Swedish band. Method The Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire was used for disease-specific QoL 
        assessments in 95 patients preoperatively, in 52 patients prospectively 
        followed-up to 12 months, and cross-sectionally in 52 patients operated 
        at a median of 28 months earlier. A generic 15-dimensional questionnaire 
        was used for HRQoL-measurements in 75 patients preoperatively, and 34 
        patients have been followed-up to 12 months. HRQoL outcomes were compared 
        cross-sectionally with the 52 patients operated at a median of 28 months 
        earlier. Results Disease-specific QoL scores were significantly improved on all domains 
        of the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire 12 months after surgical treatment, 
        an improvement maintained at a median of 28 months follow-up. Significant 
        improvements in generic HRQoL scores were seen on the dimensions mobility, 
        respiratory function, sleep, the performance of usual acts, vitality and 
        sexuality 12 months after surgery. Significant worsening was seen on the 
        eating dimension. Of these dimensions, mobility and sleeping were not 
        significantly improved at a median of 28 months follow-up, and scores 
        on the eating dimension were not significantly worse compared with values 
        obtained in the preoperative group. HRQoL single index score was significantly 
        improved 12 months after surgery. This improvement did not correlate with 
        the extent of weight loss. Conclusion Disease-specific QoL was significantly improved at 12 months follow-up, 
        an improvement that seems to have been maintained at a median of 28 months 
        following operation. HRQol was significantly improved 12 months after 
        the operation. There may be a decline in the improvements after that. Source: Tolonen P, Victorzon M, Makela J. Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery,

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
