< 0.3 mg per day). You should only use the lowest amount possible to achieve the desired effect. Your doctor can help you determine the most appropriate dose for your situation, including how to increase the amount, if needed. Pediatric Always ask your doctor before giving melatonin to a child. Keep doses to less than 0.3 mg/day. There is not enough information to say that doses greater than 0.3 mg per day are safe in children under age 15. In fact, doses between 1 - 5 mg may cause seizures in this age group. Adult Insomnia: 1 to 3 mg 1 hour before bedtime is usually effective, although doses as low as 0.1 -0.3 mg may improve sleep for some people. If 3 mg per night does not work after 3 days, try 5 - 6 mg 1 hour before bedtime. You should work with your doctor to find the safest and most effective dose for you. The right dose for you should produce restful sleep with no daytime irritability or fatigue. Jet lag: 0.5 - 5 mg of melatonin 1 hour prior to bedtime at final destination has been used in several studies. Another approach that has been used is 1 - 5 mg 1 hour before bedtime for 2 days prior to departure and for 2 - 3 days upon arrival at final destination. Precautions Because of the potential for side effects and interactions with medications, people should take dietary supplements only under the supervision of a knowledgeable health care provider. Some people may have vivid dreams or nightmares when they take melatonin. Taking too much melatonin may disrupt circadian rhythms (your “body clock”). Melatonin can cause drowsiness if taken during the day. If you are drowsy the morning after taking melatonin, try taking a lower dose. Additional side effects include stomach cramps, dizziness, headache, irritability, decreased libido, breast enlargement in men (called gynecomastia), and decreased sperm count. Pregnant or nursing women should not take melatonin because it could interfere with fertility. Some studies show that melatonin supplements worsened symptoms of depression. For this reason, people with depression should consult their doctor before using melatonin supplements. Although many researchers believe that melatonin levels go down with age, newer evidence has brought this theory into question. People older than 65 should ask their doctor before taking melatonin supplements, so blood levels of this hormone can be monitored. Possible Interactions If you are being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use melatonin without first discussing it with your health care provider. Antidepressant medications -- In an animal study, melatonin supplements reduced the antidepressant effects of desipramine and fluoxetine (Prozac). More research is needed to know if the same thing would happen in people. In addition, fluoxetine (a member of a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs) can cause low levels of melatonin in people. Antipsychotic medications -- A common side effect of antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia is a condition called tardive dyskinesia, which causes involuntary movements. In a study of 22 people with schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia caused by antipsychotic medications, those who took melatonin supplements had fewer symptoms compared to those who did not take the supplements. Benzodiazepines -- The combination of melatonin and triazolam (Halcion) improved sleep quality in one study. In addition, a few reports have suggested that melatonin supplements may help people stop using long-term benzodiazepine therapy. (Benzodiazepines are habit-forming.) Blood pressure medications -- Melatonin may make blood pressure medications like methoxamine (Vasoxyl) and clonidine (Catopres) less effective. In addition, medications in a class called calcium channel blockers may lower melatonin levels. Calcium channel blockers include: Nifedipine (Procardia) Amlodipine (Norvasc) Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin) Diltiazem (Cardizem) Felodipine (Plendil) Nisoldipine (Sular) Bepridil (Vascor) Beta-blockers -- Use of beta-blockers may lower melatonin levels in the body. Beta-blockers include: Acebutolol (Sectral) Atenolol (Tenormin) Bisoprolol (Zebeta) Carteolol (Cartrol) Metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL) Nadolol (Corgard) Propranolol (Inderal) Blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) -- Melatonin may increase the risk of bleeding from anticoagulant medications such as warfarin (Coumadin). Interleukin-2 -- In one study of 80 cancer patients, use of melatonin along with interleukin-2 led to more tumor regression and better survival rates than treatment with interleukin-2 alone. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) -- NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may lower levels of melatonin in the blood. Steroids and immunosuppressant medications -- Melatonin may cause these medication to lose their effectiveness. Do not take melatonin with corticosteroids or other medications used to suppress the immune system. Tamoxifen -- Preliminary research suggests that the combination of tamoxifen (a chemotherapy drug) and melatonin may benefit some people with breast and other cancers. More research is needed to confirm these results. Other -- Caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol can all lower levels of melatonin in the body.
