<0.01). 2 years after vertical 
        banded gastroplasty, with a significant excess weight loss (P<0.0001), 
        only 10 patients continued to have LBP but less frequently and requiring 
        reduced doses of medications compared with the preoperative condition. 
        In the remaining 19 patients with preoperative positive low-back pain 
        history, the postoperative weight loss was associated with complete resolution 
        of the symptoms. Conclusion The frequency of low-back pain is significantly higher in morbidly obese 
        patients than in lean subjects. Surgical weight reduction results in significant 
        improvement and even disappearance of this obesity co-morbidity. Source: Melissas J, Volakakis E, Hadjipavlou A. Bariatric Unit, Department of

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. © 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
