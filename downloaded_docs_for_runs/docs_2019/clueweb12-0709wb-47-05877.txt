Swisse Ultiboost Magnesium contains 300mg Magnesium from magnesium citrate and Bioperine, a unique standardised extract of Black Pepper, to help increase nutrient uptake. Magnesium is essential for many cellular functions, particularly those functions involved in energy production and for the normal functioning of muscle and nerve tissue. Magnesium is sometimes regarded as a smoothie mineral, since it has the ability to relax muscles . Magnesium helps with the relief of premenstrual symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps and anxiety. It may also help support bone structure and cardiovascular health. Low magnesium levels can contribute to fatigue , mental confusion, irritability, muscle cramps , problems with nerve conduction and muscle contraction, insomnia and predisposition to stress . According to a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study magnesium citrate is better absorbed than magnesium oxide in healthy individuals. Of the two forms, long term magnesium citrate supplementation led to the greatest increase in overall magnesium concentration. What is in it? Magnesium Citrate - Citrate is a naturally occurring salt attached to magnesium which helps correct delivery for absorption (i.e. small intestine) without being utilised by the body first. Bioperine-Black Pepper Extract - Black pepper is a common household herb that has also been used for many years as a medicine particularly in India. BioPerine Â® is standardised patent product sourced out of black pepper (piperinigrum). Its role is to enhance the bioavailability of supplement nutrients by increasing the absorption. A number of medications have been shown to reduce the body's supply of magnesium. In these cases it is important to supplement with Swisse Ultiboost Magnesium. Medications include, but are not limited to: loop diuretics for blood pressure, antibiotics, warfarin, corticosteroids, oral contraceptive pill and immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine.
