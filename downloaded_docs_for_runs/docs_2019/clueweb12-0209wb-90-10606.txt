Custom Search Migraine Relief - Prevent Migraine Headaches A typical migraine headache causes a severe headache which lasts between 4 - 72 hours and often comes with a number of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, mental confusion and light and sound sensitivity. In some cases, migraines are preceded or accompanied by neurological symptoms known as migraine auras. These sensory symptoms often begin some time before the headache, and may include disturbances in visual perception such as flashing lights, seeing zigzag lines, blurred vision, sensations of dizziness and other visual hallucinations. Conventional Migraine Headache Relief Doctors often prescribe a combination of abortive drugs to help stop migraines and preventative drugs to prevent migraine headaches or to lessen the pain when a migraine strikes. While conventional medications do reduce pain, they are heavy-strength medications, and can produce harmful side effects and the risk of addiction. Always research side effects, potential for addiction, and alternatives available before deciding on a treatment plan. Natural Migraine Remedies to Prevent Migraines Homeopathic, natural migraine remedies can provide safe migraine headache relief and can address the problem's source. Regular use of Feverfew in therapeutic dosage can significantly reduce or eliminate the frequency and intensity of migraines. Other herbs can address anxiety and stress (e.g. Passiflora) or fluctuating hormonal levels (e.g. Don Quai or Black Cohosh). Natural migraine remedies can provide safe migraine headache relief and help prevent migraine headaches, without the harmful side-effects often associated with prescription drugs.
