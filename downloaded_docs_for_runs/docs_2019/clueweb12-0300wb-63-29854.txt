The following topics are covered: • Background • About acupuncture • The evidence • Problems in acupuncture research • Systematic reviews • Trial since the systematic reviews • Unwanted effects • Precautions • Costs • What guidelines say • Practical issues The article concludes that “overall, acupuncture seems a reasonable adjunctive treatment for migraine or tension-type headaches, particularly in patients not managed by medication or those wishing to pursue non-drug options. However, provision of NHS acupuncture services is limited.” About this library entry Category: Acupuncture | Drug reviews | Headaches &associated disorders including migraine NeLM area: Evidence > Drug Specific Reviews Abstract Preview your comment Add new comment Comment text: Comments There are no comments yet.
