Oasis of Hope offers a range of cancer treatment protocols, under the collective name Integrative Regulatory Therapy (IRT).  The key word here is “integrative”.  The various therapeutic elements employed: Proven alternative treatments High-dose vitamin C Ozone treatments w/ UV Immune stimulating treatments Dendritic Cell Vaccine Laetrile treatments Nutraceuticals & supplements Nutritional therapy Emotional and spiritual support To learn more about our Integrative Regulatory Therapy, click here These treatments are intended to work together harmoniously, in a complementary or synergistic fashion, to slow or reverse the spread of cancer while promoting the physical and psychological health of the whole person.  The IRT protocols include elements intended to kill cancer cells directly along with a number of adjuvant measures intended to make this tumor killing more effective, and/or alleviate toxic risk to healthy cells. In addition, the home care treatment program is intended to act directly on remaining tumor cells to slow their growth, to inhibit new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) that supports tumor growth, to impede the metastatic process whereby cancer spreads, to support effective immune function.
