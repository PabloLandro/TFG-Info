Magnesium is involved in muscle and nerve function, maintaining proper cardiac rhythm, the formation of bone, in energy metabolism, and protein synthesis. Magnesium is aborbed through the small intestine. Blood levels are controlled by excreting excess magnesium through the kidneys. Although generally considered safe, consult your physcian before beginning a regimen of magnesium supplementation. Special caution should be taken by patients with compromised renal function. Product Research Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels) Your doctor may recommend magnesium supplements to prevent or correct hypomagnesemia. Symptoms of hypomagnesemia include: muscle cramps, tingling, abnormal heart rhythms, and if left uncorrected; seizures. Hypomagnesemia is also associated with low levels of other electrolytes: calcium and potassium. Hypomagnesemia may be caused by: renal wasting malabsorption disorders inadequate dietary intake Renal Wasting Kidneys attempt to correct for low magnesium intake by adjusting the amount excreted in the urine.   	   	Kidneys can be impaired from regulating magnesium due to a disease state or as a side-effect of medications. Several drugs are known to deplete magnesium through the urine: Oncology Cisplatin Carboplatin Oxaliplatin ErbituxTM(cetuximab) Some antibiotics GentamicinTM AmphortericinTM Transplantation (Solid Organ or Stem Cell/BMT) CyclosporinTM PrografTM (Tacrolimus) Cardiology LasixTM BumexTM EdecrinTM Hydrochlorothiazide Malabsorption Disorders Crohn's and Colitis patients can experience hypomagnesemia due to inadequate absorption of  magnesium through the small intestine. Inadequate Dietary Intake The quality of a person's diet may affect the magnesium status. A diet void of leafy green vegetables, nuts,  whole grains, etc. may be the etiology of magnesium deficiency. Dietary surveys vary greatly on the severity of this  condition for most Americans. Low magnesium levels are also associated with alcoholism or poorly controlled diabetes. ***These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
