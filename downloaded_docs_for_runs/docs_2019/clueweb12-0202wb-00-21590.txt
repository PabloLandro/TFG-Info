          January 18, 2011 at 12:27 pm Giving up smoking is something that many smokers realise they will want to do. Some may want to to it now and others believe they will make a decision in the future to pack up smoking. Unfortunately the term “ giving up ” does not help the efforts of a smoker. the words “ giving up ” implies that in doing so that you will have to “do without” something or that you will be deprived of something that you like or want. No one likes to be denied something that on some level they have accepted that they need, want or like. “ Giving up ” has similat connotations to the word “diet”. A diet implies limitations and depriving yourself of something you want or have had in the past. If you start your good intention to stop smoking with the thought that you are giving up something, psychologically this perception does not help you to stay stopped in fact it may undermine your efforts to quit smoking for good. A perception of giving up something implies that you continue to think about what you will miss by stopping smoking.  It also implies that smoking does something for you in a positive way, which, as a non-smoker you will have to cope without. Many smokers view smoking as an aid to relaxation and having a chance to de-stress. In reality the nicotine that enters the blood stream, if anything makes you more tense. It doesn’t relax you. What does hel;p to release and relieve any stress and tension is what you do whilst you are smoking. Most smokers do this when they are smoking:- 1) Step away from the place of stress to smoker (eg. step outside the office) 2) Take deeper breaths in (this is a well-known relaxation method) 3) Daydream about pleasant events (if they are alone) or get things off their chest by cursing something that has upset them. 4) Engage with fellow smokers – a kind of cameraderie that aids the pereception of shared experienes and helps de-stress someone 5) Smoke when drinking alcohol (alcohol provides temporary relaxation) Smokers make an association between the above ideas and smoking and assume that it must be the cigarette or rollie that helps them to feel chilled or relaxed. In  reality it is those other things you do when you smoke that helps you to relax. Giving Up Smoking – Good News There is a way of stopping smoking without having the sense of giving up anything. Part of that way is to continue to do those things you used to do when you smoked. So you can still have those 5 minute work breaks and step away for a while. You can still mix with people who smoke and enjoy the cameraderie. You can still enjoy alcohol. If you use this tactic you will not be giving up anything, you will in fact simply be stopping poisoning yourself. In doing so you will make the task of sticking to your decision to be a non-smoker much easier. _______________________________________________________________________________ Author’s Details Steven Harold BA(Hons) DCH DHP Quit Smoking Hypnotherapist – London and Essex Website: www.stop-smoking-hypnosis.com Email: steve@stop-smoking-hypnosis.com _______________________________________________________________________________ Incoming search terms for the article: stop smoking hypnotherapy aberdeen hypnotherapy for giving up smoking stop smoking ABERDEEN stop smoking hypnosis aberdeen stop smoking hypnotist aberdeen alcohol hypnosis east london hypnosis to give up smoking stop smoking hypnosis CARDIFF stop smoking hypnosis in aberdeen cemcas Cigarette Smoking Facts hypnosis giving up smoking maidstone hypnotherapy to give up smoking hypmotism to stop smoking aberdeen free online hypnosis to stop smoking and drinking hypnotism stop smoking aberdeen hypnotism london white city give up smoking hypnotised to stop smoking cardiff hypnotherapy to stop smoking and drinking hypnotherapy to stop drinking in warwickshire hypnotherapy giving up smoking cardiff hypnotherapy to stop drinking alcohol in the north east hypnotherapy to stop drinking - north east HYPNOTIST TO HELP STOP DRINKING S W LONDON stop smoking with hypnotherapy aberdeen stop smoking with hypnosis in aberdeen stopping smoking with hypnotherapy aberdeen stop smoking hypnotism aberdeen wrexham hypnosis to give up smoking stop smoking cardiff www hynotherapists in aberdeen uk stop drinking with hypnosis london smoking hypnotherapy abereen press release stop smoking hypnosis london stopping drinking free hypnosis hypnotherapy anti smoking highbury london hypnotherapy aberdeen stop smoking hypnoisis to give up smoking hypno anti smoking farnborough free word search on quiting smoking hynotherapy aberdeen smoking how does give up smoking hypnosis work giving up smoking with hynotherapy giving up smoking hypnosis berhamstead giving up drinking hypnotist give up smoking buntingford? free hypnotherapy for alcoholics in bolton does hypnotism work for drinking essex cardiff stop smoking groups hypnosis for drinking Aberdeen hypnosis for drinking and smoking hypnotherapy aberdeen hypnotherapists isle of wight hypnosis to stop smoking on the isle of wight hypnosis to stop smoking aberdeen hypnosis to stop drinking alcohol north west england hypnosis to quit smoking in aberdeen hypnosis to give up smoking in caerphilly hypnosis to give up drinking colchester hypnosis thornton co for cigrette and diet hypnosis give up smoking maidstone hypnosis for smoking salford hypnosis for smoking in nuneaton Britain gives up smoking Filed Under: Smoking Tagged with essex , give tobacco , give up cigarettes , give up smoking , give up smoking hypnosis , give up smoking hypnotherapists , give up smoking hypnotherapy , give up smoking hypnotism , give up smoking london , Giving Up Smoking with , Giving Up Smoking with hypnosis , Giving Up Smoking with Hypnotherapy , Giving Up Smoking with hypnotism , giving up tobacco , london Digg it Save to Del.icio.us Subscribe to My RSS feed Add this to: 1 People Had Something To Say.
