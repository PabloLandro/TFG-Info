In principle, traditional Chinese treatment procedures concentrate mainly on the flow of energy throughout the entire body. The energy means the blood circulation and also the signals emerging from the central nervous system. This energy is considered to regulate the health and correct functioning of the various body organs such as the kidneys, liver and lungs. The Chinese concentrate on the flow of energy throughout the body along particular conduction paths, and these paths are called meridians or channels. Illness is assumed to be an obstruction in the flow of energy by means of such channels which produce the signs and symptoms of allergies, breathing problems, skin problems or sensitivity to certain substances. So, acupressure and acupuncture treatment solutions concentrate on stimulating certain points of the meridians that boost the flow of energy through the blockage and alleviate the body from pain and discomfort or even disease within a couple moments.
