You 
	may even begin to think that you will never be able to sleep well again. But it 
	doesnât have to be this way. Research continues to shed new light on the 
	process of sleep. This helps doctors know how sleep disorders affect the human 
	body. Once the source of a problem is found, it can then be treated. One of the 
	treatments listed below just might be the solution to your sleep problem. There 
	is hope for you, even if you canât remember the last time you had a good night 
	of sleep. Bright light therapy This is used to help treat disorders that result from a problem with the 
	internal clock in your body. Two of these disorders are jet lag and advanced 
	sleep phase. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) These methods teach you how to change actions or thoughts that hurt your 
	ability to sleep well. They will help you develop habits that promote a healthy 
	pattern of sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) This is the most common and effective way to treat obstructive sleep apnea. A 
	steady stream of air blows through a mask and into the back of the throat to 
	keep the airway open. Medications A number of drugs have been developed to help treat some sleep disorders. 
	Always get help from a doctor before using any of these drugs. Melatonin As a nutritional supplement, melatonin is most effective in the treatment of 
	certain circadian rhythm sleep disorders. These include jet lag, shift work and 
	delayed sleep phase. Oral appliances Similar to sports mouth guards, these devices protect your teeth and open the 
	airway as you sleep. They are used to treat bruxism, obstructive sleep apnea 
	and snoring. Surgery A number of surgical options are available to help people who suffer from 
	severe cases of obstructive sleep apnea. Copyright © 2010 American Academy of
