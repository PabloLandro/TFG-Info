
Treatment of female urinary incontinence Treatment of female urinary incontinence - an annotated evaluation of non-surgical therapeutic options By Hogne Sandvik Pelvic floor exercises Bladder training Oestrogen Other drugs Electrical stimulation References Female urinary incontinence (UI) is a condition with severe economic and psychosocial impact . I have studied the epidemiology of UI in the general female population and the prevailing management of UI by Norwegian general practitioners (GPs). Those who are interested in more details, may take a look at this synopsis . The main conclusions that may be drawn from these studies are that UI is very prevalent among adult women, mostly in the form of stress incontinence. At least 6% may be regarded as potential patients. Although complicated by methodological difficulties, studies of GPs' management indicate that available therapeutic tools (described below) are not used to their full potential. A literature review demonstrates that the history is the most important diagnostic tool in general practice, and that the value of clinical investigations is poorly documented. Pelvic floor exercises In 1948 Arnold Kegel described pelvic floor exercises as a
treatment option in stress incontinence.(1) The purpose of the
exercises is to increase the muscle volume and to develop
stronger reflex contractions following quick rise in intra-
abdominal pressure.(2) Lack of awareness of these muscles is common, and Kegel
stressed the importance of learning how "good" rather than how
"bad" the condition is. The patient is asked to draw up,
instead of to bear down, and the physician should confirm the
contractions by vaginal examination.(3) Many women do not know
how to contract their pelvic floor muscles,(4) and a brief
verbal explanation or an education pamphlet do not represent
adequate preparation for a patient who is about to pursue an
exercise programme.(5) Usually, it is recommended that contractions should be
sustained for 5-10 seconds followed by an equal period of relaxation.(2,6-9) Bø et al. demonstrated that a maximal
contraction for 6-8 seconds followed by 3-4 rapid contractions
were more effective than the usual exercise regimen of lower
intensity. However, this intensive exercise group also benefitted from a weekly session with instructor in groups.(2)
Development of muscular hypertrophy is a slow process and
probably needs longer exercise periods with maximal
tension.(2) Repeated series of contractions should be
performed every day, but the total number of recommended contractions vary between studies. Bø et al. used 30 per day,(2)
Jolleys 40,(10) Burgio et al. 50,(11) Lagro-Janssen et al. 50-100,(9) and Wells et al. 90-160.(12) As the treatment protocols vary between studies, it is
hardly surprising that the results also vary. Bø et al.
reported that 60% of the intensive exercise group were cured
or almost continent, 17% in the low intensity home exercise
group. Only the intensive exercise group demonstrated significant objective improvements (pad test, maximum resting
urethral closure pressure, pelvic floor muscular strength).(2)
The initial results were maintained five years later.(13) In a
larger study Hahn et al. reported that 71% were initially
cured or improved. After 2-7 years 25% had undergone surgery,
while 55% of the rest continued to be cured/improved. However,
the frequency of training during the follow-up period was
unsatisfactory in this study.(14) Two controlled studies on the effect of pelvic floor
exercises have been performed in general practice. Jolleys
reported that 41% were cured and 46% improved by the exercise
programme, while only 2% of controls were improved.(15) Lagro-Janssen reported that 85% were cured or improved, none in the
control group.(9) Who are most likely to benefit from pelvic floor
exercises? Bø & Larsen found that responders were older, had a
longer history of stress incontinence, a higher body mass
index, and more severe incontinence, compared with nonresponders.(16) However, other studies have found best outcome in
younger women(17) or in those with mild symptoms.(18) To help women gain control over their pelvic floor
muscles several devices have been constructed. Kegel developed
the perineometer, a pneumatic vaginal rubber tube recording
intravaginal pressure.(1) Burgio et al. demonstrated that
visual feedback of bladder pressure, abdominal pressure, and
sphincter activity was more effective than simple verbal
performance feedback.(11) Such devices are too sophisticated,
however, for routine use in general practice. Vaginal cones, on the other hand, may prove to be an
applicable aid to pelvic floor training in general practice.
The cones are carried in the vagina for 15 minutes twice a
day. They provide a powerful sensory feedback which makes the
pelvic floor contract around the cone and retain it. As the
pelvic floor muscles are strengthened, the weight of the cones
is gradually increased.(19) In controlled studies cones have
been at least as effective as routine pelvic floor exercises,
and requiring less time to teach.(20,21) Bladder training Different scheduling regimens are often recommended for the
treatment of uninhibited detrusor contractions. Timed voiding
or habit training implies voiding on a fixed schedule, while
in prompted voiding the patient is asked at regular intervals
about the need to void.(6,7) These regimens are widely used
with patients in nursing homes. For cognitively intact
patients bladder training (bladder drill) has become the most
popular treatment.(8,22-25) The main characteristics of bladder training are patient
education, scheduled voidings, and positive reinforcement.(26)
Emphasis is placed on the brain's control over lower urinary
tract function.(27) Patients are requested to void only when
scheduled, at progressively increasing intervals.(26,28) A
urinary diary should be kept as an aid to treatment and as a
motivating factor.(25,27-29) Close supervision and positive
affirmation are essential for success, and the patient should
be instructed in distraction and relaxation techniques.(27,28)
A positive effect is often seen already after a week,(28) and
unsuccessful training should not continue beyond 2-3
weeks.(27,28) The treatment of bladder instability is very dependent on
the placebo effect,(30) and uncontrolled studies should
therefore be viewed with scepticism. Frewen treated 55 women
with urge incontinence, and only one failed to respond. He
considered bladder training a therapeutic test of idiopathic
bladder instability. Failure to respond should raise suspicion
of an organic disorder.(25) Two controlled studies on the management of female incontinence in general practice also
included bladder training for urge incontinence, but the
results were either not reported separately for this
group,(31) or the treatment also included drugs.(15) Jarvis & Millar did a randomized controlled trial of
inpatient bladder drill with 60 women. After treatment 83%
were continent and symptomfree, compared with 23% of
controls.(32) In another randomized clinical trial with 123
women (aged 55-90) bladder training reduced the number of
incontinent episodes by 57% (controls 14%) and the quantity of
urine loss by 54% (controls increased 21%). The effect was
maintained at six months follow-up, and there was no
significant interaction between age group and treatment
efficacy.(33) The latter study also included women with stress incontinence, and the beneficial effect of bladder training was
evident for this group, too.(33) This surprising finding has
opposite parallels in other studies demonstrating that pelvic
floor exercises and vaginal cones may also be effective in the
treatment of urge incontinence.(34,35) It is hypothesized that
pelvic floor muscle contraction may result in reduced bladder
neck electrical conductivity.(35) Oestrogen Both general practitioners and patients may seem bewildered
with regard to the benefits and risks of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy.(36-38) The use of the less potent
natural oestrogen oestriol for the treatment of postmenopausal
urogenital complaints (including UI) should not be confused
with contraceptive pills or perimenopausal hormone replacement
therapy.(39,40) While oestriol is the most widely used low-potency oestrogen in Norway,(41) synthetic oestrogens are more
popular in USA.(6,39) Oestrogens may be administered orally, vaginally, or
transdermally. In a double-blind study using conjugated
oestrogen Hilton et al. found that vaginal administration was
most effective in relieving incontinence symptoms, while side
effects were more common with oral administration.(42) There
are, however, reservations as to extrapolating such findings
to the use of oestriol.(39) For some women convenience and
compliance may favour the use of oral administration. Most researchers who have developed and evaluated management programmes for female UI in primary care have included
the use of oestrogen in postmenopausal women.(15,43-45)
Guidelines and review papers also suggest that oestrogen may
be beneficial for incontinent women.(6,8,22-24,46,47) Some randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies
have demonstrated significant effect of oestrogen in stress
incontinence.(42,48,49) Others have found good clinical effect
in urge incontinence, but not in stress incontinence.(50,51)
Benness et al. failed to demonstrate an effect even in urge
incontinence, although the urgency symptom was improved.(52)
In a meta-analysis Fantl et al. concluded that oestrogen
therapy does have a beneficial subjective effect on
incontinent postmenopausal women, with an average 46%
improvement over placebo. Although still significant, the
effect is smaller (26%) when only genuine stress incontinence
is considered.(53) Other drugs Alpha-adrenergic agonists such as phenylpropanolamine may be
beneficial in the treatment of stress incontinence, especially
when combined with oestrogens.(42,48,49) A synergistic effect
is believed to be due to increased muscular tone of the
urethra (caused by phenylpropanolamine) and maturation of the
urethral mucosa (caused by oestrogen).(49) In a randomized
controlled trial involving 157 women (aged 55-90) the benefit
of phenylpropanolamine was comparable to that produced by
pelvic floor exercises.(12) Anticholinergic drugs are recommended for the treatment
of urge incontinence.(6,8,22-24,46) Terodiline, a drug with
both anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic properties, was
effective in reducing urge incontinence,(54) but was withdrawn
from the market because of serious side effects.(55) In Norway
only emepronium bromide remains as a registered drug for the
treatment of urge incontinence. In a double-blind cross-over
study comparing terodiline with emepronium bromide most
patients preferred terodiline.(56) In several randomized
double-blind studies emepronium bromide has failed to show
significant effect over placebo.(30,57,58) However, there are
other studies in which significant effect has been demonstrated.(59,60) Tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine or
doxepine, are also recommended for the treatment of urge
incontinence.(6,8,22,23,46) These drugs may work by their anticholinergic effects as well as being alpha-stimulators.(61)
In a small double-blind study imipramine tended to be more
effective than placebo, but the power of the study was too
weak to yield statistically significant results.(62) In a
double-blind cross-over study with doxepine similar results
were obtained, this time also statistically significant.(61) Electrical stimulation Electrical stimulation of the pelvic floor may be effective
therapy both for stress incontinence and urge
incontinence.(63-67) While urge incontinence is treated by
short-term maximal stimulation,(66,67) stress incontinence is
usually treated by long-term stimulation of lower
intensity.(63,64) Eriksen & Eik-Nes treated 55 stress incontinent women
awaiting surgical repair. After therapy 68% were continent or
had improved so much that the operation was cancelled. At two-year follow-up success was maintained in 56%.(63) In a randomized placebo-controlled trial electrical stimulation for
stress incontinence proved superior to a sham device, both for
objective and subjective parameters.(65) Another study showed
electrical stimulation and pelvic floor exercises to be
equally effective in the treatment of stress
incontinence.(64) Eriksen et al. also treated 48 women with urge incontinence. Clinical and urodynamic cures were obtained in 50% and
a significant improvement in 33%. At one-year follow-up a
persisting positive effect was found in 77%.(66) In a Swedish
study 63% were cured or had improved significantly.(67) Both
studies were done without control groups. So far, no
controlled study has been published on the effect of
electrical stimulation in urge incontinence. Since 1992 the Norwegian National Insurance has reimbursed the cost of electrical stimulators for home treatment of
female UI. An evaluation report was produced after two years.
Approximately one third of the patients were cured or substantially improved. Treatment effect was not dependent on the
doctor's status (general practitioner v. specialist), but the
effect correlated significantly with patient compliance. Ten
per cent found the treatment difficult to accomplish.(68)
Close follow-up and motivation for use seem to be necessary
for successful electrical stimulation at home.(63,68) This
aspect is probably illustrated by the lower success rates
found in this unselected general survey(68) compared with the
clinical trials.(63-67) References 1.     Kegel AH. Progressive resistance exercise in the
