AP) (CBS News) To circumcise or not to circumcise? New research suggests circumcision may protect against prostate cancer, adding a new reported benefit to the procedure. Circumcision can help prevent inflammation and infection, including sexually transmitted infections that may cause prostate cancer, the study found. Controversial circumcision ritual led to infant's death from herpes, says death certificate Circumcision rates slipping, says CDC: Why? Judge slices circumcision ban from San Francisco ballot For the study, researchers tested about 3,400 men and found that men who had been circumcised before their first sexual intercourse were 15 percent less likely to develop prostate cancer than uncircumcised men. The study, led by researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, is published in the journal Cancer . Circumcision, the surgical removal of the foreskin from the penis, is usually performed shortly after birth. Studies have found the procedure is linked with a reduced risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Still, circumcision is somewhat controversial, as some argue it's risky and unnecessary. How does circumcision help prevent sexually transmitted infections? The procedure toughens the inner foreskin and gets rid of the space that may help pathogens survive. "These data are in line with an infectious/inflammatory pathway which may be involved in the risk of prostate cancer in some men," study author Dr. Jonathan Wright, assistant professor of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, said in a written statement . "Although observational only, these data suggest a biologically plausible mechanism through which circumcision may decrease the risk of prostate cancer. Future research of this relationship is warranted." Should all men be circumcised to reduce their prostate cancer risk? "At the end of the day, we feel there's risks and benefits, and it's up to the parents to decide what is in the best interests of their child," Dr. Andrew Freedman, a pediatric urologist and a member of the circumcision task force at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told MyHealthNewsDaily . The takeaway message of the study is that sexually transmitted infections may play an important role in the development of prostate cancer, so the relationship between circumcision and STDs should be noted. The American Academy of Pediatrics, in its official policy statement , says circumcision has potential health benefits, including reduced risk bladder infections and transmission of HIV/AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases. But the academy said there were potential downsides, pointing to anecdotal reports of reduced sexual sensation in older men and evidence it can lead to painful complications like bleeding and infections.

I'm not sure of the exact reasoning for me being circumcised, but I was born right at the peak of circumcision rates in the United States, and in the region where it was most common. I am unhappy with the decision to have me circumcised. If I have a son, I will not have him circumcised, because it takes away his right to bodily integrity. There is no way for me to know exactly what I am missing, but I have begun the process of manually restoring my foreskin. Sensitivity has increased because the keratinization that inevitably occurs on the glans of a circumcised ***** is reversing. Keratinization occurs because of constant exposure of the glans to clothing and drying of the glans. In addition, circumcision removes a large amount of nerve endings. While there will inevitably be people that encourage you to circumcise him for hygienic or health reasons, hygienic and health problems related to the foreskin are so rare and easy to avoid and treat without circumcision. This article states that it reduces the risk for HPV (a fact that in itself is disputed), but Gardasil is much more effective. The bottom line though is that once a boy is circumcised, it cannot be undone. It is a permanent alteration to his body. If he chooses later in life, when he is able to understand what circumcision is, to get circumcised he will still have that choice if you leave him intact. Reply to this comment by newsieee March 12, 2012 2:13 PM EDT This is ridiculous. Science shows that circumcising girls also reduces the risk of HIV infection, and yet no one is saying that's a good idea. At the end of the day, its wrong. Let each man decide on his own whether he wants it, when he's 18 and over. There is a whole industry that makes money off of infant circumcision, and I bet their money funded this "research." Reply to this comment by frizzy140 March 12, 2012 3:07 PM EDT you are a fool; circumcision is a religious right in many faiths. Also, it was created for hygienic reasons. While not necessary in this day and age is still makes the ***** more attractive (ask any woman) PS: secret infant circumcision market/industry? i think you've gone off the deep end, bet you think Obama is a Muslim too by newsieee March 12, 2012 2:12 PM EDT This is ridiculous.

Reply to this comment by louis10003 March 12, 2012 1:21 PM EDT This is another example of biased news giving, which explains why many people turn to news sources such as Al Jazeera or RT news which is not mixed with personal agendas. What the headline of your article should have said is "Circumcision is in the decline in America". Because that is what all these articles about circumcision and the supposed health benefits of it are about, how to keep circumcision 'alive'? But you know like every other human being that circumcision done to a baby boy or girl is wrong. Now THAT would have been an article about truth. Reply to this comment by MikeCollin March 12, 2012 1:16 PM EDT There have been so many studies, everything from Herpes, HIV, HPV, cancer, UTI's foreskin infections, and foreskin problems such as Phimosis, Paraphimosis etc. each time they are published the anti-circ internet trolls start complaining that these studies are flawed and false. Its about time these trolls start realising that there are benefits to circumcision and parents are going to want to pass on these benefits to their sons... . Circumcision is not a cure all but it is considered by many to be a preventive measure. Yes condoms provides protection from these viruses, but you are living in a fantasy world if you think for one second that people always use them. Have you ever checked into unplanned pregnancies for example, especially among young people, i think this speakes for itself. If anything can be done to help give someone and better defence against any of these problems then maybe it should be considered more and parents should start requesting it more often. Reply to this comment by hope4agape March 12, 2012 12:56 PM EDT This story is factually incomplete ...I.E. "new study " This is actually the 5th study of the effects on circumcision and STD prevention. like "We hope these data will ultimately result in policy changes in recommending circumcision for young boys or adult men to decrease the rates of infection with HIV, HPV and herpes," said the lead author of the Ugandan study, Dr. Thomas Quinn, a senior investigator in infectious diseases at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. Results of Quinn's study appear in the March 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine." Only differnce is HPV has now been directly linked to Cancer Reply to this comment by zBriGuy March 12, 2012 12:32 PM EDT Do you know what else reduces the risk of STDs and any cancers associated with them? Safe sex. Education is the answer, not genital mutilation. It's their body, their choice. Reply to this comment by Evirustheslaye March 12, 2012 11:08 AM EDT yah, and hacking off your feet reduces the risk of experiencing foot fungus,but good hygiene is just as effective without the required mutilation.
