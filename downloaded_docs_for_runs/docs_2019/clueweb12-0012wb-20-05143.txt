It’s usually caused by too much pressure that’s been put on the spine causing excessive compression.  There are lots of nerves that run out from the disc, so when the disc bulges near one of the nerves, pain develops.  The [...] Posted in Upper Back Pain | Leave Comments » ?I Finally Feel Relaxed 27th October 2009 A common medication prescription given for back pain is for muscle relaxants.  Muscle relaxants work well when your muscles are so tense they cause back pain.  What I didn’t realize is that science doesn’t know for sure how muscle relaxants work on the muscles.  They just know they can calm your nerves [...] Posted in Upper Back Pain | Leave Comments » ?How Come That Needle Doesn’t Hurt? 15th October 2009 I like to try alternative forms of back pain treatment whenever possible.  Sometimes, the familiar stand-bys like analgesics or ice packs just don’t do the job of relieving the back pain.  Before I’d even consider having surgery, I’d look into all forms of treatment including acupuncture. Acupuncture has been around for over 5,000 years.

Even if it’s not back breaking labor, it still hurts.  The best way to deal with back pain that persists but is obviously not due to vertebrae or disc problems is to exercise.  If [...] Posted in Upper Back Pain | Leave Comments » ?What the X-Rays Show 6th October 2009 Usually, if the doctor decides he or she needs to actually look at the bones of the spine, an X-ray is ordered.  But even if you get an x-ray that doesn’t mean you’ll suddenly have all the answers.  The x-ray can only show bones and not muscles, tendons or ligaments.  So if [...] Posted in Upper Back Pain | Leave Comments » ?Childrens Physiotherapy for Early Intervention 22nd September 2009 Childrens physiotherapy is a broad term used to cover therapy given to a child age eighteen or younger. A physiotherapist, or physical therapist, is involved with a child from birth on upwards. Infants, toddlers and children may see a physiotherapist for any number of reasons, including those that are not caused by a physical illness [...] Posted in Physiotherapy | Leave Comments » ?Using Pilates for Back Pain Relief 18th September 2009 Pilates is a great exercise form that combines the best of both Eastern and Western techniques.  Pilates uses exercises, breathing and stretching to keep the muscles strong and limber.

The new cholesterol preventing drugs are on the list of “great discoveries” – for now.  Apparently drugs like Lipitor are statins, and statins can cause muscle weakness if used for long periods of time. In fact, some people are claiming they [...] Posted in Upper Back Pain | Leave Comments » ?Go Ahead and Shock Me 6th September 2009 When I think of electrical stimulation I can’t help but think of the old Frankenstein movies.  Yet electrical stimulation is used as one of the treatments for back therapy.  Of course, it’s been given a long medical name which is Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation or TENS.  It makes me want to ask [...] Posted in Upper Back Pain | Leave Comments » ?Snaking Bones 4th September 2009 We all know we have a spine, and we know it has a long snakelike design.  But not everyone knows what keeps it supple and able to survive all the tension and motion we expect it to handle.  The spine itself is made of vertebrae which are bones.
