It is called whooping cough, as the characteristic symptom is violent coughing followed by a “whooping” intake of breath. This condition usually affects children below 6 years old. It can easily be remedied when ‘caught’ in the early stages. Obviously, prompt treatment is vital. So, how does a person get rid of a whooping cough before it gets worse? There are various ways on how to get rid of a cough such as Pertussis. Since a bacterium sets off the disease, antibiotics are very effective. Erythromycin is currently the drug of choice and is taken for 2 weeks. It is very important to follow the medication regimen to prevent relapse and drug resistance. Other antibiotics that could be taken are Azithromycin and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. If families are more inclined to use home remedies, there are vegetables and herbs that can be utilized and diets that could be followed. Cabbage and spinach are boiled, while juice from garlic is extracted. Herbal medicines like Clove (Syzygium aromaticum) and Belleric Myroblan (Terminalia belerica) are helpful. With regard to diet, dairy products are temporarily eliminated as it contributes to phlegm build up. Citrus fruits are recommended to aid get rid of a whooping cough. Conservative treatments could be provided to get rid of a whooping cough as well. Increased fluid intake, offering a cool-mist vaporizer and keeping the home free from irritants is a couple of examples. Plenty of water and cool-mist vapors will help liquefy and loosen the associated mucus build-up while getting rid of irritants like fumes and smoke would avoid triggering the cough. In cases that medications and home therapies are not enough to stop the cough, the patient should probably be brought to the hospital for supportive care. Traditional treatments such as providing oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids can alleviate with probable difficulty in breathing and accumulation of phlegm respectively. Appropriate nursing care (e.g., proper positioning, mouth care, emotional support) could also do wonders for the patient. Although it is one of the vaccine-preventable diseases, a sum of 30 to 50 million and a rate of around 300,000 per year die from Pertussis. Needless to say, it is critical that the public, especially the infants and children, are vaccinated against this disease. And as the saying goes: “An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.” Posted by                        admin                                                 -
