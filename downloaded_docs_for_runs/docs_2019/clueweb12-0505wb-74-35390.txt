Notes: Electrolytes are electrically-charged atoms or groups of atoms that conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Known as ions, electrolytes are divided into ions: positively-charged (cations -- e.g., potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, hydrogen) negatively-charged (anions -- e.g., chloride, bicarbonate, sulphate, phosphate) Inhibitors: excessive vomiting, diarrhea, urinary losses, and sweating Drugs that deplete: cholesterol-lowering, diuretics, extensive use of laxatives Food sources: almost all foods Benefits: balances and regulates fluids between different areas and tissues important for nerve conduction maintaining smooth muscle contraction acid/base balance help some enzymes and hormones function Deficiency Symptoms: poor appetite nausea muscle cramps confusion apathy constipation irregular heartbeat Pam Duff, RN, CSNC October 2009 See References .
