definition of varicose - Benefits of Wearing Medical Compression Stockings definition of varicose - Benefits of Wearing Medical Compression Stockings Benefits of Wearing Medical Compression Stockings While patients who suffer from varicose veins and other venous disorders may be well aware of the benefits of wearing compression stockings, however many other active people may not.  Simple fact of the matter is that most everyone can benefit from wearing compression stockings on a regular basis. Compression stockings are not only a wonderful treatment for varicose veins but they can also promote leg health and prevent varicose veins in most people. They can be especially beneficial to working people who are standing or sitting for long periods of time during their daily routines. People like healthcare workers, bank teller, store clerks, travelers and such can realize an extremely large benefit from wearing compression stockings daily.   Wearing compression stocking on a regular basis may alleviate those tire aching legs people experience at the end of a long day. No need to come home and elevate those tired legs at the end of the day. The graduated compression action of stockings will softly massage the leg muscles all day while standing or sitting. This compression will prevent the venous blood in the legs from becoming sluggish and promote good blood flow from the legs back to the heart.  They will also prevent the pooling and back flow of the blood which causes the aching and may lead to other more serious venous conditions.  Many people who stand or sit for long periods of time will also experience swelling of the feet, ankles and lower legs. This can make shoes, socks and other clothing become tight and uncomfortable before the end of the day. Compression stockings can prevent this swelling if worn regularly. Constant leg swelling may also lead to other more serious conditions.   People who travel on a regular basis by and means often are sitting motionless for long periods of time. This is true not only on airplanes, but also in cars, trains, and other means of transportation. When legs remain motionless the muscles that usually pump the blood up the legs are not working and the blood remains pooling in the legs. This may cause achy feeling and swelling in the legs. This may also cause more serious conditions such as blood clots and deep venous thrombosis. People who travel should always wear compression stockings when traveling.  Compression stockings are considered medical devices used to treat venous disorders and are manufactured in several levels of compression for different types of conditions. However, compression stockings with the least compression level of 15 - 20 mmHg are designed to be used by everyone as a preventative medical device. These stockings come in various styles and colors designed for everyday wear by everyone. Compression stockings may be purchased without a prescription or an order from a doctor and are available online at www.thelaserveincenter.com at discount prices. Practically everyone can benefit from wearing compression stockings regularly and promote excellent leg health.
