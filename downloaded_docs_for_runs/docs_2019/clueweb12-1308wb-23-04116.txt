Site HTML Documents Images Multimedia Forums Tags Advanced Search Home » Foot & Ankle Conditions » Varicose Veins Text Size Print Bookmark Varicose Veins Varicose veins are usually due to improperly functioning valves within the veins. The veins typically appear prominent or look "raised."  The condition can cause swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet. The skin may become discolored due to leakage of blood into the surrounding tissues, and ulcers may form on the skin. The foot and ankle surgeon may advise use of compression stockings or other treatments.
