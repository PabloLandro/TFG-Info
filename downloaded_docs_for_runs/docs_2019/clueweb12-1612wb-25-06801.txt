In what is expected to reignite the debate over circumcision , a  group of Sydney specialists yesterday described the practice as “sound  health policy” in an editorial in the Medical  Journal of Australia . A group of medical experts are sure to reignite the circumcision debate / AAP “A wealth of research has shown that  the foreskin is the entry point that allows HIV to infect men during  intercourse with an infected female partner,” they wrote. “Soon  after the HIV pandemic was first recognised, much lower HIV prevalence  was found in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where more than 80 per cent of  males had been circumcised.” Sydney physician Alex Wodak said  encouraging parents to have their baby boys circumcised was “common  sense”, given that the proportion of new HIV cases in Australia  associated with heterosexual sex was increasing. But he said that the Royal Australasian College of Physicians  on Friday had endorsed a policy which recommended against routine circumcision of boys, despite accepting the increasing evidence of  health benefits. He said the Medicare rebate had also been eroded  so that the operation was unaffordable for low-income families. Dr  Wodak, of St Vincent’s Hospital, called on governments to remove  barriers to parents wanting their baby sons circumcised. “All  states and territories should allow this operation to be carried out in  the public hospital system,” he said. “We should be trying  nationally to get back to where we were in the 1950s and 60s where the  majority of infant males were circumcised.” Despite official  discouragement of the practice, Medicare statistics show a rise in the  rate of infant male circumcision in Australia from 13 per cent in 1998  to 19 per cent last year.
