Prednisone resistant,   and accompanied by swollen eyes, I finally managed to see an Immunologist. Allergy   testing was fairly consistent with what I already knew (dust mites, pollen, animal   hair, fish, nuts, intolerant to wheat and dairy) and a three month elimination   diet did nothing to help the symptoms. However Sporanox (an oral antifungal) seems   to be the only thing that keeps it under control. I think that Candida is probably   a huge factor, and perhaps something others should look into. It also turns out   that I have critically low levels of Vitamin D, which is a problem that my father   also has, who is a sufferer of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Since Vitamin D is essential   for the health of skin and the immune system, perhaps this is also something other   eczema/allergy sufferers could look into. I have also found a product called Vaseline   Intensive Rescue Relief & Repair Balm which is a really good thick, but not   too greasy moisturiser, good for really dry spots and reasonably priced. (November   2007) Candida & Probiotics - Carla, USA NEW STUDIES ARE NOW SHOWING THAT PROBIOTICS (FRIENDLY BACTERIA)   HELP MANY CHILDREN WITH ECZEMA & ALLERGIES. YEAST OVERGROWTH TAKES PLACE IN   THE STOMACH WHEN GOOD BACTERIA ARE KILLED OFF AND CANDIDA (YEAST) TAKES OVER,   SUPPRESSING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND RELEASING MICROTOXINS THAT MOST OF US ARE ALLERGIC   TO. IT CAN ALSO CAUSE LEAKY GUT SYNDROME, NOT ALLOWING THE FOOD TO DIGEST PROPERLY   AND LEAK INTO THE BLOOD STREAM CAUSING EVEN MORE ALLERGIES. I DON'T THINK YEAST   IS EVERYONE'S PROBLEM BUT I THINK A GOOD MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM   A CANDIDA YEAST CLEANSE. RAW GARLIC TAKEN AT NIGHT CUT UP OR PUT IN A GARLIC PRESS   THEN PUT A LITTLE WATER IN YOUR MOUTH DROP THE GARLIC IN AND CHASE IT WITH MORE   WATER. YOU WON'T HARDLY TASTE IT. IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT THE SMELL DRINK A LITTLE   LEMON WATER. IT WILL TAKE CARE OF ANY UNPLEASANT SMELL. THIS IS ONE OF THE CHEAPEST   WAYS TO CLEANSE QUICKLY. PROBIOTICS ARE GREAT AND SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR LIFE IF   YEAST SEAMS TO BE YOUR PROBLEM. YOU CAN GET THEM AT ANY HEALTH FOOD STORE POWDER,   CHEWABLE (FOR KIDS), LIQUID OR PILL.
