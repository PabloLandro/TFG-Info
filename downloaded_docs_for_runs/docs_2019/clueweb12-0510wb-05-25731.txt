For wildcards use an * With their ability to differentiate and become an ongoing source of cells that make up critical tissues and organs, stem cells have potential for new regenerative therapies and as new research tools for drug developers to test emerging therapies on diseased cells. For market-watchers in the pharmaceutical industry, the question is what potential they have and where they could take the market. Kalorama Information has tackled that question in Stem Cells: Worldwide Markets for Transplantation, Cord Blood Banking and Drug Development. Kalorama analyst Alison Sahoo has built models to determine the best, moderate and worst case scenarios for the three key markets for stem cells: Stem Cell Therapeutics (Transplantation) Cord Blood Banking and Drug development This report breaks down forecasted revenues and procedure volumes for stem cell technologies for these segments in the following disease areas: Cardiovascular disease Lung disease Arthritis Incontinence Osteoporosis Diabetes Cancer Orthopedics Infertility Alzheimer’s disease Burns (severe) Lupus Parkinson’s disease Liver failure Multiple sclerosis Critical limb ischemia Crohn's disease Sickle cell disease Multiple myeloma NH lymphoma Leukemia Ths report is the result of exclusive interviews with executives in the stem cell industry, a review of medical and company literature, government databases and publications.  As part of this comprehensive analysis of stem cell markets, the following companies were profiled: Aastrom Biosciences Advanced Cell Technologies Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Celegene Cord Blood
