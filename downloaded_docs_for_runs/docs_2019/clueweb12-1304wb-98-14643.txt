How to Get Rid of Back Pain   » 2011 » December Home Share this site with your friends: Dec 24, 2011 Comments Off How to Get Rid of Lower Back Pain? Take a Time-Off Categories: Uncategorized One of the medical advices clinical practitioners give to clients with back problems is encouraging people to stay active and return to their jobs. However, a few number of clinicians believe that best answer…continued below Make no mistake, go here: RIGHT NOW …continued from above …to the question ‘ how to get rid of lower back pain ?’ also requires rest from work. The time-off allows healing to take place. Recently, a study was published that most practitioners believed that some parts of work are disadvantageous to a client’s recovery. The same study revealed how back problems are identified as the second most common cause of absence from work in the United Kingdom. Around the globe, this problem has been considered as one of the top most costly health condition. Multiple of schools have been founded on advising people to rest and take a time-off from work seems to be influencing the clinical decisions of a number of doctors. Frequent episodes of low back pains have been related to work activities. To further explore the relationship of the problem and work, the Attitudes to Back Pain Scale for musculoskeletal practitioners were also included to further clarify the matter during the study. Actual pain experience vs. thoughts of possibly having a back problem is also explored. With medical professionals from University of London digging deeper into this matter, more and more objective findings are sprouting recently. The subjects of the study came from three groups of people: the osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists. To give a clear result on a health professional’s independent management on how to get rid of back pain , here are the digits: 80% of respondents recommended taking a time off from work and about 13% of these population confided that they do this thing often. Approximately 70% of practitioners have not made a direct assessment of clients while in the workplace and never made clear advises on how to specifically incorporate exercise routines to work activities. 83% of the respondents reported of incorporating exercise routines into the work activities. Only 2% of the practitioners prescribed a certification of sick leave for clients with low back pains. Physiotherapists from the National Health Service in UK strongly advise performing activities to aid in the recovery of back problems. This group of professionals more commonly gives this advice more than osteopaths and chiropractors who are working in a private sector. Furthermore, they believed that there is no exact relationship between the occurrence of back discomforts and work as the one exacerbating it. Physiotherapists also recommended decreasing the number of treatment sessions for the problem. The visitation of specialists directly in the workplace has been low in the conducted study.  In the earlier times, integration of care in work has shown a promising result. If returning to work is beneficial to clients and to the cost savings goals of the company, then I suggest that these practitioners should be more direct in their assessment, e.g. visiting the workplace. Through this way, ‘cost saving issues’ will not become the main factor. Because the primary goal dealing with the question: ‘ how to get rid of back pain ?’ is not the budget, neither the company but the clients themselves.
