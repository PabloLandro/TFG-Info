Though it may be particularly unusual with only about one hundred new cases recorded annually in the United Kingdom, a rather high ratio of cases are mismanaged. One of the more prevalent factors behind Cauda Equina Syndrome is during surgical treatment on the small of the back. Triggers o Damage; o Prolapsed or slipped discs; o Stenosis of the spine (narrowing of the normal front to back distance of the spinal canal); o Cancers of the spine; o Inflammation of the spine; o Infections of the spine; o Medical intervention like surgical procedures, which is one of the more common causes. Signs and symptoms The indicators of Cauda Equina Syndrome range from the following: o Lumbar pain o Pain in one or both legs which begins in the buttocks and travels down the back of the thighs and legs o Numbness in the groin o Bowel and bladder disturbance o Weakness and/or decrease of function of the lower limbs (legs) o Reduced or absent leg reflexes Recognition of Cauda Equina Syndrome is often delayed as it presents its self with bladder, intestinal and sexual dysfunctions which are obiquitous conditions and can have a wide range of triggers. Patients might not speak about some of these signs and symptoms since they are embarrassed about them.

With that said, there are telltale signs and symptoms for Cauda Equina Syndrome , including: o Severe lower back pain; o Sciatica; o Perineal and genital sensory numbness; o Bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction; o Absent urinal excretion for six to eight hours. With regards to management of Cauda Equina Syndrome , it is essential for the specialist to establish if the syndrome is incomplete or complete.
