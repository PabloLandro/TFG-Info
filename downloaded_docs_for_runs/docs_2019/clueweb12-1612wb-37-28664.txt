Read About Lupus Drug Treatment Options Python Forum Home Privacy Terms Contact Read About Lupus Drug Treatment Options At one time, lupus treatment was bleak. Drug-induced Lupus was often misdiagnosed so treatment wasn't fitting the need. These days, with greater understanding, drug induced lupus treatment options make it possible for men and women to lead full active lives. Lupus, an autoimmune condition, occurs in folks for various reasons and no two people have the same exact cause, signs, or even necessarily treatment. SLE develops when your own immune system starts attacking vital organs and tissues within your body causing irritation and pain to occur. Drug induced lupus is brought on by adverse reactions to prescriptions and is just like systemic sle. Some prescription medications that have been identified to bring forth drug-induced sle are: - Hydrazine (muscle mass relaxant to treat high blood pressure levels) - Isoniazid (utilized in the treatment and protection against TB) - Methyl dopa (used for hypertension) - Penicillamine (a heavy metal antagonists employed in the treatment of joint disease and arthritic conditions) - Procainamide (helpful to treat irregular heart tempos) - Quinidine (employed to treat or prevent many types of irregular heartbeats) - Sulfasalazine (utilized to treat slight to reasonable ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease, and RA) - Thorazine (anti-psychotic treatment) Substance reactions to cellular matter within your body causes your body to develop antibodies. These antibodies battle the healthful tissues in your body. Drug-induced lupus treatment is symptomatic based. Signs or symptoms occur in general after taking the previously listed medication for as much as 3 to 6 months and often times the symptoms of lupus will go away within several days to a couple of weeks after ceased usage of the previously listed medication. That is certainly one treatment for drug-induced sle. We must consider that these treatments will not address the actual causes.
