Got Low Back Pain? Try This Back to Back Issues Page Got Low Back Pain? Try This February  11, 2010 Got Low Back Pain? Try This If you have lower back pain there are a number of self-help methods you can try. For example: stretching exercises, herbal pain patches and self-massage. All of the above techniques are covered on my Chinese exercises site. The one I want to emphasize today is the Lumbar Rub - a quick, easy and VERY effective self-massage technique for the lower back. I should know - I have had a lower spine problem for over 20 years and the Lumbar Rub is one technique I do every day, whether my back is sore or not. Rubbing your lower back is a classic Chinese exercise not only for lower back pain but also to stimulate your kidneys. The kidneys, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine, are THE most important organ. To learn how to do the Lumbar Rub to stop lower back pain, stimulate your kidneys and more, see here.
