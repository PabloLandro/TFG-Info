The fan draws the moist air through the cold evaporator coil, which cools the air below its dew point. Moisture forms on the evaporator coil and is collected in the condensate tray before draining away through the condensate tube. The cooled air then passes through the hot condenser coil where it is reheated using the same energy removed during the cooling phase, plus the additional heat generated by the compressor. The air is, therefore, discharged from the dehumidifier at a slightly higher temperature with a lower absolute humidity than that which entered. Continuous circulation of air through the dehumidifier gradually reduces the relatively humidity within the area. Because the CD100 range of units are equipped with an internal humidistat, they automatically switch on and off to save energy and expense by maintaining the desired level of humidity with intermittent operation. The additional features of the CD100E make the unit the ideal choice for installations where remote monitoring is required. The alarm humidistat can be adjusted and present during the installation process and will provide means of identifying a high humidity condition.
