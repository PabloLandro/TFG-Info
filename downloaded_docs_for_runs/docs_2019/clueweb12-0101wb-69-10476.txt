        a popular and effective option in the fight to help patients lower their 
        weight and improve weight-related health risks. However, no matter what 
        type of bypass procedure you choose - be it Roux-en-Y, or Duodenal Switch 
        - or whether it is performed using "open" or laparoscopic techniques, 
        be aware that it won't work unless you follow the proper post-operative 
        diet and exercise guidelines. Due to the extreme severity of the typical post-bypass diet , be sure 
        to ask your bariatric surgeon about post-surgery support groups and other 
        patient suppport facilities. Finally, before deciding on any weight loss operation, consult your doctor 
        about all your options, including non-surgical weight reduction methods. Obesity Clinics in
