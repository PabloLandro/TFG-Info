In his article entitled “Innovative Stroke Rehabilitation Acupuncture: The Benefits of Integrative Therapy” Maeda writes about his experience as a stroke acupuncture specialist treating stroke survivors with Xing Nao Kai Qiao (XNKQ) acupuncture stroke therapy. Maeda recounts his time as a staff acupuncturist in the stroke rehabilitation unit at Kuroda Hospital in Tokyo where “patients benefited from the integrative care as physical therapists and occupational therapists worked alongside acupuncturists to enhance a patient’s recovery.” To advance integrative stroke rehabilitation in the US, Maeda recently took up a position as director of the Stroke Rehabilitation and Dementia Care Clinic at Emperor’s College Acupuncture Clinic.  And he’s asking patients and caregivers for their support in spreading the word about the efficacy of acupuncture stroke therapies: “Without you, the acupuncture stroke therapy will not make it out of the doors of Oriental medicine clinics. You have the power to help promote this acupuncture protocol at Western medical hospitals, at rehab centers and in your local support group.” You can read Atsuki Maeda’s article here .
