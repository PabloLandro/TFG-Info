Auburn Center The Nantucket Center The Maine Center The Seacoast, NH Center International Patients Acupuncture Acupuncture is a healing method that was developed in China at least 2,000 years ago. At the Domar Center , our approach to acupuncture incorporates traditions from China, Korea, and Japan. We use traditional thin, metallic needles and manipulate them by hand to balance energies in the body. People experience acupuncture differently, but most feel no or minimal pain. Some people are energized by treatment, while others feel deep relaxation. The Domar Center for Mind/Body Health offers acupuncture sessions for all conditions -- and pre/post embryo transfer  -- seven days per week. TREATABLE CONDITIONS Research studies have shown that acupuncture treatments both before and after an embryo transfer in infertility patients may help to improve pregnancy rates. It has been shown that acupunture can increase blood flow to the endometrium, helping to facilitate a thick, rich lining. Several studies have also investigated the impact of acupuncture in men with low sperm counts. CLICK HERE or call (781) 434-6578 to schedule an acupuncture session. While it is true that acupuncture is used to treat muscles, bruises and bodily injuries, it can also be used quite effectively to treat issues like: infertility (balances hormones, decreases stress and anxiety during fertility treatments) menstrual disorders (PMS, menstrual pain, irregular or infrequent periods) perimenopause/menopause (decreases hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, anxiety/depression) pain relief while in labor brief labor duration post-natal recuperation post-partum depression morning sickness chronic pain autoimmune disorders OUR ACUPUNCTURE STAFF Lili Cai, Lic.
