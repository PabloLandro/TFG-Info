Ask Dr. Ross in Albuquerque, NM - High Desert Dental Tips on Preventing Tooth Decay Most people in the Albuquerque area know that preventing dental decay and cavities starts with adequately brushing and flossing your teeth. Fluoride products can also help keep teeth healthy. But often no matter how well you brush and floss, tooth decay can occur, especially in the back of the mouth where proper cleaning can be difficult. Taking additional preventative measures can reduce the risk of tooth decay for teeth in the back of the mouth. The American Dental Association now recommends all children receive sealants on their new adult teeth soon after they erupt, usually between 6 and 12 years of age. Sealants consist of plastic coating that can be applied quickly and painlessly, and clinical studies report a 90-100% reduction in decay by placing sealants. Regular dental visits will allow Dr. Gary McCabe Ross to monitor the progression of adult teeth and apply sealants at the appropriate time.
