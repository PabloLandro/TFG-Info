A majority of you who come to us to begin training not only come for fitness and nutrition with training, but also to do something – in some fashion – to alleviate the low-back pain! In the past few weeks there have been more discussions with various clients of mine concerning their back pain, recent “flare-ups,” and other related low-back inquiries. For that reason, we’re including a non-Holiday related post directed only at low-back pain in order to shed some light on what is going on. So enjoy the below info on low-back pain, and don’t ever hesitate to let us know your thoughts or what we can do to help you alleviate yours including a qualified referral to our friends at MFC Spine & Sports here in Round Rock, of whom recently adjusted my wife’s back/hips and she hasn’t complained since (about the back of course! JOKE!). Basis The spine is made up of 24 vertebrae, which are cushioned by tough, fibrous and gelatinous intervertebral disks arranged in three curves that form a natural S shape. The cervical spine supports the head. The ribs, which protect the internal organs, are attached to the thoracic spine. The lumbar spine, which is the workhorse of the spine and the site of low-back pain, absorbs nearly all torso stress when you stand, sit or move. When the cervical curve, thoracic curve and lumbar curve are properly aligned; you are less vulnerable to injury and pain. Trouble in The Fourth and Fifth The term “low-back pain” usually refers to pain in the lumbosacral area of the spine encompassing the distance from the first lumbar vertebra to the first sacral vertebra. This is the area of the spine where the lordotic curve forms. The most frequent site of low-back pain is in the fourth and fifth lumbar segments. Before we discuss physical activity and exercise, let’s review what we know at this time about low-back pain: At some time in their lives, 60-80 percent of people in the U.S. will have low-back pain. In 30-70 percent of sufferers, the pain will recur. For 80-90 percent of acute assaults of back pain, recovery takes from three days-six weeks. The problem becomes chronic for 5-10 percent of sufferers. Men and women are affected equally. There’s evidence that 12-26 percent of children and adolescents experience low-back pain, although most cases occur in persons between the ages of 25-60, and incidence peaks at about age 40. Low-back pain and disability do not progressively increase with age and do not correspond to age-related changes of disk degeneration.  It is not clear why low-back pain peaks at about the age of 40. The majority of people suffering from low back pain cope with it themselves, without seeking adequate treatment. There is no definitive indication that any treatment for low-back pain is superior to other methods.  Evidence shows that interventions provide only modest success for unknown duration. People missing work for longer than 6-months because of low-back pain have a 50% probability of ever returning to work.  Long absence from work depends more on socioeconomic and job-related influences than on the severity of the physical condition. In the absence of scientifically validated guidelines for the treatment and prevention of low-back pain, the determination of exercise programs has been guided largely by empirical knowledge. Most Chiropractors, Fitness specialists, and health-related Professionals all agree that treatment should focus on known deficiencies.  Sufferers typically lack normal levels of flexibility, strength, control and endurance in various muscles of the trunk, including the lumbar and abdominal muscles.  These patients/clients are often overweight and deconditioned. Therefore, the role of exercise in the treatment and prevention of low-back pain should be to correct or improve these deficiencies. The Importance of Exercise to Back Care For other parts of the body, the use of exercise to improve strength, mobility, coordination and endurance has been well recognized. However, these facets of exercise are not well understood in relation to back pain. Here is a list of reasons to prescribe exercise for back pain: To decrease pain To strengthen muscles To decrease mechanical stress to spinal structures To improve fitness levels To prevent injury To stabilize hyper-mobile segments To improve posture To improve mobility Additionally, an exercise program should incorporate activities to improve motor control and body awareness. The Role of Muscular Strength Much emphasis has been placed on muscular strengthening exercises to stabilize and support the trunk area. Several arguments justify this rational for the treatment and prevention of low-back pain, For instance, the degree of stability and support of the trunk area depends largely on the strength of the supporting structures and the muscles. Improper vertebral alignment can result from weak back extensor muscles, which may lead to undue loading on the spine. Stronger muscles can enhance the spine’s ability to withstand various degrees of external loads. In industry, workers with high levels of muscular strength are less prone to back injury. The fact that patients suffering from low-back pain exhibit lower levels of trunk extension, trunk flexion and lateral flexion strength than non-suffering persons suggests a need to alleviate this dissimilarity. The greatest losses in strength have been found in the trunk extensor muscles. In healthy, normal persons, a natural imbalance is expected, with the lumbar extensors being stronger than the lumbar flexors. The trunk extensors in a healthy person are approximately 30 percent stronger than the trunk flexors. ___________________________________________________ For help assessing how exercise and fitness could help with your low-back pain, as well as outlining the do’s and don’ts to fitness training with low-back pain, contact Fitness Mastermind today .
