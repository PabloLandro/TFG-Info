This means that between 13  to 20 % of the population in the United States have a disability . Some examples of disabilities include brain injury, cerebral palsy, ADHD  also known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and birth  defects. The 5th leading cause of possible life lost is birth defects  and they significantly contribute to long term disability and childhood  morbidity.  There are currently available programs in many states to  prevent and improve the surveillance of birth defects.  The National  Birth Defects Prevention Network includes community based  and state  program, that many states participate in, in which they are able to  retrieve the impact that birth defects have on health care, families,  and children.  There are many state programs created together with  federal programs to aid disabled individuals.  A standard state  programs goal is to aid disabled individuals by providing support in  order to bypass serious secondary conditions that may arise for  inadequate  health care and inactivity, increase their productivity and  independence, promote their well being and health, or helping them gain  better health services access. There are currently a host of birth defects that the CDC also known as  the Center for Disease Control helps with such as with the issue of  autism.  The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental  Disabilities facilitates the health of adults, children, and babies.   The CDC gives funds to projects on a number of ASDs also known as autism  spectrum disorders within several states.  The goal of these projects  are to keep track of the amount of children that have ASD, administer  studies in order to understand the aspects that contribute to a child  having ASD, and provide outreach and education program for families,  researchers, and other who may be associated with ASD.

The number for pre-diabetes is estimated  as twice as much and it is a good chance that they will develop into  diabetes.  The annual cost of diabetes is around $ 174 billion in lost  productivity and medical costs.  The medical costs for individuals with  diabetes is 5 times higher annually than individual without diabetes. There are programs concerning the management of, prevention,  education,  improvements in quality care, those that help raise awareness, detect  diabetes earlier,  and help prevent complications conducted by health  departments in all fifty states, as well as the eight United States  territories and the District of Columbia.  Diabetes prevention programs  can reduce costs with treating diabetes as well as improve the quality  of lifer.  The health care costs can be cut as much as $9 when just $1  is spent educating individuals with the disease understands how to  manage diabetes. What is Diabetes? Diabetes occurs when an individual’s body can not make (type 1) or can  not appropriately use (type 2) something called insulin which lets the  body change the sugar from foods energy the cells need. When  uncontrolled can lead to a host of health problems such as: * The risk of stroke and heart disease related deaths are 2-4 times higher among individuals with diabetes * Among individuals age’s 20-74 diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness. * Diabetes is the #1 leading cause of kidney disease * Over 60 percent of non traumatic lowercase amputations are among those that have diabetes The risk of developing diabetes of those born after 2000 is:  four in  ten Hispanics and African Americans, three in ten for all Americans and  five in ten for Hispanic females.

With  such startling statistics as this, diabetes is rapidly becoming an  important issue in America today, and knowing the basics of this  increasingly relevant disease is more pressing than ever. Here are some  basic details about diabetes. At its most simple, diabetes is related to the level of glucose (sugar)  within the blood and the production of insulin within the body. After  food has been eaten, it turns into glucose in the blood stream.  Hyperglycemia is when a high level of glucose is found in the blood,  while hypoglycemia is when a low level of glucose is found in the blood  stream. An easy way to remember which is which is to remember that  someone is â€œhyperâ€ when he has too much sugar. In diabetes, insulin production is controlled by the pancreas. Insulin  is the hormone that breaks down the glucose in the bloodstream into  energy that the body can use. The body needs a balanced amount of  glucose and insulin in order to continue performing its daily functions.  Too much or too little of either is harmful to the body. Diabetes is broken into three different types. In Type 1 (sometimes  called juvenile diabetes), the pancreas no longer produces enough  insulin to keep the body’s glucose levels in check, and it must be  injected instead. In Type 2, the pancreas may still produce insulin, but  the body is more resistance to it. The third type of diabetes is called  gestational diabetes, and occurs only in women during pregnancy. Diabetes is often genetic, but it can also be diagnosed in people who do  not have a history of diabetes in their family. Some of the warning  signs of diabetes are frequent need to increased thirst, urinate,  fatigue, and weight loss.

November 30, 2010 By admin Leave a Comment Many people do not realize how common gestational diabetes is.  Nearly 5 percent of all pregnant women get this condition during their pregnancy.  Almost all, if not all pregnant women get tested for gestational diabetes.  Generally this testing happens between weeks 24-28.  Occasionally the testing will be done early.  The reasons for early testing include a family history of diabetes or gestational diabetes, personal history, or other possible concerns, such as being overweight before the pregnancy. So, why is gestational diabetes such a problem?  Having too much sugar in the blood, or glucose, is not good for the growing baby, and can in fact, cause some major health problems.  Many times, the baby may be too large, which can result in a medically necessary c-section.  The problems can even be fatal, if the disease is not controlled at all. When a woman is pregnant, there are many things that do not pass between her body and the placenta.  Unfortunately for many, glucose is not one of these things.  When you are pregnant, if your blood sugar is high, so is your baby’s.  Luckily, for most women, gestational diabetes goes away after the baby is born, though it can increase your risks of developing diabetes later in life. If you have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, it is generally fairly easy to control.  Many women are able to control their blood sugar with just diet and a little exercise.  There are medications available for those that are unable to control it this way, including pills and insulin shots.  After being diagnosed, you will most likely meet with a dietitian who will be able to help you understand what you need to be doing with your diet.  You will also most likely be monitored more closely by your doctor.  To make sure that the baby is doing alright, many times extra ultrasounds and non stress tests will be done during your pregnancy, as well. Filed Under: Medical Questions Tagged With: Diabetes mellitus , Gestational diabetes , Pregnancy Walk for your Health November 19, 2010 By admin Leave a Comment Taking a walk is one of the easiest, most healthy things you can do for your body.  It can help with everything from controlling your weight to even strengthening your bones.  Walking helps improve how well your heart and lungs work, as well as burns body fat.  It also helps raise your metabolism.  Taking a walk before or after a meal can help you burn off that meal much faster.  For many people, taking a walk can even help relieve stress. If you have health issues, most can be helped by just taking a walk each day.  If you are trying to lower your blood pressure, taking a walk will help you with this.  Many diabetic people decide to walk as their exercise.  When you move a muscle, it uses up the sugars in that muscle, and then pulls more sugar from the bloodstream.  This is important in helping control diabetes.  If you have had a heart attack or stroke, getting on a daily walking schedule can help you rehabilitate.  Many people who suffer from insomnia find that taking a walk each day will help them sleep better at night. Many doctors state that walking is better than jogging or running.  This is because almost everyone can take a walk.  It is much less stressful on joints, and therefore much easier for many people to do on a regular basis.  Most people can also walk for a much longer period of time than they could run or jog.  Taking a walk does not require a large financial investment, lots of equipment, or a gym membership, which makes it the easiest and best exercise for many people. Whether you are deciding to walk because of health problems, to lose weight, or just to help your stress levels, making the decision to take a walk each day is something that is significant in keeping your body healthy and strong.
