        Advisory Panel on Newer Laparoscope-Assisted Bariatric Surgical Techniques As to whether new bariatric procedures like laparoscopic gastric bypass 
        or laparoscopic gastric banding improve patient outcomes as compared to 
        open gastric bypass, and whether variations on gastric bypass improve 
        outcomes for patients with super-obesity, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
        Association Medical Advisory Panel made the following judgments about 
        whether newer approaches to bariatric surgery meet the Blue Cross and 
        Blue Shield Association Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) criteria. 1. The technology must have final approval from the appropriate governmental 
        regulatory bodies. 2. The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning the 
        effect of the technology on health outcomes. The evidence is not sufficient to form conclusions about the relative 
        efficacy and morbidity of less-invasive approaches to bariatric surgery, 
        specifically laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic gastric banding. 
        The evidence allows crude comparisons of weight loss outcomes between 
        procedures at 1 year, but is not sufficiently robust to make meaningful 
        comparisons at longer time intervals. The evidence is also not adequate 
        to determine comparative rates of adverse events. For laparoscopic gastric bypass, the available evidence suggests that 
        weight loss outcomes are similar to open gastric bypass at 1 year. Because 
        of the technical complexity of this operation, there is concern for short-term 
        complications such as anastomotic leaks. Leakage of intestinal contents 
        causes peritonitis, which can be life threatening and usually requires 
        reoperation. The comparative rates of these serious adverse events cannot 
        be determined from the data, leaving considerable uncertainty as to the 
        relative safety of laparoscopic bypass. There are very little data on 
        outcomes longer than 1 year for this procedure. For laparoscopic gastric banding, the available evidence suggests that 
        weight loss at 1 year is less than that achieved with gastric bypass. 
        More limited evidence on 3-year weight loss suggests that this difference 
        in weight loss may lessen over time. Early adverse event rates are low 
        following laparoscopic gastric banding, and are probably lower than gastric 
        bypass. There is a higher rate of long-term adverse events, and there 
        are a number of potentially serious long-term adverse events such as band 
        slippage or erosion. The available data are not sufficient to determine 
        the rates of these longer-term adverse events with confidence. There are limited data on outcomes of bilio-pancreatic diversion and/or 
        long-limb gastric bypass for patients with super-obesity. There are no 
        high-quality comparative trials and only limited clinical series data 
        for these indications. These limited data do not establish that these 
        or other variants (e.g., duodenal switch) have any additional benefit 
        for patients with super-obesity, as compared to gastric bypass. 3. The technology must improve the net health outcome; 4. The technology must be as beneficial as any established alternatives. There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether these procedures (i.e., 
        laparoscopic gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric banding, bilio-pancreatic 
        diversion, long-limb gastric bypass) either improve the net health outcome 
        or whether they are as beneficial as current established surgery, open 
        gastric bypass with Roux-en-Y anastomosis. 5. The improvement must be attainable outside the investigational 
        settings. Whether these procedures (i.e., laparoscopic gastric bypass, laparoscopic 
        gastric banding, bilio-pancreatic diversion, long-limb gastric bypass) 
        improve health outcomes has not been demonstrated in the investigational 
        setting. Conclusion Based on the above, laparoscopic gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric 
        banding, bilio-pancreatic diversion, or long-limb gastric bypass do not 
        meet the TEC criteria. Back to Start of Article Source: Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Assessment Program Volume 18, No. 10,

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
