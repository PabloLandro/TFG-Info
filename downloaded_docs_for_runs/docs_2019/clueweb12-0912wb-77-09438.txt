Wednesday, March 3rd, 2010 Support hose (also known as compression stockings) are designed to deliver a squeezing to the leg that is greatest at the foot and ankle. The degree of squeezing or compression gradually decreases up the leg – this is called gradient compression and is measured in mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Support hose provide two main benefits. Compression reduces and helps prevent swelling, also called edema. And compression helps the blood to flow more quickly up the leg toward the heart. Please consult your physician, podiatrist or health care specialist before purchasing support hose, especially for compression of 20mmHg or greater. Support hose range from light compression (generally 8-15mmHg) to firm compression (generally 30-40mmHg). Common Indications (there are other indications as well, please consult your physician): Tired, Aching Legs – Standing or sitting for long periods of time can cause blood to pool at the ankles and have a hard time returning causing legs to ache and feel tired. 8-15mmHg compression stockings give a gentle squeeze at the ankles and up the leg to get your blood flowing back toward the heart. Helps relieve the tired, aching feeling in your legs. Swelling/Edema – Enlarged ankles/calves/feet. Painless swelling may be caused from medications, injury, vein problems, heart problems or other reasons. Prolonged swelling or painful swelling of the foot or leg should not be ignored and your physician should always be consulted. Mild swelling is often managed with 15-20mmHg of compression. Moderate or severe swelling may require higher compression and your physician should be consulted. Varicose Veins – Varicose veins can be mild to severe. They are caused from pooling of blood in a damaged vein. Symptoms include bulging veins, aching and discomfort in the leg, heaviness of the leg and/or inflammation of superficial veins. 20-30 mmHg is the most commonly used level of compression for varicose veins. The compression level that is best for you will depend on the severity of your symptoms and you should consult your physician before wearing compression 20 mmHg and greater. Venous Insufficiency - Damaged valves in the veins can cause blood to pool in the leg and lead to swelling and pain. This condition is called chronic venous insufficiency which can lead to skin damage and leg ulcers. Symptoms include varicose veins, daily swelling of the leg, skin color changes, especially around and above the ankles, and fragile skin that easily breaks down. Compression of 30-40mmHg (generally knee length) is the most commonly used to manage this condition. Consult your physician before wearing any compression 20 mmHg and greater.
