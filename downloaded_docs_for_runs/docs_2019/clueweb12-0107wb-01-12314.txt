Save Your Life with Cinnamon Spice! by Steven Joyal, M.D. Save Your Life with Cinnamon Spice! by 
        Steven Joyal, M.D. • Ft. Lauderdale, FL We are in the midst
of an epidemic of
metabolic disease.
As our waistlines bulge ever
wider, our blood sugar levels
rocket upwards, far past 90
mg/dL, the upper limit of the
healthy blood sugar range. Delicious cinnamon, that versatile and
        amazingly aromatic spice, offers impressive
        health benefits apart from culinary
        use. Scientific research clearly shows that
        in addition to weight loss and exercise,
        phytonutrients from cinnamon can help
        support healthy blood sugar levels in
        several different ways. A fun way to add
            cinnamon into your
            daily health regimen
            for the coffee addicts
            among us (you know
            who you are!) is to add
            approximately 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon
            of ground cinnamon daily to fresh
            ground coffee before brewing. The
            hot water helps to liberate the watersoluble
            compounds in cinnamon
            responsible for the remarkable blood
          sugar benefits of this spice. A staple of traditional Ayurvedic medicine,
cinnamon is native to tropical southern
India and Sri Lanka. One of the worlds
most versatile spices, cinnamon flavors
everything from oatmeal and apple cider to
spiced cappuccino. Impressive new research
reveals that regular use of cinnamon can
promote healthy blood sugar metabolism. A study performed at the US Department
        of Agricultures Beltsville Human
        Nutrition Research Center, isolated specific
        water-soluble compounds in cinnamon
        spice that help prevent metabolic defects
        associated with diabetes. Three water-soluble
        chemicals called polyphenol polymers
        were found to have beneficial biological
        activity, boosting glucose metabolism by
        roughly 20-fold in experiments. Scientists
        at Iowa State University determined that
        these polyphenol polymers are able to
        boost the expression of genes involved in
        blood sugar metabolism, facilitating
        blood sugar uptake into cells and lowering
        blood sugar levels. Other experimental studies show the benefit of cinnamon
        at helping to counteract the damaging
        effects of a diet high in the simple sugar
        fructose, found in high fructose corn
        syrup (HFCS). Because the risk of cardiovascular disease
        is increased up to four-fold in type II diabetes,
        natural nutrients that simultaneously
        improve blood sugar metabolism and
        cholesterol levels offer great protection.
        Controlling blood sugar levels is
        a challenging, but crucial aspect
        of diabetes self-management,
        because poorly controlled
        blood sugar is associated
        with an increased risk
        for complications
        of the disease.
        When 79
        patients
        with
        type II
        diabetes
        took cinnamon
        extract supplements three times daily for
        four months, their fasting blood sugar
        levels dropped by an impressive 10.3%.
        Furthermore, people who had higher
        initial blood sugar levels benefited even
        more from cinnamon supplementation. In a human clinical study published in Diabetes Care , cinnamon proved to be a
        dual-action agent. Sixty adults (30 men, 30
        women) with type II diabetes were divided
        into six groups. The first three groups
        consumed one, three, or six grams of cinnamon
        daily, while the other three groups
        consumed equivalent numbers of placebo
        capsules. About one gram of ground
        cinnamon is found in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon. The spice or placebo was consumed for
        a 40-day period, followed by a 20-day
        washout period. After the initial 40-day
        period, all three dose levels of cinnamon
        reduced fasting serum blood sugar levels
        by 18-29%. The one-gram cinnamon dose
        also reduced triglyceride levels by 18%,
        low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 7%,
        and total cholesterol by 12%. Higher doses
        of cinnamon produced even greater
        reductions in triglycerides, LDL, and total
        cholesterol. Even better, these decreases persisted
        throughout the 20-day washout period.
        While glucose and triglyceride levels
        increased modestly during the washout
        period compared to day-40 levels, they
        remained below the levels recorded
        before cinnamon supplementation began.
        Meanwhile, LDL and total cholesterol
        levels continued to decline throughout the
        20-day period after cinnamon use stopped.
        This study suggests that cinnamon has sustained effects , so the benefits should
        continue even if a dose is occasionally
        missed. So spice up your life with cinnamon  your
        blood sugar level will thank you for it! Dr. Steven Joyal, M.D. , is Vice President of
