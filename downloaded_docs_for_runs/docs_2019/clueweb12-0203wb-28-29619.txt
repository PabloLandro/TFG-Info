'Hypnosis is the most effective way of giving up smoking" - New Scientist ( vol 136). Contrary to many claims from hypnotherapists stopping smoking with hypnosis does require some will-power. However it is proven that with hypnotherapy you are at least five to fifteen times more likely to succeed than by willpower alone! In 1992 New Scientist Magazine published the results of an extensive clinical study on the most effective smoking cessation methods. A meta-analysis, statistically combining the results of more than 600 studies (over 72,000 individual cases) showed that single session hypnosis increased a smoker's success chance by 1000% from 6% to 60%. Here are the success rates for different smoking cessation methods: 60% - Single session Hypnosis 24% - Acupuncture 10% - Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) 6% - Willpower alone These impressive figures are for hypnosis alone - and include many hypnotherapists using hypnosis alone and often antiquated methods. Using modern clinical hypnotherapy combined with cognitive behavioural therapy these results will improve considerably. Time to become a non-smoker?
