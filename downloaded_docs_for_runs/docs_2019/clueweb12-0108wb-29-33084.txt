Muscle Cramps Health Guide - Health Guides Online Home Sitemap Muscle Cramps Health Guide What are they? A cramp occurs when a muscle, often in the leg or hand, contracts and fails to relax.  The contraction causes a build-up of lactic acid which results in pain. What causes them? A lack of potassium, sodium or magnesium can lead to muscle cramps. Pregnant women and people who work in hot environments and sweat a lot often suffer from cramps. What can be done? Treat muscle cramps by massaging the affected muscle.  In the long term, check your diet to ensure you are eating adequate amounts of fresh fruit, and vegetables which contain potassium and magnesium, drink plenty or water and try a magnesium supplement.
