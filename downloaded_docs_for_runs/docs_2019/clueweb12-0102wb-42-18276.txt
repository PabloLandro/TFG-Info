  Research Studies Conversion of Failed 
        Vertical Banded Gastroplasty to Open Adjustable Gastric Banding Occasionally, patients with failed vertical banded gastroplasty (vertical 
        banded gastroplasty) present for secondary treatment. We performed the 
        reoperations using adjustable gastric banding (AGB) technique. Method From 1991 to 1997, 80 morbidly obese patients underwent vertical banded 
        gastroplasty. In 7 (8.7%), staple-line disruption and weight regain were 
        detected within 2 years of follow-up. Conversion to vertical banded gastroplasty 
        was performed between 1994 and 1998. Meanwhile, another 80 morbidly obese 
        patients underwent primary open vertical banded gastroplasty. Results In the 7 patients, staple-line disruption was seen on radiography as 
        a leak of contrast material across the gastric partition. After conversion 
        of "failed" vertical banded gastroplastys to vertical banded 
        gastroplasty, postoperative results have been very satisfactory and similar 
        to those of the primary open adjustable gastric banding group. Conclusion Vertical banded gastroplasty is a safe technique, although conversion 
        rates were significant. Staple-line disruption constituted the chief cause 
        of insufficient weight loss and frequently indicated the need for further 
        surgery. Our results of the revisional surgery confirm that the reoperations 
        for failed vertical banded gastroplasty can be performed using adjustable 
        gastric banding technique. Source: Taskin M, Zengin K, Unal E, Sakoglu N. Department of General Surgery,

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
