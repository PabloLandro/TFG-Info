Compression stockings are specialized long socks, which are worn from the foot to the knee/thigh. These specialized stockings have a gradient of pressure (tighter in the ankles and gradually less tight at the knee). These stockings when worn properly reduce the swelling in the feet/ankles and also decrease the chance of blood clot formation in the legs. How do compression stockings work?
