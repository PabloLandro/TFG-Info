Enochs. Types of Weight Loss Surgery Performed Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass The most common Bariatric procedure that we perform at the Bariatric Center 
        of the Triangle is the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. This procedure involves 
        partitioning the stomach using staples to create an egg-sized pouch. The 
        new pouch is attached to a segment of intestine that has been used to 
        bypass 25% of the small bowel. By doing so, the operation allows the patients 
        to eat less and absorb less of what they eat. This enables the patient 
        to lose up to 75% of their excess weight within the first year. Bariatric

  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
