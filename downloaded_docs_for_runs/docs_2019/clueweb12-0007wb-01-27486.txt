<70 was 7% in unexposed children, 8% in the CBZ monotherapy group and 22% in the VPA monotherapy group. Other studies support these results. It should be noted that the response rate in this retrospective study was quite low and that the small number of prospective studies conducted to date have had very few children exposed to VPA. For example, a recent prospective, controlled, population-based study looking at intelligence had 86 children with CBZ exposure but only 13 with VPA exposure. Prospective studies are needed to control for potential confounding variables such as maternal and paternal IQ and maternal congenital abnormalities/genetic issues that may have substantial influence on these results. These variables have been absent from most studies linking AEDs and cognitive and/or behavioral development. Knowledge about the effects of the newer generation of AEDs is incomplete. Data to date on gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, tiagabine, and topiramate are very limited, but there are no strong negative signals at this point. While some birth defects have been reported with each of the drugs, most have been in situations of polytherapy. Lamotrigine has the most data available at this time, primarily from the Lamotrigine Registry and the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Registry. A 12-year international observational study of lamotrigine (LTG) found no substantial increase in overall risk of major defects. Other studies have confirmed these conclusions; however, sample sizes have been small. Data are emerging that higher dosages of lamotrigine may present higher risks to the fetus than lower dosages. When LTG and VPA are given together, there is a higher frequency of major malformations. Emerging data from a pregnancy registry suggest an association between LTG and non-syndromic oral clefts, with a rate of cleft lip/palate 24 times greater than the expected rate. Data regarding zonisamide are quite limited, but malformations recorded to date raise some concerns with respect to this AED. There have been very few pregnancy outcomes reported with levetiracetam (LEV), but it has been speculated that LEV may have a favorable profile for pregnant women because it has <10% protein binding and is eliminated primarily via renal excretion and extrahepatic hydrolysis. Renal blood flow increases in early pregnancy and persists throughout; LEV elimination has been found to be enhanced with this increased renal blood flow. Preliminary studies have found a good pregnancy safety profile with this AED; however, data are needed before it can be said to be non-teratogenic. Neonatal drug clearance was complete within the first few weeks of life. Prenatal Screening Prenatal screening to detect major and minor fetal malformations will permit preparation for adequate care for the neonate, particularly for neural tube defects and cardiac defects. The following prenatal testing is recommended to determine any anomolies in the developing fetus: First trimester ultrasound at 11 – 13 weeks is recommended to rule out neural tube defects and other major malformations. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein at 16 weeks is another screen for neural tube defects. Second trimester ultrasound at 18 – 22 weeks to determine cardiac development, head and spine anatomy, and minor malformation of the face such as cleft lip or cleft palate. Fetal cleft lip detection is best determined at 20+ weeks. A level 2 ultrasound will screen for major malformations. Surgical intervention immediately after birth may be indicated, and there are some prenatal interventions that are possible. Studies have found that a majority of parents with knowledge of facial anomolies are better prepared following prenatal counseling. Some patients may consider therapeutic abortion if a major malformation is detected. Labor and Delivery Most (about 95%) WWE have a safe vaginal delivery, without a seizure during or in the 24 hours following delivery. Women with primary generalized epilepsy are more likely than those with partial epilepsy to have a seizure at this time. Sleep deprivation can provoke a seizure so that in some cases obstetric anesthesia may be indicated prior to delivery. WWE are more likely than the general population to have labor induced, although epilepsy is not an indication for induction. This may be related to the benefits of stress reduction to avoid precipitation of seizures or it may be related to weak uterine contractions. Abruptio placentae (separation of the placenta from the uterine wall) may occur more frequently in WWE. Cesarean sections and mechanically assisted delivery are also more common in WWE. It is important to remind WWE to bring their AEDs to the hospital during labor and to take regular doses during this period under the supervision of hospital staff. . Intravenous (phenobarbital, valproate, levetiracetam) or intramuscular (phenytoin, phosphenytoin) administration may be needed if the woman is not able to keep down oral medication. Vitamin K recommendations It is suggested that oral vitamin K supplementation at 10 - 20 mg/day be prescribed during the last month of pregnancy for women with epilepsy (WWE). This is particularly important for women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs. Some AEDs, including carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, ethosuximide, phenytoin, and vigabatrin have been associated with alterations in vitamin K metabolism that induce a deficiency in the fetus, predisposing to a bleeding disorder. Vitamin K is recommended for all neonates at birth; however, neonates born to WWE should be monitored for bleeding even though some studies do not demonstrate an increased risk of bleeding for these babies. The recommended dosage for neonates is 1 mg IM or IV at birth. If a woman has not taken Vitamin K before beginning labor, it can still be administered during labor. Postpartum Care and Breastfeeding AED levels should be monitored closely in the weeks following delivery. During this period AED levels may increase gradually. The increase in postpartum plasma levels for EIAEDs starts about 10 -14 days postpartum.The drugs that are excreted renally such as levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine and those affected by estrogen, such as lamotrigine, show elevated levels with days of delivery. Thus some women will require a dose adjustment immediately following delivery. A small study suggests that oxycarbazepine levels should be monitored during pregnancy and immediately following delivery. Depending on the AEDs used during labor and delivery, both mother and neonate may experience some lethargy. Newborns, particularly infants born prematurely, may have limited capacity to metabolize phenobarbital for several days following delivery. The neonate may be irritable and have feeding problems if benzodiazepines and/or barbiturates were used. Most infants of WWE are able to breastfeed successfully. Breastfeeding benefits to the mother and infant outweigh any risks from AED exposure. AED concentrations in breast milk are far less than they are in maternal serum; however, the serum half-life of AEDs is longer in the neonate than in the mother. Parents should be advised to be alert to any increases in lethargy and to stay in close touch with their pediatrician in such cases. When the baby is born, an appointment for a neurological evaluation should be made for age 4-6 weeks. Parenting Issues and Safety WWE need to organize their lives to minimize fatigue in the weeks following delivery in order to minimize the occurrence of seizures precipitated by fatigue. They may also be at increased risk for breakthrough seizures due to stress. Mothers should be encouraged to nap when their baby naps, though this may not be possible if there are other children at home. Asking for help from other adults can alleviate some of the stress, and provision for another adult to do nighttime feedings can help with fatigue. For women who are breastfeeding, this can be accomplished with either expressed breast milk or with supplementary formula. Each woman needs to assess her particular seizure pattern, and then to make appropriate arrangements for her own safety and that of her baby. For example, if her pattern is to fall during seizures, she may wish to rely on a stroller or carriage in the house rather than carrying the infant. If she tends to drop things, perhaps a baby harness is appropriate. Baby care such as changing diapers and clothing can be done on a blanket on the floor rather than on a high changing table, especially during the immediate postpartum period when AED levels fluctuate. A second person should be present during baths to avoid the danger that even a momentary lapse in alertness can present.

Back to top WOMEN BEYOND CHILDBEARING YEARS Menopause, Definitions Menopause is a time of life not yet well researched for women with epilepsy. There are no prospective studies; available information is derived from clinical experience and retrospective studies generally based on self-report questionnaires. Nevertheless, it is important for clinicians to consider the effects of epilepsy on menopause and the effects of the hormonal changes associated with menopause and with hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) on seizure activity. Understanding the changes in seizure control that might occur beginning with perimenopause is becoming increasingly important. As the worldwide population ages, women who have reached menopause and the large group of women approaching menopause constitute one of the fastest growing segments of society. These women will live up to one-third of their lives beyond the onset of menopause and research is needed to determine the best therapeutic and lifestyle choices for them. Earlier in this Discussion Guide, we presented evidence that female sex hormones and their fluctuations can influence seizures in women with epilepsy. Estrogen has been found to have a seizure-promoting effect, while metabolites of progesterone have an anti-seizure effect. Progesterone withdrawal at the end of the luteal phase just preceding or during the onset of menstruation can exacerbate seizure activity. The substantial effects of these hormones on seizure control during other phases of a woman’s reproductive life suggest that perimenopause and menopause will produce changes in the natural history of seizures. A working definition of menopause is a full year of amenorrhea during which estrogen and progesterone stabilize at low levels. The perimenopausal period is characterized clinically by irregular menses, with increasing months of missed periods, the experience of "hot flashes" or vasomotor symptoms for some women, and mood changes. During the perimenopause period, circulating estrogen levels decline gradually, and cyclical luteal phase progesterone surges also decline. The estrogen/progesterone ratio in perimenopause rises and becomes generally unpredictable, whereas during menopause the ratio of low levels of these reproductive hormones is stable. These differences suggest that perimenopause will be associated with an increase in seizure activity. The limited amount of research in this area does show seizure exacerbation during perimenopause, which is even more pronounced for women who have had a history of a catamenial seizure pattern. Predictably, the fraction of the group of women with epilepsy reporting a catamenial increase in seizure frequency is considerably lower during menopause than during perimenopause. Onset of perimenopause is highly variable, best predicted by the age of onset in the woman’s mother. There is some evidence that menopause starts earlier for women with epilepsy, but it is not known whether this is related to use of enzyme-inducing AEDs or other factors. Perimenopause and Epilepsy Perimenopause is a difficult time for any woman, but women with epilepsy face unpredictable patterns of estrogen and progesterone changes. This complex phase could last for several years, with correspondingly lengthy effects on seizure patterns. With menopause, cessation of swings in estrogen and progesterone levels should reduce cyclical exacerbations that might have occurred with catamenial epilepsy. Loss of estrogen removes the potential for enzyme inducing interactions with AEDs as well as its epileptogenic effect on the brain. However, the loss of progesterone removes its protective effect that might have reduced seizures. Early Menopause with Epilepsy The low estrogen levels that are a part of menopause affect many different organ systems in the body. These changes generally occur slowly and differ for each woman. While estrogen levels decrease, progesterone levels also decrease in menopause. Other hormonal, endocrine, and metabolic changes that occur during menopause can also influence the risk of seizures. This makes it difficult to predict what to expect for any individual woman. While there is some variation, menopause generally occurs between the ages of 48 and 55 years. More recent data suggest that women who have had epilepsy throughout their adult lives tend to cease menstruation about 3 years earlier than women in the general population. Most reports have not differentiated between effects of epilepsy and of seizure and the effect of AEDs on the decline in hormonal activity. One investigation of women with epilepsy age 45 years and older was designed to try to study these as discrete components of ovarian failure. This study found a rate of premature ovarian failure higher than that of the general population. Lifetime total number of seizures and perhaps seizure frequency and duration of epilepsy appear to be correlated with age at menopause. Women report that menopause seems to influence their seizures. In one study published in 1999, 67% of women with epilepsy self-reported changes in their seizure frequency with menopause. For 27%, seizures lessened or improved, but for 41%, they became worse. The reduction in seizures was particularly prominent for women who experienced catamenial epilepsy during their reproductive years; 69% of these women reported an improvement in their seizures during menopause. There is some evidence that women going through menopause may be at greater risk for developing epilepsy. In this study, 20% of women actually begin having seizures for the first time after the onset of menopause. Another small study presented similar figures, with 60% of women reporting that their seizures did not change in frequency or improved with the onset of their menopause. About 30% reported some improvement in their seizure frequency while approximately 40% reported that their seizures became more frequent in menopause. Hormone Replacement Therapy Similar to women in the general population, many women with epilepsy will weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as they approach menopause. Some women may not wish to use HRT because of risks associated with this therapy. For women with epilepsy, HRT’s contribution to protection against osteoporosis may be a benefit worth considering. HRT is available in many forms including estrogen alone, combined estrogen with progesterone, and combinations that include testosterone. Estrogen without progesterone may provoke seizure activity, so that option is not recommended for women with epilepsy. Testosterone is a precursor to estrogen so it is not likely to reduce seizures. For women with epilepsy, HRT with estrogen can influence antiepileptic metabolism and seizures. There is no convincing evidence at this time to support the view that HRT worsens seizures. Women should not necessarily be denied the benefits of HRT because of unproven concerns that it may worsen their seizures. Nonetheless, women starting HRT should be monitored and AED treatment should be adjusted as needed. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in menopause or the perimenopausal period is in less favor currently but has demonstrated benefits in prevention of osteoporosis and improves vasomotor symptoms. The effect of HRT on seizures is unclear. This uncertainty may be partly due to the varied formulations of HRT, including unopposed estrogens or mixed estrogen/progesterone treatments. Bone Health Women with epilepsy may have an additional risk factor for osteoporosis, beyond their increased risk due to the earlier onset of menopause. Earlier onset of menopause in women with epilepsy affects their health by accelerating the age at which they are vulnerable to bone loss and to a decrease in cardioprotective lipid metabolism. Possible health consequences need further exploration. Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of fractures, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Excessive bone loss can cause osteoporosis. This puts a woman at major risk for broken bones and serious fractures. For women who may fall when having a tonic-clonic seizure or as a result of dizziness or sedation related to medication, this becomes a particularly serious problem. Osteoporosis is a particular problem for menopausal women. Some antiepileptic medications may be associated with mineral loss from bone, osteoporosis, and other related problems. Prevention includes a diet high in calcium and vitamin D, and adequate exposure to sunlight. Cholecalciferol may be prescribed to enhance calcium uptake, particularly for women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs. In addition, physical exercise increases bone mass before menopause and slows bone loss after menopause. HRT with estrogen also prevents osteoporosis and is a major reason for menopausal women to consider HRT. Bone mineral density measurement (DEXA scan) or a urinary bone marker test is needed to determine whether a woman has sustained excessive bone loss.Some AEDs may promote bone loss, leading to osteoporosis because of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, producing vitamin D catabolism. This is a major mechanism resulting in bone loss. This independently predicts an increased risk of fractures for women with epilepsy. This increased risk results from the effect of enzyme-inducing AEDs on vitamin D, which is added to the natural risk of osteoporosis from postmenopausal status. Tonic-clonic seizures also increase the risk of falls and fractures. While the mechanism or mechanisms of accelerated osteoporosis secondary to AED use are not well understood and are under active investigation, a number of AEDs are implicated in promoting accelerated vitamin D metabolism, leading to bone loss, including: phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxycarbazepine, and valproate. A pattern of changes in bone biomarkers suggestive of secondary hyperparathyroidism is seen in women with epilepsy taking carbamazepine and in a small study oxycarbazepine, so that these women should be prescribed 25-hydroxyvitamin D replacement. It is currently believed that additional mechanisms (e.g., direct effects on bone cells, impaired calcium absorption) are also being studied to find an explanation for the osteopenia associated with non–enzyme-inducing medications such as valproate. Long-term data on most of the newer AEDs are too limited to draw definitive conclusions but it is expected that the pharmacologic properties of some newer AEDs may prove to be safer with respect to bone health. Prevention and treatment strategies for AED-related bone loss vary and are revised as new information becomes available. For patients taking the older AEDs (phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate), it is recommended that at least 1000 mg of calcium/400 IU vitamin D daily be taken by premenopausal women and 1500 mg calcium/600 IU vitamin D daily be taken by postmenopausal women. This is recommended for all women, not only women with epilepsy, but is particularly urgent if enzyme-inducing AEDs are being taken. Higher doses of supplements are suggested by some researchers. Calcium supplements may decrease the absorption of phenytoin, so that levels need to be monitored closely when women begin taking supplements. Even high-dose supplementation may not provide sufficient protection for women taking strong hepatic enzyme inducers, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital. One of the newer, non–enzyme-inducing AEDs may be preferable for older women. In patients with known osteoporosis, treatment with bisphosphonates should be considered, although the long-term effects of these formulations are not yet known. The declining enthusiasm for HRT should shift the recommendation to a bisphosphonate; however, the main emphasis for women should be on calcitrol with vitamin D3 supplementation. Age and AEDs As people age, their drug treatment may become more complex and must always be examined across all medications and health factors. Seniors are especially sensitive to the sedating and potential adverse cognitive effects of medications such as AEDs. In addition, they are increasingly likely to have health problems requiring medications that can interact with their AEDs. Some AEDs with faster or slower clearance ratesmay not work as expected; they may also produce unanticipated toxic reactions. A prospective study with more than 9,700 elderly community-living women found that continuous AED use is associated with increased rates of bone loss at the calcaneus and the hip This rate of bone loss, if unchecked, is sufficient to lead to an increased risk of hip fracture of 29% over 5 years in women age 65 years and older.
