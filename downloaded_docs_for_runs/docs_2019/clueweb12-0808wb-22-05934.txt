Non-Surgical Weight Management Program FAQ Obesity Surgery Requirements Am I an Obesity Surgery Candidate? Being obese and being overweight are not the same condition. Not everyone who has a weight problem should consider obesity surgery and gastric banding. It depends on whetherÂ you are overweight, obese or morbidly obese. Considerations for Obesity Surgery Who is an obesity surgery candidate? Obesity surgery is indicated for use in weight reduction for people with severe obesity. Calculate your BMI to see if you meet the criteria. Who is not an obesity surgery candidate? Obesity surgery is not recommended for patients with conditions that may make them poor surgical candidates or increase the risk of poor results, who are unwilling or unable to comply with the required dietary restrictions, or who currently are or may be pregnant. Your motivation : The gastric band can be an effective treatment for morbid obesity, but the pounds do not come off by themselves. Motivation is an important factor for success, whether you undergo gastric banding, gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy.
