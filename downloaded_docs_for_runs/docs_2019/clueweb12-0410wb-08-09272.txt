< 0.001). There was no difference between the metformin and insulin groups, respectively, comparing gestational hypertension (6 vs. 7%, P = 0.9), pre-eclampsia (9 vs. 2%, P = 0.06) induction of labour (26 vs. 24%, P = 0.87) or rate of Caesarean section (48 vs. 52%, P = 0.67). No perinatal loss occurred in either group. Neonatal morbidity was improved in the metformin group; prematurity (0 vs. 10%, P < 0.01), neonatal jaundice (8 vs. 30%, P < 0.01) and admission to neonatal unit (6 vs. 19%, P < 0.01). The incidence of macrosomia (birthweight centile > 90) was not significantly different [metformin (14%) vs. insulin (25%); P = 0.07]. CONCLUSIONS: Women with GDM treated with metformin and with similar baseline risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes had less weight gain and improved neonatal outcomes compared with those treated with insulin.
