Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms and Treatments Alcohol Withdrawal - Symtptoms and Treatments Alcohol withdrawal is common and can be potentially dangerous in the long term drinker who has abruptly stopped drinking, or who has significantly lowered his ethanol intake. Decreasing the amount of alcohol, from even a mild but regular consumption, can precipitate withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal may occur anywhere from 1-7 days after the cessation of alcohol use. Withdrawal symptoms may be divided into MAJOR (serious) and MINOR symptoms. MAJOR WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS ("Delirium Tremens") 1. Seizures (convulsions), with risk of aspiration of vomit into the lungs 2. Instability of blood pressure (hypertension is common) 3. Delirium, agitation, and confusion. These patients frequently perceive invisible "things" crawling on them. 4. Fever 5. Vomiting with dehydration. MINOR WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS 1. Anxiety 2. Restlessness 3. Difficulty sleeping 4. Mild nausea 5. Tremors Evaluation of this patient will include history and physical examination. Blood tests (blood counts, liver profile, kidney profile, coagulation profile, and chemistry) will be done. These patients are frequently malnourished, B-complex vitamin deficient (thiamine and folic acid), and dehydrated. Blood testing will determine to what extent they require fluid and electrolyte replacement. An EKG may be done on patients with cardiac symptoms, or significant risk factors for heart disease. Treatment may be at home for those patients with only mild withdrawal symptoms and no significant blood test abnormalities. Rest, plenty of fluids, B-complex vitamins, and a mild sedative are commonly prescribed. Antacids can be used for indigestion. Complete avoidance of alcohol is critical. A good support group of caring, concerned family or friends is important for the patient. Symptoms of MAJOR withdrawal must be treated in the hospital. IV sedative medications (Valium, Librium) are commonly used. Anti-convulsants to control seizures will be necessary in some patients.
