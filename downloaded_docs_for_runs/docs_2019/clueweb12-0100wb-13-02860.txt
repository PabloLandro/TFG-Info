A note about Cure for Lower Back Pain - Natural Relief through Exercise In natural health and healing , we believe in holistic health and healing , as we realize that different parts of the human body are highly interlinked, often beyond Man's understanding. We also believe that the body has the ability to heal itself of any disease , even supposedly incurable diseases . In order to do so, the body needs the support of some basic dietary and lifestyle good health habits , such as a full body detox and a proper understanding and application of nutrition . No matter how remote or unrelated a health condition may seem, these fundamental health steps will greatly magnify the effects and benefits of any of our health-promoting efforts, including the use of specific natural health remedies . Women who are pregnant will often experience lower back pain.  Another common cause of lower back pain in women is cramping during menstruation.  While these are temporary causes of lower back pain, there are many other causes of pain in that part of the body. Importance of a Strong Core While you should know that eating healthy and taking the proper supplements will help you to build strong bones and muscle, perhaps the best cure for lower back pain is to make sure that your body is strong - this is referring to your core muscles, or the deep abdominal muscles that hold your belly in without you having to do anything. When you have a strong core, you will be better able to support your back.  Also, with a strong core, your posture will improve, and this will help to function as a cure for lower back pain. Your core is what keeps you balanced and held erect.  Core muscles work in conjunction with your back and surface abdominal muscles to help stabilize the body and offer strength to the back. If you have ever looked at someone who can stand straight with one leg in the air and have no balancing problems at all and wondered how they do it, you have been watching a strong core in action.  Think ballerina on this one. While many people who have strong cores typically have enviable stomachs, you really should focus on the health benefits first and the aesthetics second, but believe me, you will see results with core strengthening exercises. Start Slow So, where do you start in this quest for a cure for lower back pain? Well, if you’re currently suffering from lower back pain, the first step is to work slowly to relieve the pain and heal your back.  There are lots of very beneficial stretching exercises that will help to ease your back pain. The duration for which you should carry out these exercises before you start strengthening your core will likely depend, so you should talk to your medical professional and, more importantly, listen to your body.  You should not ever begin working on difficult core exercises if you are still nursing a back injury. Pilates Consider doing Pilates as a possible cure for lower back pain, to help heal your back.  In addition to the core strengthening work that this type of exercise provides, Pilates will also help you to improve your posture and stretch your body, making it a nearly ideal work out. Many Pilates instructors are now professionally trained specifically to help you heal and strengthen your back, so you will need to seek out a Pilates instructor who has been trained in this aspect of the exercise.  With Pilates, a natural cure for lower back pain may just be close at hand. Conclusion Remember that you know your body best, and with the help of a professional who knows how to help you heal and strengthen without doing your body more harm, you can cure your lower back pain.  Don’t be afraid to try new things, but listen to how your back feels and never overdo it.
