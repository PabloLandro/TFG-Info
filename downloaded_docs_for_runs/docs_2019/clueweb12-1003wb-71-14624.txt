Gisela has a gained a wealth of clinical experience that covers a range of treatments in this area. Acupuncture has helped people with anxiety, stress, panic attacks and insomnia to more debilitating complaints of depression, schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Where medication was not favoured as a therapy, Gisela treated women with mental health problems during pregnancy and for post natal depression. Studies show that acupuncture releases endorphins and hormones such as serotonin, which are natural chemicals that can relieve pain, relax muscles and increase feelings of well being.
