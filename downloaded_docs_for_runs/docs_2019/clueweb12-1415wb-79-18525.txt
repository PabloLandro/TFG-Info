Summary: Many are frustrated 
because they recognize the need for exercise but their busy schedule doesn't 
allow them to put in the time necessary for fitness benefits. By using this 
specialized approach you can achieve the fitness level you desire without 
compromising your commitments in other areas. Busy people can achieve their 
exercise goals and manage their frustration with these simple techniques. No More 
Excuses! If you’ve 
ever been frustrated or discouraged because your plan to exercise has fallen 
through, you need the 21 Day Exercise Jump Start! The 21 Day Exercise Jump Start 
workshop is designed with busy people in mind. I have 
spoken with many people who had very good intentions of keeping up with their 
new year’s resolutions only to let them fall by the wayside. They have spent ten 
minutes or more telling me how frustrating it is to find time to get to the gym. 
They know full well their need for cardiovascular health and they know how good 
they feel when they complete their workout. But their schedule changes, 
something comes up demanding their attention, the timing isn’t right to fit in a 
drive to the gym and a workout. Many of us 
have dusty exercise DVDs sitting on a shelf that we planned on using. The 
problem is that chair in front of the TV is so soft and comfy. We have put in a 
hard day’s work and would really enjoy watching our program before starting our 
exercise program. The TV has become a means of relaxation and many of us find it 
difficult to commit to the TV as an exercise device. Others have 
a million things to do when they get home. They find it impossible to fit a 30 
minute workout into their day. Almost 
everybody had the desire to exercise but spent that time dwelling on how they 
should be doing something about exercise. Well no 
more! Now your wasted time spent berating yourself about neglecting your 
exercise will be your cue. Turn your desire to exercise from frustration to 
daily success. Take simple steps to turn those negative thoughts to positive 
action. It takes 
twenty-one days to create a habit and that’s exactly how many days you are away 
from taking control of a daily 30 minute exercise program that works with your 
schedule. This workshop is for you if 
you have a computer and feel that periodic negative feelings may interfere with 
your commitment to daily exercise. Use this easily incorporated system to reduce 
muscle stiffness, warm up and improve blood flow to your muscles, maintain 
current muscle tone and provide an appropriate level of strengthening for your 
work environment. All the major muscle groups of 
the arms, legs and back get involved. Give your muscles what they need: Fresh 
oxygen and nutrients in, and the pain and stiffness out! Why waste another perfectly 
good day? Start the exercise routine you 
promised yourself you would commit to! Stick to the exercise routine you 
promised yourself you’d keep! Tired Minds and Tired Bodies get Instant Energy 
when these activities are added to your Day! It has never been easier to stick 
with a consistent routine with long term health benefits. Keywords:
