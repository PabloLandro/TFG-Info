The approval of Lyrica was long-awaited because it’s the first medicine that is FDA-approved to treat fibromyalgia. More fibromyalgia drugs are in development. Doctors also treat fibromyalgia with a variety of drugs developed and approved for other purposes. Below are some of the most commonly used categories of fibromyalgia medications. Analgesics Analgesics are painkillers. They range from over-the-counter drugs, such as acetaminophen, to prescription drugs, such as tramadol, and even stronger narcotic drugs. For a subset of people with fibromyalgia, narcotic medications are prescribed for severe muscle pain. However, there is no solid evidence showing that narcotics actually work to treat the chronic pain of fibromyalgia, and most doctors hesitate to prescribe them for long-term use because of the potential that the person taking them will become dependent on them. NSAIDs NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are used to treat inflammation. Although inflammation is not a symptom of fibromyalgia, NSAIDs also relieve pain. NSAIDs work by inhibiting prostaglandins, which play a role in pain and inflammation. These drugs, some of which are available over-the-counter, may help ease the muscle aches of fibromyalgia. They may also relieve menstrual cramps and the headaches often associated with fibromyalgia. Antidepressants Perhaps the most useful medications for fibromyalgia are several in the antidepressant class. Antidepressants elevate the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin and norepinephrine. Low levels of these chemicals are associated not only with depression, but also with pain and fatigue. Increasing the levels of these chemicals can reduce pain in people who have fibromyalgia. Doctors prescribe several types of antidepressants for people with fibromyalgia. Tricyclic Antidepressants When taken at bedtime in dosages lower than those used to treat depression, tricyclic antidepressants can help promote restorative sleep in people with fibromyalgia. They also can relax painful muscles and heighten the effects of the body’s natural pain-killing substances called endorphins. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) If a tricyclic antidepressant fails to bring relief, doctors sometimes prescribe a newer type of antidepressant called a SSRI. As with tricyclics, doctors usually prescribe these for people with fibromyalgia in lower dosages than are used to treat depression. By promoting the release of serotonin, these drugs may reduce fatigue and some other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia. SSRIs may be prescribed along with a tricyclic antidepressant. Doctors rarely prescribe SSRIs alone. Because they make people feel more energetic, they also interfere with sleep, which often is already a problem for people with fibromyalgia. Cymbalta (duloxetine) is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) that is also showing promise. Mixed Reuptake Inhibitors Some newer antidepressants raise levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine, and are therefore called mixed reuptake inhibitors. Researchers are actively studying the efficacy of these drugs in treating fibromyalgia. Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines help some people with fibromyalgia by relaxing tense, painful muscles and stabilizing the erratic brain waves that can interfere with deep sleep. Benzodiazepines also can relieve the symptoms of restless legs syndrome, which is common among people with fibromyalgia. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs as well as twitching, particularly at night. Because of the potential for addiction, doctors usually prescribe benzodiazepines only for people who have not responded to other therapies. buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in analgesics , anti-inflammatory , antidepressant , back , benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , disks , doctor , drug , efficacy , exercise , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injection , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , norepinephrine , NSAIDs , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , serotonin , skelaxin , soma , SSRI , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » Arthritis Drugs: What Are My Options? Friday, August 29th, 2008 Are the Newer Arthritis Drugs Always the Better Choice? Arthritis drugs have long been considered the “traditional” treatment option. Since individual response to drugs can vary and because potential side effects and adverse reactions are also a factor, finding the most effective combination of arthritis drugs can be a more difficult process than one would expect. Patients should become knowledgeable about the various arthritis drugs so they can make decisions with their doctor. NSAIDs / COX-2 Inhibitors NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are among the most commonly prescribed and widely used arthritis drugs. There are three types of NSAIDs: salicylates (both acetylated, such as aspirin, and nonacetylated such as (Disalcid) salsalate, (Trilisate) choline magnesium trisalicylate and (Doan’s Pills, Novasal) magnesium salicylate), the traditional NSAIDs, and COX-2 selective inhibitors. NSAIDs work by blocking the activity of the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, also known as COX. Research has revealed that there are two forms, known as COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs affect both forms. COX-1 is involved in maintaining healthy tissue, while COX-2 is involved in the inflammation pathway. COX-2 selective inhibitors became a new subset of NSAIDs born of this research. buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in arthritis , back , benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , disks , doctor , drug , efficacy , exercise , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injection , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , skelaxin , soma , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » Use of Muscle Relaxants for Musculoskeletal Conditions Reviewed Thursday, August 28th, 2008 Recommendations for selecting muscle relaxants for musculoskeletal conditions such as low back pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome are reviewed in an article published in the August 1 issue of American Family Physician. “Prescription rates for nonspecific back pain revealed that skeletal muscle relaxants accounted for 18.5 percent of prescriptions compared with 16.3 percent for NSAIDs [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] and 10 percent for cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors,” write Sharon See, PharmD, BCPS, and Regina Ginzburg, PharmD, from St. John’s University College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions in Jamaica, New York. “Because of the high rate of prescribing skeletal muscle relaxants, an understanding of the risks and benefits of this class of drugs is vital. This article presents evidence regarding the use of antispasmodic skeletal muscle relaxants for various musculoskeletal conditions, and appropriate drug selection if a skeletal muscle relaxant is required.” Despite the widespread use of skeletal muscle relaxants for treatment of musculoskeletal conditions, data supporting this practice come primarily from studies with methodologic limitations. Treatment goals for low back or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome include alleviation of muscle pain and improvement in functional ability allowing return to work or to customary activities. Skeletal muscle relaxants have not been shown to be superior to acetaminophen or NSAIDs for low back pain, although systematic reviews and meta-analyses support short-term use of skeletal muscle relaxants for relief of acute low back pain in patients who do not respond to or tolerate NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Existing recommendations for treating tension headaches are similar. There are 2 main categories of skeletal muscle relaxants: antispastic (such as baclofen or dantrolene) for conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis and antispasmodic agents for musculoskeletal conditions. Evidence is extremely limited to support the use of antispastic agents for musculoskeletal conditions, for which an antispasmodic agent is typically more appropriate. The most commonly prescribed antispasmodic agents are carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol. A meta-analysis of cyclobenzaprine showed that it was superior to placebo for treating fibromyalgia but that it was not as effective as antidepressants. Recent guidelines regarding treatment of fibromyalgia recommend a comprehensive approach using tramadol, antidepressants, and/or a heated pool, with or without exercise. In comparison trials, no single skeletal muscle relaxant has been proven to be superior to another. The most widely studied agent is cyclobenzaprine, with demonstrated efficacy for various musculoskeletal conditions but with significant sedation. Tizanidine, which also causes marked sedation, or cyclobenzaprine may be useful in patients with insomnia because of severe muscle spasms. All skeletal muscle relaxants are associated with adverse effects including dizziness and drowsiness, and the potential for these adverse effects should be clearly explained to the patient. Although methocarbamol and metaxalone are less sedating than tizanidine and cyclobenzaprine, evidence is limited for their efficacy. A specific skeletal muscle relaxant should be chosen according to consideration of adverse effect profile, patient preference, potential for abuse, and possible interactions with other prescribed medications because comparable efficacy data are limited. Carisoprodol is typically prescribed at a dose of 350 mg 4 times daily, but it is not recommended for children younger than 12 years. Adverse events include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rare idiosyncratic reactions (mental status changes, transient quadriplegia, and temporary loss of vision) after the first dose that may require hospitalization, and allergy-type reactions that may occur after the first to fourth dose. Physical or psychological dependence may occur, and withdrawal symptoms may occur when carisoprodol is discontinued. When combined with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, codeine or its derivatives, or other muscle relaxants, carisoprodol may contribute to respiratory depression. Starting dose for cyclobenzaprine is 5 mg 3 times daily, which may be increased to 10 mg 3 times daily. Adverse effects include anticholinergic effects of drowsiness, dry mouth, urinary retention, and increased intraocular pressure. Rare but serious adverse events may include arrhythmias, seizures, or myocardial infarction. It should be avoided in older patients and in patients with glaucoma, and there may be possible drug interactions with cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Metaxalone is prescribed at 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily and is not recommended in children younger than 12 years. Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness are common adverse effects. Rare adverse events may include leukopenia or hemolytic anemia; elevation in liver function tests; or nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Paradoxic muscle cramps may also occur. Methocarbamol is given at a dosage of 1500 mg 4 times daily for the first 2 to 3 days and is then reduced to 750 mg 4 times daily. Use of this drug may be associated with black, brown, or green urine; mental status impairment; or possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis symptoms. Specific clinical recommendations for practice, and their accompanying level of evidence rating, are as follows: * Skeletal muscle relaxants are not considered first-line therapy for musculoskeletal conditions (level of evidence, C). * For acute low back pain, skeletal muscle relaxants may be used as adjunctive therapy (level of evidence, B). * For acute low back pain, antispasmodic agents should be used short term (2 weeks; level of evidence, C). * Evidence to date does not clearly support the superiority of 1 skeletal muscle relaxant to another for musculoskeletal spasms (level of evidence, B). * Specific drug profile and individual patient situation should guide the choice of skeletal muscle relaxant (level of evidence, C). “Despite their popularity, skeletal muscle relaxants should not be the primary drug class of choice for musculoskeletal conditions,” Drs. See and Ginzberg write. “The American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians recommend using acetaminophen and…NSAIDs as first-line agents for acute low back pain and reserving skeletal muscle relaxants as an alternative treatment option. This recommendation is based on available literature, which shows skeletal muscle relaxants are better than placebo, but not more effective than NSAIDs in patients with acute back pain.” buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in back , benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , disks , doctor , drug , efficacy , exercise , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injection , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , skelaxin , soma , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » Sedation Side Effect Wednesday, August 27th, 2008 Sedation is the most commonly reported adverse effect of muscle relaxant medications. These drugs should be used with caution in patients driving motor vehicles or operating heavy machinery. More absolute contraindications do exist to the use of carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam. Rare idiosyncratic reactions have also been reported to carisoprodol and its metabolites such as meprobamate. Benzodiazepines have potential for abuse and their use should be avoided. By initially prescribing muscle relaxants at bedtime, the physician might take advantage of their sedative effects and minimize daytime drowsiness. These agents have been found to be effective when used either alone or in combination with an analgesic/anti-inflammatory agent within seven days of symptom onset. The prescribing physician should monitor patients receiving these medications and tailor dosages in an attempt to minimize the drowsiness and sedation often associated with their use. The use of benzodiazepines does not appear to offer any significant benefit to patients experiencing acute low back pain. Further research is needed before the role of baclofen and dantrolene sodium in the treatment of muscle spasm of local origin can be more clearly defined. buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , doctor , drug , efficacy , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injection , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , sedation , skelaxin , soma , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » Muscle Relaxants Tuesday, August 26th, 2008 Strains, sprains, and other muscle injuries can result in pain, stiffness, and muscle spasms. Muscle relaxants do not heal the injuries, but they do relaxmuscles and help ease discomfort and stop muscle spasms. The muscle relaxantcyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is also sometimes used to treat fibromyalgia, a condition that involves aches, stiffness, and fatigue. Muscle relaxants work by acting on the central nervous system. In the UnitedStates, they are available only with a physician’s prescription. Examples ofmuscle relaxants are carisoprodol (Soma), chlorzoxazone (Parafon Forte DSC),cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), and methocarbamol (Robaxin). Most come only in tablet form. However, methocarbamol (Robaxin) is available in both tablet and injectable forms. Some muscle relaxants are available in Canada without a prescription. Muscle relaxants are usually prescribed along with rest, exercise, physical therapy, or other treatments. Although the drugs may provide relief, they should never be considered a substitute for these other forms of treatment. Thesedrugs may make the injury feel so much better that one is tempted to go backto normal activity, but doing too much too soon can actually make the injuryworse. Muscle relaxants work quite well for relieving muscle pain due to injuries, but are not effective for other types of pain. Some people feel drowsy, dizzy,confused, lightheaded, or less alert when using muscle relaxants drugs. These drugs may also cause blurred vision, clumsiness, or unsteadiness. Because muscle relaxants work on the central nervous system, they may add tothe effects of alcohol and other drugs that slow down the central nervous system. They may also add to the effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental procedures. For this reason, anyone who takes these drugs should notdrive, operate machinery, or do anything else that might be dangerous untilthey have found out how the drugs affect them. People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take muscle relaxants. Diabetes should be awarethat the metaxalone (Skelaxin) may cause false test results on one type of test for sugar in the urine. People with epilepsy should be cautioned that taking the muscle relaxant methocarbamol may increase the likelihood of seizures. Anyone who has allergies, who is breastfeeding has kidney disease, has suffered a recent heart attack or irregular heartbeat, has an overactive thyroid gland, hepatitis or liver disease, is a current or former drug or alcohol abuser, has glaucoma, or has problems with urination should discuss their condition with their doctor before taking muscle relaxants. The most common side effects or muscle relaxants are vision changes, such asdouble vision or blurred vision; dizziness; lightheadedness; drowsiness; anddry mouth. These problems usually go away as the body adjusts to the drug anddo not require medical treatment. Methocarbamol and chlorzoxazone may causeharmless color changes in urine –orange or reddish-purple with chlorzoxazoneand purple, brown, or green with methocarbamol. The urine will return to itsnormal color when the patient stops taking the medicine. Less common side effects, such as stomach cramps or pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, hiccups, clumsiness or unsteadiness, confusion, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, flushed or red face, headache, heartburn, weakness, trembling, and sleep problems also may occur and do not need medical attention unless they do not go away or they interfere with normal activities. More serious side effects are not common, but may occur. Anyone who experiences breathing problems, facial swelling, fainting, unusually fast or unusuallyslow heartbeat, fever, tightness in the chest, rash, itching, hives, burning, stinging, red, or bloodshot eyes, or unusual thoughts or dreams after taking muscle relaxants should seek medical help promptly The muscle relaxant chlorzoxazone (Parafon Forte DSC) has caused serious, life-threatening liver problems in some people. The reaction is rare, but anyonetaking the drug should stop taking it and notify his or her physician immediately if any of these symptoms occur: fever, rash, loss of appetite, nausea,vomiting, fatigue, pain in the upper right part of the abdomen, dark urine, or yellow skin or eyes. Muscle relaxants may interact with some other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effectsmay be greater. Anyone who plans to take muscle relaxants should let the physician know all other medicines, including over-the-counter or nonprescription medicines, that he or she is taking. buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in back , benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , disks , doctor , drug , efficacy , exercise , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injection , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , skelaxin , soma , spasm , stiff , suffer , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » Soma Joint Pain Monday, August 25th, 2008 Soma is used for treating discomfort associated with certain painful muscle conditions. It is usually used along with rest and physical therapy. Soma is a skeletal muscle relaxant. It works in the brain and spinal cord to relax the muscles. It also causes drowsiness. Rarely, some patients have experienced an unexpected reaction within minutes or hours after taking Soma.

Soma is used together with rest and physical therapy to treat injuries and other painful musculoskeletal conditions. The Carisoprodol’s treating mechanism provides blocking of electrical communication among nerves in the reticular formation of the brain. It also blocks this kind of communication in the spinal cord. Soma is usually taken three times per day and before going to bed by one tablet (350 mg). Children under 12 years should not be treated with this product. To prevent the stomach disorder, take Carisoprodol with milk or food. buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in back , benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , doctor , drug , efficacy , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injection , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , musculoskeletal , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , skelaxin , soma , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » Origin of Muscle Spasm Thursday, August 21st, 2008 Muscle spasm of local origin needs to be clinically differentiated from spasticity and sustained muscle contraction in the setting of the central nervous system (CNS) and upper motor neuron injury. Baclofen (Lioresal®) and dantrolene sodium (Dantrium®) are two agents whose use is indicated in the setting of spasticity of CNS etiology. Dantrolene sodium is of particular interest, as its mechanism of action is purely at the muscular level where it serves to inhibit the release of calcium form the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Casale studied the effectiveness of dantrolene sodium, 25-mg daily, in the treatment of low back pain and found patients to demonstrate significant improvements in visual analogue scores, pain behavior, and electromyographic (EMG) evaluations of “antalgic reflex motor unit firing,” when compared with the placebo group. The findings of this study are interesting in that they demonstrate improvement secondary to a pure muscle relaxant, which does not possess other outside anti-nociceptive properties. Baclofen is a derivative of gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA) and is believed to inhibit mono and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level. Treatment with baclofen was compared to placebo in a double blind, randomized study of 200 patients with acute low back pain. Patients with initially severe discomfort were found to benefit from baclofen, 30- to 80-mg daily, on days four and ten of follow up. Forty-nine percent of treatment patients complained of sleepiness, 38% of nausea, and 17% discontinued treatment. buy soma muscle relaxant free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in back , benzodiazepines , butalbital , carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , dantrolene , diazepam , doctor , drug , efficacy , flexeril , free prescription , health , ibuprofen , injury , medication , medicine , meds , metaxalone , muscle , pain , pain relief , patient , physical , pills , skelaxin , soma , therapy , tips , trazadone , treatment , tricyclic , valium | No Comments » « Older Entries Archives November 2010 October 2010 August 2010 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 Pages Sitemap Soma is pro
