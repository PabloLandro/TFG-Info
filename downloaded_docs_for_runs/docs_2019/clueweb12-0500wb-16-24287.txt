For thousands of years acupuncture and moxibustion therapies have both been popular methods of Chinese medicine. Acupuncture treats diseases by puncturing points of the body with different types of needles whilst Moxibustion is applied with heated glass cup (also known as the cupping technique), creating a vacuum on the patient's skin, to eliminate stagnation, improve circulation, relieve pain, and treat diseases. The classical ancient Chinese explanation is that channels of energy run in regular patterns throughout the body. These energy channels, called meridians, are like river flowing through the body to irrigate and nourish the tissues. An obstruction in the movement of these energy rivers is like a dam that backs up. By stimulating the meridians, the needles unblock the obstructions at the dams and reestablish the regular flow. Symptoms that can be treated by Acupuncture and Moxibutsions: Allergy Constipations Facial Paralysis Frozen Shoulder Relieve symptoms of GI Tract Impotency Weight control Relieve symptoms of Menopause Migraine Muscle & Joint Pain Smoking Cessation Sleeplessness, Insomnia The modern scientific explanation is that needling the acupuncture points stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain (Neurology). These chemicals will either change the experience of pain, or they will trigger the release of other chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system.
