Limited by Federal law to investigational use. Overview EnteroMedics Inc. develops implantable systems for the treatment of obesity and other gastrointestinal disorders. EnteroMedics is clinically investigating VBLOC™ vagal blocking therapy to address the large unmet need for a procedure that may offer weight loss while minimizing the morbidity, mortality and other side effects associated with current surgical treatments. The vagus nerve regulates multiple digestive functions.  VBLOC Therapy is the first non-invasively adjustable implantable treatment for obesity under clinical investigation for its potential to regulate the vagus nerve. EnteroMedics' devices are currently undergoing clinical investigation for obesity treatment and are not yet available or approved for use in the United States. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., with more than 30 percent of the U.S. adult population  or more than 65 million Americans  afflicted with the disease. Approximately 23 million, are severely or morbidly obese, and these numbers are growing annually. Coronary heart disease, stroke, gall bladder disease, obstructive sleep apnea, high cholesterol; as well as endometrial, breast and colon cancers have all been linked to obesity. Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis  three of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries.  In fact, deaths related to obesity in the U.S. now number approximately 112,000 per year, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death. The health risks for many persons with obesity are serious enough that bariatric surgery is often prescribed. OBESITY DEFINED Is obesity a disease? Yes. Both the National Institute of Health and World Health Organization recognize obesity as a serious chronic disease. Obesity affects Americans regardless of gender, age or ethnic background, and it requires life-long patient treatment. The disease is caused by a complex interaction of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors. However, excessive eating and lack of exercise are major contributing factors. How dangerous is obesity? More than 19 percent of all Americans over the age of 20 were obese in 1997.  In 2005, more than 30 percent or 65 million adult Americans were obese. Obesity is now one of the leading causes of preventable death in the U.S. Each year, obesity is a factor in the death of more than 100,000 Americans. Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis  three of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries.  Coronary heart disease, stroke, gall bladder disease, obstructive sleep apnea, high cholesterol, as well as endometrial, breast and colon cancers, have all been linked to obesity. DIAGNOSING OBESITY How is obesity measured? Obesity is determined by gauging a patient's body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by his or her height (in meters squared). A person is generally considered obese if they have a body mass index (BMI) rating of 30 or higher. Patients are classified as moderately (BMI 30), severely (BMI 35) or morbidly obese (BMI 40+). Currently, approximately 23 million Americans are severely or morbidly obese, and this number is growing annually. How is obesity treated? Obesity requires life-long patient treatment. Proper diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes are important, but they fail in most cases as a long-term treatment for obesity and the diseases commonly associated with it. Obese patients are required to make lifestyle changes even if they undergo bariatric surgery. SURGICAL OPTIONS FOR TREATING OBESITY Are there any effective, long-lasting surgical treatments for obesity? The only currently available treatment proven to maintain weight loss in morbidly obese patients is bariatric surgery. The term "bariatric" comes from the Greek root "baros" meaning "weight" or "heavy" and the New Latin "iatria" meaning "to treat." How many bariatric surgeries are performed in the U.S.? The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery estimates that approximately 200,000 bariatric surgical procedures will be performed in the United States in 2007 and that just over 100,000 bariatric surgical procedures were performed in 2003. What are the bariatric surgical options? The two most commonly performed surgical procedures gastric bypass (or Roux-en-Y) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (also known as laparoscopic, or "lap", banding) come with significant side effects and fail to meet the needs of many patients. Gastric bypass surgery accounts for approximately 75 percent of all bariatric procedures in the U.S. and laparoscopic banding surgery accounts for roughly the remaining 25 percent. Gastric bypass and laparoscopic banding treat obesity in very different ways. Laparoscopic banding is referred to as a restrictive surgical procedure because it decreases food intake by restricting stomach capacity and the passageway through which food must travel to be digested. It is designed to restrict the volume of food ingested. Gastric bypass is considered a restrictive and malabsorptive surgical procedure because it restricts food intake by creating a walnut sized pouch out of the top of the stomach and decreases the absorption of food particles and nutrients by bypassing a significant portion of the nutrient absorbing small intestine. GASTRIC BYPASS SURGERY What is gastric bypass surgery? Gastric bypass surgery permanently alters anatomy and reduces the size of the stomach by creating a "limb" that bypasses a portion of the small intestine, where most calorie absorption normally takes place. The gastric bypass procedure reduces the amount of food that patients can ingest, since the stomach has been made smaller, and it also reduces the number of calories absorbed since a significant portion of the small intestine has been bypassed. What are the risks associated with gastric bypass surgery? Gastric bypass is generally considered an irreversible procedure with a risk of mortality, and among other things, such as blood clots, the potential for re-operation or infection due to post-operative leakage at the newly joined sections of the digestive system. Are there other long-term complications for gastric bypass patients? Gastric bypass patients must be willing to subscribe to life-long medical monitoring, adhere to significantly modified eating habits and take long-term vitamin and mineral supplements to overcome the micro-nutrient deficiencies caused by malabsorption. LAPAROSCOPIC BANDING SURGERY What is laparoscopic banding surgery? Laparoscopic banding reduces stomach capacity with a band that is placed around the stomach and filled with saline. The band creates a small pouch into which food may enter.  The outlet between the pouch and the remainder of the stomach is also reduced to less than one half centimeter in diameter.  Food fills the small pouch quickly, but passes through the narrow passageway, created by the band, very slowly. Stomach outlet size is adjusted by adding or removing fluid from the band via a needle inserted though the skin and into an access port implanted beneath the skin overlying the abdomen. What are the patient disadvantages of laparoscopic banding? Intolerance to certain foods such as red meats and breads is quite common as they may get stuck in the narrow passageway created by the band.  In addition to being uncomfortable, the patient will likely need to vomit to help clear the obstruction.  In order to assure adequate restriction of food intake, patients must regularly undergo band adjustments which involve insertion of a needle into the body to tighten and loosen the band using saline solution injected into a port placed under the skin. Patients may require inconvenient re-operations  as band leakage, slippage or erosion into the stomach are not uncommon post-surgery. Patients with laparoscopic bands are instructed not to drink liquids of any kind during meals and for up to two hours following a meal, because doing so can wash food past the band and allow the ingestion of more food and calories. Laparoscopic bands have not demonstrated the dramatic weight loss seen with gastric bypass. Do current bariatric surgical options always prevent patients from eating too much? No.  While it is more difficult to sabotage a gastric bypass surgery, patients can and do cheat the system with both approaches. Patients can still choose to eat excessively and to make poor decisions regarding the types of foods they're eating.  Any bariatric surgical approach should be viewed as a tool to help with weight loss that will require significant life change on the part of the patient to be truly successful. THE LINK BETWEEN THE VAGUS NERVE AND OBESITY What are the vagus nerves? The vagus nerves are a primary communication pathway between the brain and the abdominal organs and control much of the activity of the stomach, intestine, and pancreas. How do the vagus nerves regulate digestion? The vagus nerves play a significant role in food processing and in signaling the feeling of fullness and in prolonging the absence of hunger through nervous control of multiple functions: 1.	Expansion of the stomach as food enters; 2.	Stomach muscle contractions that break food into smaller particles; 3.	Release of gastric acid to continue food processing; 4.	Emptying of the stomach contents into the small intestine; 5.	Secretion of digestive pancreatic enzymes that enable calorie absorption; 6.	Sensation of hunger, satisfaction or fullness. How are the vagus nerves linked to obesity? Study of the vagus nerves and their effect on the digestive system is not new. In fact, the practice of vagal nerve surgery to treat gastric disorders is supported by a number of published studies. During these studies, which looked at the effects of surgical "vagotomy"  the partial or total severing of vagus nerves   researchers discovered that patients commonly experienced weight loss or at a minimum, failure to gain weight following vagotomy. Why isn't vagotomy, the surgical severing of the vagus nerves, an accepted means of controlling obesity? Since vagotomy is a surgical procedure that permanently alters the anatomy and function of the nerve and is therefore not adjustable or reversible, vagotomy has not proven to be an optimal approach, especially since the effects of surgical vagotomy appear to be temporary in some cases. The body is usually able to compensate for the anatomical disruption, making accommodations by "re-regulating" to normal function. Therefore, intermittent blocking of the vagus nerve  which is designed to prevent the nervous system and digestive organs from compensating for any changes in bodily functions  using laparoscopically implanted electrodes was identified by EnteroMedics as one of the critical steps in utilizing the vagus nerve in the potential management of obesity. Is VBLOC  Therapy the first obesity therapy under clinical evaluation to regulate or block the vagus nerves? Yes. While attempts have been made to control weight loss through cutting or stimulation of the vagus nerves, VBLOC Therapy is the first designed to utilize blocking of the vagus nerves in the potential management of obesity. How does vagal blocking differ from stimulation? Vagal blocking involves the use of electrical pulses delivered at a high frequency that block, or prevent the transmission of, naturally occurring signals carried on the vagus nerves.  Stimulation, on the other hand, involves the use of much lower frequency electrical pulses that cause additional signals to be sent on the nerves. ABOUT ENTEROMEDICS' VBLOC Therapy How does VBLOC Therapy affect the vagus nerve? VBLOC Therapy is designed to block transmission of nervous signals between the brain and digestive system and may "neuroregulate" vagus nerve function and the organs it affects. Why is VBLOC Therapy unique? VBLOC Therapy is the first therapy to use vagal blocking as a means of managing obesity.  Other approaches such as laparoscopic banding are either single mechanism and simply restrictive, or in the case of gastric bypass surgery, significantly more invasive. How is VBLOC Therapy intended to work? VBLOC Therapy is delivered via two very small electrodes, laparoscopically implanted adjacent to the vagal trunks just above the junction between the esophagus and the stomach, near the diaphragm. The electrodes deliver pulses of electrical energy received from a neuroregulator implanted under the skin. What does the procedure entail? During a laparoscopic procedure, the physician makes three to five 1 cm incisions to implant the electrodes. Through the smaller incisions, the physician places small electrodes around the patient's vagus nerves near the bottom of the esophagus. The physician then places the neuroregulator under the skin at a location selected by the surgeon in consultation with the patient. The procedure is intended to be performed on an outpatient (same-day surgery) basis with minimal recovery time. What happens after the procedure? After the procedure is performed, patients visit their doctor's office to initiate therapy. In the office setting, and based on the needs of each patient, the physician determines how often blocking signals are sent to the nerves. Therapy can be easily and non-invasively adjusted in the physician's office using wireless communications. Patients may eat normal foods as part of a sensible diet without the need to comply with a liquid or soft food diet for several weeks as is typical following laparoscopic banding or bypass surgeries. How is the neuroregulator powered? The implanted neuroregulator is powered by a rechargeable battery.  The battery of the implanted neuroregulator is recharged as needed using an external coil (placed over the site of the implanted neuroregulator during charging) that connects to a cell phone sized controller. Who will make adjustments to the VBLOC Therapy? Therapy modifications can be easily administered by a clinician in the physician's office or bariatric clinic. Will VBLOC Therapy and the implantation procedure be covered by insurance? EnteroMedics is developing a comprehensive reimbursement strategy and documenting the results of its clinical trials in an effort to secure reimbursement coverage. POTENTIAL BENEFITS, TREATMENT & AVAILABILITY OF VBLOC THERAPY What are the potential benefits of VBLOC Therapy? VBLOC Therapy may be administered without altering a patient's digestive system anatomy.  Additionally, the implant procedure will most likely be performed on an outpatient basis. Therapy may be non-invasively adjusted to meet the needs of the patient using wireless communication technology. Unlike gastric bypass and laparoscopic banding, patients do not have significant food intolerances such as those that are common with restrictive surgical approaches. What are the potential risks of VBLOC therapy? Potential risks should always be discussed with a physician who can advise patients on their overall medical condition and possible treatment alternatives. Potential risks include the standard risks associated with laparoscopic surgery and anesthesia for any active implantable medical system or new therapy.  Clinical studies are underway to determine VBLOC Therapy morbidity and mortality risks. EnteroMedics has not observed any mortality or any medically serious device-related events that have required surgical attention in any of our completed or ongoing clinical studies.  The potential effects of VBLOC Therapy include changes in appetite, and, in some subjects, effects that may be expected with decreased intra-abdominal vagus nerve activity, such as temporary abdominal discomfort and short episodes of belching, bloating cramping or nausea.   Specific risks associated with the Maestro System are included in required informed consent documents for the clinical investigation of VBLOC Therapy. Will a patient's diet or activities be restricted due to VBLOC Therapy? Patients are able to maintain active, healthy lifestyles, without the need to adhere to complicated diets or to modify their typical daily activities as a result of frequent return trips to the physician office. As with any interventional weight loss procedure, patients receiving VBLOC Therapy are expected to eat smaller, well-balanced, healthy meals. However, VBLOC Therapy patients do not have the difficult meal restrictions associated with patients who have had bariatric surgeries, such as gastric bypass or laparoscopic banding, who must comply with a liquid or soft food diet for a number of weeks following surgery, and take prescribed long-term micronutrient supplements. Patients with laparoscopic bands are also instructed not to drink any liquids during and for up to two hours following a meal. How can a patient receive treatment using VBLOC Therapy? VBLOC Therapy is under clinical investigation and is not currently approved for commercial use in the United States. VBLOC Therapy is available for clinical investigational use at participating investigational centers through an investigational device exemption (IDE) study approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. When will a patient be able to participate in a U.S. clinical trial? The EMPOWER clinical investigation is active, but no longer enrolling patients.  The ReCharge clinical investigation is currently underway at several selected clinical trial sites. For more information about participating in the ReCharge clinical investigation, visit www.rechargestudy.com or www.clinicaltrials.gov . How will the ReCharge clinical investigation be conducted? The ReCharge clinical investigation is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial in which all patients enrolled in the trial will be implanted with an investigational device.  Patients who are randomized to the treatment arm will receive a functional device.  Patients who are randomized to the control arm, will receive a non-functional device.  One year following implant, results between the active and the control groups will be analyzed. After most patients have completed the one year follow-up, patients who were randomized to the control arm will be given the opportunity to undergo implantation of a functional device.
