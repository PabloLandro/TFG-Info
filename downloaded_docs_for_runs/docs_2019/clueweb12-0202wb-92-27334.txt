<Moderator> Welcome to tonight's chat with Dr. Cirangle . Chat starts at 8:15pm PST/11:15pm 
        EST. Please type out your questions and hit enter will see them and present 
        them to Dr. Cirangle at the time of chat in the order we receive them. Thank 
        you! <Moderator> Welcome Dr. Cirangle Please let us know when your ready to start. <Dr. Cirangle> Hi everyone! Ready! <Becky> How 
        long can you expect to have bad breath and body odor? <Dr. Cirangle > Some of the patients get these symptoms, but not most. 
        As you lose more weight, this should improve. <Lap Bander> 
        I had Lap Band surgey 1/13/05 was losing very well. I have had 2 fills 
        in the last 8 weeks and I still do not feel the fullness felling. I am 
        almost ready to give up I have actually gained 2 pounds since the last 
        fill 3 weeks ago. Is it just I do not have enough fill yet or is this 
        not going to help me. I do get the feeling of food getting stuck sometimes 
        but that is all. <Dr. Cirangle> Lap Bander, if you feel hungry soon after a solid protein 
        meal in small quantities and feel less restricted than before, you probably 
        need a fill. If you are eating carbohydrates and not exercising with higher 
        calories, you need to change your habits to lose weight. Patients often 
        need more fills as they lose weight since the area around the upper stomach 
        also loses fat. <iRWIN> Can 
        you discuss if there is any pain or discomfort associated with the insertion 
        or removal of the Foley catheter used during wls for a male patient? Thank 
        you.. <Dr. Cirangle> iRWIN, most catheters are put in after you are already 
        asleep after general anesthesia. Removing the catheter doesn't involve 
        much pain. If you need to have it put back in, it is uncomfortable but 
        not unbearable. <Louise> What 
        is the normal stoma size, when it is too small? eg 8-11mm <Dr. Cirangle> Louise, if the endoscopics is able to pass an endoscope 
        through your stoma in an RGB, it is ok. 10-12 CM is usually ok. <iRWIN> Some 
        pre-ops say they are on pre-surgery diets. Should I be on one? I'm 6' 
        2", 296lbs, BMI of 38.5 w/ sleep apnea. WLS scheduled for 4/26/05. 
        Thank you. <Dr. Cirangle> iRWIN, it is best to lose 10-20 lbs prior to weight 
        loss surgery to minimize the chance of complications and conversion to 
        open. It can be associated with better outcome after surgery due to your 
        commitment prior to surgery behaviorally. The "it's my last meal" 
        syndrome is extremely frowned upon and does no one, especially the patient, 
        any good. <Lesa> Can I 
        lose as much weight with a Lap Band as I could with the RNY? <Dr. Cirangle> Lesa, it is possible but LapBand weight loss probably 
        takes longer and needs more discipline than an RNY patient. A Hershey's 
        kiss fits perfectly in a LapBand pouch. :) <tammy> How 
        many calories should someone stay around a year out? Is each person going 
        to be different based on their weight? <Dr. Cirangle> tammy, it depends on the progress of your weight loss. 
        If you still need to lose weight, you need to have a calorie intake of 
        800/day or less. If you are trying to maintain 1000-1200 is probably better 
        and a bit more if you are losing too much. If you get to your goal at 
        9 months, you need take this strategy also. <pat nicely: what 
        should the diet be like for a 3 month post op patient and how many calories 
        should you consuming per day? <Dr. Cirangle> pat nicely: Aloha! Hope you got the Actigall prescription. 
        You should be on a 2-4 oz diet, <800 cal a day, <40 grams carbs, 
        <30 grams fat, and >60-70 grams protein for Gastric Bypass, LapBand, 
        DS, VG. Sometimes more protein in the DS because of the malabsorption 
        and if you are male. <NicholeinMO> 
        HI, I'm 24 with a BMI of 36. I am a diabetic and might have to go from 
        pills to insulin. My cholesterol is 300. Obesity runs in my family and 
        my sister just had the surgery. As a surgeon, would you want to do the 
        surgery on someone in my position? <Dr. Cirangle> NicholeinMO: Absolutely, with your BMI 35-40 with diabetes, 
        cholesterol, you are a good candidate for surgery according to NIH guidelines 
        set in 1991 as long as you are not disabled, psychologically cleared, 
        etc. <les> What is 
        your position on carbonation after 9 months? <> les: I tell my patients not to drink carbonated beverages. 
        It can stretch your stomach. <tony> When 
        do you remove your jp drain? Before your patient's leave the hospital 
        or after? I heard that some surgeons leave it in. Why is this? <> tony: I do not place drains routinely. It depends on 
        the situation in which it is placed and the particular problem it was 
        placed for. <amber> how 
        much does one lose in the first year? <Dr. Cirangle> amber: It varies depending on starting BMI, the type 
        of procedure chosen, and compliance with the lifestyle changes required. 
        In our experience, patients can lose 120 lbs or more with the duodenal 
        switch, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and Vertical Gastrectomy. Lap Band patients 
        lose weight slower. <eric> what 
        is most important to watch after surgery calories or fats? <Dr. Cirangle> eric: carbs, fats and calories. The easiest way to think 
        about being successful after weight loss surgery is to change the order 
        in which you eat your meal: protein first to maintain >70 grams of 
        protein a day, which can help minimize carb/fat/calorie intake. Doing 
        the reverse with defeat successful weight loss. <Missy> Hello, 
        and thank you for taking my question! I am currently 15 weeks post -op 
        and am down 82 lbs as of today. My starting weight was 287. I was wondering 
        if you could tell me in your professional opinion if this is good progress 
        that I am making? <Dr. Cirangle> Missy: Can you tell me how tall you are? <Moderator> No answer back. <Dr. Cirangle> Well, regardless, that's pretty good weight loss but 
        I need to calculate her excess body weight given if she is 6 feet tall 
        versus 4 foot 11. <giner> what 
        is the difference between a distal and proximal RNY? <Dr. Cirangle> Giner: The proximal RNY has less bypassed intestine 
        than the distal RNY. <heather> Why 
        do insurance companies and doctors require the psycheatric evaluations? <Dr. Cirangle> heather: There is a documented incidence of suicide 
        after weight loss surgery in unstable, undiagnosed depressed patients. 
        I've have seen many people who are on some kind of antidepressant. Also, 
        there must be some evaluation of the "sound mind" status for 
        the person to have realistic expectations about the changes and results 
        after weight loss surgery. <Kim> how long 
        after surgery before you can swim, with Open? <Dr. Cirangle > Kim: Well, if you staples are out, it make be another 
        2-3 months depending on how you are healing. <Jeff> how long 
        before you can have sex? <Dr. Cirangle> Jeff, with laparoscopic surgery, about 2-3 weeks is 
        a reasonable time. If you incisions hurt, as with any strenuous activity, 
        you should slow down. With open surgery, you should wait longer. <mary> why do 
        some doctors not do patients over BMI 60? do you? <Dr. Cirangle> mary: patients with a BMI over 60 are considered very 
        high risk and thus less experienced surgeons may not have the technical 
        skills are are concerned about the care of those patients more than we 
        are. Yes, we actually are specialists in taking care of high risk patients. 
        I believe my heaviest patient is 550 lbs and he lost 234 lbs in 1 year 
        with out a single complication! <beth> my question 
        is about blood clots. What can I do before surgery to help prevent blood 
        clots. <Dr. Cirangle> beth: increase your activity, stop birth control pills 
        1 month prior to surgery, undergo laparoscopic surgery which allows for 
        quicker recovery, return to activity, walk the evening after surgery, 
        etc. <jerry> what 
        is the DS? <Dr. Cirangle> The DS is also called the BPD-DS, or the biliopancreatic 
        diversion with duodenal switch, or just duodenal switch. It involves making 
        a narrow tube out of your stomach an bypassing all but the last 1 yard 
        of your small intestine to induce malabsorption of fat calories to assist 
        in weight loss, especially in superobese patients. <Peach Tree> 
        what makes a surgeon a good one? what should I look out for? <Dr. Cirangle> Peach Tree: Experience, Knowledge and explanation of 
        all the risks and benefits of surgery, a comprehensive preoperative preparation 
        and postoperative diet/lifestyle program described in written form, support 
        groups, responsiveness to calls/questions from patients and doctors alike. 
        Remember, the American Society of Bariatric Surgery and many papers have 
        described that there is a learning curve to become an excellent surgeon 
        and this is 150 cases. All of us (Dr. Jossart, Cirangle, and myself ) 
        at Laparoscopic Associates of San Francisco far exceed that, perform 4 
        different procedures, with all the latest techniques, and underwent specialized 
        training not only to perform the operation but to take care of the patients 
        afterwards. http://www.lapsf.com/ and you can see what we do. <Parrish> For 
        someone waiting to have surgery, what are some things I can do now to 
        help improve the outcome once I have it? I have a three month (at least) 
        waiting period... <Dr. Cirangle> Lose as much weight as possible, significantly increase 
        your activity level, read as much and ask as much about nutrition and 
        vitamins and everything. Get into it. People often spend much more time 
        deciding on which car to buy than to pick their surgeon or the type of 
        procedure that they are going to have. We will even put our patients on 
        an Optifast diet to maximize weight loss for successful laparoscopic surgery 
        outcome. <cat> i am 6 
        days post op and i want to know if i can have sex yet? I have pcos and 
        have tryed 13 years to get pregnant, should i really be worried about 
        getting pregnant now? <Dr. Cirangle> cat: congrats! as I said it's 2-3 weeks. It is a serious 
        mistake to assume that you will continue to be infertile. Start a reliable 
        birth control method. I had a patient who never menstruated, started 2 
        months magically after her surgery and was pregnant by 6 months after 
        surgery. That is very dangerous for the developing fetus and is severely 
        discouraged. Your body is going through significant changes and you even 
        have a chance of getting malnourished with vitamin deficiencies. What 
        do you think would happen to a developing fetus with folate, vitamin deficiency 
        if you are vomiting from a stricture or having severe diarrhea? Be safe. <mainemissy28> 
        how do we get our weightloss started again after it stops from a medical 
        reason.. ? i had cancer of the thyroid , i was hypothyroid wich made my 
        motablism not working.. and i need a way to jump start my wls again.. <Dr. Cirangle> mm28: just start off as if you just had surgery: eat 
        protein (fish, chicken, meat, lean pork) first in your meal, exercise 
        5-7X a week, drink plenty of liquids, keep you calorie intake below 800/day, 
        see your surgeon, go to support group meetings, take your vitamins, calcium, 
        B12 if you had an RGB and ADEK vitamins if you had a DS, etc etc. <lori> How long 
        should one wait to get a tummy tuck? <Dr. Cirangle> lori, you want to wait until your weight stabilizes 
        and your comprehensive nutritional, metabolic panel of blood tests are 
        normal. <Kelley F> About 
        what percentage of calories do we lose because of malabsorbtion with a 
        RNY? <Dr. Cirangle> Kelley F: it depends on if it's proximal or distal but 
        most of the weight loss with a proximal RNY is from the small amount of 
        food you ingest (restriction) and not any significant malabsorption of 
        calories. <carrie> I reciently 
        had versed for a vascular procedure, since Monday my lap band has been 
        very tight, wondering if the versed had anything to do with this? <Dr. Cirangle> carrie, probably not. <luke> Why do 
        many post-op gastric bypass patients experience problems with their gall 
        bladder? <Dr. Cirangle> luke: actually I would say that the opposite is true. 
        If you take Actigall 300 mg twice a day for 6-12 months, your risk of 
        gallstone formation is dropped from 33% to 2%. <todd> i'm 7 
        weeks out and not doing as well with foods i ate 3 weeks out in fact i 
        feel nausiated daily now <Dr. Cirangle> todd: which procedure did you have and did you tell 
        your surgeon? what did he or she say? what are you eating or drinking 
        nowadays? are you having any abdominal pain? <Moderator> no reply yet... <Dr. Cirangle> Anyway, if you had a RNY, you may need an endoscopy 
        for a stricture soon. <Tim> What does 
        you BMI have to be to qualify with most insurances for the surgery? Or, 
        is there a weight chart that says if you are 100 pounds over weight? <Dr. Cirangle> Tim: BMI > 40 or 35-40 with medical problems. You 
        can go to my website http://www.lapsf.com/ to calculate your BMI. <Roberta> HOW 
        COME I THROW UP FOOD THATS SUPPOSE TO BE GOOD FOR ME BUT CAN EAT AN ICE 
        CREAM CONE NO PROBLEM <Dr. Cirangle> Roberta: Here is what I tell patients: Take ice-cream, 
        pasta, mash potatoes, lettuce, etc and put it in a bowl of warm water. 
        What happens to that stuff? They just dissolve and can go down any narrow 
        pipe. If you take a piece of chicken and do the same, it will sit there 
        for a year. You need to chew your food well. Talk to your surgeon. Make 
        sure you don't have a stricture. If fish is OK you are probably OK but 
        communication of these symptoms is important, and an experienced surgeon 
        should be able to give some answers. <Moderator> last question goes to..... <kathy> i have 
        had this surgery done in 1998 and now i have a leak and have to do it 
        again so my guestion is could this leak be harmful if it is not fix. <Dr. Cirangle> kathy: I don't understand how you can have a "leak" 
        seven years later. If you have a fistula, you probably have not lost or 
        have regain a lot of weight. It depends on what you mean. Please ask your 
        surgeon or see one for evaluation with x-rays. <Moderator> Dr. Cirangle of Laparoscopic Associates of San Francisco Website: http://www.lapsf.com/ Phone: 866-957-3627 Fax: 415-561-1713 E-mail: WeightLoss@lapsf.com <Moderator> Another Great Chat tonight!!
