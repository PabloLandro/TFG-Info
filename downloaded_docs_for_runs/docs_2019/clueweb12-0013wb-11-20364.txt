His ongoing success with weight loss is easy for millions of American television watchers to see. But now, the American public can view the actual surgery, performed via a live Webcast from Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, on June 23 from 5pm to 6pm EDT. James (Butch) Rosser, MD, director of minimally invasive surgery at Beth Israel, who himself underwent bariatric surgery in August 2001 (and has since lost 150 pounds), will perform the surgery, which is designed for the more than five million Americans who suffer from clinically severe, or morbid, obesity. Dr. Rosser will perform the surgery via a minimally invasive procedure known as laparoscopy, where several, small surgical incisions are made instead of one long incision, as in conventional “open” surgery. The result is significantly less post-operative pain, risk of infection and recovery time. Gastric bypass surgery has been endorsed by the National Institutes of Health(NIH), the World Health Organization, The American Obesity Association, the Heart Association, and Shape Up America.
