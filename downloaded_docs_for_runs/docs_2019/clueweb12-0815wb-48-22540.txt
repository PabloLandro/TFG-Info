Subjects were randomly    assigned to receive either acupuncture or medication (estazolam) plus sham acupuncture.    Acupuncture treatment consisted of needling the following abdominal acupuncture    points: CV-17, CV-10, CV-4, CV-6, KI-17, ST-24, Xiafengshidian, and Qipang. The authors concluded, "Results indicate that short-term abdominal acupuncture is more effective than pharmacological treatment for relieving insomnia in adult women and has few adverse effects." Some people are very sensitive to medications, and can only use natural sleep    aids. This study adds acupuncture to the list of natural options for insomnia.    As an aside, microcurrent therapies, such as Frequency Specific Microcurrent,    can help fibromyalgia and nerve pain, and seems especially helpful for insomnia    — again, without medication side effects.
