The film asks,What would happen if women were taught to enjoy birth rather than endure it?

Testimonials I came to Sharon over a year and a half ago with chronic insomnia, and though I was using prescription sleep aids regularly, I still rarely slept through the night. Unlike the many other doctors I have seen for my insomnia, Sharon did not ask me to shape my life around my treatments, but rather, took tremendous care to work with me to integrate my treatments into my life. When I started acupuncture, I was afraid that I would become reliant on my treatments, as I had on my prescribed medications, but after three months, when I took a break from treatments to test this theory, I found that my quality of sleep was still vastly improved. I now see Sharon on a "maintenance" treatment plan, and with her help, I continue to see a huge difference in the quality of my sleep. Over the past year and a half, Sharon has helped me to sleep through a stressful job transition, an apartment search, and innumerable small crisis that would have previously kept me tossing and turning for weeks on end!
