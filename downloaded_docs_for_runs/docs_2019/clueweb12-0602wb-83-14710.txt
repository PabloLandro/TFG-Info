Medication Medication If neither rest nor hot or cold treatments alleviates your back pain, your doctor may recommend a pain-relieving drug. Some pain medications can be taken orally, while others require injections. Oral medications include analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and muscle relaxants--all of which can help relieve back pain and muscle tension or swelling. Over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen are the most common pain-reducing and anti-inflammatory drugs. Prescription medications, including muscle relaxants and stronger analgesics, are also options. Pain is your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong. Taking medication may ease your pain, but does not necessarily treat the underlying problem. Reducing pain can, however, also give your body time to heal.

For many back injuries and spine conditions, taking medication to help control the pain represents one element of treatment. Although medication alone may be tried first, more aggressive treatments are often needed as well. Doctors often prescribe medication in conjunction with a physical therapy regimen. The medication treats the pain, while the physical therapy focuses on strengthening muscles and increasing flexibility, both of which will help to prevent (re)injury. Warning Do not take any medication except under the explicit direction of any of our providers. Work with your physician so that you can both make an informed decision about what medication(s) you will be taking.
