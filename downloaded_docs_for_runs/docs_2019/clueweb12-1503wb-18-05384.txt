<5 min) analysis of airborne  microorganisms. For this challenge our laboratory has introduced the use of  proteomic strategies to deduce the identities of bacteria, spores, viruses and  protein toxins from MALDI mass spectra. Collaborators include the researchers  at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the Johns Hopkins  Medical School and local industries. Research in the Fenselau lab is strongly cross-disciplinary,  and Dr. Fenselau welcomes graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from  analytical chemistry, biochemistry, cell and molecular biology and  bioengineering. As one of the first trained mass spectroscopists to take  a faculty position in a U.S. medical school (Johns Hopkins), Catherine Fenselau  has led the application of mass spectrometry in many aspects of biomedical  research. She has a record of working successfully with difficult samples. For  example, she first identified the active metabolite of the widely used  oncostatic cyclophosphamide, proved that the false anticancer agent Laetrile  is actually a glucuronide conjugate, and demonstrated that allosteric  hexamers of insulin held together by two zinc ions also complex six water  molecules. Instrumentation All instrumentation required for protein biochemistry is  available in the Fenselau Lab or in the Department. Laboratory facilities  support 2D gel electrophoresis, capillary HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.  Both OffGel and GelFree devices are available for solution electrophoresis. High  throughput proteomics analysis is carried out in the College Proteomics  Facility using a state-of-the-art capLC-LTQ-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry  system.
