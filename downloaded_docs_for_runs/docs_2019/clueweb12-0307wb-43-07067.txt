Immunotherapy Palliative Care Radiation Therapy Surgery Targeted Therapies Complementary & Alternative Medicine Therapies List Laetrile This treatment modality is used in place of conventional therapies to treat cancer. Seek advice from a qualified physician before replacing standard cancer therapy with Laetrile therapy. What does Laetrile therapy involve? Laetrile, also known as amygdalin, Vitamin B17, sarcarcinase and nitriloside, is a natural substance found in the pits of some fruits and nuts. Laetrile is a compound that can release cyanide, a lethal molecule.  Treatment with Laetrile is commonly administered intravenously for two to three weeks. The treatment is followed up by oral maintenance doses. How is Laetrile thought to treat cancer? There are two theories by which Laetrile is claimed to work: 1. Cyanide Release Theory Beta-glucosidase, an enzyme which is thought to exist in large quantities in cancerous tissue, causes the release of hydrogen cyanide from Laetrile. Cyanide stops tumor respiration and selectively kills the cancerous tissue. 2. Vitamin Deficiency Theory Cancer is the result of a vitamin deficiency and Laetrile is the missing “vitamin B17.” What has been proven about the benefit of Laetrile? Scientific studies have been conducted for over twenty years and no evidence of any antitumor activity, in either animals or humans, has been found. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved laetrile as a treatment for cancer, although the drug is manufactured and distributed as a cancer treatment in Mexico. What is the potential risk or harm of Laetrile? While taking Laetrile, patients may experience nausea, vomiting, headache and dizziness. There are several reports in the medical literature in which Laetrile caused life-threatening toxicity and even death. Cyanide toxicity can cause progressive neuromuscular weakness and respiratory arrest. How much does laetrile cost? Laetrile is usually given as part of a larger treatment program and can cost between $2,000 and $5,000 per week.
