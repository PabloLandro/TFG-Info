Acupuncture -- as an alternative medicine include('/var/www/html/seniors-site.com/www/scripts/top.php'); ?> Acupuncture FAQ Acupuncture is the gentle insertion of hair-fine needles into specific
points on the body to stimulate the flow of one's Qi (pronounced chee)
or natural healing energy. Acupuncture needles used today in the United States are all sterile and generally disposable.  They come in sterile containers, are used once, and then disposed of. Safety Acupuncture and herbal treatments are drug-free, you avoid side effects
or dependency. However, you should always inform any health practitioner
about all pre-existing conditions, the names of all medications you are
taking, whether you are, or could be pregnant, and if you have a cardiac
pacemaker or cosmetic implants. Your acupuncturist will be able to
evaluate your specific situation with this information to insure the
best results. Acupuncture treatment may be used along with other medical care to great
advantage. It has been used for pain control after other medical or
dental procedures, for  improving healing, and to lessen the
side-effects of some drugs including chemo-therapy. Does acupuncture hurt? Most people are surprised to learn that acupuncture needles are very
thin. From ten to fifteen acupuncture needles can fit into one
conventional hypodermic needle. Acupuncturists can attain a
high level of skill in gently placing these tiny needles into the skin
with a minimum of discomfort. Can acupuncture be effective when other treatments have
failed? Absolutely! Each system of medicine has its own areas of greatest
effectiveness. Acupuncture excels in those areas in which conventional
medicine comes up short. Chronic disease, pain control, and stress
related disorders are three of acupuncture and Oriental medicine's
specialties. Conditions successfully treated with Oriental Medicine
