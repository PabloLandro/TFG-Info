Dental sealants are a great way to protect your child's permanent teeth from cavities. Answer: Dental sealants are a clear and protective coating that is applied to the biting surfaces of the back teeth. The sealant protects the tooth from getting a cavity by shielding against bacteria and plaque. Sealants are most commonly placed on children's permanent back teeth because they are more prone to cavities. Most insurance companies pay for sealants on children's teeth.  They can also be placed on adult's teeth, however, insurance usually won't cover them.
