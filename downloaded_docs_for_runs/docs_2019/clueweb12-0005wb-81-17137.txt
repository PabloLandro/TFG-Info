If your child has a cough, even if it is a productive cough with green mucus, it is unlikely to be pneumonia if he is not having any difficulty breathing. Your child may also have a productive cough because of mucus draining down the back of his throat. If your child is coughing and having difficulty breathing, then he should be evaluated by his physician. If he does have pneumonia then he will need to take an antibiotic as treatment for the infection. Your doctor will probably be able to diagnose pneumonia by listening to your child's chest with a stethoscope, but he may also need an x-ray. Mild cases of pneumonia will be treated at home with an oral antibiotic, but more serious infections may require hospitalization.
