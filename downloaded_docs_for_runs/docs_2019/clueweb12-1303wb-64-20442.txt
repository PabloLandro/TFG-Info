All the types of aloe vera products come from the aloe vera plant. Inside the leaves of the plant is a yellow gel substance. This gel can be used as is or processed into different products. Medicinal Use of Aloe Vera Aloe vera is said to have medicinal properties, including treating skin problems, healing wounds and treating intestinal problems. There is actually no scientific evidence confirming those sayings – you should always consult a doctor prior to taking anything for medicinal purposes, including aloe vera. Aloe Vera Use – How To Use The Gel Even though the aloe vera gel can be used directly from the leaf, some of its benefits can not be used in this form. So, manufactures have found ways to make different forms of aloe vera to help people get all of the benefits they can from the plant. Aloe vera gel can come straight from the plant, as mentioned, however if a person does not own an aloe vera plant then they can also buy the gel prepared commercially (beware of some brands adding dangerous chemicals). Usually the aloe vera gel is mixed with other ingredients to produce a thick gel similar in look and texture to hair gel. Aloe vera can also be made into a concentrate. This is done by taking the water out of the gel. Concentrate is used in making other products like creams or in capsule to be taken for internal aloe vera use . Aloe vera juice is another popular aloe vera product. The juice is another product that can be taken internally. The juice is made from aloe vera gel and usually contains at least 50% of the gel. Aloe vera is found in a wide range of products and forms, these just represent the most common forms. Any Other Aloe Vera Use? These are just a few examples of the many variations of aloe vera. The different forms of aloe vera allow it to be used both externally and internally. Aloe vera is added to many different products as well. The range of uses for aloe vera make it a popular product no matter what form it is in.
