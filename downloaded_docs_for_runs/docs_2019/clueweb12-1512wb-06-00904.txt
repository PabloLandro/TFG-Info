Hypnotherapy can help with a wide range of problems. It can help wherever there is a psychological component such as with obsessive thinking, phobias, anxiety or lack of confidence. Hypnosis cannot cure organic diseases but it can recruit the enormous healing power of the mind to help control pain, and improve many chronic conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Thoughts and Ideas People may suffer from persistent thoughts of low self esteem, or compulsive worrying about everyday events. Many people will find that the harder they try to 'not think about' these things the harder it seems to be. Hypnotherapy can be very helpful enabling people to find a more positive focus and let go of habitual thoughts that have troubled them for many years. Fears and Phobias Hypnotherapy is remarkably effective in helping people overcome phobias and fears quickly and permanently. Feelings Feelings of anxiety, jealousy or guilt can be released and replaced with more helpful and constructive feelings  very reliably and completely. Habits Any habit from nail biting to smoking can be effectively removed and replaced with Hypnotherapy often quite quickly and without 'will-power'.
