A doctor can keep track of withdrawal symptoms so that more serious health problems don't develop. He or she can also give emotional support. Medicines can control the shakiness, anxiety and confusion that come with alcohol withdrawal. Only a doctor can prescribe these medicines. If you take the medicines at an early stage of the withdrawal, they may keep your symptoms from getting worse. Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal or Delirium Tremens The goals are to treat the immediate withdrawal symptoms, prevent complications, and begin long-term preventative therapy. The person will probably have to stay at the hospital for constant observation. Heart rate, breathing, body temperature, and blood pressure are monitored, as well as fluids and electrolytes  (chemicals in the body such as sodium and potassium). The patient's symptoms may progress rapidly and may quickly become life-threatening. Drugs that depress the central nervous system (such as sedatives) may be required to reduce symptoms, often in moderately large doses. Treatment may require maintenance of a moderately sedated state for a week or more until withdrawal is complete. A class of medications known as the benzodiazepines are often useful in reducing a range of symptoms. A drying-out period may be appropriate. No alcohol is allowed during this time. The health care provider will watch closely for signs of delirium tremens . Hallucinations that occur without other symptoms or complications are uncommon. They are treated with hospitalization and antipsychotic medications as needed.
