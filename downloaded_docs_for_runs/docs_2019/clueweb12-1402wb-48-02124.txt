Whooping cough, or pertussis, mainly affects infants and young children. Caused by a bacterium, it is characterized by paroxysms (intense fits or spells) of coughing that end with the characteristic whoop as air is inhaled. Whooping cough caused thousands of deaths in the 1930s and 1940s, but, with the advent of a vaccine, the rate of death has declined dramatically. What are the symptoms of whooping cough? The disease usually takes one to three weeks to incubate. The following are the most common symptoms of whooping cough. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include: coughing sneezing nasal discharge fever sore, watery eyes whooping lips, tongue, and nailbeds may turn blue during coughing spells Whooping cough can last up to 10 weeks and can lead to pneumonia. The symptoms of whooping cough may resemble other medical conditions. Always consult your physician for a diagnosis. How is whooping cough diagnosed? In addition to a complete medical history and medical examination, diagnosis of whooping cough is often confirmed with a culture taken from the nose.
