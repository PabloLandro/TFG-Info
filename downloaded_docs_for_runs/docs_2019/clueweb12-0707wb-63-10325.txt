        to Previous page Unlike ghrelin levels in the diet group, 
        those in the surgery group did not oscillate in relation to meals. In 
        fact, "ghrelin levels not only failed to rise but dropped profoundly," 
        says Dr. David Cummings, the study's lead researcher and endocrinologist 
        at VA Puget Sound Healthcare System and the University of Washington in 
        Seattle. Cummings explains the reason for 
              the dramatic difference: The objective of gastric bypass surgery 
              is to shrink the stomach to only 5 percent of its original size 
              by rewiring the course of food through the digestive system. The 
              tiny new stomach pouch can hold only two teaspoons of food, which 
              then travels into the very first part of the small intestine. It is the presence of ingested food 
              and nutrients that activate the ghrelin cells in the stomach. The 
              permanent absence of food in this organ ultimately suppresses ghrelin 
              production. For next page, click Weight 
      Loss Diet and Ghrelin Weight Loss Surgery - No Guarantees Gastrointestinal weight loss surgery is not an easy weight loss option. 
        It's a serious surgical procedure whose long-term weight loss success 
        depends on a patient's commitment to diet and behavior modification for 
        life, along with exercise for weight control. See also: Weight
