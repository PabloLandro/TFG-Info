Cranberry Benefits Cranberry is nature's cure for urinary tract infections, which particularly afflict women. Cranberries stimulate the production of a powerful substance called hippuric acid that has a strong antibiotic effect on the urinary tract. Hippuric acid discourages and even eliminates infection causing bacteria. Cranberry also works by inhibiting the ability of microorganisms to stick the the cells lining the urinary tract, making it a less hospitable environment for disease causing bacteria such as E-coli to breed, thereby reducing the risk of infection. Several studies have shown that daily consumption of cranberry dramatically reduces the recurrence of urinary tract infections. Women are 10x as likely to have these infections as men! Cranberry has also been shown to shorten the duration of urinary tract infections, helping reduce pain, burning, itching and other symptoms. Cranberry also helps deoderise urine so is invaluable to anyone suffering from incontinence. Cranberry is also high in Vitamin C. Recommended Use Each day take 2 capsules with a glass of water. This is equivalent to 12,500mg of Cranberry. You May Prefer... 100% Pure Concentrated Cranberry Juice £10.95 per litre bottle - 16 daily servings! Just 100% Cranberry.
