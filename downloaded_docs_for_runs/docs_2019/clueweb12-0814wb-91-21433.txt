Gebreselassie Background: The protective effect of male circumcision from HIV infection and Sexual Transmitted Diseases (STDs) is controversial as various studies report conflicting findings. The study is aimed to assess the protective effect of male circumcision from HIV infection and STDs. Methods: This is a cross sectional comparative study based on secondary data of 18 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa starting from 2003. From all surveys, information on 70,554 males aged 15-59 years was extracted. The association between male circumcision and HIV infection and STD symptoms (Genital discharge or genital ulcer/sore) was assessed using binary logistic regression. Adjustment was made for sexual history and basic socio-demographic variables. Results: The weighted prevalence of HIV among men 15-59 years was 3.1%. In the bivairate analysis being uncircumcised was significantly associated with risk of HIV with Odds Ratio (OR) of 4.12 (95% CI: 3.85-4.42). The association was even more significant, 4.95 (95% CI: 4.57-5.36), after adjustment for number of sexual and socio-demographic variables. The risk associated with un-circumcision is significantly lower among younger men aged 15-29 years than those in 30-59 years age category. About 5.5% of the study subjects reported either genital discharge or genital sore/ulcer in the preceding 12 months of the surveys. Circumcision was not significantly associated with ether of the symptoms of STD with adjusted OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.99-1.15). Conclusions: Male circumcision provides a strong protection against acquisition of HIV infection. Hence, it can be considered as an important way of reducing the spread of HIV infection in areas where the practice is rare. A comprehensive study to assess the association between circumcision and different types STDs is recommended. Abstract no. MOPE0328 Suggested Citation " S.
