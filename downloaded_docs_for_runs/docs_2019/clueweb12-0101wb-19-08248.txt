References have also been found from the early Indian and Chinese cultures. These ancient records detail the therapeutic advantages and healing properties of Aloe Vera particularly as a topical treatment for wounds, burns and skin irritations. Egyptian Queens associated the use of Aloe Vera with their physical beauty, while in the Philippines it was taken with milk to treat kidney infections.
