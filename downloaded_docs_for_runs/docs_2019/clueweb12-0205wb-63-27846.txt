How Does Aloe Vera work? Aloeride capsules - Aloe Vera Product Pure Aloe Vera > How Does Aloe Vera Work? How Does Aloe Vera Work? The plant aloe vera contains a complex mixture of molecules. The Handbook of Phytochemical Constituents of GRAS Herbs and Other Economic Plants by James A. Duke states that there are as much as 300 different types of molecules in aloe vera. Hardly surprising then that it has multiple effects on multiple tissue types. Unfortunately this broad spectrum of activity also fuels academic skepticism because aloe vera does just too much to be true. To put that last criticism into perspective, even in Prescription Only Medication (POM) there is not just one thing any drug does. This is why we have monthly editions of MIMS and BNP to show, next to the indications of POMs, their contraindications, warnings, other drug interactions and adverse effects. POMs are as targeted molecules as a pharmaceutical company can make them, yet they affect so much. Imagine a plant with 300 different types of molecules, of course it is going to act broad spectrum. Aloe vera has been used by millions of people worldwide throughout the ages. Empirical evidence accumulated in accolades like miracle plant and burn plant but for academic validity such a sustained track record is said to be meaningless. But even in todays climate of evidence based medicine (EBM) much of day to day healthcare is characterized by non evidence based practice, variation in practice, inadequate outcome data, and inequality of access to optimal treatment and ultimately a lack of evidence base. (Virus Research, Volume 89, Issue 2, November 2002, Pages 175-181). Entrenched skeptics should note that lack of evidence of efficacy should not be confused with evidence of lack of efficacy. The former says that there is insufficient evidence to pass judgment. The latter says it does not work. Of course good aloe vera works. Quite beside that there is safety and validation in the numbers (millions of people) and in the length of time aloe vera has been used (centuries), there is a lot of good quality research on aloe vera as well as scientific knowledge about what its different type of molecules do. This said how well an aloe vera product works depends entirely on its quantity of working molecules, the quality of them and purity of product. On all counts Aloeride is an exemplary product that stands head and shoulders above its competitors. So how does it work? Aloeride is mostly taken by mouth but can also be applied to the skin. When taken by mouth, in the fluid environment of the stomach, the Aloeride capsules dissolve within 1 or 2 minutes giving our powder plenty of time to mix with the ample water (your stomachs mixing waves occur every 15-25 seconds) with which you swallowed the capsules. So you have now rehydrated your aloe vera powder. Only when you have lesions or inflammation in your mouth or esophagus is there a need for opening the capsules and ingesting the powder with water. This is easy and it does not taste horrible. With all 300 different types of molecules are out of the capsule, Aloeride goes to work. Broadly speaking the action is threefold and interconnected: anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory and tissue healing with the target being mostly epithelium (tissue that separates tissue cells from air). Of course the first point of contact of these molecules is the alimentary canal, so it is hardly surprising that Aloeride's molecules show their effect there first. Because Aloeride's molecules also are absorbed into your bloodstream; they also find their way to peripheral tissue. Thus Aloeride exerts effect way beyond the alimentary canal and causes powerful inside-out healing, the only route for safe wound healing and 24/7 skin care. Just how broad spectrum aloe vera works is underpinned by good research: cell growth, anti-inflammatory effect, anti-microbial effect, effect on burns, anti-diabetic effect, cardiovascular and lipid effect, anti-ageing effect and response to UV light, wound healing, gastrointestinal effects and immune modulation. Broad spectrum action is the result of 300 types of molecules as well as domino effect. To explain the latter, an inflamed intestinal wall for example becomes permeable to macromolecules that ought to stay within your alimentary canal. Enterocytes (intestines absorptive lining cells) normally determine what may enter the body - via transcellular crossing - and what stays inside the intestines. In leaky gut syndrome gaps occur in between the enterocytes so indiscriminate, paracellular crossing now can happen. Macromolecules gate crashing into your body trigger immune reactions. Aloeride helps close the gaps between enterocytes, thus indirectly changing immune response beyond its direct, researched effect on phagocytosis, lymphocytes and T-helper cells. Beyond that Aloeride also creates a more favorable milieu for good gut bacteria which in turn improves immunity. Three hundred different types of aloe vera molecules, working synergistically and causing domino effects, will act broad spectrum and the magic of all this forms the basis for aloe veras much deserved accolades.
