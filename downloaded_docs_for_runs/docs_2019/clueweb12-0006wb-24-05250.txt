Interview with Dr. Nakazawa > you are in News & Events Interview with Dr. Nakazawa August 31, 2000 8:00 - 9:00 p.m. (EST) Moderator Good evening, Dr. Nakazawa. Thank you forjoining us this evening. We will wait until 8 ED to officially start the chat so other guestscan arrive. Good evening everyone. Dr. Nakazawa is experiencing sometechnical difficulties. However, he is here and I will be typing hisanswers for him. Thank you. Moderator Dr. Nakazawa is a general surgeon andacupuncturist with a private practice in Baltimore, Md. He is alsosecretary of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. Wouldanyone like to open our chat this evening on medical acupuncture forosteoarthritis? lisad Dr. Nakazawa, I understand you work with many arthritis patients. How long have you been doing so? Dr. Nakazawa : I have been working with arthritis patients for about 6 years. Moderator Dr. does acupuncture help treat rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis? Dr. Nakazawa : Acupuncture has a place in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is more generalized than osteoarthritis. As a result, it's more difficult to treat. Acupuncture can be difficult in treating the chronic stage of rheumatoid arthritis. But it can provide some transient relief from the pain. However, it is a more general disease, so acupuncture can help a patient restore or improve his or her feeling of well being. lisad Have you always used acupuncture in treating this condition? Dr. Nakazawa : No. I have not always used acupuncture for treating arthritis. I combine it with moxa (dried mog weed) and also diet - nutritional supplements. I don't deny anything. An anti-inflammatory drug can be useful, as long it is under the physician's supervision. Patients taking medicines over the counter, often go on for months without letting anyone know until they reach complications, such as gastro-intestinal bleeding, etc. chaz5 I don't understand how needles can help arthritis. Dr. Nakazawa : Chaz5.... It's a basic concept of acupuncture. It's a question of how acupuncture works. Inserting acupuncture needles into the skin will produce, number one, increased local blood circulation. Number two... It will stimulate the production of endorphines, which produce a morphine-like physiological effect. Therefore, the patient feels less pain and it eases the tension that patients often feel. I see more chronic arthritis. Patients typically come and complain of pain, and swelling and going up and down steps. chaz5 Does it hurt? Dr. Nakazawa : Chaz, no. The size or the needle is about the size of a strand of hair. So the smaller, thinner needle is less painful. We use a quick insertion technique. It is inserted in about a quarter of an inch. Patients usually don't feel pain. The Japanese needles are the thinnest and least painful. Lisad : What causes osteoarthritis? Dr. Nakazawa : Lisa... In traditional Chinese medicine, there are two large categories.. one, external and the other internal. We call external invasions - wind, cold, dampness and heat - affects our body's surface. The second category - internal - means more emotional varieties.. such as joy, anger, sadness, fear and worries. That causes stress - inside and outside. Internally, our body "chi" flow or energy flow can be impaired or obstructed by those stresses. It can cause a circulatory disturbance, so that the tissue doesn't get enough oxygen. That can cause the pain deep into the joint. Osteoarthritis is also called the "wear and tear" arthritis. That is caused by degeneration of the cartilage in the joint. This may also be compounded by increased body weight or physical stress. A 200-pound body weight has the effect of one ton of weight into the knee joint! chaz5 So what will I feel when you touch my skin with a needle? Dr. Nakazawa : Chaz.. You usually don't feel it if you have an experienced acupuncturist. Otherwise, it's a quick light prick, but not like a stinging needle. lisad Are arthritis patients more inclined to come to you since you are a medical doctor? Dr. Nakazawa : Lisa... I often get physician referrals to my practice. It makes it easier because I can discuss medications with their physicians as well. Having a basic knowledge of how to approach Western and Eastern medical ways helps. chaz5 What's a typical first visit like? Dr. Nakazawa : AT first, you take a patient history. We need to know how long they have had this because acute arthritis and chronic arthritis are different entities. Acute arthritis can be handled in a step by step easier way to alleviate the pain while guiding the patient in terms of nutrition, exercise, etc. That is, along with acupuncture treatments. On the other hand, chronic arthritis is treated with different modalities. The cartilage of the joint in chronic arthritis is actually damaged. So the patient tends to be more limited in range of motion. Acupuncture alone can be supportive - but it is not something that cures. Acute osteoarthritis is caused by injury, for example, and doesn't involve the degeneration of the cartilage.. lisad How can I find medical acupuncture docs in DC? Dr. Nakazawa : Lisa.. The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture has chapters throughout the USA. The number is 323-937-5514. Or you can check the Academy's web site, although I'm sorry I don't have the address for that handy. sflaviano it's www.medicalacupuncture.org drdo1 The more appropriate number for the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture is 800/521-2262. Moderator : The Academy is based in LA. Dr. Nakazawa : Thank you. I thought it was so, but I didn't want to give out an incorrect address. chaz5 Is there a "cut-off" age for people who should not receive acupuncture? Dr. Nakazawa : There is no cut-off age. I treat many patients in nursing homes who are quite older. Moderator Doctor, how many visits does someone need to make for acupuncture treatment of osteoarthritis? Dr. Nakazawa : The minimum number of treatments is typically six. Then, we would make a decision whether we should continue. chrisb Hi Doc. I would like to know if acupuncture actually does something to help cure the arthritis, or if it is just a pain management aid. Dr. Nakazawa : Chris, we talked about this earlier, but the chances of curing arthritis is limited. For chronic arthritis pain, you can provide relief. The treatment is more supportive or palliative. A lot depends on if the outcome of the initial treatment. As a follow up, we can combine the acupuncture with some other modality, such as physical therapy or exercise. Often a nutritionist can help. chaz5 How many arthritis patients do you treat on average? Also, what else do you treat? Dr. Nakazawa : I treat between 5 to 10 patients a week. Chaz. Do you mean what else do I treat by medical acupuncture? chaz5 Yes. Do you treat other conditions? Dr. Nakazawa : Medical acupuncture is like a general practice, but with acupuncture needles. Many conditions can be handled by medical acupuncture. Medical acupuncture can be used to treat asthma, allergies, general fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, and severe back pain, headache, for example. It is also used to treat gastro-intestinal diseases and some gynecological conditions, such as PMS and menopausal syndrome. These conditions can be handled with very good results. Also, in treatment with acupuncture, many patients do come back after the initial treatment for an adjustment, or maintenance. For instance, a patient comes once every two or three weeks after the initial treatment. Insurance policies vary as to what coverage they will provide, if any. Always check with our insurance company first to see what they would cover. chaz5 How much does exercise play a part in helping relieve arthritis pain? Dr. Nakazawa : Chaz, this depends on the severity of the arthritic condition. If a patient can do simple walking - which is an excellent exercise - or warm water swimming, or pedaling on a stationary bike - then that's good because those exercises are not so hard on the joints. Aerobic exercises, such as jogging or aerobic dancing or heavy weight lifting, can put a lot of stress to the joints and may cause more damage. Nutrition and supplementation, such as glucosamine or chrondrotin, can also provide protection for the cartilage of joints. Thank you, Dr Nakazawa. Balancing the body is very important. Prevention then is key - improving exercise and nutrition, helps you keep a balance. Moderator Folks. You've had good questions. We have another five minutes or so with Dr. Nakazawa, so please get your questions in. Thanks. Dr. Nakazawa : We have, by the way, about 20 million people in America who suffer from arthritis About 17 million suffer from osteoarthritis. Medical science has spent tons of money on this, but medical acupuncture can provide the best of the two worlds, the East and the West. Moderator Our chat time is up, everyone.
