Doctors usually prescribe erythromycin to treat pertussis. This antibiotic reduces the length and severity of whooping cough, especially when the infection is discovered within the first 10 days. In some cases, codeine is prescribed for the harsh coughing. The DPT ( diphtheria , pertussis, and tetanus ) vaccine prevents pertussis in children. Children receive five doses starting at age two months and ending at age six. The vaccine is 90 percent effective when all doses are given and lasts for five years after the final dose. Reimmunization after this period is not recommended because young adults and children experience severe side effects. Last updated: 01-Jan-00 Interact on Body1 Discuss this topic with others.
