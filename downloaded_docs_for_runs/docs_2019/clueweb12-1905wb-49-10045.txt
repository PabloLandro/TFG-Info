[br]I've been eating apricot seeds for years.  I have experimented with as many as 40 an hour with only slight nausea.  On a regular day I try to spread them out, morning, afternoon and evening and I eat about 10 to 15 at a time. I also keep a handfull in my pocket to munch on whatever,  waiting in line at the stores or sitting traffic! Hope this helps!

Has anybody else here had any experience setting up blogs or webpages abouy B17? Many Thanks. BR_549 Posted - 01/24/2012 : 06:32:59 Anyone taking capsules?  and having sleep issues? By the way - I weigh 115 lbs. 5'3".  So not sure how many 'kernels' would be in a capsule.  1 or 2? Have a blessed day! [/quote] I am able to handle 2000mg of B-17 a day without any problems. If I take 2500mg of B-17, I can only sleep around 2 to 2 ½ hrs a night. I am 64 and weigh 240lbs. ============================= Update March 18, 2012; I am now up to 3000mg per day. I have also found if I take only one 500mg tab within 2 hrs. before going to bed I have no problem sleeping. The 11/30/11 my PSA reading was at 6.1. Taking around 1500mg, per day by 01/04/12 my PSA was now 5.2. Taking around 1500mg to 2000mg per day by  02/29/12 my PSA is now at 4.9. After the last test I do 3000mg per day and will return to my Dr. 05/30/12. Remember me in your Prayers. Have Character, don''t be one. Its not about all the Gifts you receive; its about the Gifts you leave behind after youre gone. alanr Posted - 11/16/2011 : 18:43:42 DX in March 2011. Clinical trial in North Carolina for Stage IV NSCLC. Ist line of Chemo Avastin, Carboplatin, Taxol.  4 bouts of treatment and cancer was shrinking with 1st 2 follow up scans. Stayed on Avastin for maintenance. Avastin not working going to start Alitma tomorrow. My tumors are in lt Lung, Multiple tumors in liver(don't know how many) and 1 tumor in my subcarinal lymph node in my chest which in last CT scan was still getting smaller with the other 2 still growing. Now as far as Alternatives. Started out taking Milk Thistle in April took 3mil a day for 4 months, no longer take it. Then went to balancing Ph to get it over 7.3. Got it to 8 for about a week now trying to keep it at 7.5 for some reason 7.25 is my level. It is very difficult to keep PH levels high. I fight with it everyday. By diet, alkaline water and taking 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda in water split to a 1/2 teaspoon 3x a day . I have been doing this for 2 months. I have been taking B-17 since 10/ 6/11. I am up to 3grams a day. take 1gr 3x a day. In about a week I will be taking Zeolite with DHQ.  I am doing what I think is best for me and hopefully they are good guesses but as of now everything Alternative I've done has not helped a great deal. I can't afford to go to clinics that specialize in Alternative care so I give it my best shot. My wife wife and I have lost nearly everything we had since this started and I have decent Medical ins. By the way I am 63 yers old. I hope with the increase of B-17, the addition Zeolite and trying to keep my Ph above 7.25 this will eventually start to all kick and start to destroy this beast .  One more important and probably my 1st line of defense is God. Prayer, prayer and more prayer. But I must keep in mind God heals in his time frame not mine. And if he decides to take me then he needs me for something else, maybe to ru a big Casino in the sky(just kidding). My 1st wife died of cancer at a young age 49. She fought breast cancer which metastasized everywhere. She fought it for 9 years and I was her caregiver 24/7 during that time. Now my 2nd wife has to deal with me having it. I think God has a plan for me. I nearly died in September, 2010 of a hypertensive coma, 2 hours from death. Took EMS 40 minutes to revive me and spent 5 days in hospital mostly in ICU. Well that's my story on my life past 14 months. Any comments are appreciated and welcomed. God Bless. Alan tobin Posted - 06/29/2011 : 09:17:50 I've recently learned about B17 so please forgive my lack of knowledge. I had purchased some Apricots, cracked open the kernel and ate the seeds but did not consume the kernels. Now  I see it mentioned that we should grind and eat the kernels. So which do you eat for the B17, the kernels, the seeds or both? God bless and thanks in advance for your answer! KowKow Posted - 06/01/2011 : 16:28:14 Hi Albino Cavies: I have my mom who has Stage 4 colon cancer. She does not look good after multiple rounds of chemo. She looks like a concentration camp person and I fear her next set of CAT scans on Friday is going to show that her cancer has worsened. So I am desperate for real answers, as the conventional doctors don't seem to have any. My questions are do you spread the 2 caplets of B17 throughout the day? (like one in the morning and one in the evening) Or do you just take the 2 all at once? Do you drink a lot of water to get rid of the excess by-products from the B-17?  I am clueless about this, because conventional medicine never said anything about these things. Originally posted by AlbinoCavies: I take two (2) 500 mg B17 capsules every day.  I had Stage 3 colon cancer (read my profile for details) and have been cancer free for over 3  years now. I began with the kernels.  At the time, I was 40 years old and 175-180 lbs.  I started eating 8 kernels a day and worked my way up to 13.  At 13 capsules, I started getting severe headaches.  I reduced my intake to 12 and then to 11 before they went away. I've always had insomnia and it neither worsened nor improved while I was eating the capsules. After consulting with my surgeon, he suggested I try the capsules and recommended the dosage of two (2) 500 mg capsules per day.  I feel great and my doctors are ECSTATIC about my continued great health and "cancer free" status.  My Oncologist even uttered the word "cured" at my last appointment in September 2007 and said that she only needed to see me once per year for another few years.

Poppyseed Dreams is the store for seasoned poppy collectors as well as individuals who wish to add some color to their gardens. I would suggest visiting: http://www.poppyseeddreams.com EllenDiann Posted - 04/21/2010 : 11:50:44 I like to know why things work and if I am mistaken please correct me, but isn't it the arsenic in the seed that is helping people?  I believe the parasites and fungus are killed by the arsenic and thus the body is allowed to heal as these troublers are removed.  I have learned through much study and prayer that the body heals continuously because HIS WORD in the DNA is why you have life, are able to move and have your being.  However,  when we self-destruct through dietary habits or allow uncleanness within, the healing is blocked.  For example, if you cut your hand and put it in sewer water and then do not wash it, what happens?  Everyone should cringe at the thought knowing that the filth of sewer water would cause inflammation.  If the wound is not cleansed, would taking the apricot seeds help? Probably not!  What has to take place is cleansing.  Along with killing the destroyers like parasites and fungus, cleansing should be done as well.  What we eat can be polluters or cleansers.  It is easy to educate yourself today because of the Internet.  Learn about detoxification, fasting and cleansing modalities along with things like B-17 and herbs.  The organs are best served by herbs (whole foods) because when organs are overloaded their frequency or energy level drops and herbs have "like" frequencies that benefit specific organs.   For example, why is milk thistle so good for the "liver".  Why not other organs as well?  In truth if one organ is sick, the whole body suffers.  My web site www.cfhsm.ws has many links for those seeking knowledge about natural healing.  I am adamant about the AMA being a very poor source of "good" knowledge.  The AMA can observe what God is doing at teh cellular level, but because they reject God in all medical research and science, they lack understanding, thus no cures. I cannot reconcile the dangerous hypocrisy of drugs with the Word of God.  The AMA is NOT ordained of God.  God can bring good out of the much evil, but His ways are without hypocrisy and He commands us to seek NOT the counsel of the ungodly.  Why do we want to come into agreement with evil reports that the AMA falsely puts on men, women and children.  They cannot predict death from a spirit of truth and how many times do they have to be wrong for people to realize the falsehood of the  demonic and dangerous medicine of the AMA.    Oh yes, in parting, everyone should watch the teaching videos by a doctor in Rome, Italy at www.cancerisafungus.com Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. graftmd Posted - 02/10/2010 : 07:03:19 where can I buy apricot kernals ? please advise TJ Kristi Posted - 01/27/2010 : 14:29:09 Seeds contain 8-10 mg of B17 per seed.. K "If you are alive today, it is because God has a purpose and a plan for your life." Kristi Northern California Please feel free to email me at kristi175@yahoo.com CLC81 Posted - 01/09/2010 : 20:28:45 Hello!  I have read World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17 by G. Edward Griffin and found some information online about Vitamin B-17 (Amygdalin). I am 26, healthy (though I really don't exercise as much as I should), and have never had cancer. I have a father-in-law who is a survivor (4 yrs so far since his conventional treatment).  Also I had three grandparents who developed cancer (breast, liver/everywhere, and stomach, respectively).  Of those three, two died from it. In 1900 the cancer rate was about 1 in 33 and today it is 1 in 2.5.  I figure taking some apricot kernels couldn't bee too bad if it may prevent cancer. I just received a 1/2 pound bag and made a mixed berry smoothie with banana and almond milk.  I took one (1) apricot kernel and 1 teaspoon of raw flax seeds and ground them together in a coffee grinder and sprinkled the mixture in the smoothie and blended some more.  I had half of the combination. I am cautious about having too much amygdalin.  Since I don't have cancer and am young, theoretically, would just one apricot kernel per day be enough to prevent cancer - since I am concerned about the level of cyanide?  I know that the cyanide, benzaldehyde, and sugar molecules are locked together and supposedly cannot be "unlocked"  except where the cancer is...  but what do you think? Beverly Posted - 11/11/2009 : 05:13:34 Hi you can make B17 from the cassava/yucca root if you type milk on this site search you will get that info http://tinyurl.com/9s5hu Kristi Posted - 10/05/2009 : 16:26:36 Our father who was an alternative physician in the 70's that treated cancer always said "The bitter, the better!" Ask where the seeds come from and if they are processed at all or what is done to them before shipping, some suppliers soak them  to take a lot of the bitter taste out..NOT what you want if you are looking for B17. I get everything from www.apricotpower.com. The seeds from here are just taken from the pitt and dried on mats and packaged p. Hope this helps, Kristi "If you are alive today, it is because God has a purpose and a plan for your life." Kristi Scottsdale, Arizona Please feel free to email me at kristi@cancervictors.net melwong Posted - 10/03/2009 : 08:13:49 Hi, I'm new to apricot seed and i recently bought 1.1lb (0.5kg) each from 2 diff suppliers. One is my friend, the other is an online trader. Frankly until now I'm confused which one is the REAL bitter apricot seed. My first buy from the online trader is this shown here below. I bought it for USD8 for 1.1 lb Prob is it's not bitter as people claimed. It fact, it's quite nice to eat. That's why I was sceptical that this is the real bitter apricot seed. In fact, I've compare the photos I get on internet against the one i bought, and well, they do look the same. Then i went to buy another 1.1lb from my friend, which is this one. This one is slightly more expensive. I bought it for USD11 for 1.1 lb Now this one is super BITTER. I remember reading online that it is the bitterness that is the Vitamin B17. So, will the real bitter apricot seed please stand up? Which one is the right one? A & A Herbal Remedies Posted - 09/03/2009 : 15:04:01 Sorry Susanna Frank Sepico was a brave and coragous police officer and is entittled to his opinion.  Chief Sitting Bull a buffalo eating Indian lived to be 99 years old.  The Eskimo's whose diet is 60% fat have never had a case of cancer in their history and are considered to be free of all diseases. Usally it take at least 5 things happening at once for cancer to occur.  One of the primary of thoses is mental stress and can occur from a number of reason, such the loss of a loved one or the loss of one's livelyhood.  This very rapidly depresses the immune system.  Dental work is also a major player.  A study done in Sweden showed that 98% of women with breast cancer also had root canals.  Natropathtic Doctors in Sweden will not treat a patient for cancer untill the root canals have been removed.  A person with a healthy immune system are able to expel cancer causing toxns from the body.  However once the immune system has become suspressed or weakened they are no longer able to expel these toxins.  No natural cancer treatment can be considered complete without the removal of root canals and amalgan fillings.  The FDA has just reclassified amalgan fillings from low risk to moderate risk.   They should have been banned 160 years ago.  It is worth knowing the the FDA was sued by a consumer group in order for them to make the studies. Although vegetarians have less incidence of cancer, they do still get it and they certanly cannot rely on diet to treat the cancer alone.  Herbs like Chaparral, Burdock and others stimulate the immune system to begin functioning again.  I specialize in making herbal formulations against cancer that I believe are the worlds best.

I am a self taught alternative cancer treatment therapist and is currently learning chinese herb medicine from a master. I m a big fan of Mr G. Edward Griffin's books and have read all of them. I got into cancer after reading World Without Cancer about a year ago. I have successfully treated several relatives and family friends in China that had cancer by combining chinese herbal medicines and Dr Binzel's vitamin, enzymes, b17, & diet program (Cancer is exploding in China over the last decade). Apricot Kernels has been used as medicine in traditional chinese herbal medicine for thousands of years. Production and sale of Laetrile/Amygdalin in China is also legal because of our long tradition of herbal medicine. I buy it directly from the factory for my patients at around $400 USD per kilo of laetrile powder. The powder is soluble in warm water (preferably distilled water) for intravenous injection or can be capsuled for oral use. I am currently working on more patients that my relatives have referred to me. I am considering changing profession to cancer treatment and move to China where i wont run into trouble promoting alternative treatment. Lastly I want to thank everybody in this forum and website for sharing their own experience. I have gathered a lot of important information regarding alternative therapy from all of you so that i can further assists several cancer patients in my hometown of wenzhou, china. If anyone wants to obtain a large quantity of laetrile at great prices, just go directly on www.alibaba.com and search for "amygdalin" for the best results. I got my supply of amygdalin from the factories listed on alibaba also. Most of these factories specialize in manufacturing of chinese herbal remedies, therefore, quality is not a problem.  Make sure contact gold members on alibaba only as they are more reputable. Production time is about a week and they will ship to any country. If you live in a country where importing laetrile is illegal they will still ship and go as far as fudging the custom declaration forms. But buy at your own risk because customs do random package inspections and might confiscate.
