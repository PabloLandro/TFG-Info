One of the best ways to combat  this is to drink spice tea containing cinnamon and cloves. Cinnamon is a ‘carminative’, which means that it helps to control the intestinal  bacteria which produce gas. It also helps to suppressing the growth of  E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida yeast, and some parasitic worms. In Chinese medicine, cinnamon is believed to aid weight loss by  driving off excess water retention. In Western medicine, it is now  suggested that consuming only half a teaspoon of cinnamon a day can help  to prevent diabetes and the pre-diabetic condition known as ‘metabolic  syndrome’ [1]. [1] Khan A, Safdar M et al. Cinnamon improves glucose and lipids of  people with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care 2003 26(12) 3215-8. Cinnamon can be sprinkled on cooked fruit, cereals or oats  (porridge), and can also be added to curries. The ‘Yogi’ brand of spice  teabags containing cinnamon is now available in many supermarkets and from Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk .
