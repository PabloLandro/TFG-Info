It compared the benefits and harms of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in 101 clinical trials which each involved at least 100 patients and were conducted between 1980 and 2007. About half were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and 20% by government organisations, 10% had mixed funding, and in 20% the source of funding could not be determined. Key findings included the following: · In 23 head-to-head trials there were no important differences in efficacy between synthetic DMARDs (limited to methotrexate, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine) or among tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab). · Monotherapy with TNF inhibitors resulted in better radiographic outcomes than did methotrexate but there were no important differences in clinical outcomes (for example, 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement according to American College of Rheumatology response criteria). · Various combinations of biological DMARDs plus methotrexate improved clinical response rates and functional outcomes more than monotherapy with either methotrexate or biological DMARDs. · In patients in whom monotherapy failed, combination with synthetic DMARDs improved response rates. · Numbers and types of short-term adverse events were similar for biological and synthetic DMARDs. “Combination therapies improve response rates in patients previously receiving monotherapy, but available evidence does not allow firm conclusions about which combination strategy is best,” the review said. The investigators identified areas for further investigation, and cautioned that there was a lack of long-term safety studies for some medications, primarily biological DMARDs. in some cases, findings from such studies might considerably shift the balance between benefits and harms.
