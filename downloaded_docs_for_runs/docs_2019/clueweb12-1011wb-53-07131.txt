<1%), abdominal pain (<1%), and mild drowsiness and headache (<1%) [154] .
           One case of anaphylaxis has been reported in a patient with a history of atopic reactions [149] .
           Echinacea should not be administered to individuals with allergies to other plants of the Asteraceae family, including daisies, ragweed, marigolds, and chrysanthemums. It is also recommended to avoid echinacea if currently on immunosuppressants [131] . Toxicology Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that, even when administered at doses several-fold higher than the ones normally used, echinacea is devoid of toxicity. Analysis of 112 pregnant women who were exposed to echinacea preparations during the first trimester of pregnancy showed no difference in fetal health when compared to the nonechinacea-exposed group [77] .
           Although other studies seem to confirm safety, echinacea preparations should be avoided during the first trimester due to lack of definitive evidence. Dosage For treatment of cold symptoms and upper respiratory infections, an initial 300-1000 mg titrated dose of powdered herb in capsules or its equivalent (tincture or juice) is administered for 5 to 7 days [41, 64, 154, 174] .
           Preparations containing 15% pressed herb are used topically as disinfectants. KAVA Efficacy : *** E Safety : AEs/DIs/UnS Common Name and Scientific Name Kava ( Piper methysticum ), a member of the pepper family, is a widely cultivated shrub indigenous to the South Pacific islands. It is also known as kava-kava, kawa, or ava pepper. Historical and Current Use A drink prepared from the root of the kava plant has been used traditionally in the South Pacific for ceremonial, social, and medicinal purposes for several centuries, if not millennia. It is used for its mild relaxing and calming properties, culturally comparable to alcohol use in Western societies. Following the European trend, the use of kava for the treatment of anxiety has become popular in the U.S. In some countries, including Germany, it has been commonly prescribed to treat anxiety, stress, and insomnia, although very serious concerns regarding potential hepatotoxicity have lead to warnings and bans in North America. Pharmacology The lipid-soluble extract of kava is rich in kava pyrones, including kavain, dihydrokavain, and methysticum [183] .
           Kava pyrones block voltage-dependent sodium channels, a mechanism responsible for the local anesthetic properties of kava drinks, which causes numbness and tingling of the mouth. Kava also contains antioxidant flavonoids and alkaloids. It has been reported that kava has a direct effect on limbic structures, particularly the amygdala. It does not bind to the GABAA receptors, unlike benzodiazepines, which target the GABAA receptors abundantly distributed in the cerebral cortex. This may account for the difference in anxiolytic properties of kava, which, unlike benzodiazepines, does not cause sedation [96] . At higher doses, kava lactones also have muscle-relaxant and anticonvulsant properties, which are possibly related to the stimulation of the glycine receptor [119] .
           Kavain has dose-dependent antiplatelet aggregation and anti-inflammatory properties [81] . Evidence-Based Therapeutic Use and Effectiveness A Cochrane Review found that, compared with placebo, kava extract is an effective symptomatic treatment for anxiety although, at present, the size of the effect seems small. The effect lacks robustness and is based on a relatively small sample. The data available from the reviewed studies suggest that kava is relatively safe for short-term treatment (1 to 24 weeks), although more information is required. ( http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD003383/kava-extract-for-treating-anxiety Last Accessed: January 12, 2012 ) Level of Evidence: Meta-analysis The clinical effectiveness of kava has been widely studied, and clinical studies strongly support its efficacy in the treatment of moderate and mild cases of anxiety. One meta-analysis included data from 11 double-blind, controlled clinical trials, and the authors concluded that kava, when compared to placebo, is effective in the symptomatic treatment of anxiety [169] .
           A standardized preparation of kava (LI 150) was as effective as the anxiolytic drugs buspirone and opipramol [22] .
           An extensive literature review also confirmed the clinical effectiveness of kava preparations in the treatment of anxiety [158] . Several clinical studies, including one published by Holm and colleagues, assessed the effect of kava on memory and compared it with both the anxiolytic oxazepam and placebo [96] .
           They concluded that kava, unlike oxazepam, does not impair cognitive performance and memory. In fact, an improvement in memory was observed in the kava-treated group, but these interesting results wait for confirmation [158] . Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions In clinical trials, the side effects of kava preparations were rare and mild, with gastrointestinal discomfort, restlessness, headache, and dizziness reported in about 2% of patients. Kava dermatitis, a yellow discoloration of the skin accompanied by scaly dermatitis, is only observed in chronic heavy kava drinkers and reverses after discontinuation of kava administration. This skin condition resembles pellagra but is resistant to niacin treatment. Neurotoxicity, pulmonary hypertension, and choreoathetosis have also been reported in chronic heavy drinkers in the Australian Aboriginal population [193] .
           A few rare cases of kava-induced Parkinson-like extrapyramidal disorders have been reported, as well as the aggravation of existing Parkinson's disease in one patient [174] .
           There are some reports, however, suggesting that kava may cause severe and, in some cases, irreversible liver damage. As a result, the FDA issued an advisory letter to healthcare professionals stating possible health risks [35] .
           In August 2002, Health Canada issued a stop-sale order for all products containing kava [90] . Kava extracts interact with and potentiate the effects of anxiolytic and depressant drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. Due to its antiplatelet properties, kavain-containing preparations should not be administered to patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy, although the clinical relevance of this potential interaction has not been established. Kava preparations should also be avoided in patients with extrapyramidal disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Finally, due to the potential hepatotoxicity, kava should not be administered to patients with liver disease or those treated with potentially hepatotoxic medications such as acetaminophen, anabolic steroids, or the anticancer agent methotrexate [26, 158] .
           As a precautionary measure, kava should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation due to the lack of safety studies. Kava administration should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to surgery because of possible potentiation of the sedative effect of anesthetics [6] . Toxicology More than 30 cases of kava-induced hepatotoxicity, ranging from hepatitis and cirrhosis to acute liver failure and death, have been reported in the literature. One study of lipid-extractions of kava led researches to state that rather than being caused by directly toxic mechanisms, reactions to kava likely stemmed from immunologically mediated idiosyncratic mechanisms; therefore, the hepatotoxicity of kava may be similar to benzodiazepines [234] .
           An Australian trial concluded that water-extracted kavalactones, using dried roots sourced from the island of Vanuatu and prepared in a controlled pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, caused neither an increase in liver enzymes nor hepatotoxic symptoms [235] .
           Other studies have shown that kava suppresses CYP450 enzymes in the liver, leading to hepatotoxic concentrations of concurrently administered drugs [236] .
           Although no cases of hepatotoxicity were reported in any of the clinical trials included in a Cochrane Review, it is not recommended for use in the U.S. [64, 169] . Dosage Standardized products are available, and the usual recommended daily dose of kavalactones ranges from 120-250 mg/day, divided in 2 to 3 equal doses [158, 174] .
           In the U.S., most formulations are standardized to 30% or 55%, meaning that a 100 mg tablet contains 30 mg or 55 mg of kavalactones, respectively. Usually, kava use should be limited to 3 months to avoid potential habituation, and patients should be advised of the potential adverse effects on motor coordination and capacity to drive or operate heavy machinery [174] . GARLIC Efficacy : ** E Safety : AEs/DIs Common Name and Scientific Name Garlic ( Allium sativum ), also known as allium, is related to chives ( Allium schoenoprasum ) and onions ( Allium cepa ), and all belong to the Liliaceae family, which also includes lilies. Historical and Current Use The recorded medicinal use of garlic goes back to ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. It was used for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including heart problems, headaches, intestinal parasites, and tumors, and as a local disinfectant. In the nineteenth century, Louis Pasteur also reported the antimicrobial properties of garlic. It is now used for its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol and for its antithrombotic and antioxidant properties, as well as for its ability to lower blood pressure. Together, these properties have also provided some support for the use of garlic in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis [62, 155, 174] .
           The benefits of garlic in the treatment of certain cancers, specifically stomach and colorectal, have also been investigated [112] . Pharmacology The beneficial effects of garlic have been related to its sulfur compounds. More than 20 different sulfur compounds have been identified in garlic. The sulfur compound allinin (S-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide) is transformed to allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) via the enzyme allinase when the bulb is crushed or ground. Allicin is an unstable molecule that is converted into more stable compounds. Other sulfur compounds, such as peptides, steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenols, derive from allicin metabolism and have been the subject of investigations aimed at identifying their biological role [3] .
           In vitro and in vivo studies have associated allicin with the antibacterial properties of garlic. Commercially available garlic extracts are standardized to the allicin content. Three water-soluble allicin derivatives, s-allylcysteine (SAC), s-ethylcysteine (SEC), and s-propylcysteine (SPC), are the most effective in reducing in vitro cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes by 42% to 55% [136] . Methyl-allyl trisulfide (MATS), a lipid-soluble allicin derivative, inhibits cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis and is responsible for the antithrombotic and antiplatelet aggregation properties of garlic [7] .
           Another sulfur compound, diallyl trisulfide (DATS), is a potent inhibitor of colon and lung human cancer cell proliferation in cell cultures and is at least partially responsible for the anticancer properties of garlic [98, 176] . The antioxidative properties of garlic are exerted indirectly through the sulfur compound-induced stimulation of protective antioxidant enzymes present in the body, including glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase [7, 62] . Evidence-Based Therapeutic Use and Effectiveness The American Dietetic Association has found that consumption of garlic may or may not be beneficial for the reduction of blood pressure, as the current evidence is inconclusive regarding its effect on blood pressure. ( http://www.guidelines.gov/content.aspx?id=12817 Last Accessed: January 12, 2012 ) Level of Evidence: III (Studies of weak design for answering the question or inconclusive findings due to design flaws, bias, or execution problems) Several clinical trials have reported that garlic lowers total cholesterol levels by 8% to 15% [188, 220] .
           This effect results from the lowering of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides, while the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) values remained unchanged. A meta-analysis confirmed that, after 10 to 12 weeks, garlic lowers plasma cholesterol, although the benefits (4% to 6%) were less pronounced than previously reported, and this effect was not statistically significant after a six-month period [198] .
           In 2001, an extensive meta-analysis of 34 randomized clinical trials including almost 2000 patients confirmed the previous assertions [1] .
           In conclusion, garlic preparations are moderately effective in lowering LDL and triglycerides and do not change the HDL concentration in the plasma [155] . The effects of garlic on blood pressure have been studied in several clinical trials. Most studies have shown a small (6%) yet statistically significant effect, although these findings were not replicated by other studies [155] . Garlic has also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, as expected by its inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin synthesis. The effective dosages are not well established, and comparison with other antiplatelet aggregation drugs is not yet available. Because several reports have associated garlic with bleeding accidents, administration should be limited to lower dosages and co-administration with drugs that affect hemostasis, including antiplatelet aggregation drugs (e.g., aspirin) or anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), should be avoided [155, 167] . Some clinical studies suggest that garlic preparations slow the progression of atherosclerotic plaques [187] .
           Although encouraging, these results are preliminary and further studies are required. The anticancer properties of garlic compounds have been reported both in vitro and in vivo, but their clinical effectiveness remains to be established. Epidemiological studies suggest that regular consumption of garlic may be associated with a lower risk of developing gastric and colorectal malignancies [72] .
           Although the evidence is cautiously positive, well-designed clinical trials are needed before a conclusion can be reached. Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions The most common adverse effects reported are bad breath and body odor. Less commonly, dyspepsia and flatulence are also reported. In rare cases, dermatitis and respiratory difficulty can occur in hypersensitive patients [174] .
           The highest risk of herb-drug interaction is between garlic and anticoagulant drugs, such as the vitamin K inhibitor warfarin, and antiplatelet aggregation agents such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel and results from the pharmacodynamic potentiation of mechanisms of action [167] . Toxicology Garlic preparations administered within the recommended dosages are safe, although they should not be administered to patients allergic to garlic or to other members of the Liliaceae family, namely chives, onions, leek, or lilies [155, 167] .
           A dangerous pharmacokinetic interaction between garlic and the protease inhibitor saquinavir has been reported, as it reduces the plasma concentration of the anti-HIV drug by 50% [168] . Dosage Administration of garlic preparations varies greatly according to the preparation used (i.e., fresh, powder, or oil extracts). Standardized preparations to 1.3% allinin or 0.6% allicin are usually administered at 600-900 mg per day. This is considered equivalent to one small clove of fresh garlic [174] . VALERIAN Efficacy : ** E Safety : S Common Name and Scientific Name Valerian ( Valeria officinalis ), also known as baldrian, is a member of the Valerianaceae family. Other species of the same family that are also used for medicinal purposes include V. wallichi and V. sambucifolia . Historical and Current Use Historical documents from ancient Greece, China, and India widely report the use of preparations from valerian root and rhizome in the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. This herb, native to Asia and Europe, is now found throughout the world. Topically, it has been used in the treatment of acne and wound healing. It has also been used traditionally for the treatment of a variety of disorders, including digestive problems, flatulence, congestive heart failure, urinary tract disorders, and angina pectoris. For the past 200 years, valerian has been widely used in Europe and North America for its mild sedative properties [62, 174] . Pharmacology A large number of chemicals, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, valepotriates, amino acids, and alkaloids, have been extracted from valerian. Although no single component has been shown to account for its pharmacological properties, the biologically active valerenic acid has been used as the constituent for standardization. In vivo studies have confirmed the sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant properties of valerian preparations. Studies have also shown the agonistic effect of valerian and some of its individual compounds on the GABAA receptors and on the 5-HT5a serotonin receptors [57, 164, 206] .
           Other studies have revealed that valerian extracts inhibit the presynaptic GABA carrier, further contributing to an increased GABAergic inhibitory activity in the brain [178] .
           Valerenic acid also inhibits GABA transaminase, the enzyme responsible for GABA metabolism [172] .
           Together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of valerian. More recently, research has identified valerenic acid and its modulation of the GABAA-ergic system as probable cause of the anxiolytic effects, a mechanism similar to benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) [237] . Evidence-Based Therapeutic Use and Effectiveness A systematic review of 9 randomized clinical trials found that results regarding the effectiveness of valerian in the treatment of insomnia were inconclusive [197] .
           Some benefits were reported within 1 to 2 days, but benefits on sleep were observed only after 4 weeks of treatment. A larger European clinical trial reported that the valerian had minimal or no effect on sleep regulation [59] .
           Unfortunately, patients were treated for only 2 weeks, a time period considered too short when compared with previous studies, which may account for the negative outcome. As of 2010, no well-designed trials of valerian in the treatment of anxiety in humans have been published. An investigation of the effect of valerenic acid on rats concluded that valerian use was related to a reduction of anxious behavior [237] . Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions In clinical trials, valerian side effects were minor, most commonly headache, stomach upset, or dizziness, and were usually reported as frequently as in the placebo group. Adverse effects on reaction time and alertness were much lower than benzodiazepines. Dependence and withdrawal have not been reported in any of the clinical trials, although a single case report of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation has been published [78] .
           As valerian and benzodiazepines similarly target the GABAA receptor, it is possible that the patient may develop physical dependence after lengthy administration. It is therefore advisable to discontinue valerian administration progressively. Valerian potentiates the effects of other sedatives, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol, kava, and chamomile, and should not be co-administered in conjunction with these drugs or phytomedicines [161] . Toxicology Valerian is considered safe by the FDA, but administration during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not advised due to the limited availability of safety data. Dosage In clinical trials, for the treatment of insomnia, 900 mg of a standardized solution equivalent or 1.5-3 grams of dried root was administered 30 minutes to 1 hour before bedtime [174] . ANDROGRAPHIS Efficacy : ** E Safety : AEs/DIs Common Name and Scientific Name Andrographis ( Andrographis paniculata ) is also known as Justicia paniculata , green chiretta, king of bitters, kan jang, and sambiloto. It is an herb naturally found in Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and southern China, and it is also cultivated for commercial use in the preparation of traditional HMs. Andrographis is an annual tall herb, up to one meter high, with small white flowers. It thrives in humid climates and shady areas. Historical and Current Use The bitter-tasting leaves of andrographis have been used for centuries in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine in the preparation of an infusion used for the treatment of digestive ailments and fever. In Malaysia, andrographis has also been traditionally used for the treatment of hypertension [202] .
           In northern European countries, andrographis is used for the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections [153] . Pharmacology Andrographis is rich in diterpenoids and flavonoids. At least 9 diterpinoids, including andrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide (DA), and 14-deoxy-11-oxoandrographolide (DDA), have been isolated. In vitro studies revealed that andrographolide has anti-inflammatory, antiapoptic, and immunomodulatory properties. In vivo studies demonstrated that both DA and DDA effectively lower blood pressure, decrease heart rate, and cause vasodilation [201] .
           DA and DDA block calcium channels, increase nitric oxide synthesis, and inhibit ß-adrenergic receptors. All of these actions provide the mechanistic explanation for the hypotensive properties of andrographis [201] . Evidence-Based Therapeutic Use and Effectiveness Several clinical trials, including almost 900 subjects, have assessed the effectiveness of andrographis in the treatment and prevention of upper respiratory tract infection. Two meta-analyses concluded that andrographis was significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms [44, 170] .
           Limited evidence also suggests that andrographis preparations may be effective in the prevention of upper respiratory tract infection [30] .
           Two clinical studies concluded that andrographis is also effective in the treatment of influenza symptoms, although larger and better-designed studies are needed to confirm the results [153] . Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions Andrographis is considered safe and well tolerated. Headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and nasal congestion are the most commonly reported adverse effects [153] .
           Although data regarding andrographis interactions with other drugs is still limited, due to andrographis' hypotensive and hypoglycemic properties, concurrent administration with antihypertensive and hypotensive drugs should be avoided. Toxicology In clinical trials, a dose-response dependent toxicity of andrographis has been identified, and fatigue, headache, and lymphadenopathy have been described [30, 31, 75] .
           Furthermore, three cases of anaphylactic reaction have also been reported [44] . Dosage Three hundred milligrams of standardized preparations of andrographis (4% andrographolides) are taken 4 times a day, for as long as 2 weeks [153] . ENGLISH IVY LEAF Efficacy : *** E Safety: S Common Name and Scientific Name English ivy ( Hedera helix ), also known as common ivy, is an evergreen climbing vine. It is native to Europe and Central Asia, grows easily, and is commonly found in humid environments and in forests. It is often used for decorative purposes. It is different from ground ivy ( Glechoma hederacea ) and American ivy ( Parthenocissus quinquefolia ). It is particularly important not to confuse it with poison ivy ( Rhus toxicodendron ). Historical and Current Use The glossy and dark green leaves of common ivy have been traditionally used for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders, including respiratory disease, arthritis, fever, burns, and infections. It is now used as an expectorant and in the treatment of bronchitis and asthma [174] . Pharmacology Ivy leaves are rich in saponins (e.g., hederin and hederacosides) but also contain sterols, flavonol glycosides, and polyalkanes among other chemicals. Saponins stimulate secretion of mucus in the upper respiratory tract and have a mucokinetic and mucolytic effect [183] .
           They also prevent acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm [101] .
           Hederacoside C has antifungal and antibacterial properties [21] .
           Together, these bronchodilatory and antimicrobial properties of ivy leaf extracts provide the pharmacological evidence to support their beneficial effects in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. Evidence-Based Therapeutic Use and Effectiveness The clinical efficacy of ivy leaf extracts has been the subject of one meta-analysis [95] .
           Five clinical trials, three of which measured its effect on children, indicated that the treated group showed an improvement in chronic bronchial asthma. In another study not included in the previous review, 1350 children with chronic bronchitis were treated with standardized ivy leaf extracts for 4 weeks. A significant improvement or cure of the following symptoms was observed, when compared to the baseline: cough (92%), expectoration (94%), dyspnea (83%), and respiratory pain (87%) [93] .
           A postmarketing study of almost 10,000 patients with bronchitis showed that, after a 7-day treatment with ivy leaf extracts, 95% of the patients had improved significantly [67] . Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions Ivy leaf extracts are generally considered safe. Mild adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, eructation, or nausea, are observed in 0.2% to 2.1% of patients [67, 93] .
           No drug interactions have been reported. Considering the detergent-like actions of saponins, it has been suggested that ivy leaf extracts should not be ingested at the same time as other drugs, considering the unlikely possibility that ivy leaf extracts may facilitate the absorption of the other drugs. However, this warning is not supported by any evidence and should be considered as speculative. Toxicology Ingestion of ivy berries can be toxic, and falcarinol present in cut ivy leafs may cause contact dermatitis, particularly in sensitive individuals [167] .
           In a bizarre case reported by Gaillard and colleagues ingestion of ivy leaves caused mechanical obstruction and suffocation [76] .
           Toxicological tests confirmed the cause of death as being suffocation, and no toxin was detected in cardiac blood, femoral blood, or urine of the deceased [76] . It has been suggested that ivy leaf products should be avoided during pregnancy because the emetine content in ivy leaf may cause uterine contractions [238] .
           Data on the effects of ivy leaf extracts during lactation are not yet available, and as a result, ingestion of ivy leaf extracts in these cases should be avoided. Dosage Standardized ivy leaf extracts are available as a hydroalcoholic extract syrup (105 mg/day of dried ivy leaf extract), ethanolic extract drops (35-40 mg/day of dried ivy leaf extract), or suppositories (160 mg/day of dried ivy leaf extract) [95, 138, 139] . CONCLUSION Herbal medications have become an important issue in North America for a variety of social, economic, and medical reasons, and the use of HMs continues to increase. It has been estimated that, in 2007, approximately 20% of the U.S. population had used dietary supplements, a 46% increase compared to the 1997 values [208, 240] .
           Considering that the age group with the highest use (70%) of herbal medications is 18 to 33 years of age, it is expected that the overall consumption will continue to increase in years to come. In the U.S., the out-of-pocket expenditures for CAM were conservatively estimated to be $34 billion in 2007; this represents about 11% of national healthcare spending [240] .
           Furthermore, in the United States, the cost of dietary supplements alone in 2007 was estimated at $15 billion (compared with $48 billion spent on prescription drugs in 2007), approximately 40% of the total costs of CAM [240] .
           Considering the high price of health insurance and changing attitudes towards CAM, the expenditures today are most likely greater. In addition, more than 50% of patients receiving conventional medical care also use CAM [173] .
           An estimated 50% to 70% of patients fail to disclose the use of HMs to their healthcare providers, and concern regarding a possible negative reaction or perceived lack of interest by the healthcare provider have been identified as the main reasons for limited disclosure of HMs use [37, 173] .
           It is commonly believed by the population in general, and by many healthcare providers as well, that due to their natural origin, these products are intrinsically safe and devoid of adverse effects or toxicity, or that the worst possible outcome is lack of therapeutic effectiveness. This has been proven false. The regulatory framework for the use of HMs in North America was discussed, and the process of approval of conventional medications versus herbal medications was analyzed. A scientific approach to the general pharmacological study of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms underlying the actions of HMs, their therapeutic properties, adverse effects and drug interactions, toxicological profile, and commonly used dosages were presented. Finally, the ten most commonly used HMs were reviewed in detail with an evidence-based approach ( Table 1 ).

It was the goal of this course to provide the evidence required for healthcare providers to be particularly aware of the need to include current or past use of HMs in the patient's medical history, discuss relevant information with their patients, to be aware of the possible interactions with conventional medications, and evaluate the potential therapeutic benefits of HMs when appropriate.
