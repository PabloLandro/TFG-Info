Foot Insoles- Insoles for Metatarsalgia and ball of foot pain Testimonials About Home Foot Conditions Insoles Contact Us Metatarsalgia Metatarsalgia                             is a general term used to denote a painful foot condition                             in the metatarsal region of the foot (the area just                             before the toes, more commonly referred to as the ball                             of the foot). This is a common foot disorder that can                             affect the bones and joints at the soles of the feet.                             Metatarsalgia (ball of foot pain) is often located under                             the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th metatarsal heads, or more isolated                             at the first metatarsal head (near the big toe). This                               condition can cause a variety of different soft tissue                               and bone complaints which may result in severe pain                               to the patient. The primary cause of metatarsalgia                               is over pronation . This                               can be controlled via insoles. Orthotic                               Proof Sources and Safety Data. The use of foot orthotics has been researched and                               tested by leading institutions around the world, and                               is widely accepted in the medical community. Foot                               orthotics/ foot insoles are used in both public and                               private hospitals and clinics. Clinical studies and field research verify the value                               of orthotics in preventing and treating corns while                               improving the structural integrity of the ligaments                               and muscles around the ankle. Flexible orthotics control                               foot motion without restricting function and creating                               compensatory movement in other structures.

The Dual Gel Shock Modules provide extraordinary protection for the two major impact zones, the HEEL and FOREFOOT. They also feature an arch support to prevent over pronation (rolling over of the feet) which can cause problems such as heel pain, arch pain, back pain and leg pain. These remarkable dual-density gel insoles doubles the cushioning where feet need it the most - at the heel and metatarsal area. So if you suffer from conditons such as flat feet, over pronation, heel pain and pain in the forefoot use these insoles to support the arch, cushion the heel and forefoot for extra comfort.

I find these insoles very absorbing and comfortable and recommend them to any sports fanatic or anybody who plays sport." Mr M Davies Scotland, U.K "I am writing to tell you how happy I am with your insoles. On two separate occasions I have had professionally fitted orthotics. Both were rigid and intolerable to wear. In addition to being flat-footed, I have traumatic arthritis in my left ankle. Prior to purchasing your insoles, I thought surgery was the only option for the constant pain when I walked. To my surprise and happiness, both my feet and my left ankle have quit hurting. Your insoles are a God-send." Ms Lindsay Barker, UK "I am writing to thank you for the insoles you sent me. 18 months ago, being referred by my GP to see a consultant for my flat feet and fore foot pain, I paid £160 for a pair of orthotic insoles but your insoles at £25 a pair are every bit as good as my original ones, if not better.
