	   compression, aiding with the relief and recovery of lower back and leg pain or neck and arm
	   pain. Some of the conditions that may be causing these symptoms include
	   herniated, protruding or bulging discs, spinal stenosis, sciatica or
	   radiculopathy. Traction is the distraction or separation of the joint surfaces by gently applying forces pulling them apart thus relieving pressure on the skeletal system. Spinal Traction can be applied manually by the Burnaby Physiotherapist or mechanically by a traction machine. Excessive forces to the neck or lower back may cause exacerbation of your symptoms therefore we usually take a more cautious approach and try Manual Traction before progressing to Mechanical Traction.
