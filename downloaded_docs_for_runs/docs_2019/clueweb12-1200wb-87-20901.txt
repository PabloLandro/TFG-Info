Posted  by Doris Rapp, MD on Mar 23rd, 2012 | 0 comments It is becoming more and more apparent that super-bugs like MRSA are becoming increasingly dangerous to those who are susceptible to infection. The most powerful of antibiotics that we have are no longer effective in killing the newer strains of MRSA. Recent studies have found that honey, Manuka honey to be more specific, can eliminate the infections when used under the dressing of a wound where antiseptics and antibiotics have failed. In the UK, even an immunosuppressed patient, a person  in which the immune system is suppressed by medications during the treatment of other disorders, like cancer, or following an organ transplant, was able to make a full recovery thanks to this amazing honey.
