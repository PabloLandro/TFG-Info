Excess Heat from Constraint Disturbs the Spirit (Shen) The Spirit (Shen) resides in the Heart. When Heat gathers in the chest from emotional constraint, the Spirit is disturbed. You feel restless or you have a problem sleeping.  This is called Disturbed Shen. During times of stress or separation, the free-flow of energy is constrained in the chest. Just as circulation cools, constraint heats. This condition can cause difficulty falling or staying asleep. Try Good Sleep & Worry Free Pills 2. Deficiency Heat Disturbs the Spirit (Shen) This kind of insomnia is also caused by heat.  However, this heat comes from a deficiency of cool (yin) rather than an excess of heat. This condition is very common during menopause.  People with deficiency types of insomnia tend to feel tired, even after sleeping OKl. Try combining Good Sleep & Worry Free Pills with Two Immortals Pill 3. Heart Blood Deficiency This insomnia has a nutritional root. The quality of the blood is poor because the diet is poor or the digestion is weak. The poor blood fails to properly nourish the Heart (Mind). If you have this insomnia, you may have more difficulty falling asleep, but once asleep you can sleep through the night. You may also have fatigue during the day or you may have a digestive complaint as well. Try combining Gui Pi Wan , and Suan Zao Ren Tang 4.
