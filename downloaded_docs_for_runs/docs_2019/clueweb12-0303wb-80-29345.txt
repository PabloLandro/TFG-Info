Disease Case 5 Michael P. D'Alessandro, M.D. Peer Review Status: Internally Peer Reviewed Chief Complaint: Fourteen year old male with a complicated pneumonia Clinical History: The patient was a 14 year old male who was diagnosed with a right
lower lobe pneumonia that initially was non responsive to oral
antibiotics. He was subsequently hospitalized at an outside hospital,
where he developed an empyema and was non responsive to IV
antibiotics and the placement of a pigtail catheter for empyema
drainage. He was transferred to our institution where a large bore
chest tube was surgically placed for empyema drainage and new IV
antibiotics were started. Clinical Physical Exam: The patient was febrile. Clinical Labs: Non-contributory Clinical Differential Diagnosis: Empyema, lung abscess Imaging Findings: A chest CT exam was obtained to better evaluate the nature of the
patient's complicated pneumonia. Image 1 Images 2 and 3 Imaging Differential Diagnosis: Empyema with lung abscess and bronchopleural fistula Operative Findings: None Pathological Findings: None Final Diagnosis: Lung Abscess, Empyema, Bronchopleural Fistula Follow-up and Prognosis: The chest tube was removed so that the bronchopleural fistula would
not progress. A repeat spiral chest CT exam obtained 3 weeks later
(not provided) showed substantial improvement of the disease in the
right hemithorax, with the bronchopleural fistula being no longer
demonstrated. Similar Cases: Case 14 , Case 25 , Case 28 , Case 52 References: Paediapedia WebPath WebPath WebPath WebPath WebPath WebPath WebPath WebPath Next
