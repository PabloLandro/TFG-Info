It's Not As Bad As You Think. Kathy Peck Wax is formed in in the outer part of the canal not in the deep part 
        of the ear canal near the eardrum. When wax blocks up against the eardrum, 
        it is often because of probing the ear with such things as cotton-tips, 
        bobby pins, twisted napkin corners or, other foreign objects. They only 
        ram the wax in deeper. The skin of the ear canal and the eardrum is very 
        thin and fragile and can be is easily injured. Earwax is healthy in normal amounts. It serves to coat the skin of the 
        ear canal where it acts as a temporary water repellent. The absence of 
        earwax can cause dry, itchy ears. Most of the time the ear canals are self cleaning. Old earwax is constantly 
        being transported from the ear canal to the ear opening where it usually 
        dries, flakes, and falls out. When wax has accumulated so much that it blocks the ear canal (and hearing), 
        your physician may have to wash it out, vacuum it, or remove it with special 
        instruments. Or he may prescribe ear drops or reccommend non precripttion 
        ear drops which are designed to soften the wax. are you at risk? | features | shop
