Not sure whether to order the one with flexible plastic or metal stays. Answer: The height of the Lumbar Sacral Support is generally based on your level of pain that you need relieved.  Essentially the taller the brace, the more support it can provide, the less pain you're in and more comfort. As for metal or plastic stays, this is based on the type of support you need. If you are a fairly mobile person who does much bending, you may need the flexible plastic stays as they allow more range-of-motion, however still provide the support needed. The metal stays may not be quite as comfortable, but do aide in providing the utmost stabilization and support.
