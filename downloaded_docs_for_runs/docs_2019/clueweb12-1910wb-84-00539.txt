New York State Dental Association: News - New York State Dental Association is a constituent of the American Dental Association representing more than 13,000 dentists in New York. Tuesday, May 8, 2012 Forgot Password/First-time user? News 06/02/2010 CNN report cites BPA and dental sealants CNN is scheduled to air a 
two-part investigative report with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on June 2 and 3 entitled, “Toxic America.” 
The report will focus on five chemicals, including Bisphenol A. CNN cites dental sealants as one source of BPA at this link. http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/31/chemical.dangers/index.html NYSDA anticipates that this report will generate questions from patients and the media, and is providing the following statement from the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs. "According to the CDC, dental caries remains the most common chronic disease of 
children aged 5 to 17 years—five times more common than asthma (59% versus 
11%). Untreated cavities can cause pain, dysfunction, absence from 
school, and poor appearance—problems that can greatly affect a child’s quality 
of life. The utility of composite resin materials for both restoring dental 
health and preventing caries is well established, while any health risks from 
their use are not. The ADA fully supports continued research into the safety of 
BPA; but, based on current evidence, the ADA does not believe there is a basis 
for health concerns relative to BPA exposure from any dental 
material.” Bisphenol A and Dental Materials : http://www.ada.org/1766.aspx What are dental sealants? Dental sealants act as a barrier, protecting the teeth against 
decay-causing 
bacteria. The sealants are usually applied to the chewing surfaces of 
the back 
teeth (premolars and molars) where decay occurs most often.
