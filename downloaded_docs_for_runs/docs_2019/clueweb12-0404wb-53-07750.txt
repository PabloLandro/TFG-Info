                              Product and Nutrition Expert Q&A Your Answer Is Below... Expert Q&A Home > Food & Nutrition How do herbs or supplements like cinnamon, chromium or fenugreek help control blood glucose? While a variety of supplements are promoted for blood glucose control, research is limited on the effect of supplements, including cinnamon and fenugreek, for lowering blood glucose levels for those with type 2 diabetes . Very small amounts of chromium, a trace element, are needed for human health. Chromium is possibly effective for helping to improve the way the body uses insulin, and so may help with blood glucose control. However, scientific evidence is not conclusive. For cinnamon, the research is still too limited to make a recommendation although there may be some benefit for those with type 2 diabetes . For the use of either chromium or cinnamon or for any other herb, used as a supplement to help control your blood glucose levels, talk to your health care provider first; continue to use approaches to blood glucose control that are known to be effective. Your best strategies for blood glucose control are meal and snack planning for diabetes management, regular physical activity, and a healthy weight.
