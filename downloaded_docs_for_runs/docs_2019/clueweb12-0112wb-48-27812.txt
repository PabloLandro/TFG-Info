                    pain in the workplace. Many of these complaints have arisen 
                    due to the increasing exertion we apply to the feet. After many studies and much research on this subject, biomechanics 
                      experts agree that a clear solution to the reduction of 
                      these ailments lies in alleviating the reactionary forces 
                      which occur while standing and walking. One solution was to introduce cushion/fatigue mats into 
                      the workplace. This was helpful but did not address those 
                      occupations in which the worker is mobile. We believe that a professional insole has the following 
                      advantages over comfort floor matting. Cushion 
                          mats at stationary workstations do not address mobile 
                          and outdoor work settings Professional insoles 
                          are beneficial to long term foot health by working inside 
                          the footwear, next to the foot Costs overall are 
                          lower for shoe inserts than for floor mats and have 
                          require less maintenance Matting increases 
                          the likelihood of trips and fall on raised edges Insoles require no installation like 
                          mats and can be implemented instantly Another and more practical solution was to introduce the Anti-Fatigue Insole into the workplace. Such inserts 
                      supply a cushion interface between the foot and the floor, 
                      which reduces exertion on the foot and hence biomechanical 
                      pressures across the body. What are anti-fatigue insoles? The Anti-Fatigue Insole is a specialist insole placed in the 
                      shoe to help balance the bodys posture and maintain 
                      alignment. Anti-Fatigue Insoles perform functions that make standing, 
                      walking, and running more comfortable and efficient, by 
                      slightly altering the angles at which the foot strikes a 
                      walking or running surface. Insoles are proven to solve a number of biomechanically 
                      related problems, not only for obvious foot problems but 
                      also for ankle, knee, pelvis, hip and back pain. This is 
                      achieved by preventing misalignment of the foot which can 
                      significantly alter the way in which the bones move within 
                      their joints. Insoles take different forms and are constructed 
                      of various materials. All are concerned with improving foot 
                      function and minimising stress forces that could ultimately 
                      cause foot deformity and pain. Insoles come in many styles and features depending 
                      on your needs and the shoes you choose to wear. Why do workers need specialist insoles? Several studies show a statistically significant improvement 
                        in reducing back pain with Orthotic inserts Inserts offer a preventative approach to reducing general 
                        fatigue, poor posture and foot pain. Motion control at the feet can improve standing posture. Supporting the feet reduces the tendency for the body 
                        to slouch forward. The right amount of cushioning inside the shoe avoids 
                        the need for floor mats. Costs are lower for shoe inserts than for floor mats 
                        and other anti-fatigue solutions. Inserts from Foothealthcare.com do not require specialist 
                        fitting as they are designed to be size specific to match 
                        shoe sizes. Most employees spend the majority of their shift standing. Most employees will wear cheap, poor fitting shoes that 
                        lack support for standing. Complaints of back and foot pain combined with hard 
                        work surfaces lead to high employee turnover, workers 
                        compensation claims and lost days. We can supply insoles for your workforce in bulk quantities 
                      at much lower prices. If you would like a quote or to talk
