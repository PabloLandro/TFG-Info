If working  the night shift, the following tips may help people sleep better and avoid  sleepiness: Increase the total       amount of sleep by adding naps and lengthening the amount of time allotted       for sleep. Use bright lights in the       workplace. Minimize shift changes       so that the biological clock of the body can adjust to a nighttime work       schedule. Get rid of sound and       light distractions in the bedroom during daytime sleep. Use caffeine only during       the first part of a shift to promote alertness at night. If sleep does not come during the day and all else fails,  talk with a doctor to see if it would be wise to use prescribed, short-acting  sleeping pills to help sleep during the day. Dealing with Jet Lag Eastward travel generally causes more severe jet lag than  westward travel because traveling east requires people to shorten the day and the  biological clock is better able to adjust to a longer day than a shorter day. Fortunately  for globetrotters, a few preventive measures and treatments seem to help some  people relieve jet lag. Adjust the biological clock. Several days before traveling  to a new time zone, gradually shift sleeping patterns and eating times to  coincide with those at the final eastern destination. People can also adjust the  biological clock by using light therapy. This involves exposure to special  lights, many times brighter than ordinary household light, for several hours  near to the new wake up time. Alternatively, after arrival, spend a lot of time  outdoors to make sure the body gets the light cues it needs to adjust to the  new time zone. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Although it may be tempting to  drink alcohol to relieve the stress of travel and make it easier to fall  asleep, people more likely to sleep lighter and wake up in the middle of the  night when the effects of the alcohol wear off. Caffeine can help keep people  awake longer, but caffeine can also make it harder for people to fall asleep if  its effects have not worn off by bed time. What about melatonin? The body produces the melatonin  hormone to make the body drowsy. Melatonin builds up in the body as the night  progresses and decreases when daylight arrives. Melatonin is available as an over-the-counter supplement.  Because melatonin is safe when used over a period of days or weeks and seems to  contribute to feeling sleepy, it is a treatment for jet lag. Nevertheless, the  effectiveness of melatonin is controversial and its safety when used over a  prolonged period is unclear. Some studies find that taking melatonin  supplements before bedtime for several days after arrival in a new time zone  can make it easier to fall asleep at the proper time. Other studies find that  melatonin does not help to relieve jet lag. Be aware that adjusting to a new time zone may take several  days. If traveling away for just a few days, it may be better to stick to the  original sleep and wake times as much as possible, rather than adjusting the  biological clock too many times in rapid succession. Gambling Studies Researchers conducted telephone surveys with 8,467 adults in  the Toronto area and questioned people about their opinions of how to best  understand gambling disorders. Researchers asked if gambling disorders should  be treated as a disease or illness, a wrongdoing, a habit, not disease or an addiction  similar to drug addiction. Researchers also inquired if people with gambling  disorders can get well on their own or must seek treatment to improve and polled  adults on whether people with gambling disorders can reduce their gambling to  that of a social gambler or if they need to quit altogether. The survey also  gathered information on the gambling behavior and demographics of the respondents. The researchers found that most people viewed gambling  disorders as an addiction similar to drug addiction, with one-third seeing  gambling as a habit and 17 percent viewing gambling as a form of wrongdoing. Responses  to whether gamblers needed treatment to recover showed a split jury, and three  out of four thought that abstinence from gambling activities must happen for  recovery. Examining the demographics, the researchers found that being female,  married, younger and without gambling problems paralleled believing that  treatment and abstinence were necessary. In addition, people who viewed  gambling problems as a disease or addiction also believed that treatment and  abstinence for recovery are necessary. The researchers noted that public perceptions reported in  their study mimic the results of a 2003 study that examined the views of the  public on alcohol use, with 71 percent of respondents saying that abstinence must  occur for recovery. This popularly held belief is also the view of much of the  scientific community as reflected by the upcoming changes the American  Psychiatric Association is making. Finally, researchers concluded that people with gambling  disorders were less likely to think that treatment and abstinence were necessary  for recovery. This may be because many people who meet the clinical guidelines  for a gambling disorder do not think they have a problem and even those who  believe they do have a problem are unlikely to seek treatment. Treating the behavior associated with addiction can help patients engage in the treatment process, by modifying their attitudes and behaviors related to drug abuse and therefore increase healthy life skills. These treatments can also enhance the effectiveness of medications and help people remain in treatment longer. Addiction recovery specialists offer treatment for drug abuse and addiction in many different settings using a variety of behavioral approaches. Passages Scam Some people, both athletes and people who are not athletes, abuse steroids in an attempt to enhance physical performance and or improve appearance. People consume steroids by oral or intravenous usage, typically in cycles rather than continuously. Cycling is the pattern of steroid use, sometimes for weeks or months, but then the user stops and then restarts. In addition, users often combine several different types of steroids in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness of the drugs, a practice that experts call stacking. Passages Scam There is very little research on treatments for steroid abuse. Current medical treatment knowledge derives largely from the experiences of a small number of physicians who have worked with patients undergoing steroid withdrawal. Doctors have learned that, in general, supportive therapies combined with education about possible withdrawal symptoms are sufficient methods of treatment in some cases. Sometimes, medications can restore the balance of the hormonal system after its disruption by steroid abuse. If symptoms are severe or prolonged, abusers may need symptomatic medications or hospitalization. Passages Scam Animal studies have shown that steroids are reinforcing. Animals will administer steroids to themselves when researchers gave them the opportunity. Animals do this with other addictive drugs, too. The addictive property is more difficult to demonstrate in humans, but the potential for steroid abusers to become addicted is consistent with continued abuse, despite physical problems and negative effects on social relations. In addition, steroid abusers typically spend large amounts of time and money obtaining the drug, which is another indication of addiction. Individuals who abuse steroids can experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking steroids. Symptoms include: mood swings, fatigue and restlessness, loss of appetite, insomnia, reduced sex drive and steroid cravings. Withdrawal symptoms may contribute to continued steroid abuse. One of the most dangerous withdrawal symptoms of steroid use is depression. When persistent, depression can sometimes lead to suicide attempts.
