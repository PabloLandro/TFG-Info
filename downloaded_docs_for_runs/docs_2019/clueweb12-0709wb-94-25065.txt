Description of selected adverse reactions, Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders One hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with Enbrel for up to approximately 6 years, including 231 patients treated with Enbrel in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of approximately 2 years duration involving 240 Enbrel-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were reported in Enbrel-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with Enbrel in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. In a group of 7,416 patients treated with Enbrel in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). Injection site reactions Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with Enbrel had a significantly higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the majority of injection site reactions in the Enbrel treatment groups, and the majority of patients who were given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at the most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with Enbrel developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Serious infections In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with Enbrel for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-controlled study where patients were treated with either Enbrel alone, methotrexate alone or Enbrel in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of Enbrel with methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with Enbrel and those treated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious infections experienced by Enbrel-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported a serious infection (pneumonia). Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of Enbrel; reported pathogens include bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few weeks after initiating treatment with Enbrel in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). Enbrel treatment may increase mortality in patients with established sepsis. Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with Enbrel, including invasive fungal, protozoal, bacterial (including Listeria and Legionella ), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received Enbrel. The exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections were Pneumocystis and Aspergillus . Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). Autoantibodies Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed new positive ANA ( 1:40) was higher in patients treated with Enbrel (11%) than in placebo-treated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with Enbrel who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with Enbrel on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia There have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal outcomes (see section 4.4). Interstitial lung disease There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. Concurrent treatment with anakinra In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with Enbrel plus anakinra, a higher rate of serious infections compared to Enbrel alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ). While neutropenic, one patient developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Paediatric population Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving Enbrel during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of Enbrel in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of Enbrel compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease in JIA patients being treated with Enbrel from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive rechallenge (see section 4.4). Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. Go to top of the page 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m 2 followed by subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m 2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient mistakenly self-administered 62 mg Enbrel subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to Enbrel. Go to top of the page 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Go to top of the page 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, ATC code: L04AB01 Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity. TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. Mechanism of action Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF. Clinical efficacy and safety This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, two studies in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg Enbrel or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with Enbrel at 3 and 6 months than in patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: Enbrel 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 6 months, respectively: ACR 50: Enbrel 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, respectively; p<0.01 Enbrel vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses). Approximately 15% of subjects who received Enbrel achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving Enbrel, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate between placebo and 25 mg. Enbrel was significantly better than placebo in all components of the ACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were improved in patients treated with Enbrel compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. After discontinuation of Enbrel, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. Re-introduction of treatment with Enbrel after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the same magnitudes of responses as patients who received Enbrel without interruption of therapy based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 48 months in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received Enbrel without interruption; longer-term experience is not available. The efficacy of Enbrel was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (<3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg Enbrel were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of action within 2 weeks with Enbrel 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with Enbrel 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in Year 2 of this study. In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg Enbrel dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. Enbrel 25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and Enbrel 25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below. Radiographic Progression: Comparison of Enbrel vs. Methotrexate in Patients with RA of <3 Years Duration In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with Enbrel alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. Patients in the Enbrel in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). Significant advantages for Enbrel in combination with methotrexate compared with Enbrel monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Clinical Efficacy Results at 12 Months: Comparison of Enbrel vs. Methotrexate vs. Enbrel in Combination with   Methotrexate in Patients with RA of 6 Months To 20 Years Duration Endpoint Methotrexate (n = 228) Enbrel (n = 223) Enbrel + Methotrexate (n = 231) ACR Responses a ACR 20 58.8% 65.5% 74.5% , ɸ ACR 50 36.4% 43.0% 63.2% , ɸ ACR 70 16.7% 22.0% 39.8% , ɸ DAS Baseline score b 5.5 5.7 5.5 Week 52 score b 3.0 3.0 2.3 , ɸ Remission c 14% 18% 37% , ɸ HAQ Baseline 1.7 1.7 1.8 Week 52 1.1 1.0 0.8 , ɸ a: Patients who did not complete 12 months in the study were considered to be non-responders. b: Values for Disease Activity Score (DAS) are means. c: Remission is defined as DAS <1.6. Pairwise comparison p-values:  = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs. methotrexate and ɸ

Radiographic progression at 12 months was significantly less in the Enbrel group than in the methotrexate group, while the combination was significantly better than either monotherapy at slowing radiographic progression (see figure below). Radiographic Progression: Comparison of Enbrel vs. Methotrexate vs. Enbrel in Combination with Methotrexate in Patients with RA of 6 Months To 20 Years Duration (12 Month Results) Pairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel vs. methotrexate,  = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs. methotrexate and ɸ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs. Enbrel. Significant advantages for Enbrel in combination with methotrexate compared with Enbrel monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the significant advantages for Enbrel monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the Enbrel in combination with methotrexate group compared with the Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p<0.05). The difference between Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p<0.05). Among patients who completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, respectively. The safety and efficacy of 50 mg Enbrel (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg Enbrel once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two Enbrel treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. Adult patients with psoriatic arthritis The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active psoriatic arthritis ( 3 swollen joints and 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion 2 cm in diameter. Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids (24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for 2 months) could continue at a stable dose of 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of Enbrel (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total duration of up to 2 years. Clinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 response and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC). Results are summarised in the table below. Responses of Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis in a Placebo-Controlled Trial Percent of Patients Placebo Enbrel a Psoriatic Arthritis Response n = 104 n = 101 ACR 20 Month 3 15 59 b Month 6 13 50 b ACR 50 Month 3 4 38 b Month 6 4 37 b ACR 70 Month 3 0 11 b Month 6 1 9 c PsARC Month 3 31 72 b Month 6 23 70 b a:  25 mg Enbrel SC twice weekly b:  p < 0.001, Enbrel vs. placebo c:  p < 0.01, Enbrel vs. placebo Among patients with psoriatic arthritis who received Enbrel, the clinical responses were apparent at the time of the first visit (4 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. Enbrel was significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p < 0.001), and responses were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis patients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index score was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with Enbrel, relative to placebo (p < 0.001). Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in the table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change 0.5) at 12 months was higher in the Enbrel group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, respectively, p 0.001). The effect of Enbrel on radiographic progression was maintained in patients who continued on treatment during the second year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage was observed in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement. Mean (SE) Annualized Change from Baseline in Total Sharp Score Placebo Etanercept Time (n = 104) (n = 101) Month 12 1.00 (0.29) -0.03 (0.09) a SE = standard error. a. p = 0.0001. Enbrel treatment resulted in improvement in physical function during the double-blind period, and this benefit was maintained during the longer-term exposure of up to 2 years. There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Enbrel in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like and arthritis mutilans psoriatic arthropathies due to the small number of patients studied. No study has been performed in patients with psoriatic arthritis using the 50 mg once-weekly dosing regimen. Evidence of efficacy for the once-weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been based on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis The efficacy of Enbrel in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind studies comparing twice-weekly administration of 25 mg Enbrel with placebo. A total of 401 patients were enrolled, from which 203 were treated with Enbrel. The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of 30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving DMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete ankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of Enbrel (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, BASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. Compared to placebo, treatment with Enbrel resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline. Similar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. In a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg Enbrel (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly vs. 25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy profiles of the 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly regimens were similar. Adult patients with plaque psoriasis Enbrel is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who failed to respond to in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI<50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available. The efficacy of Enbrel versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing Enbrel with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of Enbrel were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving 10% of the body surface area who were 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of Enbrel (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for 24 weeks. Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. Enbrel was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, patients received placebo or one of the above three Enbrel doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded Enbrel (25 mg twice a week); patients in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally randomised. Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg Enbrel, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this study received a dose of 50 mg Enbrel or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 50 mg Enbrel once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. In study 1, the Enbrel-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, 56% of patients in the Enbrel-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below.

No statistical comparisons to placebo were made at week 24 in studies 2 and 4 because the original placebo group began receiving Enbrel 25 mg BIW or 50 mg once weekly from week 13 to week 24. b.  Dermatologist Static Global Assessment. Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received Enbrel, significant responses relative to placebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy. Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the occurrence of rebound (PASI 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with Enbrel in patients initially responding to treatment. In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and had their Enbrel dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. In study 4, the Enbrel-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 (38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI 75 at week 24. In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where Enbrel was given without interruption, clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and individual patient needs. Antibodies to Enbrel Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no correlation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 3% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of antibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis The safety and efficacy of Enbrel were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset types. Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) Enbrel subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on Enbrel or receive placebo for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI), defined as 30% improvement in at least three of six and 30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare was defined as a 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and 30% improvement in not more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on Enbrel experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was 116 days for patients who received Enbrel and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the patients remaining on Enbrel continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those who received placebo did not improve. Studies have not been done in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of continued Enbrel therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating Enbrel therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the recommended dose of Enbrel following its long-term use in patients with JIA. Long-term safety of Enbrel monotherapy (n=103), Enbrel plus methotrexate (n=294), or methotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Enbrel in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an sPGA score 3, involving 10% of the BSA, and PASI 12). Eligible patients had a history of receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. Patients received Enbrel 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week 12, more patients randomised to Enbrel had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to placebo.

Responses observed during the open-label period were similar to those observed in the double-blind period. During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to Enbrel. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. Th e long-term safety and effectiveness of Enbrel 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with Enbrel was generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. Go to top of the page 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With twice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg Enbrel, the average maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg•hr/ml. Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance across the dosing range. A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of Enbrel in rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were C max of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, C min of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466 μg•hr/ml and 474 μg•hr/ml for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (N= 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute renal or hepatic failure. The presence of renal and hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. Methotrexate has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of etanercept. The effect of Enbrel on the human pharmacokinetics of methotrexate has not been investigated. Special populations Elderly patients The impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept serum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to estimates in patients less than 65 years of age. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis In a polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with Enbrel, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.4 mg Enbrel/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have appreciably lower levels. Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. Go to top of the page 5.3 Preclinical safety data In the toxicological studies with Enbrel, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. Enbrel was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with Enbrel due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. Enbrel did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single subcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. Enbrel did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg.
