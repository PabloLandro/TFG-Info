Blackmores Bio Magnesium Tabs 100 $24.30 (RRP: $26.95) If the body is low in magnesium, it is forced to take it from the muscles, and without sufficient magnesium muscles stiffen up or contract at liberty. The result may be painful cramps, irritability, twitching or even tremors. Magnesium supplementation may also be of assistance for the temporary relief of symptoms of back pain and muscular strain. Features and benefits Combines magnesium with co-factors for improved absorption and utilisation Contains magnesium from two different sources, magnesium oxide (which is the most concentrated source of elemental magnesium) and magnesium phosphate How it works Magnesium is essential for the electrical activity of nerves and muscle, and is indicated to relieve painful cramps (including menstrual cramps), twitching and tremors. Together with calcium, magnesium plays an integral role in tooth and bone hardness. Other nutrients present in Bio Magnesium also assist muscle function and include vitamins C and D (low intake has been associated with muscle fatigue), vitamin B6 and the mineral manganese which is involved in active phosphate transfer processes to provide muscle energy.
