< 16 years with transcranial doppler ultrasound.  Children with high flow rates in the MCA and distal ICA, indicating advanced stenosis, were found to have a 90% reduction in stroke incidence if blood transfusions were initiated, either through manual exchange or erythrocytopheresis, to maintain hemoglobin S less than 30%.  However, the potential side effects of iron overload, allo-immunization, and transmission of blood-borne pathogens, still prove to be limiting, and thus not all patients at risk of primary stroke or recurrence benefit.  This obstacle led to the development of alternatives to chronic transfusion, including hydroxyurea and stem cell transplantation. The first successful hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for SCD was initiated in 1984.  Since then, the preparative or conditioning regimen has been altered to be either completely myeloablative or partially ablative.  Each of these therapies confer their own spectrum of adverse effects including infertility/sterility, neurotoxicity, lung and liver toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft rejection, and transplant related mortality (TRM).  Additionally, donors have traditionally been restricted to matched related siblings, severely limiting the pool of potential recipients.  Recently, clinicians at Washington University have begun to treat potential HSCT recipients with a partially myeloablative regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab.  The trial accepts matched unrelated donors, expanding the pool of recipients who otherwise have no alternative.  As studies such as this begin to address and ameliorate the immediate toxicities of HSCT, including GVHD and TRM, we can begin to offer transplantation as an alternative to chronic transfusion therapy and, look to its potential as an achievable cure for sickle cell disease.
