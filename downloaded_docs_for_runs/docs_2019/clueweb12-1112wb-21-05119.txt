Home Architecture Decorating Gardening Home Decor Home Improvement Recipes Brookstone Pillows – NapForm Lumbar Back Support August 19, 2008 By evette 5 Comments Share When I first get to work I am chipper, lively and still have that gleam of happiness in my eyes. Of course as the day progresses, my life force is slowly drained from my body and I become more and more hunched over at my desk . Add to that I am fairly well endowed on the chesty chest. I am not bragging, as a matter of fact the girls are becoming quite a burden in my latter years. I am not joking when I say that it becomes cumbersome trying to remain erect with 6-8lbs of boobage strapped to your chest. Anyhow I am ready to invest in some sort of lumbar support pillow. The one I have been scoping out is the Napform Lumbar Support from Brookstone. I am ready to treat my lower back to perfectly shaped support and luxurious NapSoft fabric. Here’s the official pitch: “NapFormâ¢ memory material will ease discomfort and pressure, while helping to improve circulation and overall comfort. Our lumbar support also helps your back âwork lessâ to maintain posture, even during prolonged sitting. ” (Source: Brookstone ) Mmmm, sounds divine. That’s everything I am looking for to be honest. The NapForm Lumbar Support Pillow costs – $50 Have any of you guys purchased a back support pillow to use at work? What do you recommend?
