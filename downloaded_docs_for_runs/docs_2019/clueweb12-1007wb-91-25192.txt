Brands Medihoney Honeycolloid Dressing Click for other views Medihoney honeycolloid dressing is a novel honey-based dressing for lightly to moderately exuding wounds.  The dressing contains 80% Active Leptospermum Honey, can be used to cover a shallow wound or fill a deep wound (non-adhesive version only), and provides a moist environemt conducive to wound healing.  The adhesive version is specifically to be used as an all-in-one dressing, with no need for a secondary dressing to hold it in place.  Active Leptospermum Honey has been shown to have several properties which assist in promoting an optimal healing environment.  It has low pH, and has been shown to help lower the overall wound pH, which is beneficial in chronic wounds.  The honey is also highly osmotic, which assists in debridement and keeping the wound bed clean.  This non-toxic dressing can be used as a cornerstone for wound bed preperation, and throughout all the phases of wound healing.
