< 37 weeks gestation) or low birth weight (< 2500 g). Studies that included other allergy prevention interventions (e.g. maternal dietary avoidance measures, environmental allergy reduction measures) in the treatment and not the control group were excluded. Studies that had other allergy prevention interventions in both treatment and control groups were eligible. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine if the findings were affected by including only studies of adequate methodology, defined as adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding of intervention and measurement, and < 10% losses to follow up. Description of studies Excluded studies and reasons for exclusion from the review are found in 'table of excluded studies'. Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion in this review - see 'table of included studies'. Allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity outcomes were assessed by 6 studies enrolling 2080 infants but reporting outcomes for only 1549 infants. Participants: Risk of allergy: Five studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Rautava 2002 ; Taylor 2006 ) enrolled term or near term infants at high risk of allergy or food hypersensitivity (infants with at least one first degree relative with a history of allergy or food hypersensitivity). Five studies ( Brunser 2006b ; Puccio 2007 ; Rautava 2006 ; Saavedra 2004 ; Vendt 2006 ) enrolled healthy term or near term infants and were not selected on the basis of a family history of allergy. Two studies ( Bin-Nun 2005 ; Lin 2005 ) enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants and were not selected on the basis of a family history of allergy. Infant feeding: All studies used prolonged supplementation of infant feeds with probiotic supplements. Five studies ( Brunser 2006b ; Puccio 2007 ; Rautava 2006 ; Saavedra 2004 ; Vendt 2006 ) enrolled infants receiving prolonged formula feeding. Five studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Bin-Nun 2005 ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Taylor 2006 ) enrolled infants receiving either prolonged breast milk or formula feeding. Six studies ( Bin-Nun 2005 ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Brunser 2006b ; Rautava 2006 ; Saavedra 2004 ; Vendt 2006 ) enrolled infants receiving prolonged cow's milk formula feeding (with or without breast feeding). One study ( Abrahamsson 2007 ) enrolled infants using a hydrolysed infant formula (with or without breast feeding). Two studies ( Lin 2005 ; Rautava 2002 ) enrolled infants receiving prolonged exclusive breast feeding. Kalliomaki 2001a reported encouraging women to breast feed, with 60% of infants predominately breast fed at 6 months, 35% receiving predominate cow's milk based formula and 5% a hydrolysed or amino acid based formula. Taylor 2006 reported the majority of women ever breast fed (98%) and were still breast feeding at six months (72%). Interventions: L. acidophillus: Taylor 2006 allocated infants to treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus versus placebo. L. johnsonii: Brunser 2006b allocated infants to treatment with Lactobacillus johnsonii versus prebiotic (fructo-oligosaccharide) supplemented formula versus control formula. L. reuteri: Abrahamsson 2007 allocated infants to treatment with Lactobacillus reuteri versus placebo given to the mother four weeks before delivery, then mother and baby daily for 12 months. L. rhamnosus: Three studies ( Kalliomaki 2001a ; Rautava 2002 ; Vendt 2006 ) allocated infants to treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo. Probiotic mixtures: Bin-Nun 2005 allocated infants to treatment with a mixture of Bifidobacteria infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacteria bifidus versus placebo mixed in infant feeds. Lin 2005 allocated infants to treatment with a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis versus control. Rautava 2006 allocated infants to treatment with a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis versus placebo. Mixtures of pro and prebiotics: Kukkonen 2006 allocated infants to treatment with a probiotic and prebiotic mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and galacto-oligosaccharide 0.8g versus placebo (no probiotic or prebiotic). Puccio 2007 allocated infants to Bifidobacterium longum BL999 and a prebiotic mixture containing fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides (1:9). Saavedra 2004 allocated infants to treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis versus placebo. Reported bacteria counts, doses, formulations and controls are documented in 'table of included studies'. Outcomes: Allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity: assessed by six studies enrolling 2080 infants but reporting outcomes for only 1549 infants ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Rautava 2002 ; Rautava 2006 ; Taylor 2006 ). Abrahamsson 2007 performed blinded assessments for eczema and sensitisation (skin prick tests and specific IgE) up to two years of age. Kalliomaki 2001a performed blinded physician assessment for eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma at two and four years of age. Sensitisation assessed by skin prick tests at 6, 12 and 24 months of age and specific IgE at 3, 12 and 24 months of age. Kukkonen 2006 performed blinded physician assessment for food hypersensitivity, eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis at two years of age. Sensitisation assessed by skin prick tests and specific IgE at two years of age. Rautava 2002 performed physician assessment for eczema up to two years of age. Cow's milk protein hypersensitivity was confirmed by double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) or skin prick test for cow's milk protein sensitisation. Rautava 2006 performed physician assessment for eczema up to 12 months of age. Cow's milk protein hypersensitivity was confirmed by double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) or skin prick test for cow's milk protein sensitisation. Taylor 2006 performed blinded physician assessment for eczema and food allergy confirmed by a positive skin prick test to specific food at 12 months of age. Other outcomes: Six studies ( Bin-Nun 2005 ; Brunser 2006b ; Lin 2005 ; Puccio 2007 ; Saavedra 2004 ; Vendt 2006 ) did not report allergic disease or food hypersensitivity outcomes. Infant growth when on probiotics was reported by seven studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Bin-Nun 2005 ; Brunser 2006b ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Puccio 2007 ; Saavedra 2004 ; Taylor 2006 ; Vendt 2006 ). Lin 2005 reported incidence of blood culture positive sepsis. Methodological quality of included studies Randomisation and allocation concealment: All studies reported random method of allocation to treatment. Four studies ( Bin-Nun 2005 ; Puccio 2007 ; Rautava 2002 ; Rautava 2006 ) did not report method of randomisation so allocation concealment is unclear. The other studies had an adequate allocation sequence. Blinding of treatment: Ten studies used a placebo to blind treatment ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Brunser 2006b ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Puccio 2007 ; Rautava 2006 ; Saavedra 2004 ; Taylor 2006 ; Vendt 2006 ). The other two studies ( Bin-Nun 2005 ; Lin 2005 ) reported measures to conceal treatment allocation from treating staff. Blinding of outcome measurement: Eight studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Bin-Nun 2005 ; Brunser 2006b ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Lin 2005 ; Taylor 2006 ; Vendt 2006 ) reported blinding of measurement. The other four studies ( Puccio 2007 ; Rautava 2002 ; Rautava 2006 ; Saavedra 2004 ) did not specifically report blinding of measurement but used a placebo so blinding is likely. Losses to follow up: Post-randomisation losses to follow up were: Abrahamsson 2007 19% in both groups; Bin-Nun 2005 2% of enrolled infants; Brunser 2006b 34% of enrolled infants; Kalliomaki 2001a 17% of enrolled infants; Kukkonen 2006 24% of enrolled infants; Lin 2005 none reported; Puccio 2007 reported 30% infants discontinued treatment, but reported all infants in an intention to treat analysis. Rautava 2002 ; 61% excluded as not breast feeding or not compliant; Rautava 2006 11% of enrolled infants; Saavedra 2004 10% of enrolled infants; Taylor 2006 18% of enrolled infants; and Vendt 2006 12.5% of enrolled infants. The range of post-randomisation losses in studies using the probiotic agent L rhamnosus was 17% to 61%. Intention to treat analysis: All studies reported analyses according to group of assignment. Results PROBIOTIC VERSUS NO PROBIOTIC - ALL INFANTS (COMPARISON 01): Allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity: Allergy (outcome 01): One study ( Kukkonen 2006 ) reported no significant difference in all allergic disease in infants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75, 1.08). Food hypersensitivity (outcomes 02-3): No study reported food hypersensitivity (all manifestations). Meta-analysis of 2 studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Rautava 2002 ) found no significant difference in food hypersensitivity manifest as gastrointestinal symptoms in infancy (typical RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27, 4.03). Asthma (outcome 04): Meta-analysis of two studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Taylor 2006 ) found no significant difference in asthma incidence in infancy and Kalliomaki 2001a reported no significant difference in asthma prevalence in childhood. Eczema (outcomes 05-6): Two studies ( Kalliomaki 2001a ; Rautava 2002 ) independently reported a significant reduction in infant eczema, with meta-analysis of five studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Kalliomaki 2001a ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Rautava 2002 ; Taylor 2006 ) finding a significant reduction in infant eczema (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70, 0.95). However, significant (p = 0.03) and substantial (I 2 = 63.6%) heterogeneity was found. Kalliomaki 2001a reported a significant reduction in childhood eczema prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33, 0.97). Kukkonen 2006 reported a significant reduction in atopic eczema in infants, with meta-analysis of four studies ( Abrahamsson 2007 ; Kukkonen 2006 ; Rautava 2006 ; Taylor 2006 ) finding no significant difference in atopic eczema in infants (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62, 1.02). Again, significant (p = 0.04) and substantial (I 2 = 65.1%) heterogeneity was found. Allergic rhinitis (outcome 07): Abrahamsson 2007 reported no significant difference in allergic rhinitis in infants and Kalliomaki 2001a reported no significant difference in childhood prevalence of allergic rhinitis incidence. Food hypersensitivity and allergy (outcomes 08-10): Taylor 2006 reported no significant difference in food allergy in infants. Meta-analysis of three studies ( Kalliomaki 2001a ; Rautava 2002 ; Rautava 2006 ) found no significant difference in cow's milk protein hypersensitivity in infants and Kalliomaki 2001a reported no significant difference in childhood prevalence. Rautava 2006 reported no significant difference in cow's milk protein allergy in infants. Urticaria (outcome 11): Abrahamsson 2007 reported no significant difference in urticaria in infants. Growth: Abrahamsson 2007 reported infants were heavier in the L. reuteri than the placebo group at three months of age (6.4 kg vs. 6.1 kg, p = 0.03, t-test), but not at any other time points. Bin-Nun 2005 reported the mean (+/- sd) cumulative weight gain at six weeks of age was 691 ± 208 g in the probiotic group versus 594 ± 239 g in the placebo group, with the differences reported as not significant. However, RevMan analysis found that weight gain was significantly greater in the probiotic group (MD 97.00 g/6 weeks, 95% CI 24.10, 169.90). Brunser 2006b reported no differences between the study groups with respect to weight, height, weight for height, weight for age and height for age z-scores (National Center for Health Statistics) on the day of enrolment as well as during the study (data not documented in publication). Kalliomaki 2001a reported infants receiving probiotics and control had no significant difference in weight or length at two weeks, three months and six months of age when receiving treatment [at six months, mean weight (range) - probiotic: 8.4 kg (6.8 - 11.5); control 8.2 kg (6.4 - 11.0); mean length (range) - probiotic 69.1 cm (63.2 - 74.5); control: 68.2 cm (61.5 - 72.6)]. There was also no significant difference at 12 and 24 months of age. Saavedra 2004 reported z-scores for weight/age, height/age, and weight/length at the time of enrolment and at the end of participation as well as the change in z-scores over the time of participation for all subjects in each group. No significant differences between the groups were reported. Taylor 2006 reported no significant difference in weight or height at six months of age at the end of the period of treatment [Height - probiotic: 67.8 cm (se 0.3), control: 67.3 cm (se 0.3). Weight - probiotic: 7.8 kg (se 0.1), control: 7.9 kg (se 0.1)]. No significant difference was also reported at 12 months of age. Vendt 2006 reported weight, length and head circumference measured monthly and transformed into standard deviation scores (SDS). Changes in length and weight SDS at the end of the study were significantly higher in those receiving probiotic supplemented formula than those receiving regular formula (0.44 ± 0.37 versus 0.07 ± 0.06, P < 0.01 and 0.44 ± 0.19 versus 0.07 ± 0.06, P < 0.005, respectively). However, length and weight SDS scores were significantly lower in the probiotic group at study entry, and no adjustment was made for these differences. Potential harms: Abrahamsson 2007 reported no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of mild adverse events (spitting-up, colic and constipation) during the first 12 months of age. At one and two months of age, more infants in the L. reuteri group were reported having spitting-ups than in the placebo group (26% versus 14%, p = 0.04, at one month of age, and 33% versus 19%, p = 0.04, at two months of age). There were no significant differences when the parents were asked whether their infants had any gastrointestinal problems (13% versus 9%, p = 0.37, at one month, and 6% versus 11%, p = 0.28, at two months). The cumulative incidence of infants reported to have gastrointestinal problems during the first 12 months was 21% in the L. reuteri group and 23% in the placebo group. No severe adverse events were reported. Bin-Nun 2005 reported a significant reduction in NEC and/or death (6/73 versus 17/72; p = 0.025) in preterm infants receiving probiotics compared to control. Brunser 2006b reported none of the withdrawals from the study were associated with adverse reactions to the formulas. Kalliomaki 2001a reported no significant difference in infant vomiting, total duration of crying, duration of fussing and consistency of stools in infants receiving probiotics compared to control. Kukkonen 2006 reported no significant difference in adverse events ('abdominal discomfort', vomiting, excess crying) between probiotic and placebo groups and discontinuation because of major difficulties in swallowing product. Lin 2005 reported none of the positive blood cultures grew Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species. The incidence of sepsis was lower in the probiotic group (22/180 (12.2%) versus 36/187 (19.3%); p = 0.03). Rautava 2002 reported that "no adverse reactions or clinical side effects were observed during probiotic supplementation or clinical follow-up". Saavedra 2004 reported significant reductions in colic or irritability frequency in infants receiving infants receiving probiotics compared to control. No significant difference was reported in infant stool frequency or consistency, vomiting or fever with diarrhoea, discomfort with bowel movement, health care attention for illness or daycare absenteeism due to illness. No study reported data for costs.

PROBIOTIC WITH ADDED PREBIOTIC VERSUS NO PROBIOTIC (COMPARISON 07): Outcomes 01-3: In infants, Kukkonen 2006 reported no significant difference for all allergic disease (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75, 1.08), a significant reduction in eczema (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66, 0.99) and a significant reduction in atopic eczema (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51, 0.96). Puccio 2007 reported weight gain was not significantly different (MD 0.50 g/day, 90% CI -1.48 to 2.48) - authors analysis. Puccio 2007 also reported length gain in mm/month (boys 35.1 [sd 4.2] versus 35.1 [4.4]; girls 32.2 [4.3] versus 32.2 [4.6]) and head circumference growth in mm/month (boys 17.9 [2.7] versus 17.4 [2.7]; girls 16.0 [2.8] versus 15.5 [3.0]) was also not significantly different, although it is unclear as to whether this analysis includes all infants or is restricted to the 97 of 138 infants who did not discontinue formula. SPECIFIC PROBIOTIC VERSUS NO PROBIOTIC (COMPARISON 08): L. rhamnosus, B. Breve and P. freudenreichii (with GOS): In infants, Kukkonen 2006 reported no significant difference for all allergic disease (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75, 1.08), a significant reduction in eczema (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66, 0.99) and a significant reduction in atopic eczema (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51, 0.96).

OTHER PRESPECIFIED COMPARISONS All studies included in this review were eligible for inclusion in the analysis 'Infants given prolonged supplementation (weeks or months).' The 2 studies ( Bin-Nun 2005 ; Lin 2005 ) that enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants did not report allergic disease or food hypersensitivity outcomes so separate subgroup analysis were not performed. No study compared different probiotics. PROBIOTIC VERSUS NO PROBIOTIC - STUDIES WITH ADEQUATE METHODOLOGY (COMPARISON 09): no study met criteria for studies of adequate methodology. Discussion The primary outcomes of this review were all manifestations of allergic disease and food hypersensitivity with one study reporting no significant difference in all allergic disease. No studies reported all manifestations of food hypersensitivity. For specific allergies in infants, no significant difference was found overall for gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy (confirmed by skin prick test or specific IgE), cow's milk protein hypersensitivity, cow's milk protein allergy, and urticaria. Meta-analysis of five studies reporting the outcomes of 1477 infants found a significant reduction in infant eczema. However, there was significant and substantial heterogeneity between studies. When the analysis was restricted to studies reporting atopic eczema (confirmed by skin prick test or specific IgE) the findings were no longer significant. One study assessed outcomes up to four years of age and reported that difference in eczema persisted, but there was no significant difference in asthma, allergic rhinitis or cow's milk protein hypersensitivity. Although most studies had adequate randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinded intervention, nearly all studies had substantial losses to follow up. No study was eligible for inclusion in the prespecified analysis of studies of adequate methodology. In subgroup analyses, all studies reporting infant and childhood eczema enrolled infants at high risk of allergy and/or food hypersensitivity. No other outcome became significant when analysis was restricted to high risk infants. Only one study reported allergic disease or food hypersensitivity outcomes in infants not selected on the basis of risk for allergy and food hypersensitivity, with no benefits reported for atopic eczema, cow's protein hypersensitivity and cow's protein allergy. One study reported a significant reduction in eczema in exclusively breast fed high risk infants. In infants fed cow's milk formula, significant reductions were reported by one study for eczema and meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in atopic eczema. One study reported no significant difference in any specific allergic disease or food hypersensitivity for infants fed breast milk or an extensively hydrolysed formula. One study reported a significant reduction in eczema and atopic eczema for infants fed a combination of probiotic with prebiotic. Two studies independently reported a significant reductions in eczema in infants for probiotics including L. rhamnosus. One of these studies also reported a significant reduction of eczema in children. One study also reported a significant reduction in infant eczema from a mixture of L. rhamnosus, B. breve, P. propionibacterium and prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide. The incidence of atopic eczema (sensitisation confirmed), but not all clinical eczema, was increased in one study using the probiotic L. acidophillus. No other benefits or harms were reported for specific probiotics. However, the interpretation of results is made more difficult by the different dosing strategies used by different studies. Control group event rates for all allergic disease and eczema were 35%, a rate that is consistent with use of high risk selection criteria based on having a first degree relative with a history of allergy. The review is powered to detect differences in event rates between treatment groups of approximately 5%. Contrary to expectations, the only study enrolling infants that were exclusively breast fed had the highest control group event rate (47%) and reported the highest absolute reduction in eczema (32%). As this study excluded a substantial proportion of infants post-randomisation who were not exclusively breast fed, the results of this analysis should be viewed with caution. Since most other studies included infants both breast and formula fed, no firm conclusions regarding the effect of probiotics in solely formula fed infants can be made. No consistent adverse effects on infant growth when on probiotics were reported. No other adverse effects attributable to probiotics were reported. One study in preterm infants reported no episodes of sepsis with probiotic bacteria. To date, treatment with probiotic bacteria appears to be safe, although the studies included in this review have insufficient power to detect uncommon outcomes including sepsis with probiotic bacteria. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. Although there was a reduction in clinical eczema in infants, not all studies showed a benefit and caution is advised in view of methodological concerns regarding the studies. To date, studies using L. rhamnosus have been the most homogenous in reporting beneficial outcomes. Further studies are required to determine whether the finding of reduced eczema persists over a longer period of time, applies to other manifestations of allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity, is associated with reductions in allergen sensitisation, and is reproducible. Future studies should enrol infants at high risk of allergy or food hypersensitivity, consider using preparations of probiotics that have been reported to produce a reduction in infant eczema and compare groups with and without an added prebiotic. Reviewers' conclusions Implications for practice There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. Although there was a reduction in clinical eczema in infants, this effect was not consistent between studies and caution is advised in view of methodological concerns regarding included studies. Implications for research Further studies are required to determine whether the finding of reduced eczema persists over a longer period of time, applies to other manifestations of allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity, is associated with reductions in allergen sensitisation, and is reproducible. Future studies should enrol infants at high risk of allergy or food hypersensitivity, consider using preparations of probiotics that have been reported to produce a reduction in infant eczema and compare groups with and without an added prebiotic.
