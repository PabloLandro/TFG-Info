You can expect your back and body to become stronger and much more flexible, and your mind to become more settled and clear. This means you are less likely to accidentally injure yourself and suffer lower back pain, especially if you stick at your yoga practise. As mentioned above, Yoga is also known to help your mind become more settled and clear. The calmness this brings will help you reduce your stress levels and avoid related illnesses and injuries. Yoga postures are called asanas and they are designed to produce beneficial effects in several ways: 1. The position of the asana causes an increase in blood circulation to the specific target organ or gland. 2. The position of the asana often produces a slight squeezing of the organ or gland. This has the effect of massaging the organ or gland and stimulating it. 3. Deep breathing and visualizing the target area sends an extra supply of prana (life energy) to the area. The Salute to the Sun exercise is strictly speaking not yoga, although it is widely used as a warm up to a yoga routine.
