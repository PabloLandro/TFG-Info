Drug-induced Lupus was often misdiagnosed so treatment had not been fitting the need. At this point, with greater understanding, drug induced lupus treatment options allow folks to lead full active lives. Lupus, an autoimmune disease, occurs in folks for various good reasons and no two people have the same exact cause, signs, or even necessarily treatment. Lupus occurs when your own immune system starts attacking vital organs and tissues in your body causing irritation and pain to emerge. Drug induced lupus is brought on by damaging reactions to medications and is similar to systemic sle. Some prescription medications that have been identified to bring on drug-induced sle are: - Hydrazine (muscle tissue relaxant to treat high blood pressure levels) - Isoniazid (utilized in the treatment and prevention of TB) - Methyl dopa (used for hypertension) - Penicillamine (a heavy metal antagonists employed in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and arthritic conditions) - Procainamide (helpful to treat irregular heart rhythms) - Quinidine (utilized to treat or prevent many types of irregular heartbeats) - Sulfasalazine (used to treat slight to average ulcerative colitis; Crohn's illness, and RA) - Thorazine (anti-psychotic treatment) Medication reactions to cellular matter within your body causes your body to develop antibodies. These antibodies fight the healthful cellular material in your body. Drug-induced lupus treatment is symptomatic based. Signs occur normally after taking the above mentioned medication for about 3 to 6 months and often times the signs and symptoms of lupus will go away within a few days to a couple of weeks after ceased usage of the previously listed medication. That is certainly one treatment for drug-induced lupus. We must bear in mind though that these treatments will not address the actual causes.
