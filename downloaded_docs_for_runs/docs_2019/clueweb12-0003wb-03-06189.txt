Halik Skin Care - Aloe Vera Aloe Vera - 5 Amazing Benefits For Healthier Skin Since the days of antiquity, the aloe vera plant has been a popular healing remedy for many different types of diseases and conditions and also as an aid in the promotion of greater health. Without a doubt, aloe vera's most popular use is in the promotion of health and healing for the skin. But do we really understand how truly amazing this plant really is and what it does for us in improving the health and healing of our skin? Here is a brief list of just 5 of the amazing benefits aloe vera has for the health and healing of our skin: BENEFIT 1: Aloe Vera heals the skin: Probably the most widely known benefit is the healing effect that aloe has on the skin. Aloe vera aids in the healing of wounds, frostbite and burns including sunburn. Aloe vera contains a combination of salicylic acid and magnesium that has a soothing, anti-inflammatory effect on the skin. Aloe is able to penetrate the skin's layers to reduce pain, inflammation and increase bloodflow to the affected area. With its ability to penetrate the layers of the skin easily and be absorbed quickly, aloe vera has been widely used to heal, and sooth the skin. BENEFIT 2: Aloe Vera moisturizes the skin: Aloe vera is a natural moisturizer for the skin. With its ability to penetrate the layers of the skin easily and be absorbed quickly, aloe helps to balance the skin's own natural pH level, which is needed for smooth, healthy looking skin. BENEFIT 3: Aloe Vera conditions the skin: Aloe vera also provides natural skin conditioning. Aloe vera contains valuable vitamins and nutrients that are able to be carried to and reach and the deep innermost layers of the skin, thereby healing and conditioning the skin from the inside out. BENEFIT 4: Aloe Vera fights aging: Aloe vera contains natural anti-oxidants such as vitamins A, C and E which are widely known and used throughout the cosmetics industry to help reduce the adverse signs of aging in the skin and also to help improve and tighten the skin's overall elasticity. BENEFIT 5: Aloe Vera promotes healthy skin: Aloe vera also promotes healthy skin growth. Aloe vera is believed to contain its own natural enzymes which have the capability of ridding the skin of dead skin cells and aid in the promotion of healthy, new skin cell growth. Aloe vera leaves the skin with a soft, healthy looking tone and texture.
