Posted 03.02.2010 Louis K. Diamond Chair in Hematology, Professor, Laboratory Medicine, Medicine Dr. Kanâ€™s current research efforts involve the construction of mouse models for sickle cell anemia that mimic the human variations in the clinical phenotypes in order to provide mice for investigating drugs that inhibit sickling and stimulate fetal hemoglobin expression.  Using a transgenic knockout mouse with sickle cell anemia that he previously constructed, he has derived ES cells from the homozygously affected mice and is using homologous recombination to correct the sickle mutation. The ES cells will be differentiated into hematopoietic cells and transplanted for the treatment of sickle mice.  He is also exploring gene therapy for alpha-thalassemia using a mouse alpha-thalassemia model that he previously constructed.  Finally, he is investigating gene and cell therapy for the treatment of coronary heart disease. He plans to deliver a hypoxia regulated VEGF gene into mouse ischemic hearts using both viral vectors and hematopoietic stem cells.  Future work over the next five years will be concentrated on gene and cell therapy for these disorders. While these experiments are performed in mouse models, successful results may lead to their application to human diseases. SCHOOL OF M
