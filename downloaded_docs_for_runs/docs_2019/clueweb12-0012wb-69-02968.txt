chronic back pain - Bodybridge chronic back pain What can I do about my chronic back pain? One way to alleviate back pain is to arch the body, as people and animals do when they stretch to relax. Lying backwards so that the front of the body is stretched will further relax the spine, with the additional benefit of freeing discs and vertebrae from the normal downward pull of gravity. As the body stretches backwards, abdominal muscles tighten and strengthen, and therefore help to take more of the load off the lower back. BodyBridge Arching the back reduces stress. Some studies have even suggested that this effect can reduce stress on the lower back by 50%. In the process it provides mild, passive exercise of the ligaments, tendons and musculature that surround the abdominal cavity. As a result it permits a better supply of blood to flow to all parts of the body, by utilizing the pull of gravity in different directions from those we experience in a normal upright position. The BodyBridge is a curved topped passive traction table which decompresses the spine. Each disk can gently separate through passive traction. Once decompression takes place, pressure is taken off the muscle groups in the low, mid and upper back. Many of our customers are now pain free because they took the time to retrain their muscles by using the BodyBridge daily.
