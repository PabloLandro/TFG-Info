Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that promote the growth of friendly microflora in the intestines. Some probiotic powerhouses you can find in your favorite Burbank grocery store are yogurt, kefir, and kimchi. Probiotics support digestive health in a number of ways. They have been shown to prevent diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and help reduce the symptoms of eczema. Safe and natural probiotics can be an effective weapon in your eczema arsenal. Burbank dermatologists and Seville pediatricians also recommend washing your tot’s clothing with mild detergents , using humidifiers , and bathing them with mild soap and then letting their skin completely dry.
