        Surgery Guide - Research Into Obesity Surgery Laparoscopically Performed Gastric Banding in A 13 Year-Old Girl With 
        Morbid Obesity And End Stage Renal Insufficiency Allows Lifesaving Weight 
        Loss And Hemodialysis In adults, laparoscopic gastric banding is applied to treat morbid obesity, 
        usually in combination with dietary and psychological intervention and 
        increased physical exercise. However, little information is available 
        on gastric banding in children. Method The 13 year-old girl suffered from end stage renal failure. Complications 
        with hemodialysis catheters due to her extensive subcutaneous fat pads 
        led to a life-threatening deterioration of her uremia. Intensive conventional 
        schedules for weight reduction failed to be effective, so the morbidly 
        obese girl underwent laparoscopic gastric banding at the age of 13 years 
        after informed parental consent was obtained. Results After laparoscopic gastric banding there was a notable weight loss of 
        14 kg and an eventually adequate hemodialysis was possible. Total weight 
        loss of the now 15 year-old girl was 24 kg. Conclusion Even in childhood, laparoscopic gastric banding may be considered in 
        cases of morbid obesity in critically ill patients. Source: Knerr I, Horbach T, Plank C, Carbon R, Nusken KD, Rascher W, Dotsch J.

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
