Usually doctors start very high doses in alcohol withdrawal and gradually tailing it off over the time. Also it is used in management of anxiety disorders and short term relief of acute anxiety. Side effects of Librium Most common side effects are light headedness and drowsiness which can continue to the next day. If the patient is taking Librium for alcohol withdrawal, chances are high that he or she is taking high doses of the drug. This makes the side effects severe in patients who are taking the drug for alcohol withdrawal. This also makes operating machinery and driving pretty dangerous, so patients should avoid them during the drug course and at least three days after stopping the drug. Rarely excitation and aggression can occur (paradoxical excitation). Confusion and ataxia (loss of full control of bodily movements) is also common. This usually manifest as a tremor when patient tries to move. Confusion and ataxia is common in elderly patients. It can also cause amnesia. Muscle weakness is also common. If the patient continues to take the drug for a longer period, then patient can become dependant on the drug. That means having withdrawal symptoms after stopping the drug. But abuse potential is lower with Librium. Occasionally patients can complain headache. This can be controlled by taking over the counter pain killers such as acetaminophen. Vertigo is another symptom that can occur occasionally. Sometimes faintish ness can occur due to low blood pressure (Hypotension), which is a side effect of Librium. Some patients will have gastro intestinal disturbances like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. But they are common to most of the drugs. Some patients will have visual hallucinations, illusions and various other visual disturbances but they are very uncommon. Rarely patients can develop urinary incontinence or urinary retention. Also rarely blood disorders like reduced white cell counts can occur. It should be used cautiously in a patient with liver failure. Also there are harmful interactions with other central nervous system depressants like opiates. Pregnancy When using the drug regularly during pregnancy, it can cause neonatal withdrawal symptoms, neonatal hypothermia, neonatal hypotonia and neonatal respiratory depression. But it can be used if the risk of not using is higher than the side effects. So the decision is in your doctor’s hand. Breast feeding It’s present in breast milk. So avoid if possible. Very Important! Do not stop taking the drug without consulting your physician. Written by njmanura Dr. Manura Nanayakkara is a Qualified medical professional working in Sri Lanka.
