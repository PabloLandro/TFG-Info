In: Statistics, Alternative Treatments for Conditions or Diseases. Answer. Here is a brief review of some
         of the research evidence on the effectiveness of hypnosis: 90.6% Success Rate for Smoking Cessation Using Hypnosis. Of 43 consecutive
         patients undergoing this treatment protocol, 39 reported remaining abstinent from tobacco use at follow-up (6 months to 3
         years post-treatment). This represents a 90.6% success rate using hypnosis. University of Washington School of Medicine, Depts. of Anesthesiology and Rehabilitation Medicine, Int J Clin Exp Hypn.

Hypnosis Most Effective Says Largest Study Ever: 3 Times as Effective as Patch and 15 Times as Effective as Willpower. Hypnosis is the most effective way of giving up smoking, according to the largest ever scientific
         comparison of ways of breaking the habit. A meta-analysis, statistically combining results of more than 600 studies of 72,000
         people from America and Europe to compare various methods of quitting. On average, hypnosis was over three times as effective
         as nicotine replacement methods and 15 times as effective as trying to quit alone. University of Iowa, Journal of Applied Psychology, How One
         in Five Give Up Smoking. October 1992. (Also New
         Scientist, October 10, 1992.) Hypnosis Over
         30 Times as Effective for Weight Loss. Investigated the effects of hypnosis in weight loss for 60 females, at least 20% overweight. Treatment
         included group hypnosis with metaphors for ego-strengthening, decision making and motivation, ideomotor exploration in individual
         hypnosis, and group hypnosis with maintenance suggestions. Hypnosis was more effective than a control group: an average of
         17 lbs lost by the hypnosis group vs. an average of 0.5 lbs lost by the control group, on follow-up. Cochrane, Gordon; Friesen, J. (1986). Hypnotherapy in weight loss treatment. Journal of Consulting
         and Clinical Psychology, 54, 489-492. Two Years Later: Hypnosis Subjects Continued To Lose Significant Weight. 109 people completed a behavioral treatment for weight management either with or without the
         addition of hypnosis. At the end of the 9-week program, both interventions resulted in significant weight reduction. At 8-month
         and 2-year follow-ups, the hypnosis subjects were found to have continued to lose significant weight, while those in the behavioral-treatment-only
         group showed little further change. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (1985) Hypnosis Subjects Lost
         More Weight Than 90% of Others and Kept it Off. Researchers analyzed 18 studies comparing a cognitive behavioral therapy such as relaxation training,
         guided imagery, self monitoring, or goal setting with the same therapy supplemented by hypnosis. Those who received the hypnosis lost more weight than 90 percent of those not receiving hypnosis
         and maintained the weight loss two years after treatment ended. University of Connecticut, Storrs Allison DB, Faith MS. Hypnosis as an adjunct to cognitive-behavioral
         psychotherapy for obesity: a meta-analytic reappraisal. J Consult Clin Psychol. 1996;64(3):513-516. Hypnosis More Than Doubled
         Average Weight Loss. Study of the effect of adding hypnosis to cognitive-behavioral treatments for weight reduction,
         additional data were obtained from authors of two studies. Analyses indicated that the benefits of hypnosis increased substantially
         over time. Kirsch, Irving (1996). Hypnotic enhancement of cognitive-behavioral weight loss treatments--Another
         meta-reanalysis. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 64 (3), 517-519. Hypnosis Showed Significantly Lower Post-Treatment Weights. Two studies compared overweight smoking and non-smoking adult women in an hypnosis-based, weight-loss
         program. Both achieved significant weight losses and decreases in Body Mass Index. Follow-up study replicated significant
         weight losses and declines in Body Mass Index. The overt aversion and hypnosis program yielded significantly lower post-treatment
         weights and a greater average number of pounds lost. Weight loss

         7LJ, UK Hypnosis can more than
         double the effects of traditional weight loss approaches. An analysis of five weight loss studies reported in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology
         in 1996 showed that the "… weight loss reported in the five studies indicates that hypnosis can more than double
         the effects" of traditional weight loss approaches. University of Connecticut, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology in 1996 (Vol. 64, No.
         3, pgs 517-519). Weight loss
         is greater where hypnosis is utilized. Research into cognitive-behavioral
         weight loss treatments established that weight loss is greater where hypnosis is utilized. It was also established that the
         benefits of hypnosis increase over time. Journal of Consulting and
         Clinical Psychology (1996) Showed Hypnosis As "An Effective Way To Lose Weight." A study of 60 females who were at least 20% overweight and not involved in other treatment showed
         hypnosis is an effective way to lose weight. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (1986). Hypnosis Reduces Frequency and Intensity of Migraine. Compared the treatment of
         migraine by hypnosis and autohypnosis with the treatment of migraine by the drug prochlorperazine (Stemetil). Results show
         that the number of attacks and the number of people who suffered blinding attacks were significantly lower for the group receiving
         hypnotherapy than for the group receiving prochlorperazine. For the group on hypnotherapy, these two measures were significantly
         lower when on hypnotherapy than when on the previous treatment. It is concluded that further trials of hypnotherapy are justified
         against some other treatment not solely associated with the ingestion of tablets. Anderson JA, Basker MA, Dalton R, Migraine and hypnotherapy, International Journal of Clinical & Experimental Hypnosis
         1975; 23(1): 48-58. Hypnosis Reduces Pain and Speeds up Recovery from Surgery. Since 1992, we have used hypnosis routinely in more than 1400 patients undergoing surgery. We found
         that hypnosis used with patients as an adjunct to conscious sedation and local anesthesia was associated with improved intraoperative
         patient comfort, and with reduced anxiety, pain, intraoperative requirements for anxiolytic and analgesic drugs, optimal surgical
         conditions and a faster recovery of the patient. We reported our clinical experience and our fundamental research. [Hypnosis and its application in surgery] Faymonville ME, Defechereux T, Joris J, Adant JP, Hamoir

         that application of hypnotic analgesia reduced report of pain intensity significantly more than report of pain unpleasantness. Dahlgren LA, Kurtz RM, Strube MJ, Malone MD, Differential effects of hypnotic suggestion on multiple
         dimensions of pain. Journal of Pain & Symptom Management. 1995; 10(6): 464-70. Hypnosis Reduces
         Pain of Headaches and Anxiety. The improvement was confirmed by the subjective evaluation data gathered with the use of a questionnaire
         and by a significant reduction in anxiety scores. Melis PM, Rooimans W, Spierings EL, Hoogduin CA, Treatment of chronic tension-type headache with
         hypnotherapy: a single-blind time controlled study. Headache 1991; 31(10): 686-9. Hypnosis Lowered Post-treatment Pain in Burn Injuries. Patients in the hypnosis group reported less post treatment pain than did patients in the control
         group. The findings are used to replicate earlier studies of burn pain hypnoanalgesia, explain discrepancies in the literature,
         and highlight the potential importance of motivation with this population. Patterson DR, Ptacek JT, Baseline pain as a moderator of hypnotic
         analgesia for burn injury treatment. Journal of Consulting & Clinical Psychology 1997; 65(1): 60-7. Hypnosis Lowered Phantom Limb Pain. Hypnotic procedures appear to be a useful adjunct to established strategies for the treatment of
         phantom limb pain and would repay further, more systematic, investigation. Suggestions are provided as to the factors which
         should be considered for a more systematic research program. Treatment of phantom limb pain using hypnotic imagery. Oakley DA, Whitman LG, Halligan PW, Department
         of Psychology, University College, London, UK. Hypnosis Has a Reliable and Significant Impact on Acute and Chronic Pain. Hypnosis has been demonstrated to reduce analogue pain, and studies on the mechanisms of laboratory
         pain reduction have provided useful applications to clinical populations. Studies showing central nervous system activity
         during hypnotic procedures offer preliminary information concerning possible physiological mechanisms of hypnotic analgesia.
         Randomized controlled studies with clinical populations indicate that hypnosis has a reliable and significant impact on acute
         procedural pain and chronic pain conditions. Methodological issues of this body of research are discussed, as are methods
         to better integrate hypnosis into comprehensive pain treatment. Hypnosis
         and clinical pain. Patterson DR, Jensen MP, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine,
         Seattle, WA USA 98104 Psychol Bull. 2003 Jul;129(4):495-521. Hypnosis is a Powerful
         Tool in Pain Therapy and is Biological in Addiction to Psychological. Attempting to elucidate cerebral mechanisms behind hypnotic analgesia,
         we measured regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography in patients with fibromyalgia, during hypnotically-induced
         analgesia and resting wakefulness. The patients experienced less pain during hypnosis than at rest. The cerebral blood-flow
         was bilaterally increased in the orbitofrontal and subcallosial cingulate cortices, the right thalamus, and the left inferior
         parietal cortex, and was decreased bilaterally in the cingulate cortex. The observed blood-flow pattern supports notions of
         a multifactorial nature of hypnotic analgesia, with an interplay between cortical and subcortical brain dynamics. Copyright

            grateful for small mercies." "Control of the future has proved to be an elusive possibility." "One of the most useless endeavors in this life is that of expecting
            people, including our parents, to not be who and what they are, or to be who and what they are not. .  I know,
            I did it all my life!" “Authentic love of humanity, authentic love of truth and beauty, being the ground of authenticity
            in general, are the first rungs on the ladder of rising consciousness, guiding the development of an evolving creative mind;
            while comprising most of the middle and final rungs too!” "The pursuit of truth is a parent to authenticity, just as authenticity
            leads to the pursuit of truth.  Original creativity is both the step-child and step-parent of both. This is applies to
