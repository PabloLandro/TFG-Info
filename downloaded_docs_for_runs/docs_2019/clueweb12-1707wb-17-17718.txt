If you are not used to a good work out, it can be a huge challenge to overcome. However, exercise doesn't have to be vigorous, awkward or boring. There are tons ofÂ  great techniques, tools, resources and options for you to develop a strong back and avoid horrible and unbearable back pains. Prevention is always more beneficial and cheaper than cures.Here are some great lower back exercises and back pain prevention tips to help you strengthen your back: Prevent Lower Back Pain By Practicing Good Habits Sleeping - When sleeping the best position for your back is to
 sleep on your side with your knees bent. This position will put the
least amount of pressure on your back. You can also place a pillow
between your knees to take more pressure off your back. However, if you
sleep on your back, place pillows under your legs to elevate the lower
part of your legs. This will also help decrease the pressure on your
back. Moreover, using the right pillow can also help prevent back pain. Look for a pillow that has ergonomic properties, one that contours your neck is ideal. Click here for more information! Using your computer or sitting at a desk - If you sit for an
extensive amount of time it's important to stretch every 20-30 minutes.
This will help alleviate or prevent disc pressure. Every 20-30 minutes
stand tall, do a little back massage (refer to the lower back pain relief page under massage), arch your back and most importantly don't forget to
breath. It's important to breath deep and controlled. When sitting there
 are a few things you should always practice. First, make sure you are
sitting on a comfortable chair. Your chair should be at a comfortable
height where your thighs are parallel to the ground. Lumbar support is
very important, you can purchase this separately ( look for lumbar support in the amazon widget in the upper right gray panel) or get it built in the chair. Finally, your posture is also very
important. Do not slouch! Keep your back straight, your head, ears,
shoulders and hips should all be aligned. Remember to keep your
shoulders below and behind your neck. When using a computer your arms
should be almost parallel to ground and your posture straight. Tip: a
footrest can help take the stress off your back. Lifting, Pulling and Pushing - Never lift with your legs
straight and your back curved. The proper way to lift an object is by
bending your legs with your back and neck straight. When pushing and
pulling an object keep your neck and back aligned, do not look down. Standing - Standing is just as important as sitting and sleeping. If you do stand or walk in an upright position you may experience back pain in the long run. When you're standing it's important to keep your back straight, shoulders down and behind your neck and chin up. You can also practice keeping a good posture by standing an inch from a wall and leaning on the wall or walking with books on your head.
