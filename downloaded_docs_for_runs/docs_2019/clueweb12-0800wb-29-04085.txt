Severe back pain treatment can be substantially different than treating mild type of back pain, so it’s important to know how to treat your back pain if it should become severe. The first thing you want to do is have your health professional assess your severe back pain so that you can begin the proper treatment.  Many times, severe back pain can be treated at home, but sometimes the pain can become so chronic that you need to get a prescription pain medication and sometimes muscle relaxers are in order to help you deal with the pain. If you feel that your back pain can be treated at home, even though it is severe, you will want to first take some ibuprofen and stop any sort of activity that can cause your pain to become more severe.  Ibuprofen is one of the many types of pain relievers that helps to relieve inflammation and stop pain, so your pain reliever is doing double duty.  Also, for the short term, you may find that you are able to take more of this type of pain reliever than you would with others.  Talk to your medical professional to see how much of this type of pain reliever is safe for you to use before you begin treating your back pain yourself. Then next thing you need to do is apply heat to the area that hurts for a while.  Often, the heat which you apply will aid in severe back pain treatment by easing the tension in the back muscles.  You can do this with a hot shower, bath or a heating pad.  Use heat for not more than 20 minutes at a time, though, because too much heat can cause your pain to become worse. After you use heat to treat your severe back pain and loosen up the muscles in the back, you need to apply ice for about 20 minutes to ease the swelling in the painful area.  By alternating heat and ice, you are effectively reducing tension in pulled and strained muscles while keeping swelling at bay, which can increase the amount of pain you feel. In time, massaging the painful area can be another effective way to treat severe back pain and help the back to heal up.  Also, once the worst of the back pain has faded, it’s a good idea to begin gentle stretches on your back so that you can work to completely heal your back pain for good.  Also, when your severe back pain is gone, you should begin back pain exercises which will help to strengthen the muscles and prevent future injuries.
