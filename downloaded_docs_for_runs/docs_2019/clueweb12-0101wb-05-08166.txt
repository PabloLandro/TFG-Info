        Weight Loss Adjustable Gastric Banding In this bariatric operation, a small pouch is created in the upper part 
        of the stomach by wrapping an adjustable band around the stomach about 
        20 mm below the gastro-esophageal junction, leaving only a narrow passageway 
        (stoma) from the newly created pouch into the larger lower section of 
        the stomach. Due to the greatly reduced capacity of the pouch, patients 
        experience a rapid sense of fullness and stop eating. If patients continue 
        to eat, they develop nausea, vomiting, or pain, which naturally constrains 
        further eating. Band is Easily Adjusted On the inner lining of the band there is a longitudinal balloon (like 
        a bicycle tyre). This balloon is connected to a small tube attached to 
        a subcutaneous port. The balloon is empty at time of surgery but afterwards 
        is filled with saline fluid by injection through the subcutaneous port. 
        By increasing the fluid content of the band/balloon, the opening in the 
        stomach may at any time be widened or narrowed. Basic Digestive System Untouched A major advantage of gastric banding surgery is that the stomach anatomy 
        is left untouched. There are no incisions, scars, or any gastric stapling, 
        and thus fewer side-effects or complications like anastomotic leakage, 
        infection etc. It is the simplest type of weight loss surgery and can 
        easily be adjusted or even reversed. Types of Adjustable Gastric Bands There are three main types of bands in the adjustable gastric banding 
        market. The Lapband, (LAP-BAND) manufactured by Bioenterics Corp, USA; 
        the Swedish Adjustable Band manufactured by Obtech Medical AG of Switzerland; 
        and the Midband, manufactured by Medical Innovation Developpement in Lyon, 
        France. Laparoscopic or Open Gastric Banding Laparoscopy, the use of instruments connected to video monitors permitting 
        the bariatric surgeon to see inside the operation-site, is becoming more 
        widespread in the performance of adjustable gastric banding. Early results 
        seem to suggest that laparoscope-assisted banding is as effective as the 
        traditional open surgical technique, with fewer complications. However, 
        laparoscopic surgery is more demanding on the weight loss surgeon whose 
        results typically improve quite noticeably with experience. Weight Loss After Adjustable Gastric Banding Patients may lose 60-75 percent of their excess weight within 18 months 
        of surgery, although it is unclear whether this level of weight loss is 
        sustainable in the long term, as weight regain is common. Much depends 
        on the degree of post-operative complications and patient-compliance with 
        dietary guidelines. See also: Lap Band Procedure Lap-Band Benefits & Risks Operation Diagram Post-Operative Follow-Up Gastric Banding Vertical Banded Gastroplasty

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
