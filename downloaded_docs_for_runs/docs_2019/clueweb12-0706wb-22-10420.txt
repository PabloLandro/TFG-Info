        & Children Doctors are alarmed at how fast America's 
        children are getting fat and obese. The number of overweight adolescents 
        has tripled since the 1980s. Today, 15 percent of adolescents are overweight. This contributes to a number of health 
              problems, including diabetes, sleep apnea, orthopedic deformities 
              as well as social problems. A bariatric surgery operation costs 
              about $25,000. Some insurance companies don't cover it because they 
              consider it a cosmetic procedure; plus, the Food and Drug Administration 
              has not approved the surgery for minors, making it even harder to 
              get reimbursed. Still, more and more people are turning 
              to bariatric surgery. In 1992, there were 16,200 bariatric surgeries, 
        according to the American Society for Bariatric Surgery. Last year, there 
        were 63,100 operations and the count is expected to reach 100,000 this 
        year. The figures only include operations performed by the society's members 
        and it's unclear how many of the surgeries were done on minors. Weight
