Trigger Finger is usually caused by excessive repetition of a single movement. Over time, repeated motion can reduce circulation to the area and lead to tiny tears in the tendon. These tears then swell up and become inflamed and irritated. In the early stages, rest itself can alleviate the symptoms. In more stubborn cases, acupuncture needles are placed near the injury. The needles stimulates the qi and blood so that blood can flow more smoothly through the injured area. As the injury begins to heal the congestion is reduced, further speeding up healing. I would suggest four to eight treatments in moderate cases, and ten to twelve treatments in more severe conditions.
