Privacy policy Loading "Take Control Of Your Health.....Naturally" Remedies for Coughs A cough is the body's response to inflammation or irritation in the throat, larynx, bronchial tubes or lungs. There are two basic kinds of coughs, congested and dry, with each one having different underlying causes. See also: Remedies For Laryngitis Ways to relieve Coughs Put a few drops of the oil of eucalyptus in a vaporizer and breathe in the steam. The moist air will soothe the airways and loosen sinus congestion and phlegm in your throat and lungs. Place hot packs on your chest and throat this is can be very soothing. Raise your head in bed by placing firm pillows under head. This will allow mucus to drain easier. Always drink alot of water for better health. Dairy products, fried foods and meat promote mucus build-up so avoid these products. To open and moisten the airways drink hot tea. (I like to add a little honey). To help loosen mucus try eating spicy foods. Don't use over the counter cough medicines because they suppress symptoms. The purpose of coughing is to eliminate congestion and taking suppressants defeats the purpose. If you smoke, STOP, for obvious reasons.

Garlic: Make a mixture of a garlic glove with a tablespoon of honey and lemon juice. The combination can open up sinus passages and breaks up phlegm. Grape Juice: Combine a cup of grape juice and a teaspoon of honey. Enjoy! Aloe vera: To alleviate a scratchy cough mix equal parts of aloe juice and honey. Cayenne pepper: To clear congestion and fight infection try mixing 1/2 teaspoon of pepper in a glass of water and use as a gargle, swallowing afterward. Carrot juice: Concoct a mixture of honey and a little warm water and take a tablespoonful a few times during the day. Spinach juice: To help eliminate dry cough gargle with warm spinach juice. Tea: Peppermint or rosemary tea will help break-up congestion although any tea will help. Horehound lozenges: These worked for me when I was a kid, I still like them. Honey: To soothe the throat add a tablespoon of honey to a glass of boiling water and sip cautiously. Holy basil: Holy basil is used to beat stress, overcome whooping cough, colds and respiratory infection.It is also good for those people who have kidney stone cough. Best taken in supplement form. Vicks; Folk Remedy: Generously apply vicks to your feet... put on socks... within an hour your annoying cough will be greatly reduced. Folk Remedy: This sounds really stupid, but it actually works, and you don't even need anything for it. If you can't stop coughing, raise your arm up higher than your head. Just one--I don't know if two work or not. This has worked for everyone we have ever suggested it to! Peanutbutter: For a cough. Try a tablespoon of peanutbutter. It helped me in the middle of the night. Folk Remedy: Whenever somebody is coughing non stop. Mix 1 T.S of honey and 1/2 T.S of cinnamon powder in half a glass of tolerable hot water and make the patient drink. This will give a quick relief from coughing. Dark Chocolate: About 2 ounces of dark chocolate contains 1000mg of Theobromine. Studies have indicated that theobromine is about 33% more effective than codeine. (1 ounce should be adequate for small children) Turmeric powder Add one generous teaspoon of turmeric powder into a cup of boiled milk and stir. Drink it hot twice a day. Works just like antibiotic. Folk Remedy: 1 tsp of corn syrup will soothe the throat. "A-B-C" method: Fish-liver-oil vitamin A together with crystalline powdered vitamin C -- quick cessation of coughing. Then "B" yourself --- natural vitamin B-Rich Foods and avoidance of B-Robbing Foods.
