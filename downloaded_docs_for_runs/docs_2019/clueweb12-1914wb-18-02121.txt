<< Prev page I first heard about Wound Honey on National Public Radio in a segment about a woman whose foot had a non-healing ulcer despite 3 months of conventional treatment. The next option was going to be amputation, when her doctor decided to try Active Manuka Honey as a last-ditch effort to save her foot. In 4 days, she improved 70-80% and the swelling was reduced by 50%. In less than 3 weeks, her wound was completely healed and the infection was gone. Read more ... Since then, the doctor has discovered for himself the remarkable healing attributes of Wound Honey and has developed a salve containing New Zealand Active Manuka Honey (which has been clinically proven to have activity against bacteria, including the superbug MRSA [Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus]), Aloe Vera, and Panthenol (vitamin B). It can be used on a wide variety of wounds, from burns, cuts, abrasions, paper cuts, and infected diabetic ulcers to bed and pressure sores. It is helpful for eczema and cracked heels, too. It has also been effective with scars (including cosmetic surgery) and non-healing scars. Virtually any wound, sore, or rash that might need a salve or a cream can be treated with Wound Honey. Remember to cover with a bandage or non-stick dressing, though, as it's as sticky as you'd expect any honey to be! (Do not use if allergic to bee venom or bee products.
