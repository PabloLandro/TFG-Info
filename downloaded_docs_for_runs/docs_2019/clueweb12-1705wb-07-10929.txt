He suffered injuries to his low-back discs and sacroiliac joint. Fortunately, Dr. Indelicato healed and was able to continue running, biking and swimming, but for years his injuries lingered making vigorous training uncomfortable and sometimes unbearable. It wasn’t until Dr. Indelicato tried the “Serola Sacroiliac Belt” that he was able to fully enjoy exercising again and run for prolonged periods of time. Last December, Dr. Indelicato turned 50-years-old and his personal goal was to run 50 miles in less than one week. Because of the Serola Sacroiliac Belt, he was able to accomplish his goal in just 4 days! Dr. Indelicato advocates the Serola Sacroiliac Belt to a wide variety of patients like athletes, chronic pain patients and patients with specific injuries to their sacroiliac joints.

Sciatic nerve neuralgia is considered to be one of the most difficult abnormalities of the support and movement system. Clinical expressions of sciatic nerve neuralgia include sharp pain irradiating to the lower extremities which increases during any of the patient’s attempts to move and of course limited range of motion on all axes and planes. Usually, when a patient appears at the doctor’s office with such a difficult clinical picture, in addition to prescribing painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or utilizing injections, the doctor will usually refer the patient for radiological examination. Today, the most common radiological examinations are the MRI and/or CT scan. In many cases, MRI test detects bulging and/or herniation of discs. If symptoms are not alleviated in a period of a few weeks due to conservative methods of treatments (above mentioned oral or injected medication) consideration will be given to surgical intervention. The problem is that in many cases, this difficult neurological picture is not the result of the disc herniation, but is actually the result of piriformis muscle syndrome that being muscular treatment could be successfully treated by massage, post isometric techniques, cold and hot applications. Reoccurrence of the painful symptoms must be prevented by special rehabilitative exercises.

Question by G : How to choose a proper LS belt for low back pain? I have chronic low back pain. On consulting with my physiotherpist, he suggested to wear a LS belt with metallic strip. My focus is to keep my spine erect with in the right shape of ‘S’.I mean the belt should keep my low back at natural curved posture. plz help me asap!! Best answer: Answer by mr.answerman One word of caution about wearing low back supports. It is well known that if you wear this support to frequently it will weaken you back. That is because it as it relieves your low back pain, the support will act as your back muscles and the muscles in your back will become weaker. You can take this info to the bank. If you wear a support it should be worn only during the times when you are active and doing something that you could not do without it, and then simply take it off. Failure to do this will really mess you up. Give your answer to this question below! 2 comments - What do you think? Posted by					douglas1940										 -
