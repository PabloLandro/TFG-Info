<0.001). The rate of symptomatic UTI was also 33-fold lower in this group of 30 patients while colonized with E. coli 83972 than in the well-matched group of 14 patients who were not successfully colonized [mean 0.06 versus 1.80 episodes of symptomatic UTI/patient-year, P <0.001).Conclusions. The results of this pilot study indicate that bacterial interference using E. coli 83972 may be safe and effective in preventing UTI. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?db=m&form=6&dopt=r&uid=11549475> Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas, USA marmalady 09-22-2001, 10:29 AM I must say I shuddered when I read about introducing E. coli into a body! My son was recently put on a Renacidin (sp) irrigation twice a day for the main purpose of trying to prevent bladder 'grit' and stones which he had at an alarming rate (i.e. cystos once a month, and sometimes cath changes 2-3 times a week!); the Renacidin is working beautifully in preventing stone formation, but an added side effect we have all noticed is that he has had NO UTI's since we started the irrigations!  We're doing the irrigations twice a day at 30 cc. per dose, and he's getting his magnesium levels, etc., monitored periodically.   http://sci.rutgers.edu/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif Wise Young 09-23-2001, 01:49 PM I was really struck by the incredible success rate of this study.  Even though the number of patients is small (30 patients) and the investigators called with a "pilot study", it would seem to me that a 63-fold reduction in the rate of symptomatic infection is stunning. Marmalady, stones themselves harbor bacteria and provide a nidus of infection.  However, the same principles may succeed in colonizing the stones and "grit" with non-pathogenic bacteria. Wise.
