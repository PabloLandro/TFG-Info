Spinal decompression is a drug-free treatment available for treating a wide array of back disorders. If you are tired of surgical processes, this technique can provide you with complete relief. The treatment requires no complicated or risky surgical process and is totally safe. The method was developed from years of research and is ideal for long term relief from pain. Until recently, patients with back pain were usually given drugs with possible side-effects, referred to physical therapists, or sent for surgery. The structure of our back is comprised of spinal bones (vertebrae), their joints, discs between vertebras, and the muscles and ligaments which bind all the parts together. The discs which act as a cushion between the vertebrae can get damaged and the gelatinous material inside can leak, leading to herniated disc which is the cause of pain. These types of back pains can be treated with modern decompression techniques including Decompression Therapy System (DTS), VAX-D, ABS systems, DRX-3000, DRX9000, and the Accu-Spina System. Spinal compression is the common cause for neck and back pain. Spinal decompression therapy causes the expansion of disc herniations, which are the cause for the pressure exerted on nearby spinal nerve roots. Decompression technique works by taking away pressure from damaged discs so that the bulging will shrink back to its original size and thus protect the surrounding discs from getting damaged. The treatment has also proved to be successful in treating spinal stenosis, sciatica, pinched nerve, facet syndrome, low back disc bulge, golf related pain, and degenerative disc disease. The spinal decompression treatment normally takes about 6-8 weeks. It can be followed by neuromuscular, cardiovascular and diet therapy for even greater results. All treatment methods are affordable and are designed to alleviate all types of back pain. The treatment procedure is effective and results can be seen within the initial weeks of the treatment.
