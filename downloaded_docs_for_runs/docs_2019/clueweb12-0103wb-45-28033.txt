        a Weight Loss Surgeon Bariatric Surgery Advice If you are severely obese 
      and want to find a board certified weight loss surgeon located in Maine, 
      see below. There are two main types of bariatric 
      weight loss surgery - banding like Lap Band, and bypass like roux-en-y. 
      Whichever you choose, be guided by your physician. Good luck in your search 
      for an obesity clinic in the Maine area.

Laparoscopic (or open) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 2. Percutaneous Vertical-Banded Gastroplasty Reversal Laparoscopic (or open) Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass The operation involves extensive re-routing of the food flow through your 
        stomach and upper intestine in such a way that your appetite will be diminished, 
        and less of what you eat will be absorbed. This combination of effects 
        is what allows a motivated patient to maintain substantial weight loss 
        on a long-term basis. Be prepared to spend 2-3 nights in the hospital, 
        although this will vary according to how quickly you progress after surgery. Percutaneous Vertical-Banded Gastroplasty Reversal I will be reversing your vertical-banded gastroplasty (gastroplasty, VBG, 
        stomach stapling) using upper endoscopy and one or a few small puncture 
        wounds on your abdomen. This involves cutting the plastic ring narrowing 
        the outlet of your stomach pouch. The operation should allow you to eat 
        more normally without vomiting and improve (although not necessarily eliminate) 
        acid reflux. I'll leave a small tube in your stomach but will remove it 
        in the office during your follow-up appointment in 3-4 weeks. Be prepared 
        to spend one night in the hospital, although you might not need to, depending 
        on how you feel after surgery. Weight

  such as gastric banding or bypass is not an easy solution to morbid obesity 
  and weight loss. It is a serious surgical procedure, involving health risks. 
  To produce lasting weight loss it requires a long-term patient commitment to 
  eating a healthy diet and following a regular program of physical exercise. 
  Life-long use of nutritional supplements may also be necessary. So, before deciding, 
  discuss your options fully with your doctor. Â© 2003-2008 Bariatric-Surgery.I
