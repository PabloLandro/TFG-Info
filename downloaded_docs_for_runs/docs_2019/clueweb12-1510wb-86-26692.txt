Back and Chest Pain Back and Chest Pain “…Renegade  Doctor Reveals How To Cure Your Back Pain Permanently In 7 Days or Less …Using  Secret Techniques Chiropractors Don’t Want You To Know…” Click Above  NOW Back pain can have many causes.  If the pain  is not too severe then we do feel as though it is not any kind of an  emergency.  However, it is very different if we feel pain in the  chest.  This is because most of us have been educated regarding heart  disease.  When we feel the slightest twinge of anything remotely like pain  in the chest we suspect heart trouble.  We all know that if the pain  extends from the chest down the left arm we need to get to a doctor or hospital  as soon as possible.  It would be most unwise to ignore this kind of  pain. We most certainly do take back pain seriously if  the pain is bad.  If it is sudden and sharp it could prevent us from being  mobile.  Of course, if we are unable to move it can be rather distressing.   In such a case, medical attention is needed and immediately.  Such pain  could be caused by an injury or it could be a slipped disc.  Back pain can  also be a dull ache or it can be very intense. We have all heard about the stories regarding  people who had chest pains and rushed off to the doctor, only to be told that  it was not a heart attack but a bad case of gas.  It is not that easy to  tell if the pain is being caused by something benign or serious.  The best  advice is to have it checked out.  Any medical professional will tell you  that it is far better to be safe than sorry. It is not difficult to understand why back and  chest pain could be closely linked.  If you consider the physiology of the  human upper back, it is really one with the chest.  If you think about it  like this then it can be understood why, at times, pain can be felt in the back  and the chest at the same time.  Pain in this area need not be due to a  heart problem.  There are many muscles in the back and chest area.   Pain will be felt if any of these muscles have been overworked or  injured.  The only way to get rid of muscular pain is to get sufficient  rest and if really bad a doctor can prescribe an inflammatory. Another common cause of back and chest pain is brought  on by colds and flu.  This is especially so if the lungs are  affected.  The inflammation will be painful and at times it can be felt in  both the chest and the upper back.  Inflammation of the lungs can cause a  great deal of coughing in order to get rid of any mucous.  It is possible  to cough so much and for so long that our muscles are strained every time we  cough.  Such coughing spasms must be treated by a doctor with the right  medication.  Once the coughing is eased our muscles can rest and  heal.  The right medication will also clear up our lungs and put a stop to  the back and chest pain we experienced.
