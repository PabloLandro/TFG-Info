Items of Interest « HOLIDAY SCHEDULE | Main | ANTIBIOTICS DON'T CURE SINUS » HONEY CALMS CHILDREN'S COUGH A teaspoon of  honey before bed seems to calm children?s coughs and help them sleep better, according to a new study that appears in December?s Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. The folk remedy did better than cough medicine or no treatment in a three-way comparison. Note: Honey should not be given to children under age one because of a rare but serious risk of botulism. There are also many other natural and effective ways to help someone with a cough- my treatments, herbal remedies and homeopathic remedies, to name a few.  Decreasing the coughing and increasing the sleep helps everyone in the family! ~Susan Posted b
