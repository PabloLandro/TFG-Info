Acupuncture for Fatigue | Acupuncture & Massage Blog Acupuncture & Massage Blog Skip to content Home About Subscribe ← Nutrition for Health Acupuncture for Allergies → Acupuncture for Fatigue Posted on January 26, 2008 by Dr. Richard Browne Many symptoms of fatigue respond to acupuncture for fatigue therapy. Acupuncture for fatigue can strengthen a weakened immune system, enhance vital energy, increase lymph circulation, and nourish blood. Acupuncture for fatigue may be utilized as a stand-alone therapy or may be integrated into allopathic treatment for individuals with fatigue. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) uses a combination of acupuncture for fatigue, moxibustion, Chinese herbal medicine, and lifestyle changes to treat fatigue. A series of weekly treatments for four to six weeks is recommended followed by progress assessment, to reduce fatigue levels and increase functional capacity. Various malfunctions in the endocrine, cardiovascular and digestive body systems that may cause fatigue are treatable with acupuncture for fatigue. Acupuncture points chosen during acupuncture for fatigue treatment address the root of the problem, such as qi deficiency, while other selected points reduce occurrence of specific symptoms, such as headache. Your acupuncture physician may recommend an additional series of acupuncture for fatigue treatments to normalize and balance the immune system in cases of chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is the current name for a disorder characterized by debilitating fatigue and a variety of associated physical, constitutional and neuropsychological complaints. Because there is no known cure, there is no defined therapy for generalized and chronic fatigue. Allopathic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines and decongestants can reduce the symptoms of fatigue, including diffuse pain and feverishness. Acupuncture for fatigue can work in conjunction with allopathic medications by improving mood and stabilizing disordered sleep cycles. Acupuncture for fatigue utilizes moxibustion to stimulate affected organs from their depleted state while increasing vitality. Acupuncture for fatigue can also treat many of the root origins of fatigue, including stress, insomnia and depression.

This is my last year of the course acupuncture and I have to do thesis for my graduation. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a very interesting case for my thesis. So the subject in CFS is to compare acupuncture with herbalism. I was searching the net for some cases of CFS treat with herbalism and / or acupuncture. I was wonder if you have articles of patient published of the subject CFS in TCM. If you have any time left mailing me, I would be very happy. Any support is useful.
