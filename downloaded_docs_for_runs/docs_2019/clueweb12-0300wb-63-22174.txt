For programs, the objective of targeting is to provide sealants to the largest possible number of children at higher risk for dental caries. Making a program more efficient results in more children receiving sealants each day, which in turn leads to completing a school in fewer days and serving more schools during a school year. Quality assessment for programs is the process of evaluating them to ensure that they are meeting the goal of efficiently applying high-quality sealants to the teeth of children at higher risk for dental caries. When designing a program, it is important to know about requirements specified in the state’s dental practice act and rules and regulations. A large proportion of children at schools with sealant programs are expected to be Medicaid beneficiaries. ODH sets requirements and monitors the compliance of the programs it funds. ODH conducts both comprehensive and focused site reviews. BACK TAKE POST-TEST © 2009 NationalMaternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center and Ohio Department of Health
