                        Human Nutrition Research Center, Bldg. 307, Rm. 224, Beltsville, MD 20705. E-mail: Anderson{at}307.bhnrc.usda.gov Abstract OBJECTIVE —The objective of this study was to determine whether cinnamon improves blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL
                     cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —A total of 60 people with type 2 diabetes, 30 men and 30 women aged 52.2 ± 6.32 years, were divided randomly into six groups.
                     Groups 1, 2, and 3 consumed 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon daily, respectively, and groups 4, 5, and 6 were given placebo capsules
                     corresponding to the number of capsules consumed for the three levels of cinnamon. The cinnamon was consumed for 40 days followed
                     by a 20-day washout period. RESULTS —After 40 days, all three levels of cinnamon reduced the mean fasting serum glucose (18–29%), triglyceride (23–30%), LDL cholesterol
                     (7–27%), and total cholesterol (12–26%) levels; no significant changes were noted in the placebo groups. Changes in HDL cholesterol
                     were not significant. CONCLUSIONS —The results of this study demonstrate that intake of 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon per day reduces serum glucose, triglyceride,
                     LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes and suggest that the inclusion of cinnamon in the diet
                     of people with type 2 diabetes will reduce risk factors associated with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
