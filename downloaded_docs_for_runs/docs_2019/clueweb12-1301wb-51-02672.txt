Muscle Cramp-Tension Formula - Night time leg cramps can be frustrating, and make sleeping difficult. Ridding of the day's tension and tight, sore muscles is easy with this safe and effective formula by Pure Encapsulations. Muscle Cramp/Tension Formula offers important electrolytes and herbs to help relax muscle tension from daily stress or exercise and helps to welcome relaxation for a good night's sleep. Muscle Cramp/Tension Formula offers important electrolytes and soothing herbs to help lessen occasional nighttime or exercise-related leg muscle cramps and ease muscle tension while promoting overall relaxation. What Is It? Muscle Cramp/Tension Formula offers important electrolytes
and soothing herbs to help relieve occasional nighttime
leg muscle cramps, minor muscle cramps associated
with athletic activity, and overall muscle tension.* Uses For Muscle/Tension Formula Muscle Cramps and Muscle Tension: The electrolytes
magnesium, calcium and potassium are important for
maintaining healthy muscle contractile function. In several
trials, magnesium supported leg muscle comfort by
helping to lessen occasional nighttime cramping while
relieving occasional sleeplessness. The traditionally
soothing botanicals lemon balm, passion flower and
chamomile also help to relieve occasional muscle tension.
Additionally, these herbal extracts moderate occasional
stress and promote overall relaxation.* What Is The Source? Calcium, magnesium and potassium are derived
from limestone. Citrate is derived from corn dextrose
fermentation. Glycinate is synthetic. Passion flower extract
is derived from Passiflora incarnata L. aerial parts and
standardized to contain 3.5% vitexin. Lemon balm extract
is derived from Melissa officinalis leaf and standardized
to provide 5% rosemarinic acid. Chamomile extract
is derived from Matricaria recutita flowers. Ascorbyl
palmitate is derived from corn dextrose fermentation and
palm oil. Are There Any Potential Side Effects Or
Precautions? Chamomile is not recommended for individuals with
sensitivity to botanicals from the Asteraceae/Compositae
family. In rare cases, passion flower can cause headache,
dizziness, joint pain or ataxia. There is one case report
of ventricular tachycardia following passion flower
administration. If pregnant or lactating, consult your
physician before taking this product. Are There Any Potential Drug Interactions? Chamomile may be contra-indicated with blood thinning
medications. Passionflower may be contra-indicated with
sedative medications. Consult your physician for more
information.
