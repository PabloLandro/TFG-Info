Being aware of gestational diabetes important for pregnant women | The Rwanda Focus Home National Editorial Opinion Business Health Woman Entertainment Features Sport Advertise With Us Contacts Archives Tenders and Jobs Shyaka Kanuma’s Blog Thursday, September 29th, 2011 | Posted by Lulu Jemimah Being aware of gestational diabetes important for pregnant women With many anxieties popping up during pregnancy, expecting women – especially over weight ones – also have to keep an eye out for the possibility of developing gestational diabetes (or gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM). Research, although varying with population studied, has proved that every 3-10% pregnancies are affected by gestational diabetes. (Internet photo) GDM is, according to Dr. J. Bosco Mpatswe Mugabo, a condition in which women without previously diagnosed diabetes exhibit high blood glucose levels during pregnancy, especially around the third trimester. Research, although varying with population studied, has proved that every 3-10% pregnancies are affected by gestational dia­betes. “Gestational diabetes is caused when the body of a pregnant wom­an does not secrete excess insulin required during pregnancy lead­ing to increased blood sugar levels.” he explains. “If a woman gets diabetes while pregnant but never had it before then it’s gestational diabetes.” It may not discriminate, but GDM has classic risk cases like a family history of type 2-diabetes and a maternal age of over 35 years, be­cause women are at a higher risk the older they get. A previous di­agnosis of gestational diabetes or pre-diabetes, as well as a previous pregnancy which resulted in a child with a high birth weight, have also been known to increase the chances of GDM. Statistics have also suggested a double risk of GDM in smokers. GDM poses a risk to mother and child, largely related to high blood glucose levels and its consequences. Women who have had gesta­tional diabetes and children whose mothers had gestational diabetes are at higher lifetime risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. “The child is also at a risk of developing jaundice, as shown by changes in skin and eye color; it may also have Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and could suffer from low mineral levels in the blood which would cause twitching or cramping.” Dr. Mugabo states. “Children whose mothers had GDM have also recorded a higher risk for obesity, abnormal glucose tolerance, and diabetes in the future.” The baby’s body is usually larger than normal (a condition called macrosomia), making it difficult to have a natural birth. The infant could also develop hypoglycaemia or low blood sugar although this can be reversed by breastfeeding immediately or giving the child glucose through a tube directly to his or her blood. It may be possible to prevent type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes. “If you know you want to get pregnant again, have a blood sugar test up to three months before becoming pregnant to make sure your blood sugar level is normal.” Dr. Bosco advises. If kept in check with controlled body sugar, healthy diet, regu­lar exercise, and a maintained healthy weight, it may not affect the health of a baby. For many women the blood sugar levels will usually normalise after birth but a blood test to check your sugar levels is recommended at least two months after the child is born. Gestational diabetes generally resolves once the baby is born. Based on different studies, the chances of developing GDM in a sec­ond pregnancy are between 30 and 84%, depending on ethnic back­ground. A second pregnancy within 1 year of the previous pregnancy on the other hand has a high rate of recurrence. In some cases GDM patients do not suffer any symptoms and when they do they are few and range from increased thirst, increased uri­nation, fatigue, nau­sea, vomiting, blad­der infection, and yeast infections to blurred vision. Any one of these symp­toms (except blurry vision) as explained by Dr. Mugabo, is not out of character with pregnant women. This is the reason GDM is most commonly di­agnosed by screening during pregnancy since a diagnostic test is the most efficient way to de­tect inappropriately high levels of glucose in blood samples. He also advises women to keep track of their blood sugar and keep it under control. They should maintain a healthy diet, watch their weight, con­trol carbohydrates in­take while getting mod­erate physical activities. In some cases, but only with the recommenda­tion of a physician, insu­lin can be taken to help manage diabetes.
