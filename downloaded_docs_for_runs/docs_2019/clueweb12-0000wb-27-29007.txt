Inside this Article Lower Back Pain Health Care and Prevention See all J-L articles Definition Pain felt in your lower back may come from the spine, muscles, nerves, or other structures in that region. It may also radiate from other areas like your mid or upper back, a hernia in the groin, or a problem in the testicles or ovaries. You may feel a variety of symptoms if you've hurt your back. You may have a tingling or burning sensation, a dull aching, or sharp pain. You also may experience weakness in your legs or feet. It won't necessarily be one event that actually causes your pain. You may have been doing many things improperly -- like standing, sitting, or lifting -- for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, like reaching for something in the shower or bending from your waist, leads to the feeling of pain. Images: Lumbar vertebrae Alternative Names Backache; Low back pain; Lumbar pain; Pain - back Considerations If you are like most people, you will have at least one backache in your life. While such pain or discomfort can happen anywhere in your back, the most common area affected is your low back. This is because the low back supports most of your body's weight. Low back pain is the #2 reason that Americans see their doctor -- second only to colds and flus. Many back-related injuries happen at work. But you can change that. There are many things you can do to lower your chances of getting back pain. Most back problems will get better on their own. The key is to know when you need to seek medical help and when self-care measures alone will allow you to get better. Low back pain may be acute (short-term), lasting less than one month, or chronic (long-term, continuous, ongoing), lasting longer than three months. While getting acute back pain more than once is common, continuous long-term pain is not. Common Causes You'll usually first feel back pain just after you lift a heavy object, move suddenly, sit in one position for a long time, or have an injury or accident. But prior to that moment in time, the structures in your back may be losing strength or integrity. The specific structure in your back responsible for your pain is hardly ever identified. Whether identified or not, there are several possible sources of low back pain: Small fractures to the spine from osteoporosis Muscle spasm (very tense muscles that remain contracted) Ruptured or herniated disk Degeneration of the disks Poor alignment of the vertebrae Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) Strain or tears to the muscles or ligaments supporting the back Spine curvatures (like scoliosis or kyphosis ) which may be inherited and seen in children or teens Other medical conditions like fibromyalgia Low back pain from any cause usually involves spasms of the large, supportive muscles alongside the spine. The muscle spasm and stiffness accompanying back pain can feel particularly uncomfortable. You are at particular risk for low back pain if you: Work in construction or another job requiring heavy lifting, lots of bending and twisting, or whole body vibration (like truck driving or using a sandblaster) Have bad posture Are pregnant Are over age 30 Smoke, don't exercise, or are overweight Have arthritis or osteoporosis Have a low pain threshold Feel stressed or depressed Back pain from organs in the pelvis or elsewhere include: Bladder infection Kidney stone Endometriosis Ovarian cancer Ovarian cysts Testicular torsion (twisted testicle) Home Care Many people will feel better within one week after the start of back pain. After another 4-6 weeks, the back pain will likely be completely gone. To get better quickly, take the right steps when you first get pain. A common misconception about back pain is that you need to rest and avoid activity for a long time. In fact, bed rest is NOT recommended . If you have no indication of a serious underlying cause for your back pain (like loss of bowel or bladder control, weakness, weight loss, or fever), then you should reduce physical activity only for the first couple of days. Gradually resume your usual activities after that. Here are some tips for how to handle pain early on: Stop normal physical activity for the first few days. This helps calm your symptoms and reduce inflammation. Apply heat or ice to the painful area. Try ice for the first 48-72 hours, then use heat after that. Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). While sleeping, try lying in a curled-up, fetal position with a pillow between your legs. If you usually sleep on your back, place a pillow or rolled towel under your knees to relieve pressure. Do not perform activities that involve heavy lifting or twisting of your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain begins. After 2-3 weeks, you should gradually resume exercise. Begin with light cardiovascular training. Walking, riding a stationary bicycle, and swimming are great examples. Such aerobic activities can help blood flow to your back and promote healing. They also strengthen muscles in your stomach and back. Stretching and strengthening exercises are important in the long run. However, starting these exercises too soon after an injury can make your pain worse. A physical therapist can help you determine when to begin stretching and strengthening exercises and how to do so. AVOID the following exercises during initial recovery unless your doctor or physical therapist says it is okay: Jogging Football Golf Ballet Weight lifting Leg lifts when lying on your stomach Sit-ups with straight legs (rather than bent knees) Call your health care provider if Call 911 if you have lost bowel or bladder control. Otherwise, call your doctor if you have: Unexplained fever with back pain. Back pain after a severe blow or fall. Redness or swelling on the back or spine. Pain traveling down your legs below the knee. Weakness or numbness in your buttocks, thigh, leg, or pelvis. Burning with urination or blood in your urine. Worse pain when you lie down or pain that awakens you at night. Very sharp pain. Also call if: You have been losing weight unintentionally You use steroids or intravenous drugs. You have never had or been evaluated for back pain before. You have had back pain before but this episode is distinctly different. This episode of back pain has lasted longer than four weeks. If any of these symptoms are present, your doctor will carefully check for any sign of infection (like meningitis, abscess, or urinary tract infection), ruptured disk, spinal stenosis, hernia, cancer, kidney stone, twisted testicle, or other serious problem.  See the next page to learn more about prevention and what to expect at the doctor's office.
