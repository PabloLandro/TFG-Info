Submitted by HealthyAndHot on Mon, 2007-02-05 13:59. published to Nutrition Cinnamon has been used for centuries to treat a variety of ailments. Recent studies have found that Cassia cinnamon, also known as Chinese cinnamon ( Cinnamomum aromaticum)  is beneficial as an anti- inflammatory and antioxidant and has been shown to lower cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose, and improve insulin function. Studies conducted by B Qin and collegues at Nagoya University in Japan studied the effects of a cinnamon extract on the insulin action in rats and analyzed possible changes in insulin signaling occurring in skeletal muscle. Their results suggested that a cinnamon extract improves insulin action by increasing glucose uptake in vivo.  A component of this action is through enhancing the insulin-signaling pathway in skeletal muscle (Qin et al., 2006). Dr. Heping Cao and collegues of the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, investigated the biochemical properties that improve the function of insulin. Their results showed that cinnamon increases the amount of three proteins involved in the body's insulin signaling, glucose transport, and inflammatory response. These effects are similar to those found in insulin. Dr. Cao argues that the study provides new biochemical evidence for the beneficial effects of cinnamon in potentiating insulin action and also suggests anti-inflammatory properties for the antioxidants in cinnamon. Dr. Richard A. Anderson of the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, United States Department of Agriculture is completing human studies to determine how cinnamon may improve insulin functioning in women with polycystic ovary syndrome; individuals with type 2 diabetes; and in people who are very obese.  It is believed that improving insulin function will lead to a decrease in weight and an increase in lean body mass (Goodwin, Sarah, 2006).
