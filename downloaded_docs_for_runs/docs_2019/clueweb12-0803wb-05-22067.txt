This condition
    is common in all types of people from children to the elderly and from top athletes
    to people with a sedentary lifestyle. The feet become misaligned and combined with poor posture roll inwards to gain ground
    contact, the arches become flattened producing the condition known as excessive pronation. When the feet are excessively pronated a combination of poor posture and diminished
    shock absorption results in some areas of the feet being subjected to excessive stress
    and pressure. This can lead to various conditions including knee and back problems,
    as well as foot problems and deformities. Professional chiropody / podiatry adhesive paddings and materials can be used to
    help reduce the excessive pressure. Also with the use of orthotic insoles, it is
    possible to control excessive pronation of the feet, helping them to function more
    normally, reducing the stress on the feet, knees and back. These are some of the possible resulting conditions due to poor shock absorption
    in the feet. The orthotics which we recommend for this condition are the FootSupports™ or Vasyli
    orthotics. Vasyli Medium Density Blue ¾ Length Orthotic Insoles Semi- Rigid. Medium Density. Regular Support. Designed for everyday use, this orthotic
