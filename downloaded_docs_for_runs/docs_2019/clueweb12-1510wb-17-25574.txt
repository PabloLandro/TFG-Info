It mostly occurs in the women who are more sexually active but this does not indicate that somebody not having sex cannot get this infection. On an average one of every three women will probably develop this disease at some stage in their lives so it is not really that dangerous. This infection is not transmitted due to sexual contact as well as not categorized as one of the sexually transmitted infections. This can happen to both pregnant and non pregnant women. But in case of pregnancy and due to this disease, chances of premature deliveries as well as miscarriage increase. The main symptom of this infection is an off-white discharge with unpleasant odour mostly after sexual contact. This discharge can coat the surfaces of vagina and may smell like fishy odor. The amount of discharge varies from person to person. This disease can lead to irritation or ache in the vagina. Many times this infection is confused with the yeast infection. So it is advised to take a help of a medical doctor and start the treatment as soon as is possible. Till date precise reason for the infection is not known to the physicians and also is related to many gynecologic conditions. Simply speaking it is caused because of the imbalance of bacteria levels in the vagina. Basically there are two types of bacteria in the vagina: good bacteria as well as the bad bacteria. And the reason behind this infection is that bad bacteria outnumber the good bacteria due to change of the environment in the vagina. Factors that are identified to increase the chance of bacterial vaginosis can include: low immune system, utilizing vaginal lotions, soaps, douching and having unprotected sex with multiple sex partners. Bacterial vaginosis is curable. The doctors can prescribe antibiotic creams or even metronidazole to get rid of the infection. Same treatment methods are followed for both pregnant and non pregnant women. It is also noticed that over fifty percent ladies treated with antibiotics are likely to develop this infection again within 12 months. To stop the use of the antibiotics women are nowadays making use of home treatments to cure bacterial vaginosis. Most common and simple to use treatment consists of using apple cider vinegar. This vinegar helps in improving the level of acidity in the vagina thus getting rid of the infection. Some other remedies may include eating garlic, using tea tree oil, drinking cranberry juice. Yogurt also provides relief from this disease because it contains a lot of good bacteria.
