Researchers suggest that aloe vera accelerates healing and reduces pain associated with canker sores and blisters on the lips and mouth and could be a very inexpensive alternative remedy. Author Richard L. Wynn discusses a study done on a patient with lichen planus, a disease affecting the skin and oral mucus membranes. The patient drank 2 ounces of aloe vera juice daily and topically applied aloe vera to the lips. The oral lesions cleared up in four weeks and complete success was achieved. Dr. Wynn cited the study as showing that oral health problems can be treated with aloe vera. "Aloe Vera can be taken both as the aloe vera juice and aloe vera gel. These are the two modes of delivery recognized by the FDA," said Dr. Wynn. * Watkins Aloe Vera Juice is 99.7% pure, cold-processed and stabilized, and our Gel Capsules contain concentrate equal to one teaspoon of pure gel. The recommended use is 2 to 6 ounces of juice or one gel capsule per day. For the greatest benefits, drink at least 2 ounces of Watkins Aloe juice daily, and when symptoms appear, cut open a gel capsule with clean, sterile scissors or a knife, and squeeze the aloe onto the sore to speed healing.
