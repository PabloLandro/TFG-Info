The Mercury Connection and Seizures DENTAL AMALGAM MERCURY SYNDROME www.amalgam.org DAMS, Inc.; P.O. Box 7249 Minneapolis, MN 55407-0249 For Immediate Release: Epilepsy: the mercury connection and seizures, 
nutritional treatment 1. Dental amalgam fillings are the largest source of mercury
 exposure in most people. 2. Adults often also get high mercury exposures from fish,
 and infants and older adults get high mercury thimerosal 
exposure from vaccinations. 3. Amalgam dental fillings in the mouth with other metals
 result in galvanic electrical currents much higher than 
impulses in the nervous system, which result in adverse 
neurological effects and high mercury exposures. These 
galvanic currents are factors in conditions like epilepsy. 4. Mercury causes significant adverse metabolic effects that
 are a major factor in epilepsy and other chronic conditions. 5. Mercury commonly causes autoimmunity which is a major 
factor in autoimmune conditions like MS, lupus, rheumatoid 
arthritis, etc. and can be a factor in epilepsy. Documentation Dental amalgam fillings are the largest source of mercury 
exposure in most people 1 5 , but those who
 often eat fish
 can get high levels of exposure and children and older 
adults have gotten large exposures to mercury thimerosal 
from vaccinations. 5 Amalgam fillings produce 
electrical 
currents which increase mercury vapor release and have 
other harmful effects. 3 These currents are 
measured in
 micro amps, with some measured at over 4 micro amps. The
 central nervous system operates on signals in the range 
of nano-amps, which is 1,000 times less than a micro amp. Negatively charged fillings or crowns push electrons into 
the oral cavity since saliva is a good electrolyte and cause 
higher mercury vapor losses. 7, 3 Patients with 
autoimmune
 conditions like MS, or epilepsy, depression, etc. are 
often found to have a lot of high negative current fillings. 7, 3 Mercury commonly causes autoimmunity which can 
also be a factor in conditions like epilepsy, MS, lupus,
etc.. 14, 5 Prenatal exposure to mercury has been found 
to predispose animals and infants to seizures and epilepsy. 6, 8 A major factor in epilepsy has been found to be essential
mineral deficiencies and imbalances- such as magnesium, zinc,
etc. 13 Mercury is well documented to cause cell membrane 
permeability changes, mineral efflux from cells, leaky gut,
enzyme blockages, etc. that commonly result in essential 
mineral deficiencies and imbalances. Mercury causes 
significant destruction of stomach and intestine epithelial
cells, resulting in damage to stomach lining which along 
with mercury’s ability to bind to SH hydroxyl radical in 
cell membranes alters permeability 4, 2 and adversely 
alters bacterial populations in the intestines causing 
leaky gut syndrome with toxic, incompletely digested
complexes in the blood 4, 2 and accumulation of heliobacter
pylori, a suspected major factor in stomach ulcers and 
stomach cancer and candida albicans, as well as poor 
nutrient absorption. Mercury’s forming strong bonds with and modification of 
the-SH groups of proteins causes mitochondrial release of
calcium 4, 2 , as well as altering molecular function
 of 
amino acids and damaging enzymatic process, resulting in
improper cysteine regulation, inhibited glucose transfer 
and uptake, damaged sulfur oxidation processes, and reduced 
glutathione availability (necessary for detoxification). 
The essential mineral deficiencies and imbalances have been
found to be a major factor in Epilepsy, and correcting 
mineral imbalances has been found to cause significant 
improvement in epilepsy. 13 Some of the main mechanisms of toxic effects of metals
include cytotoxicity; changes in cellular membrane 
permeability; inhibition of enzymes, coenzymes, and 
hormones; and generation of lipid peroxides or free
radicals- which result in neurotoxicity, immuno 
toxicity, impaired cellular respiration, gastrointestinal
/metabolic effects, hormonal effects, and immune reactivity
 or autoimmunity. Also mercury binds with cell membranes 
interfering with sodium and potassium enzyme functions,
 causing excess membrane permeability, especially in terms 
of the blood-brain barrier. 4 Less than 1ppm mercury
 in 
the blood stream can impair the blood- brain barrier. Most patients with epilepsy recovered or had significant
improvement after amalgam replacement 6, 7, 10,
