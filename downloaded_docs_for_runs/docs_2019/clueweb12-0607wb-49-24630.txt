Migratol | Migraine Headaches and Herbal Remedies Migratrol TM Migraines have a variety of symptoms and causes. This 
						paper discusses the roles that some Foods may play in the prevention and causes of some 
						migraines.  Migratrol is a 100% Food supplement 
						that is intended to supply nutrients, glandulars, and 
						herbs needed to maintain and support optimal thyroid 
						health. A mild product that often is used by older 
						people and some with headaches. Migratrol contains the following Foods : Adrenal glandulars are a Food which has been used for decades by nutrition-oriented 
						doctors when certain headaches are present. It has been 
						recently noted that plasma norepinephrine levels have 
						been found to be lowered in patients who suffer from 
						cluster headaches [1]. These types have been called 
						“adrenal headaches” [2,3] with an etiological background 
						of “overwork, exhaustion, worry, tension, tuberculosis” 
						[2]. Borage leaf and flaxseeds are a natural Food source of essential fatty acids. 
						Platelet aggregation appears to be altered in migraine 
						headaches and that platelet aggravating factor may be 
						involved in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches [4]. 
						It has been found that prophylactic use of foods high in 
						gamma-linolenic and alpha-linolenic acid can, after 
						several months, reduce the severity and frequency of 
						migraine headaches [5]. This may be because gamma-linolenic 
						acid competes with arachidonic acid for the active site 
						of cyclooxygenase and it appears to reduce the 
						production of inflammatory leukotrines [6]. Borage seed 
						oil contains 47.2% of linoleic acid and 23.1% of gamma-linolenic 
						acid [8]. Chromium GTF in Food is organically attached. Inorganic chromium “is very 
						difficult to absorb”, but organically attached chromium 
						10-25 times “more easily absorbed” [9-11]. “Chromium may 
						help reduce the length and severity of a migraine, 
						especially if the migraine is due to hypoglycemia and/or 
						emotional stress” [9]. A double-blind trial showed that 
						chromium can play a role in reducing the frequency and 
						intensity of chronic headaches [12]. ORDER NOW Doctors' Research Migratol 90 Tablets $23.98 Feverfewleaves are a commonly used Food by people with migraine headaches, especially 
						prophylactically [13-15]. Feverfew is naturally rich in 
						sesquiterpene lactones, the principal one being 
						parthenolide [15]. Parthenolides inhibit phospholipase 
						A2, have antiplatelet activity, and have anti-white cell 
						activity [14]. “Feverfew may produce an antimigraine 
						effect in a manner similar to methysergide maleate” [14] 
						(Methysergide maleate, Sansert , 
						is a known serotonin antagonist [16]). Liver glandulars are a Food which has sometimes been recommended by 
						nutrition-oriented practitioners for some with headaches 
						[2,3,17]. The liver is involved in blood sugar 
						regulation, conversion of T4 to T3, and a variety of 
						enzymes [18]; problems in any of those areas can 
						contribute to migraines [9]. Magnesium in Food is in a near-ionic state and is not a mineral salt (an 
						industrial rock). Magnesium is reduced in the blood, 
						saliva, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain when migraine 
						headaches are present [19-23]. Reduced brain 
						concentrations of magnesium can result in migraine 
						headaches; reduced amounts of magnesium in mononuclear 
						blood cells has been found in patients while 
						experiencing migraines or auras associated with their 
						occurrence [19]. Niacinamide (vitamin B-3) in Food is not the same as the synthetic USP nutrient. 
						Nicotinamide is a vasodilator [24]. Nutrition-oriented 
						practitioners have used vitamin B-3 to help people with 
						migraines [9,25,26]. Pituitary glandulars are a Food which has long been used by doctors for headaches [27]. 
						Research strongly suggests that the pituitary gland is 
						associated with headaches of many types [1,9,28,29]. 
						“Often, with migraine patients, doctors view x-rays for 
						evidence of swollen pituitary glands which can easily be 
						defined in this restricted region. As stated in 
						Harrison’s Textbook of Internal Medicine, ‘Enlargement...is 
						frequently encountered in routine skull [x-rays] 
						obtained in patients complaining of headaches... ’ 
						The swelling places pressure on the nerves in the 
						cranium and this causes pain” [9]. Thyroid glandulars are a Food which has been used by migraine headache sufferers since 
						at least the 1930s [27]. Dr. D.A. Versendaal (D.C.) 
						recommends thyroid glandular supplements for people with 
						migraine headaches [26]. Low thyroid function appears to 
						play a role in migraine headaches [9,26,30], but “The 
						precise reason the thyroid is so involved in migraine is 
						unknown...The thyroid gland exerts significant control 
						over the circulatory system, and this is one reason 
						disorders of the thyroid gland are related to 
						migraine...Poor circulation with resultant reduced blood 
						supply to the brain increases the risk for migraines” 
						[9]. Many who do not have migraines have found that Migratrol can 
						help provide nutritional support for improved thyroid 
						health. Vitamin B-2 in Food is not the same as the synthetic USP isolate. A Belgian 
						study found that consuming a daily single high dose of 
						riboflavin (vitamin B-2) for three months improved 
						average headache scores for migraine sufferers by about 
						two-thirds, which was the same as aspirin [31]. Various substances have been implicated in causing 
						migraines . Some are rare and some more common. Perhaps the two 
						most common are those containing caffeine or dairy 
						[30,32] (inhaled chemicals are also a factor for many 
						[30]). Dr. Alex Duarte places caffeine first in his list 
						of foods which can cause migraine headaches [32]. Many 
						who take Migratrol also avoid caffeine and dairy 
						products; while some also take Food Magnesium 
						Complex or Food C Complex with it. For many migraine sufferers, it is best to 
						taper off caffeine slowly in order to help avoid 
						‘rebound’ headaches.

						essential monosaccharides), essential lipids, and 
						proteins (including all ten essential amino acids) as 
						found in specially grown, enzymatically processed Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the individually listed 
						foods. All glandulars are New Zealand source. Migratrol TM contains no synthetic USP nutrients 
						or isolated mineral salts. Numerous university studies have concluded that 
						supplements containing food nutrients are better than 
						USP isolates. Food nutrients are better because they 
						contain important enzymes, peptides, and phytonutrients 
						CRITICAL to the UTILIZATION of vitamins and minerals 
						which are not present in isolated USP nutrients. 
						Published research has concluded that food vitamins are 
						superior synthetic/USP vitamins. Suggested use: 1-3 tablets per day or as recommended by 
						your health care professional. Adjust usage according to 
						nutritional lifestyle requirements. No 
						Synthetic Nutrients * No Dairy * No Preservatives * No
