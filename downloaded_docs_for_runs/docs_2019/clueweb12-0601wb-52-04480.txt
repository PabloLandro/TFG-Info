MrSupplement Testimonials I ordered on a Thursday night and received the products on Monday no hassle at all. I will order from Mr Supplement again in the future.  - Luke S, Gawler, SA BSc Body Science Fuel Magnesium Plus Reviews 21st February 2012 Review by Marco R, Seahampton NSW Highly reccomended product. I suffer from cramps when cycling long distance. If I take a drink of this stuff before a ride and drink it made up in my water bottles during the ride, it keeps those cramps at bay. You may have to experiment on just how much you need to take for it to work. The only downside is that it does not dissolve 100% and you have to shake before a drink. Also, it may not be all that palatable on a hot day out on the road (whether, running, cycling etc) and I find it best mixed in with another sports drink.
