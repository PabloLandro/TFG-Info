Sep, 2011 by rssfaq in Health & Fitness , Women's Health Home treatment for bacterial vaginosis is very simple and inexpensive that you don’t need to spend a huge amount of money in order to get it. As you probably know, bacterial vaginosis or BV is caused by an imbalance in the growth of bacteria in the vagina. While pregnant women tend to have this problem due to hormonal changes, many non-pregnant women also experience similar problem. Bacterial vaginosis is very annoying because it causes other problems such as vaginal discharge, unpleasant odor, painful urination, and itchiness. Untreated or recurring bacterial vaginosis does not only affect your health, but also affects the quality of your life. Many women suffering from BV end up feeling embarrassed and humiliated due to the stench and pain in their nether regions. This, of course, will affect their self esteem as well as their life and relationship. To cure this disease, you have to reduce your sugar intake. Keep in mind that BV-causing bacteria feed on sugar. Consuming lots and lots of sugar will not help you get better. Plain yogurt is a good home remedy for BV. This fermented dairy product contains good bacteria which can help control the population of bad bacteria in the vagina. You can also try cranberry juice. Cranberry is an amazing fruit which is rich in proanthocyanidins, a flavanol which helps prevent bacterial attachment in the vagina. If you can stand its reeking smell, you can try consuming raw garlic. It may not smell so good, but garlic has antibacterial and antifungal properties which are very helpful in treating bacterial vaginosis. Alternatively, soak a teaspoon of dried tracheal in one cup of hot water and drink the concoction before going to bed every night. Tracheal is useful in removing toxins, bacteria, and parasites from your body. Always to keep in mind that you have to always maintain the cleanliness of your vagina when you try any home treatment for bacterial vaginosis .
