By Dena  Afrasiabi The CDC is finally catching up with Jewish teaching, 4000 years later, by proposing mandatory circumcision for all baby boys. This proposal is based on data that finds circumcision can reduce the risk of HIV by 50%. Studies also show that circumcised men run a reduced risk of diseases like syphilis, HPV and cancer of the penis, even urinary tract infections. The value of circumcision comes as no surprise to many.  According to Jewish teachings, cirumcision was recommended by God, who told Abraham that cutting the foreskin would symbolize the convenant. Muslims, too, believe in circumcision. And Victorian doctors blamed the foreskin  for all manner of psychiatric illnesses stemming  from excessive masturbation, which the presence of the foreskin was said to promote. The United States, in general, has been mostly pro-circumcision, especially compared to other countries,  particularly in Europe, which have given up on the procedure. But even with all of the evidence of its benefits presented by its supporters, many opponents to circumcision, a.k.a. "intactivists," refuse to forego the foreskin, making comparisons between circumcision and female genital mutilation and calling it a human rights violation. Regardless of what the CDC decides, this little piece of skin will no doubt continue to house a whole lot of controversy, perhaps for another 4000 years. Last Updated
