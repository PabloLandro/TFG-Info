Obesity has become a national epidemic. Today one in five Americans are considered to be obese. You may be considered obese if you are more than 30 percent over your ideal body weight. Doctors often use body mass index or BMI to determine whether someone is obese. BMI uses a ratio of height and weight. Click here to calculate your BMI. More than cosmetic Problems with obesity involve much more than how a person looks. The American Medical Association reported in 2001 that an estimated 300,000 Americans die from obesity-related causes each year. People who are obese are at greater risk of developing some very serious health problems including Heart disease and stroke Type 2 or non-insulin dependent diabetes Cancer Osteoarthritis Sleep apnea Some people who are obese also deal with psychological problems such as depression. Obesity also is associated with menstrual irregularities  and stress incontinence. Lowering your health risks If you are obese, you can take steps to lower your overall health risks. For those who are overweight, losing as little as 5 to 10 percent of your body weight may help improve your overall health. There are many programs designed to help people lose weight. For those who need to lose under 100 pounds, a number of options are available including structured diet and exercise programs, modified fasts and medications to help with weight loss. You should discuss your options with your physican and determine what’s for you. If you need to lose 100 pounds or more, you may want to consider surgical weight loss. Gastrointestinal surgery for obesity or bariatric surgery, changes how you digest food. These surgeries may restrict the amount of food you eat or restrict food intake and the amount of calories and nutrients your body absorbs. These surgeries have been found to help many patients lose weight quickly. Many patients are able to maintain their weight loss over time.
