						9:44 pm Many experts and medical professionals may not necessarily agree with them, but there are a growing number of people who are looking more and more into natural home remedies for various forms of illnesses and infections. This is mainly because of the continually rising cost of medication and treatment, forcing more and more people to seek more affordable but still acceptably safe alternative cures for many of their conditions. One such condition is bacterial vaginosis. Cured Your Bacterial Vaginosis in 3 days the Natural Way Bacterial vaginosis is a mild infection that occurs in the vagina when the balance of the naturally occurring bacteria becomes disrupted, resulting in a greater number of one group of bacteria over the other forms. This type of infection is considered as particularly embarrassing by some women, since it necessarily involves visible and chronic symptoms that are quite hard to ignore. Bacterial vaginosis can have any of the following symptoms: abnormal discharge with a particularly unpleasant fishy odor, intense itching in vaginal area, swelling and irritation, and sometimes even cramp-like stomach pains. These are just a few of the more commonly known symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, and the possible sources of the infection are almost as varied as the symptoms, like frequent wearing of thongs and other underwear which alternately rub between the vagina and the anus, triggered by a previous sexually-transmitted infection, infections caused by strep, and, to a certain degree, sexual intercourse between two women, that is, presupposing that one of the women had been infected, or is currently infected with bacterial vaginosis. The most common cure for bacterial vaginosis is pretty much the same as the accepted cure for most types of infections: antibiotics. This cure, however, can be quite problematic for those who have a pronounced intolerance, or even allergy, to antibiotics. Hence, there is a need to find an alternative treatment for bacterial vaginosis, using other substances known to be less harmful to the human body. One form of treatment being looked at is the restoration of the natural balance of the normal vaginal flora, or population of the naturally existing bacteria in the vagina. Considering that some of these treatments are quite natural, virtually as natural as the normal food we eat, there is a huge chance that it will not trigger an adverse effect on the body, and it may even prove to be a lasting solution to the problem. Cured Your Bacterial Vaginosis in 3 days the Natural Way Treatments include: Restore the acidic balance – The vaginal area has natural acidic properties brought about by the interaction of different naturally-occurring bacteria. Disrupting this often leads to bacterial vaginosis. This can be resolved by restoring the acidic balance using lactobacillusacidphilus and L. bifidus, which are both found in yoghurt. Yoghurt can be eaten directly, or vaginal inserts that have been soaked in yoghurt can also be introduced into the vagina to promote restoration of the acidic balance. Preventing unwanted bacteria from multiplying – This particular treatment is done as an alternative to acidifying the vaginal pH. Unwanted bacteria is bacteria is rendered unable to multiply by the use of a boric acid douche. For those who have shown a particular sensitivity or even allergic reaction to this method, a vinegar douche, made by mixing a tablespoon of vinegar to one quart of water, is also quite effective. Use of nutritional supplements and topical applications – Vitamins with antioxidant components have been known to help greatly in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. These vitamins include vitamin A, C, D, E and B complex. To help relieve the itching, a topical cream made from vitamin is quite effective. Soothe the irritated genital tissues – A warm bath or even a shallow sitzs bath has been known to soothe the irritated tissues around the vagina, although it is generally advised that soap should not be directly used to clean the genital area, as it can destroy the skin’s natural lipid shields that help keep out bacteria. These are just some of the natural and household remedies that have been known to help in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. While there are more treatments that can be done at home to help treat bacterial vaginosis, it is strongly recommended that a consultation with a physician be done first before any type of home treatment is done. Bacterial Vaginitis can be treated with antibiotics but these will kill of the vagina’s own good bacteria as well as the bad bacteria and will not stop the Bacterial Vaginitis coming back. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis is a real problem for many women and that’s why a natural home remedy might be the answer. You really need to get smart with your body and build you own bodies natural bacteria balance to help prevent bacterial vaginosis. This can be done with probiotic supplements such as Lactobacillus Acidophilus and natural yogurt containing live cultures amongst other things.
