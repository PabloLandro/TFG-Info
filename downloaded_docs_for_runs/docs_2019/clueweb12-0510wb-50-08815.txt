                                      can kill bacteria For thousands of years certain cultures 
                                      have known that raw honey has amazing healing 
                                      properties. For example, traditionallly 
                                      in the Greek culture, honey has been used 
                                      to treat stomach ulcers - it was recommended 
                                      that the sufferer take 1-2 teaspoons of 
                                      honey in the morning on an empty stomach. 
                                      Up until recently there has not been much 
                                      scientific evidence showing that honey has 
                                      antimicrobial properties. Honey from bees using a plant called leptospermum 
                                      (a jelly bush flower from Northern New South 
                                      Wales in Australia and a related Manuka 
                                      plant in New Zealand) has now been shown 
                                      to have antibacterial activity. A new study 
                                      conducted by an Australian PhD student at 
                                      the University of Sydney has shown that 
                                      this honey is able to knock off the notorious 
                                      bacterium "Golden Staph" (Staphylococcus). 
                                      Even more surprisingly, the bacteria do 
                                      not seem to become resistant to this honey. 
                                      It was found that the honey kills bacteria 
                                      by attacking over 100 of its genes, resulting 
                                      in reduced reproductive capacity and increased 
                                      susceptibility to death. The honey also 
                                      seems to stimulate wounds to heal - no other 
                                      topical antimicrobial agent does that. One 
                                      day honey could be standard treatment for 
                                      burns, ulcers and other wounds. Last
