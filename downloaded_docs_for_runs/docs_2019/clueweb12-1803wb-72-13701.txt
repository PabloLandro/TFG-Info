Quit Smoking Before Your Breast Augmentation - Here´s How Smoking and Breast Surgery: A Dangerous Combination Tweet Smoking tobacco raises your risk of cancer of the  lungs, mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach, and each cigarette you smoke increases the likelihood that you will develop heart disease, bronchitis or emphysema,  or experience a stroke. But that's not all. Smoking can also compromise the  results of your breast  augmentation , breast  lift or breast  reconstruction procedure. Smoking constricts your blood vessels and inhibits  the binding of oxygen, lowering the amount of oxygen that is available to your  cells. Insufficient oxygen impedes your body's ability to heal after surgery  and increases your risk for wound separation, skin death and raised, red scars. As a smoker, you will also have a higher risk of anesthesia complications and  post-surgery infections than your non-smoking counterparts. Many surgeons won't  even perform breast enhancement procedures on smokers. In general, smokers who undergo surgery have longer  hospital stays and a higher likelihood of being admitted to an intensive care  unit. Smokers are also at greater risk for heart attack, stroke, pneumonia and/or  death after surgery. Quitting Smoking Before Surgery Quitting before surgery is advisable. While quitting  for good would be ideal, stopping for even two weeks before and after surgery  can dramatically reduce your risks and encourage a smoother breast surgery recovery. Tools for Helping You Kick the Habit While some people are able to quit cold turkey,  others need help. Many smoking cessation aids are available today. Nicotine replacement products can help relieve the  symptoms of nicotine withdrawal by allowing you to receive gradually decreasing  amounts of nicotine without all of the other chemicals in tobacco. These  products include over-the-counter patches, gums and lozenges as well as  prescription nasal sprays and inhalers. Nicotine replacement products cannot be used  immediately prior to or during your procedure because the nicotine they contain  poses some of the same risks as cigarettes. Tell your surgeon if you are using  any nicotine replacement aids. In addition to nicotine replacement products, prescription  drugs are also available to help smokers quit. Bupropion (sold under the brand  names Wellbutrin and Zyban and also used to treat depression) is believed to  lessen the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Varenicline tartrate (Chantix) targets nicotine receptors  in the brain, preventing the nicotine from reaching them. Doctors typically  advise their patients to begin using Chantix a week before they plan to quit  smoking; this should be factored in to your plan if you decide to try the drug. Other tools to help you quit include  hypnotherapy and acupuncture as well as community and online support groups. If  you are a smoker, be sure to discuss all your options along with their risks  and benefits during your initial consultation with a board-certified plastic  surgeon. Start your search for the right surgeon now.
