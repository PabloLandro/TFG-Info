In China, acupuncture has been used for centuries to help control the female   reproductive system. "Firstly, acupuncture may mediate the release of neurotransmitters, which may   in turn stimulate secretion of gonadotrophin releasing hormone, thereby   influencing the menstrual cycle, ovulation, and fertility," write Eric   Manheimer, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, and   colleagues. "Secondly, acupuncture may stimulate blood flow to the uterus by   inhibiting uterine central sympathetic nerve activity. Thirdly, acupuncture may   stimulate the production of endogenous opioids, which may inhibit the central   nervous system outflow and the biological stress response." The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled   trials was to assess the effect of acupuncture given with embryo transfer on the   rates of pregnancy and live birth among women undergoing in vitro   fertilization. Using Medline, Cochrane Central, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Database,   hand-searched abstracts, and reference lists, the authors identified randomized   controlled trials comparing needle acupuncture given within 1 day of embryo   transfer vs sham acupuncture or no adjuvant treatment, with reported outcomes of   clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and/or live birth. For all of the included trials, the investigators contributed additional   data, such as live birth rate, that were not included in the original   publication(s). Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility,   evaluated methodological quality of the included trials, and extracted outcome   data. All randomized patients (1366 women enrolled in 7 trials) were included in   the meta-analyses. Clinical factors were relatively homogeneous among the included studies. For   the primary analysis, trials with sham acupuncture and no adjuvant treatment   were pooled as controls. Administering acupuncture with the embryo transfer process was linked to   significant and clinically relevant improvements in clinical pregnancy (odds   ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 ?2.14; number needed to   treat [NNT], 10 [95% CI, 7 ?17]; 7 trials), ongoing pregnancy (OR, 1.87; 95% CI,   1.40 ?2.49; NNT, 9 [95% CI, 6 ?15]; 5 trials), and live birth (OR, 1.91, 95% CI,   1.39 ?2.64; NNT, 9 [95% CI, 6 ?17]; 4 trials). Outcome data on live births were not available for 3 of the included trials.   Therefore, the reviewers suggest that the pooled OR for clinical pregnancy more   accurately represents the true combined effect from these trials than does the   OR for live birth. These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses on study   validity variables. When using a prespecified subgroup analysis including only the 3 trials with   the higher rates of clinical pregnancy in the control group, there was a smaller   nonsignificant benefit of acupuncture (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86 ?1.77). "Current preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture given with embryo   transfer improves rates of pregnancy and live birth among women undergoing in   vitro fertilization," the reviewers write. "Additional randomised trials are   needed to quantify findings further and investigate the relation between   baseline rate of pregnancy and the efficacy of adjuvant acupuncture." Limitations of the meta-analysis include heterogeneity of baseline rates   across trials, possible publication and "hypothesis" (orientation) biases, and   inclusion of 3 studies presented only as abstracts. "If acupuncture increased the likelihood of success of an individual cycle,   then the need for a subsequent cycle would be reduced, and overall costs would   be decreased," the reviewers conclude. "Even if such increases were small, and,   for example, 17 patients needed to be treated with acupuncture to bring about   one additional pregnancy (that is, the lowest range of our 95% confidence   interval), an acupuncture cointervention may still be cost effective,   considering the negligible costs of two to four sessions of acupuncture,   relative to the high costs of in vitro fertilisation."
