WLKY Homepage > Louisville News Whooping Cough Found In Second County By Stephanie Segretto/WLKY POSTED: 4:25 pm EDT October 23, 2008 UPDATED: 5:30 pm EDT October 23, 2008 Email Print comments ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. -- First, it was spreading through a Bullitt County elementary school. Now an outbreak of whooping cough is being confirmed one county over. Watch The Story Hardin County health officials said they have cases in at least three schools and a day care. There are 10 confirmed cases in Hardin County, but that number could grow as many parents take the health department's advice and get their children tested. "This morning she woke up not really coughing so much, but started having that runny nose, and they say it's like a common cold," said parent Heidi Law. "So I went ahead and called her doctor and have an appointment in the morning." Law said this week she was told several cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, were found in her daughter's day care at Elizabethtown Christian Academy. "I was nervous because my daughter is right up in the mix of all of it," she said. Public Health Director Linda Sims said cases have also been confirmed at two other local schools -- Saint James and Heartland Elementary. "It began you know slowly with a few cases involving the same family and then this week we began getting more notification," Sims said. Whooping cough is a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease that is spread through the air in the tiny droplets formed when people sneeze or cough. The symptoms are similar to a common cold, with sneezing, runny nose, low fever and a mild cough. Then, after, about 10 days, a strong cough develops. There has also been an outbreak of pertussis in Bullitt County in the last few weeks and now health officials are trying to determine if there is a connection. "Eventually it might trace back where there was some contact or involvement with sports or church or school between these groups, but we just haven't found that yet," Sims said. The health department is urging every parent to get their child tested if they develop symptoms. Then the disease can be treated with antibiotics. They hope this will help stop the outbreak before it spreads any further. "I heard first about Bullitt County and I didn't pay attention, and now it's in my daughter's school and I'm thinking, 'Where else?'" said Law. All of the students diagnosed with whooping cough did receive the vaccination for the disease, but health officials say it seems to have faded. They said for those who have been vaccinated, their case will be less severe.
