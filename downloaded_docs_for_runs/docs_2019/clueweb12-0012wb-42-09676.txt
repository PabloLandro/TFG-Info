February 12, 2012, 2:18 am by admin Feverfew November 29, 2010 in Herbal Medicine by admin Feverfew has been used for centuries in European folk medicine for headache, arthritis, and fever. Feverfew comes from the Latin word, febrifuge, which means fever-reducing. This herb was traditionally used for insect bites, irregular menstruation, stomachaches, and toothache, although modern herbalists do not usually use it for these conditions. Herbalists today use feverfew to treat migraine, arthritis in its early stages, rheumatic diseases, and other conditions. Plant Description Feverfew originally came from southeastern Europe. Today, it is widespread throughout Europe, North America and Australia. It is a short perennial that blooms between July and October. In the past, it could be seen in nearly every hedgerow throughout the gardens of England and Germany. People planted feverfew around their homes because they believed it would purify the atmosphere and ward off disease. The small, daisy-like yellow flowers of this plant show that it belongs to the daisy family. Feverfew looks a little like chamomile, but it has some differences. The yellow-green leaves are alternate, and turn downward with short hairs. The leaves are the most important part for herbal medicine. Feverfew is an aromatic herb with a strong and bitter smell. What’s Feverfew Made Of? Feverfew products are usually made from the leaves. Sometimes they are made from the aerial parts (all the parts of the plant that grow above the ground). The migraine-relieving activity of feverfew comes from an active compound called parthenolide. Parthenolide affects smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels in the brain to block the action of vasoconstrictors like serotonin, prostaglandins, and norepinephrine. Vasoconstrictors narrow blood vessels and are one of the main causes of migraines. Available Forms of Feverfew Feverfew capsules are usually made from dried leaves. Always look for standardized products that contain at least 0.2 percent parthenolide. If the product is not standardized, you cannot be sure that you are actually getting enough parthenolide. And without parthenolide, you might not reap optimal health benefits. It is important that you read the label carefully on feverfew products because the amount of parthenolide varies depending upon where the feverfew was grown. Feverfew from some regions of the world has very little or even no parthenolide. You can also chew leaves from feverfew that you plant yourself or buy from an herbal market. However, be cautious in eating the leaves. About 10 percent of people who chew feverfew leaves get mouth ulcerations, loss of taste, and swelling of their lips, tongue, and mouth. How to Take Feverfew Today, nearly 10 percent of Americans suffer from migraines. Feverfew can provide effective relief for many of these people. It is used to treat migraines in progress and stop migraines before they start. It is most beneficial for migraine sufferers who have not had much success with other medications. (This includes prescription drugs and over-the-counter pain medications.) Feverfew is safe when used according to your health care provider’s instructions. In the 1980s, British researchers found that 70 percent of migraine sufferers who ate two to three fresh feverfew leaves every day got serious relief from their headaches. The British scientists were so amazed by this high success rate that they expanded their research. They discovered that feverfew was much more effective than placebo in reducing migraine severity. And feverfew also decreased symptoms of nausea and vomiting associated with migraine. In 1997, feverfew ranked number 19 on a list of top-selling herbs at health food stores in the United States. Medical experts are not sure if feverfew reduces the inflammation of arthritis. The evidence so far is conflicting. But some people who have arthritis claim that feverfew helps decrease their pain and stiff joints. Recommended dosage of Feverfew -	To treat and prevent migraine, take standardized feverfew extract (minimum 250 mcg parthenolide) two times daily. -	To treat an acute migraine attack, take 1 to 2 g parthenolide daily. For other conditions, take 1 to 2 ml twice a day of 1:1 fluid extract; or 2 to 4 ml twice a day of 1:5 tincture (solution made from herb and alcohol, or herb, alcohol, and water). Feverfew Precautions Feverfew works best for migraine sufferers who have not responded well to conventional treatment. Sometimes people experience side effects such as abdominal pain, indigestion, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and nervousness. Because feverfew can alter the menstrual cycle, menstruating women should use it with caution. Pregnant women, nursing women, and children under 2 years old should not take feverfew. Possible Interactions for Feverfew You should not take feverfew if you are taking aspirin, warfarin, or another blood-thinning medication because this herb also has blood-thinning properties. If you are taking any of these medications, you should consult your health care provider before taking feverfew. Supporting Research on Feverfew Blumenthal M, ed.
