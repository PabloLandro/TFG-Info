Posted by admin on July 4, 2011 Circumcision is a procedure accepted by some cultures and rejected by others. But history reveals that it is the oldest and most common surgical procedure performed. Statistics say that one out four men on earth are circumcised. In the United States the rate is about 50% and in Europe it is very rare. Many scientists support the idea that circumcision is a strategy to prevent HIV transmission. From biological point of view the fact the mucosal surface of the foreskin has high density of HIV receptors maker this supposition plausible. But the hypothesis needs more trials to get a scientific confirmation. Until then there are some evidences that vote for circumcision as a method of HIV transmission prevention. 1. Those cultures with high rates of circumcision have low HIV rates and vice versa. 2. A recent study conducted in Uganda, revealed no female-to-male transmissions in circumcised men with a female partner with a viral load! 50,000 copies/mL.rn 3. Two ongoing studies performed in Rakai and Kenya report that circumcision reduces female-to-male transmission of HIV. At the same time there are some irrelevant facts, as a study in South Africa was prematurely stopped by the Monitoring Board due to excessive rates of HIV transmission in the control group. If many confirmations will come, the circumcision could be used alongside condoms to prevent the transmission of HIV. But implementing this measure on a large male population will be complicated.
