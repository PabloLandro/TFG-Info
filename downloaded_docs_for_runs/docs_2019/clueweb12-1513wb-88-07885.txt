They are mainly used for preventative and recovery purposes. Preventative use includes people who spend long periods of time standing at work. Recovery use includes people who have had been treated for sclerotherapy or Endovenous Laser Therapy. Compression stockings are an easy, inexpensive way to treat varicose veins because they are constructed to reduce the pooling of the blood in your legs. Unlike traditional dress stockings, compression stockings use stronger elastics which apply the most pressure around the ankle and less pressure as they go up the leg. This special design helps to create pressure in the arteries which causes more blood to flow back to the heart. Although wearing compression stockings won’t eliminate varicose veins, they can help to relive a variety of symptoms including swelling, aching, and heaviness. Medicare and many insurance providers cover some of the cost for compression stocking therapy. Compression stockings are available in a variety of elastic strengths, sizes, colors, and lengths. And we are happy to fit our patients with the proper selection based on your individual needs. What's My Next Step? Ready for the next step?
