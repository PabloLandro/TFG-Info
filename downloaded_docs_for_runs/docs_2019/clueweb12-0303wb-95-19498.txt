This welcome result has led  to long-term  follow-up, which was needed to further assess the effectiveness of  male  circumcision at controlling the epidemic. This  extension study followed nearly 5,000 men from one  of the earlier studies in  Uganda for more than 2 more years. During  this time, 4 out of 5 of the  uncircumcised men from the original study  chose to be circumcised during the  extension phase. What resulted was  an average 68% fewer infections in this  group. As well, of those who  were circumcised during the original study, a  similar average of 67%  fewer infections occurred in those men. This  is good news for efforts at controlling the  epidemic in parts of Africa. From  this study, male circumcision appears  to be at least somewhat acceptable by  many men. And despite a  self-reported decrease in using condoms by both groups  of men, the  procedure continues to prevent a high number of new infections. This entry was posted in In the news , PrEP news .
