Alcohol Treatment Guidelines - The management of withdrawal syndromes - Part 7 - Detoxification from stimulant drugs - DryOutNow.com Alcohol Treatment and Alcoholism Advice for Alcoholics and their family THE MANAGEMENT OF WITHDRAWAL SYNDROMES DETOXIFICATION FROM STIMULANT DRUGS Abrupt cessation of stimulant (amphetamine, cocaine)
     use is associated with depression, anergia, anhedonia,
     increased drug craving, increased appetite, hypersomnolence
     and increased REM sleep (Weiss, Greenfield &
     Mirin, 1994). This initial period of intense symptoms
     is commonly termed the 'crash', which is usually selflimiting
     to a period of days. There have been reports
     of myocardial ischaemia occurring in the first week of
     stimulant withdrawal (Nademanee, Gorelick et al, 1989)
     although this is uncommon, and other medical effects
     are relatively minor. The 'dopamine deficiency' hypothesis of stimulant
     withdrawal has not been supported by clinical practice -
     controlled clinical trials of dopamine agonists have
     yielded inconsistent results. Similarly the use of tricyclic
     antidepressants to limit the effects of withdrawal on the
     basis that they inhibit presynaptic catecholamine neurotransmitter
     uptake, have failed to deliver any significant
     benefit. Antidepressants may however be useful in the
     treatment of an on-going depressive disorder associated
     with stimulant drug misuse. The stimulant withdrawal syndrome is thus best treated
     supportively and symptomatically by allowing the patient
     to sleep and eat as much as necessary. A benzodiazepine The stimulant withdrawal syndrome is best
       treated supportively and symptomatically
       by allowing the patient to sleep and eat
       as much as necessary. A benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide
       may be helpful in selected patients who
       develop agitation or sleep disturbance. such as chlordiazepoxide may be helpful in selected patients who develop agitation or sleep disturbance (Pearsall & Rosen, 1992); these should not be continued
     any longer than two weeks. Neuroleptics should be
     avoided because of their potential to induce dysphoric
     side-effects. As for opiate drugs, the chronic stimulant misuser is
     likely to experience a protracted withdrawal syndrome
     for months or even years which is characterised by
     depressed mood, lethargy and anhedonia together with
     intense craving. There is no specific pharmacological
     antidote for this syndrome or to limit the likelihood of
     relapse, although concurrent depressive disorder may
     respond to antidepressants. In conclusion, the management of stimulant drug
     misuse is largely psycho-social at all stages. Next page .. DETOXIFICATION FROM NICOTINE Alcohol Guidelines index The above information is copyright of Dr Bruce Trathen MBBS MRCPsych (2006).
