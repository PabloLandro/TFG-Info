Back to top ANXIETY Anxiety has affected at least a third of the population at some point in their lives. Factors eliciting an anxiety response may include pressure in the workplace, problems in relationships, or significant milestones such as births, weddings, divorces, etc. People experience anxiety in a variety of different ways including feelings of irritability, panic attacks and insomnia. Common to most sufferers is a sense of having lost control. Besides being very relaxing, hypnotherapeutic techniques can effectively help clients to conquer their anxiety and regain control of their thoughts, feelings and behaviour, also having a knock-on effect on their physiology. Sessions are tailor-made and may include assertiveness training, visualisations, and desensitisation to triggers. Effective Self-Hypnosis and Autogenic Training will be taught, free of charge, to all clients wishing to empower themselves.

"We found that patients in the hypnosis group were significantly less anxious postintervention as compared with patients in the attention-control group and the control group. Moreover, on entrance to the operating rooms, the hypnosis group reported a significant decrease of 56% in their anxiety level whereas the attention-control group reported an increase of 10% in anxiety and the control group reported an increase of 47% in their anxiety. In conclusion, we found that hypnosis significantly alleviates preoperative anxiety." (Saadat H, Drummond-Lewis J, Maranets I, Kaplan D, Saadat A, Wang SM, Kain ZN (2006).

Back to top ASTHMA Asthma is a chronic disease affecting the airways carrying air in and out of your lungs. During an asthma attack inflammation of the airways makes the them constrict and produce extra mucus, reacting strongly to a variety of triggers, such as smoke, pollution and allergens, and causing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing and tightening sensations in the chest cavity, particularly at night. Symptoms are exacerbated by anxiety. There is currently no cure for Asthma but most sufferers can control their symptoms to an extent that enables them to function. In acute asthma attacks, the airways can constrict so severely that oxygen is prevented from reaching vital organs. As relaxation is an intrinsic part of any hypnotherapy session, asthma symptoms can be reduced using a variety of hypnotherapeutic techniques, including Self-Hypnosis and Autogenic Training, taught, free of charge, to all clients wishing to empower themselves.

Back to top BINGE EATING Binge eating can be described as a pattern of episodic uncontrollable overeating. During such binges, a person rapidly consumes an excessive amount of food. Most people who have eating binges try to hide this behaviour from others, and often feel ashamed or depressed about their overeating. Eating binges can be followed by behaviour in which the person tries to compensate for the effects of overeating with acts such as purging (induced vomiting or laxative abuse), fasting and heavy exercising. Although people who do not have any mental disorder may occasionally experience episodes of overeating, frequent binge eating is often a symptom of an eating disorder and is a central feature of bulimia nervosa. Traditional and Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy are both very effective tools for achieving long-term change to disruptive or dysfunctional cognitive, behavioural and emotional patterns. Effective Self-Hypnosis will be taught, free of charge, to all clients wishing to empower themselves. Practising this wonderful skill enables rapid long-lasting achievement of desired results.

Back to top BRUXISM (GRINDING TEETH) Bruxism is grinding of the teeth, typically accompanied by clenching of the jaw. In most people, bruxism is mild enough not to be a health problem; however, some people suffer from more significant bruxism that can become symptomatic. Bruxism often occurs during sleep and can even occur during short naps. Most bruxers are not aware of their bruxism and only 5-10% go on to develop symptoms such as jaw pain and headache. Bruxism is one of the most common sleep disorders with millions of people grinding their teeth during sleep, with the grinding sound often disturbing their partners. As relaxation techniques are known to reduce Bruxism (see statistics), hypnotherapy is very effective in achieving long-lasting results. By using  Self-Hypnosis, taught free of charge to all interested clients, Bruxers can help themselves reduce symptoms before going to sleep. Practising this wonderful skill enables rapid long-lasting achievement of desired results. Unsure about hypnotherapy or what to expect from your sessions with me? Please click here.

Back to top EMOTIONAL ABUSE Emotional abuse can be inflicted by a whole host of people (parents, siblings, teachers, school bullies, work colleagues and partners to mention a few) and often not only results in a severe lack of confidence, but also in an inability to control emotions such as anger, anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, emotional abuse is often not taken as seriously as physical abuse, even though its resulting emotional scars can be just as debilitating. Traditional hypnotherapy techniques, counselling, EMDR and Solution Focussed Therapy can all help to restore confidence and control in a surprisingly short time. They work particularly effectively with people who rationally understand how they should feel or behave in certain situations, but find themselves reacting completely irrationally, as it if were out of their conscious control. If you recognise this pattern in yourself, do please call so that we can work together to help you regain control of your emotions and behaviour. You'll probably be surprised at how quickly this can happen. Unsure about hypnotherapy or what to expect from your sessions with me? Please click here.

Back to top CONFIDENCE (LACK OF) Confidence can be described as a faith in one's own ability. People with high self-confidence typically have little fear of the unknown, are able to stand up for what they believe in, and have the courage to risk embarrassment, for example, by giving a presentation to a large group of people. Self-confidence  decreases with the loss of trust in one's ability to perform. This may be as a result of past failure, or as a result of a more general self-doubt. Either way, if not conquered, it can lead to debilitating shyness and a reluctance to try new or unfamiliar experiences, often becoming  a self-fulfilling prophecy. Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy is extremely effective in helping clients increase their confidence levels. Sessions are individually tailored  to each client so  they can feel comfortable with the pace of their own progress. By using  Self-Hypnosis, taught free of charge to all interested clients, clients can feel more empowered as they help themselves every day.

Back to top ERYTHROPHOBIA (BLUSHING) Erythrophobia is a fear of Blushing. Blushing displays a marked redness of the face as a result of embarrassment, shame, or modesty. Those suffering from erythrophobia usually experience anxiety, stemming from concerns about being the focus of attention which may lead to embarrassment. Many who try to hide blushing usually end up making the condition  worse. As a result, Erythrophobia sufferers try to avoid social gatherings, public speaking engagements, and other situations involving large groups of people. Traditional hypnotherapy techniques can help suffers control the extent of their blushing and Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy ensures that they change their perception of the condition, enabling them to achieve their full potential, socially and professionally.

Back to top EXAM NERVES Most people experience varying degrees of anxiety before exams. Whilst moderate amount of exam stress can help with focus and motivation, too much stress may cause symptoms of anxiety - panic attacks, insomnia and irritability - all of which would prevent the sufferer from achieving their full potential in the exam, or in extreme cases may lead to total avoidance of exams. For those people suffering with excessive exam nerves, it is important to keep on top of reactions by learning stress-reduction techniques such as the use of Self-Hypnosis and Autogenic Training, taught free of charge to all interested clients.

Back to top FEAR OF FLYING Fear of flying is the fear of travelling by plane and can manifest as early as the planning or ticket-booking stages. Sufferers experience a level of anxiety so great that it prevents them from flying, or causes them great distress when they are compelled to do so. The most extreme manifestations can include panic attacks or vomiting at the mere sight or mention of an aircraft or air travel. Fear of flying may be a distinct phobia in itself, or it may be an indirect manifestation of one or more other phobias, such as Claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), Acrophobia (a fear of heights), fear of not being in control, fear of having panic attacks in certain places where escape would be difficult and/or embarrassing (agoraphobia), fear of hijacking or terrorism, fear of turbulence, fear of flying over water, fear of flying at night or fear of crashing, resulting in injury or death This widespread fear receives more attention than many other phobias because air travel is often difficult for people to avoid - especially in professional contexts. A previous traumatizing experience with air travel or somehow connected to air travel can also trigger a fear of flying. Traditional hypnotherapy uses techniques such as systematic desensitisation to specific triggers, whilst inducing a wonderful state of relaxation. Clients can also be taught relaxation techniques, Autogenic Training and Self-Hypnosis, taught free of charge to all interested clients. Practising these wonderful skill enables rapid long-lasting achievement of desired results. Unsure about hypnotherapy or what to expect from your sessions with me? Please click here.

Back to top FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING Fear of public speaking can often lead to avoidance of making presentations or at work speaking in front of large groups in other situations, and may often result in the sufferer missing out on great opportunities for promotion, networking or increasing their social circles. Stress before making a presentation may also affect relationships with loved ones, and performance anxiety may prevent the realisation of dreams and future goals. Symptoms may include:  Fear of losing control  Fear of embarrassment in front of others  Heart palpitations  Panic Attacks  Anxiety  Fear of blushing  Insomnia  Fear of forgetting what to say  Stress  Constant monitoring of bodily symptoms  Hyperventilation How many opportunities have already been missed due to performance anxiety? Imagine how far you could go with more confidence. Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy is extremely effective in helping clients increase their confidence levels and, as its name suggests, works on emotions, beliefs and behaviour. Sessions are individually tailored  to each client so  they can feel comfortable with the pace of their own progress. Self-Hypnosis and Autogenic Training, taught free of charge to all interested clients, can help them to feel more empowered as they help themselves every day.

Back to top HEADACHES Headaches rank amongst the most common local pain complaints. Common causes are tension, migraine, eye strain, dehydration, low blood sugar, and sinusitis. A large percentage of headaches among women are caused by fluctuating hormonal levels. It may be possible to relate the occurrence of a headache to  particular triggers such as stress or particular foods, which can then be avoided.** Traditional hypnotherapy and autogenic training are very effective in helping clients control tension headaches due to its relaxing nature.

Back to top MOTIVATION Lack of motivation and ensuing procrastination are incredibly common in this day and age for a variety of reasons such as lack of confidence, lack of direction, fear of failure, lack of focus, reluctance to stepping out of one's comfort zone and a low tolerance of discomfort.

Back to top PERFORMANCE ANXIETY Performance anxiety can be a debilitating condition, preventing the sufferer from reaching their full potential in different areas of their life including work, social life and personal relationships and leading to lowered self-esteem and irritability. Sufferers report feelings of extreme anxiety when faced with situations in which they must perform in the presence of others. Symptoms of this anxiety vary from one individual to another and may include panic attacks, sweating, increased heart rate, hyperventilation, nausea, shaking, insomnia, increased urination, blushing, stammering, going blank, dizziness and, in the cases of sexual performance, anxiety may lead to erectile dysfunction or impotence. The symptoms are often so extreme that they lead to avoidance of the situations which invoke them. Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy is  remarkably effective in the treatment of performance anxiety and I often also incorporate the use of traditional techniques such as systematic desensitisation, EMDR, Solution Focussed Therapy, Autogenic Training and Anchoring where necessary. Regular practise of Self-Hypnosis will help the client maintain control over their emotions and remain calm and relaxed when performing.

Many people who have experienced physical abuse often experience feelings of extreme anger and/or anxiety and lose confidence in their ability to control both their emotions and behaviour. Traditional hypnotherapy techniques, counselling, EMDR and Solution Focussed Therapy can all help to restore confidence and control in a surprisingly short time.

Back to top PHOBIAS AND PHOBIC DISORDERS Phobias are irrational, intense, persistent fears of certain activities, situations, objects or people. The main symptoms of a phobia are characterised by an excessive, unreasonable desire to avoid the feared element. These fears are beyond one's control, and often interfere with daily life. Phobias are the most common form of anxiety disorders. Phobias can emerge from a combination of external events and internal predispositions. Many specific phobias can be traced back to a specific triggering event, usually a traumatic experience at an early age. Social phobias and agoraphobia have more complex causes. I use a variety of techniques, including systematic desensitisation, EMDR, Autogenic Training and Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy to help clients rid themselves of these restricting disorders, often in only one session. Phobias treated include: • Social phobias  fears of social situations, performance anxiety, fear of interaction with other people, embarrassment by scrutiny of others, embarrassment by eating in public and embarrassment when urinating in public toilets. • Specific phobia s – fears of specific panic triggers such as spiders, snakes, birds, dogs, elevators, water, flying, being sick, catching a specific illness, heights, etc. • Agoraphobia – a generalized fear of leaving home (or familiar 'safe' area), and of possible panic attacks that might follow. Phobias vary in severity among individuals. Some people can simply avoid the subject of their fear and suffer only relatively mild anxiety over that fear. Others suffer fully-fledged panic attacks with all the associated disabling symptoms. Most individuals understand that they are suffering from an irrational fear, but feel powerless to override their initial panic reaction. Both traditional and Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy techniques, including systematic desensitisation and EMDR can help clients rid themselves of these restricting disorders, often in only one session. Practising Self-hypnosis and/or Autogenic Training, taught free of charge to all interested clients, can help maintain a feeling of calmness and control.

Back to top SEXUAL ABUSE Childhood sexual abuse is likely to leave long-lasting scars in those who experience it and yet, survivors of this abuse are often remarkably resilient. This kind of abuse is incomprehensible to an adult, so a child cannot possibly make sense of it and this unfortunately often leads to the child blaming him or herself and carrying feelings of guilt and shame for many years. Further insecurities are also experienced as the child grows older and may feel they cannot rely on their judgement about who they can and cannot trust, while cues such as sounds or smells commonly trigger feelings of anxiety, anger or depression. Traditional hypnotherapy techniques, counselling, EMDR and Solution Focussed Therapy can  help  restore confidence, control and feelings of safety. They work particularly effectively with people who rationally understand how they should feel or behave in certain situations, but find themselves reacting completely irrationally, as it if were out of their conscious control. If you recognise this pattern in yourself, do please call so that we can work together to help you regain control of your emotions and behaviour.

Back to top SMOKING CESSATION If you've clicked on the Smoking Cessation link you've probably already decided you want to become a non-smoker. Stop smoking now quickly and easily with one hypnosis session. Join our list of delighted clients who have kicked the habit in only one easy session. Over 85% of our clients stop smoking after just one session. However, a highly discounted follow-up session is offered at only £30 if needed within the following 30 days. Book an appointment now and leave the session as a non-smoker! Hypnotherapy is so successful as an application for smoking cessation because it can access both the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind. In this way we can challenge  self-limiting beliefs about how stressful it will be to quit or any reasons you may have for continuing to smoke and replace these with positive feelings of calm, control and relaxation so that you have no desire to smoke. In 2001, New Scientist reported the largest ever scientific comparison of ways to stop smoking. Of all the methods analysed, the survey found that Hypnotherapy was by far the most effective, five times more effective than willpower alone and three times more effective than nicotine gum. New Scientist (Vol.136,issue 1845): "... most techniques turned out to be hopeless. Hypnosis, however, came out as the most effective anti-smoking technique."

Back to top SPORT PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT To reach and harness their true potential, athletes and sports people must train their minds as well as their bodies, to gain the ultimate positive state of mind and optimum focus. Solution Focussed Therapy with traditional and Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapy can help clients to identify and conquer mental barriers or negative beliefs and enhance their sporting performance using similar mental imagery techniques to that used by the likes of golfer Tiger Woods and Olympic diver Greg Louganis and footballer Michael Owen. These techniques are as successful for clients wishing to improve their weekend tennis game as they are for professional athletes. In hypnotic trance you will be able to see yourself practising and perfecting that flawless free kick or the optimal backhand, using muscle memory to train your mind and body. In addition to this you can be desensitised to your opponent's attempts to psyche you out and use techniques such as anchoring to quickly and easily get yourself into the zone. Sports coaches claim that 80% of an Olympic athlete's performance is in the mind. To prevent fear of humiliation or their opponents' intimidation affecting their skill, they use hypnosis techniques before and during their performance. With hypnosis you can: • Develop new techniques with mental imagery. • Remove limiting beliefs and fear of failure (or success). • Revisit previous good performances and install anchors to access resourceful states at whenever they are needed without others noticing. • Give yourself more time, for example to hit a tennis ball, by slowing your perception of time. • Replace your current negative self-image with one of an Olympic athlete, installing their traits and techniques. • Enhance endurance. • Remove hesitation and anxiety during competition. • Reframe the pain experienced, for example during a marathon, to make it more tolerable. • Motivate yourself to lead the lifestyle and stick to the healthy diet needed to get maximum sporting results.

Back to top STRESS When asked to define stress, most people give a description that includes overwhelming feelings of anxiety, anger, frustration, and physical symptoms such as lack of energy, insomnia and IBS, which they may try to compensate for by resorting to over eating, drinking alcohol, smoking or taking medication to calm themselves or to enhance their mood. But many people are unaware of a physical chain of events that takes place in our bodies when we feel stressed. It is widely accepted that it took man millions of years to evolve to accommodate changing climates and circumstances, but in the last couple of centuries our bodies have been bombarded with thousands of new chemicals (added to our food and found in common household products), pollutants and radiation (from computers, cordless 'phones, TVs etc), not to mention the relentless pace of life that we have adopted in the last century, and especially since the introduction of personal computers and mobile 'phones. Unfortunately, our bodies have not had time to evolve in response to these factors so react to them in the same way as they would have done hundreds of thousands of years ago - with the 'fight or flight' response. As a consequence, when our bodies are physically or emotionally overburdened the following changes take place: • Pupils dilate - letting in more light to help us to see more effectively • Heart rate and force increase - to enable increased blood flow to muscles and essential organs • Bronchial (lung) muscles relax - to widen the airways and take in more oxygen • Liver increases blood glucose concentration - to increase our energy • Adrenals secrete more adrenalin and cortisol - to help deal with pain and stress • Blood is redistributed from less to more active organs and muscles All these reactions sound positive and harmless enough, BUT they are meant to be temporary (ie to allow you to fight or take flight and then recover) and because blood is distributed from less to more active organs and muscles, all the above reactions happen at the expense of other vital systems in our bodies, which are not needed in emergencies, for example: • Saliva and mucus production are reduced • Digestive function and peristalsis are reduced • Kidneys decrease urine secretion • Adrenalin narrows blood vessels in the skin • Function in reproductive and other non-essential organs is reduced In most cases the body’s fight or flight reactions are wasted as, unlike our ancestors, we rarely have to fight or take flight and usually just bottle up our emotions. Consequently, the strain of trying to rebalance all our systems for prolonged periods of time exhausts our bodies' systems and causes us to feel stressed.

Thus it is a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. " Anxiety We found that patients in the hypnosis group were significantly less anxious postintervention as compared with patients in the attention-control group and the control group. Moreover, on entrance to the operating rooms, the hypnosis group reported a significant decrease of 56% in their anxiety level whereas the attention-control group reported an increase of 10% in anxiety and the control group reported an increase of 47% in their anxiety. In conclusion, we found that hypnosis significantly alleviates preoperative anxiety. Weight control "At the end of the 9-week program, both interventions resulted in significant weight reduction.
