Log in Home Blog Article Products About Dr.George The Clinic The College Contact Discussion Forum Cinnamon Lowers Blood Sugar in Diabetic Animals 02-Dec-2010 Cinnamon lowers blood sugar and raises levels of HDL, the “good” cholesterol, in type 2 diabetic rats, a new study has found. Researchers administered cinnamon extract at different dosages (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg) to the animals for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, blood glucose concentration was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner with the largest reduction in the 200 mg/kg group compared with the control. HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher and the concentration of triglycerides and total cholesterol were significantly lower after the 6-week study. “These results suggest that cinnamon extract has a regulatory role in blood glucose level and lipids,” the study authors wrote, “and it may also exert a blood glucose-suppressing effect by improving insulin sensitivity or slowing absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine.” Reference: Kim SH, Hyun SH, Choung SY.
