Yes. Chromium is found primarily in two forms, trivalent, which is biologically active and found in food, and hexavalent, a toxic form that results from industrial pollution. Chromium polynicotinate, a complex of chromium bonded with nicotinic acid, is present in the trivalent form, which is considered very safe and devoid of documented reports of toxicity. In addition, chromium polynicotinate has been investigated for its efficacy in various conditions, including support of healthy glucose metabolism, cholesterol, and triglyceride metabolism. † Ask a Question Fill out the form below to ask a question about this product.
