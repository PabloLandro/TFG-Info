Aloe Aloe Vera | Health Information Bookmark Health Information Make Health Information Your Homepage ALOE ALOE VERA Herbal Medicine ALOE (Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f.) (Gel) ++ Synonyms: - A. barbadensis Mill., A. perfoliata var. vera L., A. vulgaris Lam. The gel is used folklorically, and the dried inner leaf juice pharmaceutically as a laxative. There is much confusion resulting from different interpretations by botanists, chemists, collectors, herbalists, pharmaceuticists, physicians, and taxonomists. I dont know the herbalist or taxonomist who can identify aloe to species by its latex or leaves alone. Here, I have tried to sort out what I think was intended by the authors, mostly also compilers like myself, interpreting the studies of others. Potters New Cyclopedia tried to straighten things out by calling the gel  aloe vera  and the purgative powder  aloes.  Fleming (1998) aggregates it all inextricably, dried and fresh leaf juice, whole leaves, and the gel (PHR, PH2). Its even botched in the Bible, according to Biblical scholars. Aloe in the Old Testament is said to be Aquilaria, while that of the New Testament is said to be our Aloe vera.
