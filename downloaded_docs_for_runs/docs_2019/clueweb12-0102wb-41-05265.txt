Barefoot Science Arch Activation System is designed to correct some foot problems at the source. It gently works and rehabilitates weak foot muscles and lazy arches, helping restore the optimal foot function. The system helps improve foot alignment & strength in conjunction with other forms of exercise. Doctors recognize Barefoot Science a major advance in relief for the millions suffering from foot, lower limb, and back pain. Research shows that, aside from trauma, our footwear is most often to blame. And even more surprising, conventional insoles and orthotics actually make things worse. Although they may provide short-term relief, they dont address the cause of the problem - weak foot muscles. Thats because conventional insoles and orthotics rob your feet of the ground stimulus necessary to activate foot muscles require for natural healthy foot function. As a result, you lose the natural shock absorption of the foots arch and the stress travels up the feet, ankles, knees and lower back . . . and you feel the pain. But all that is about to change, thanks to Barefoot Science. Its not a cushioning or passive insert, says Dr. Fowler, rather, it utilizes an insole with a series of progressively firmer inserts to stimulate and restore your feet with every step you take. Over several weeks, you move from the extra soft to the firmer inserts as your foot muscles get stronger. And that means a healthier functioning arch for superior natural shock absorption and a coiled spring effect in the foot, says Dr. Fowler. In my practice, Ive seen firsthand the effectiveness of Barefoot Science. Even my most challenging patients, those whove used orthotics with no success, have found dramatic improvements in foot function and pain levels using the System. Each pair comes complete with FIVE levels of progressive arch activation inserts. Fantastic prices with ease & comfort of Amazon.com!

The low profile design fits casual, dress, and cleated footwear. The Flat Foot Insole was designed to reduce over-pronation and help relieve foot, knee, hip and lower back pain associated with having flat feet or low arches, but they will not fix the abnormalities of having flat feet as they are not a corrective device. We do not recommend that you use the Flat Foot Insole with a normal arch as it may cause problems rather than alleviate them. If you are a diabetic with flat feet, do not wear this insole. Flat Foot Insoles do not work with other insoles or orthotics. Remove existing insoles or orthotics before inserting the Flat Foot Insoles. Shoes that have a built-in (non-removable) arch support or highly raised arch area may cause discomfort. If you wear orthotics, consult your Doctor before wearing Flat Foot Insoles. If you experience acute discomfort or pain from wearing Flat Foot Insoles, discontinue use. Allow for a few days of light to moderate activity using the Flat Foot Insoles before engaging in strenuous workouts or long distance runs. The first few times you wear the insoles, you may feel slight pressure in the arch area and/or some tightness in the calf muscles.

If you like the feel of powestep orthotics then you'll like the extra benefits these Sport Sole insoles have. The leather top cover is great for hygiene purposes and the fabric covered insoles is great if you desire a softer feel. The orthotic is heat adjustable. The following are the instructions for adjusting: If you just heat adjust from the bottom side in the arch area that will allow you to either raise or lower the arch. You do this by bending it into the desired way (increase or decrease) then holding it there until it cools down a bit. You should only heat it up 30 seconds or so. Depends on how heat your heat gun gets. But, if it is to hot for you to touch it you heated to much. TIP: "I often after heating it and bending it I will place it under cold water or into a bowl while holding it. That helps it cool down and then retain its position."
