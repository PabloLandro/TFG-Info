Contact Us Article Search Content Magnesium for Sports & Fitness Why Use Dosage & Side Effects More Resources Magnesium Related Topics Magnesium as a Nutritional Supplement Sports Supplements Why Do Athletes Use It?* Some athletes say that magnesium helps curb dehydration and prevent muscle cramping. What Do the Advocates Say?* People who are doing “heavy-duty” exercise lose a lot of magnesium through urination and sweat, so it’s important that it’s replaced. To keep water in the blood vessels, electrolytes, such as magnesium, need to be replaced. Therefore, to curb dehydration, electrolyte drinks are more effective than plain water. Magnesium helps to prevent muscle cramping after exercise, too. *Athletes and fitness advocates may claim benefits for this supplement based on their personal or professional experience.
