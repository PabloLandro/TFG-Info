Despite confusion most likely due to their similar names, valerian and the benzodiazepine sedative Valium are completely unrelated. Current research indicates that valerian’s therapeutic effects are likely a result of synergistic action of many of this plant’s constituents, and not one single molecule. Traditionally taken in a dose of 20 drops two times daily or as directed by your physician.                                    Container: 2 Fluid oz./60 ml.
