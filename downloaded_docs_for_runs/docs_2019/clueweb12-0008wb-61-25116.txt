2009  February | Protopic Protopic FedEx overnight shipping and free prescription at MyRxPill.com Archive for February, 2009 « Older Entries Infections and Eczema Thursday, February 26th, 2009 If skin gets very dry and broken, it can easily become infected with germs called bacteria. It’s important to recognise an infection early so that it can be treated quickly. If it’s not treated, it can get worse and spread. Infections often start where your or your child’s skin touches skin, for example under the arm or in the groin. It’s good to check those areas regularly. Some symptoms that can mean you have an infection are: * Crusty yellow blisters * Oozing areas of skin where blisters have burst. Skin infections can be caused by germs called bacteria and fungi. So these sometimes need to be treated with antibiotics, which kill the the germs that caused the infection and stop it spreading Antifungal drugs are used to treat infections caused by fungi. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in allergies , atopic , cleocin-t gel , cream , dermatitis , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , dry skin , eczema , elidel , gris-peg , irritation , itchy , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , nummular , ointment , penlac , pharmacy , prevent , protopic , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , sumycin , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » Self-Care For Eczema Wednesday, February 18th, 2009 There are many things you can try at home to help control your or your child’s eczema symptoms. These might also help prevent flare-ups. Which self-care treatments work best for eczema? We’ve carefully weighed up the research and divided the treatments into categories. Treatments that are likely to work * Moisturisers: Lotions, ointments and creams that help keep moisture in the skin often protect against eczema and can help relieve symptoms. Treatments that need further study * Avoiding certain fabrics: Some fabrics make eczema worse for some people. More… * Avoiding detergents: Very often, soaps and detergents make eczema worse. More… * Avoiding animals: Animal fur, feathers or skin can make some people’s eczema worse. More… * Changing what you or your child eats: If certain foods seem to trigger an allergic reaction, you may want to cut them out of your diet. More… * Reducing levels of house dust mites: Certain cleaning methods can help get rid of house dust mites, and special bed covers and sheets protect against them. Other treatments Some people use alternative treatments to treat their eczema. We haven’t looked at the research in the same way we have looked at research for other treatments on our site. But we’ve included them here because lots of people are interested in alternative treatments.

But we need more research to be sure. We found one good-quality study (called a randomised controlled trial) of nearly 160 pregnant women who had a close relative with eczema. The women were either given probiotics for the last few weeks of their pregnancy and for six months after their baby was born or a dummy treatment (placebo). The study found that when the babies were two years and four years old: * 1 in 4 of the babies whose mothers took probiotics had eczema. * Nearly 1 in 2 of the babies whose mothers had the dummy treatment had eczema. Two studies have looked at babies who were given prebiotics in formula milk. * One of these studies looked at children who were at high risk of getting eczema because they had close relatives with allergies. Taking prebiotics reduced the risk of eczema for these children. But this was a small study, and lots of children dropped out before the end. This may make the results less reliable. * The other study looked at children who had a low risk of eczema. It found that having prebiotics made no difference. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in allergies , atopic , babies , cleocin-t gel , cream , dermatitis , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , dry skin , eczema , elidel , gris-peg , irritation , itchy , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , nummular , ointment , penlac , pharmacy , prevent , protopic , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , sumycin , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » How To Remove Eczema Monday, February 16th, 2009 Stop The Itching For Good!

Many conventional diaper rash creams offer little or no treatment, and can actually cause the rash to become worse, especially if they contain questionable ingredients that are inappropriate for baby skin. If there is broken skin, the diaper rash ointment can get under the skin and irritate it. It also masks the problem and leaves the bottom area still moist under the diaper. Instead, the rash should be taken care of in a natural manner that is safe for baby and gentle. When you change the baby’s diaper, switch to using a moist (with water only) baby washcloth to cleanse your baby’s bottom instead of baby wipes, which often contain drying and irritating ingredients. If you’re on the run, you can carry some wet washcloths in a baggie. Look for washcloths made with unbleached, organic cotton, if possible. If this is too difficult, then at least look for hypoallergenic wipes that are unscented and that do not have preservatives and alcohols but that use essential oils and botanicals. Prepare a bath with colloidal oatmeal. You can make your own oatmeal bath by grinding oats finely in the blender or Vita-Mix and then putting them in the bath either straight up or in a muslin tea bag (less mess). You can also find products at the health food store that contain colloidal oatmeal that helps reduce the inflammation and itchiness of the rash. Make sure the bath is nice and warm, but not too hot. Let your baby play in the water about 10-15 minutes. In the bath, be sure to only use unscented products with no perfumes or dyes. You want to be gentle with baby’s skin and only use products that won’t irritate the skin with fragrances and dyes. When the bath is done, rinse your baby off with warm water and pat dry carefully. After the bath, and after each diaper change until the rash has healed, allow your baby to be naked for as long as possible. This allows the rash to be exposed to air and begin the healing process, naturally. When the diaper is on, it only blocks bacteria and moisture back into the skin, which doesn’t allow the skin to breathe. During this “naked time” you can do several things. You can either leave your baby naked, or if you are afraid of him or her peeing on furniture, you can use a clean, cotton cloth to create your own diaper, the way diapers used to be put on. Or if you happen to have reusable cotton diapers, use one of those instead. At the end of the naked time, apply a diaper rash cream made from botanical ingredients. Put on the diaper loosely and check often to see if they need to be changed. Depending on the severeness of the rash, you should see a visible improvement within one to three days time. If you are concerned the diaper rash has worsened or is not diaper rash at all, be sure to call the baby’s health care provider to see what steps must be taken next. If the diaper rash is constantly reoccurring, consider switching to chlorine-free, fragrance-free and hypoallergenic diapers instead, or cloth diapers. Incidentally cloth diapered babies get fewer episodes of diaper rash in the first place. If you’re already using cloth, try removing the waterproof cover for as long as possible and simply letting baby wear a pinned on prefold for maximum air circulation. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in allergies , atopic , babies , cleocin-t gel , cream , diprolene af , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , elidel , gris-peg , irritation , itchy , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , penlac , pharmacy , prevent , protopic , rash , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , sumycin , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » What’s The Evidence For Pimecrolimus? Saturday, February 14th, 2009 There’s good evidence that pimecrolimus can help relieve the symptoms of eczema. But because pimecrolimus is so new, there isn’t any good evidence to show that it causes less harm than steroid treatments. So doctors don’t yet know if pimecrolimus has significant advantages over steroid creams and ointments. We found one summary of the research (called a systematic review) that looked at the results from 11 good-quality studies (called randomised controlled trials) involving more than 2500 people. After a few weeks, the people using pimecrolimus were much more likely to see their eczema clear up. The summary also found that pimecrolimus can prevent flare-ups. Pimecrolimus has also been shown to help babies with eczema. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in allergies , atopic , cleocin-t gel , cream , dermatitis , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , dry skin , eczema , elidel , gris-peg , irritation , itchy , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , nummular , ointment , penlac , pharmacy , pimecrolimus , prevent , protopic , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , sumycin , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » Eczema The Itchy Irritation Friday, February 13th, 2009 Eczema is not just about the dry itchy skin, or the cracked, broken, and flaky skin.

Half lots of sun exposure and the risk of sunburns. While too much sun can cause skin damage and sunburns, moderate sun is good for our health. Sunshine is our best source of vitamin D, which actually reduces the risk of certain cancers and other diseases. It is important to get some moderate sunlight daily, but avoid burning. To avoid sunburns, we must take certain precautions. Many of us, including children, can only be in direct sunlight for about 10 or 15 minutes before feeling some effects of burning, while others may not be safe for 20 to 30 minutes. A moderate exposure to sunlight on a daily basis is beneficial for your health and your child. You can minimize exposure to the sun during the hours of 10 a.m. and 3pm, when the sun is hotter. If you have to go out during these times, be sure to use adequate protection. The best protection is to use a wide-brimmed hat and natural fiber clothing that protects the skin, but honestly do not normally use such protection. What is most commonly used is sunscreen. However, sunscreens are not necessarily safe for us? Parents are known for large lathering on sunscreen their children daily during the summer months. But sunscreen can be very toxic and that is definitely not something you want your child to freely apply the skin daily. Some common ingredients found in sunscreens are suspected carcinogens. The ingredients include, but are not limited to triethanolamine, diethanolamine (TEA, DEA), benzophenone, oxybenzone, homosalate, salicylates and parabens. Many studies have been done and have shown that some of the most popular sites can contribute to cancer due to its mutagenic and the generation of free radicals properties. But one of the most disturbing findings is that many commonly used sunscreens contain chemicals that have strong estrogenic actions. What does that mean? This means that it can interfere with normal sexual development and can cause reproductive problems. Some studies also have shown that chemicals found in sunscreens can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The longer the chemicals are left on the skin over the absorption in the bloodstream. But there is no need to fear, there is a healthy alternative to the popular and dangerous sites on the market. Zinc oxide is a mineral that provides complete protection against UVB and UVA rays. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and is considered a safe sunscreen. The only drawback is the strong white residue left on the skin when applied. There are certain plots available zinc oxide, which also did not convert his white skin. Be sure to check the label, sized particles of zinc oxide, that some products being used to avoid turning the skin, while still in the testing stages, it is not clear about the safety of particles size. There are organic products in the market that contain particles, and are safe for use on adults and children. As always be careful when using chemicals and be sure to read the labels, not only to protect his family of chemicals, but also the effects of sunburns. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in allergies , aloe , atopic , cleocin-t gel , cream , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , dry skin , elidel , gris-peg , irritation , itchy , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , penlac , pharmacy , prevent , protopic , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , summer , sumycin , sun , sunburn , sunlight , sunscreen , swimming , symptoms , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » Eczema Treatments May Vary By Person And Severity of Symptoms Tuesday, February 10th, 2009 If you’ve been diagnosed with eczema, you’re probably relieved to finally know what has been causing you all the discomfort and embarrassment. Your doctor or dermatologist will first explain what type of eczema you have and then he’ll go over eczema treatments with you. The type of eczema treatments will depend on the type of eczema, your medical history and the severity of your symptoms. The main goals of the eczema treatments will be to reduce the skin inflammation, control itching, loosen and remove scaly lesions, clear any infections and prevent or reduce new lesions. It’s important to realize that there is no miracle or instant cure for eczema and you may have to try a few different eczema treatments before you find one that is working effectively. Most doctors and dermatologists have found that a combination of different therapies seems to be more effective in treating eczema. One recommendation your doctor will make will be for you to make some lifestyle changes. This may not cure the eczema, but it may prevent you from having future flare-ups as well as reduce any possible side effects you may have from the prescribed medications. Your doctor may give you your preference as to eczema treatments or medication. One of the most common treatments is topical medication or steroids. Topical medication is medication that is applied to the skin such as creams, lotions and ointments. Topical steroids my be over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams or stronger steroids that require a prescription. Strong steroids are usually avoided with children, however. Some of the common steroid creams include Dermatop, Cutivate, Locoed and Elocon. Side effects such as stretch marks and skin thinning may occur if these are used too long. Many patients prefer to use topical medications without steroids, in which case, they often use Elidel or Protopic. These are considered quite safe eczema treatments for children and can be applied on the face, unlike the stronger medications. They are also effective in preventing flare-ups when they are applied at the first sign of itching or the rash. Another type of eczema treatments that are often used are antihistamines. Antihistamines are quite effective as eczema treatments. One reason for this is that eczema is often thought of as being allergy-related. They are also recommended for children because they help the child to rest better at night without itching. Benadryl and Atarax are two medications that work well. Applying cold compresses also helps to relieve itching. In more severe cases, your doctor may recommend ultraviolet light therapy and phototherapy. Before you choose to do one treatment you must know all the risks for each treatment and you can ask to your doctor or dermatologist. As we know with the new technology improvement they can minimize it. buy cheap protopic skin care free prescription pills FedEx overnight shipping free prescription online pharmacy Posted in allergies , atopic , cleocin-t gel , cream , dermatitis , diprolene af , disease , doctor , Dovonex , drugs , drugstore , dry skin , eczema , elidel , gris-peg , irritation , itchy , kenalog , lamisil oral , medication , medicine , meds , moisture , nizoral , nummular , ointment , penlac , pharmacy , prevent , protopic , remedies , renova , retin-a , silymarin , skin , skin care , sumycin , synalar , temovate , tips , treatment | No Comments » « Older Entries Archives November 2010 October 2010 August 2010 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 Pages Sitemap Protopic is pro
