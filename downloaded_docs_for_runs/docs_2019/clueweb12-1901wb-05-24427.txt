If you don’t try how will you ever know Stop Smoking Permanently With Hypnotherapy Hypnosis has been effectively and safely used as a method to help people quit smoking for hundreds of years and has been recognized by many medical associations. Before moving ahead let me first tell you exactly what hypnotherapy is. Hypnotherapy is a process, which helps you to relax your mind and body, moving past the guard of your conscious mind, to the subconscious mind. Our conscious mind constantly grades and judges all our thoughts and inputs, whereas our subconscious mind is like a sponge and absorbs whatever you give it. Our subconscious mind is not able to differentiate between reality and imagination. Hypnotherapy helps you to imagine yourself as a non-smoker and your subconscious mind accepts that as a reality, thus eradicating the habit of smoking. Hypnotherapy is designed in such a way that it helps you to overcome the psychological addiction towards cigarettes. It helps you to believe you are a non-smoker and decreases the chances of relapsing. There are two ways hypnosis helps you to quit smoking permanently. In this method, you undergo specific training and expertise. This method basically involves programs such as audio hypnosis and video hypnosis. The important thing about quit smoking hypnotherapy is you will get used to it. Hypnosis is a powerful tool in changing your behavior. The only thing you need to do is re-program your brain through various good quit smoking suggestions (stop smoking for the family). By doing this you will soon be able to efficiently get over the addiction permanently. Hypnotherapy for smokers provides two main benefits: •	It reduces stress and involves learning techniques that help you to overcome stress •	Hypnotherapy hits the bull’s eye by changing your attitude, beliefs and associations towards smoking and completely eradicates the habit of smoking. Relapse rate: As hypnosis permanently changes the smokers’ attitude towards smoking, there is a little chance of relapse at any point in the future. However, every coin has a flip side and Hypnotherapy is no exception. It is found that hypnotherapy comes with a success rate of 66% and to get this success rate you will have to pay attention to a couple of details. First of all, you will have to undergo at least 4 sessions. Secondly, if you are planning to undergo hypnotherapy you will have to do so with a licensed therapist, which can be very much hard to find.
