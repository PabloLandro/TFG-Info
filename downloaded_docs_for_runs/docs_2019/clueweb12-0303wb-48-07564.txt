       been studied for almost 10 years. Overall, they have been given to more
       than 600,000 people worldwide. A “biologic” drug copies the effects of
       substances naturally made by your body's immune system. Biologic agents
       are genetically engineered drugs – meaning that human genes that normally
       guide the production of these natural human immune proteins (i.e., an
       antibody to TNF) are used in non-human cell cultures to produce large
       amounts of a biologic drug. These drugs are given to lessen inflammation
       by interfering with biologic substances that cause or worsen inflammation.
       These new biologic agents can specifically affect some of the abnormalities
       of the immune system that lead to the joint inflammation and other abnormalities
       seen in rheumatoid arthritis and so help treat its symptoms. Uses Biologic agents have been approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis that has not responded to an adequate trial of one or more of the traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Because of their expense and side effects, most people with mild to moderate rheumatoid arthritis are treated with methotrexate before a biologic agent is used unless they are unable to take methotrexate because of side effects or other conditions. Biologic agents may be used alone, but are often given in conjunction with other DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate , leflunomide , hydroxychloroquine , sulfasalazine ), to increase the benefit and limit potential side effects.  When patients start biologic agents, they usually also remain on their current dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) and/or corticosteroid (i.e., prednisone) medicines. Some of the TNF inhibitors have been approved for use in juvenile
arthritis , Crohn’s colitis, psoriatic
arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. How it works Currently available biologic agents act as inhibitors of the cytokines
       IL-1 or TNF. Cytokines are messenger molecules made by many of the body's
       cells that act to excite other immune system cells. Interleukin-1 (L-1)
       and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are made in large amounts in rheumatoid
       arthritis and other forms of inflammation. In these diseases, TNF or IL-1
       act to increase inflammation, similar to the effect of gasoline on a fire.
       However, in rheumatoid arthritis TNF or IL-1 (the gasoline) acts to excite
       the inflamed joint (the fire). Hence, these cytokines amplify and worsen
       inflammation and joint damage. Biologic agents were made to specifically
       attach to TNF or IL-1 and inhibit or inactivate them. Table
       1 compares
       the different biologic drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis. Dosing For rheumatoid arthritis, the starting doses have been established by large clinical trials and are shown in Table 2.  Biologic agents must be given by an injection under the skin (etanercept (brand name Enbrel), adalimumab (brand name Humira) and anakinra (brand name Kineret)) or by intravenous (IV) infusion (infliximab (Remicade)).  These medications must be stored in a refrigerator and warmed to room temperature prior to use.  Patient education information and videos are available for the self injectable medicines.  A nurse or physician can teach you about the medicine and how to give the injections. It often helps to bring a spouse or friend with you to learn how to do the injections. You can inject the medicine in the front of your thighs or abdomen.  Injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used repeatedly.  Most patients who fear self-injection are usually able to give these injections repeatedly with mild or no discomfort. Remicade infusions are either done through an IV line in the doctor’s office or specialized infusion centers.  These treatments usually take 2-3 hours, during which time the patient can rest, read, watch TV or do office work without discomfort. Time to effect Biologic agents usually work quickly to relieve the symptoms and swelling associated with rheumatoid arthritis.  Although the studies show that most patients will improve within 4-6 weeks of treatment, most patients receiving Enbrel, Humira, or Remicade will notice marked improvement after the first or second injection. Side effects The most common side effects seen with the injectable medicines include
       skin reactions, which are called “injection site reactions.”  Skin reactions
       to injection occur in less than 30% of patients, and such patients usually
       complain of localized rash, burning, or itching at the site of injection.
       With Enbrel and Humira these skin reactions may last up to a week. Kineret
       injection skin reactions may last for 10-14 days before fading away without
       scar. The most significant side effect of these medications is an increase the risk
       of all types of infections, including tuberculosis (TB). Before starting
       an anti-TNF medication a TB skin test is usually done. Treatment with
       these agents should be stopped while you have an active infection and
       are taking an antibiotic or if you have a high fever. Remicade can cause
       allergic reactions. There are rare neurologic complications from the anti-TNF
       medications and people with multiple sclerosis should not use them. (See table 2 and package insert). People with significant congestive heart
       failure should not take the anti-TNF agents. Points to remember Biologic agents represent a new kind of treatment for patients with inflammatory arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis.  They are expensive (usually over $12,000 per year in the US), generally effective, well tolerated and quite safe in most patients, but do increase the risk of infections.  Their safety can be enhanced by proper screening procedures (e.g., TB skin test) and periodic monitoring of blood tests by your doctor.  Patients should request and read educational materials (including videos) from the doctor who prescribes these medicines.  Watching instructional videos and having another person give you these injections can minimize the fear of self-injection.
