BACKGROUND Male circumcision significantly reduced the  incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among men in  three clinical trials, but what about other STD's?. This study assessed  the efficacy of male circumcision for the prevention of herpes simplex  virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and  syphilis in HIV-negative adolescent boys and men. METHODS This Prospective work enrolled 5534 HIV-negative,  uncircumcised male subjects between the ages of 15 and 49 years in two  trials of male circumcision for the prevention of HIV and other sexually  transmitted infections. Of these subjects, 3393 (61.3%) were HSV-2- seronegative at enrollment. Of the seronegative subjects, 1684 had been randomly assigned to undergo immediate circumcision (intervention group) and 1709 to undergo circumcision after 24 months (control group). At baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months, the subjects were tested for HSV-2 and HIV infection and syphilis, along with performing physical examinations and conducting interviews. In addition, a subgroup of subjects was evaluated for HPV infection at baseline and at 24 months. RESULTS At 24 months, the cumulative probability of HSV-2  seroconversion was 7.8% in the intervention group and 10.3% in the  control group (adjusted hazard ratio in the intervention group, 0.72;  95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.92; P=0.008). The prevalence of  high-risk HPV genotypes was 18.0% in the intervention group and 27.9% in  the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90;  P=0.009). However, no significant difference between the two study  groups was observed in the incidence of syphilis (adjusted hazard ratio,  1.10; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.65; P=0.44). CONCLUSIONS In addition to decreasing the incidence of HIV  infection, male circumcision significantly reduced the incidence of  HSV-2 infection and the prevalence of HPV infection, findings that  underscore the potential public health benefits of the circumcision  procedure. back Section Editor Dr. Arik Shechter Family Physician Public practice of Sexual Health Haclalit sick f
