Pneumonia | Child Health | Kidica Pneumonia Symptoms and treatment of pneumonia What is pneumonia? Pneumonia is not a term for just one illness. Rather, it is a term that includes any illness in which the lungs are inflamed or infected. The alveoli, or air sacs, within the lungs that are responsible for absorbing oxygen are filled with mucus and stop functioning properly. Many types of pneumonia can be cured within one month, but pneumonia can also result in death, particularly among infants and the elderly. What are the types of pneumonia? Bacterial pneumonia is a bacterial infection of the lungs. The most common bacterium to cause pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can also be the culprit behind bacterial meningitis. Other forms of bacterial pneumonia can result when bacteria from the digestive system is displaced, as by vomit, and then inhaled into the lungs. Viral pneumonia is caused by invasive viruses including the very common influenza. Therefore, the common flu can often progress to viral pneumonia. This is the most common type of pneumonia found in children. Bronchial pneumonia , or bronchopneumonia, is a more progressed type of pneumonia in which the infection has spread to the bronchial tubes of the lungs. Walking pneumonia is a mild form of pneumonia that generally does not require hospitalization or bed rest. Because walking pneumonia symptoms are hard to detect, it is often difficult for the infected person to realize that they have pneumonia; they simply feel more tired than usual. People with walking pneumonia are often more sick than they appear. What are the causes of pneumonia? The causes of pneumonia vary depending on the type of pneumonia, but pneumonia generally results from fluid filling the lungs as a result of bacterial or viral infections. What are the symptoms of pneumonia? Pneumonia symptoms can also vary based on type. General symptoms of pneumonia include: fever shaking chills yellow-green phlegm difficulty breathing More serious pneumonia symptoms that may be revealed by medical tests are a fast heart rate and low blood pressure. How is pneumonia treated? Pneumonia treatment also varies depending on the type of pneumonia. Antibiotics are used when dealing with bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotics for pneumonia include Augmentin, Floxin and Ceftin. Viral pneumonia, on the other hand, cannot be treated by antibiotics, but generally, the virus subsides within weeks. Treatment for the various types of pneumonia almost always includes lots of rest and fluids, breathing exercises, and fever-reducing or pain-relieving medication. Is pneumonia contagious? Pneumonia is not technically contagious. While pneumonia is caused by bacteria and viruses, which can be transmitted from person to person, these germs do not always result in pneumonia. So, even if you are exposed to a person with pneumonia and have direct contact with the bacteria or virus, you will not necessarily contract pneumonia.

I think i am new with the environment which i used to for the past 10 years I was thinking that still I am in my adjustment period. Until I notice that I only have this feeling when I am exposed to dust and smoke. I was advice to take anti allergy every time i want to travel or when I am exposed to dust and so on... taking anti allergy really l works for me.. Until I decided to try not to take any antihistamine. To my surprise it did worst thing to me. I suffered dry cough and the worst thing for my second days I couldn't breath almost I suffered asthma.
the
next day i went to hospital for check up and to my surprised I was brought to emergency room and nurses did first aid I was with oxygen for a couple of days.. taking antibiotics and doctors say as to the result of my x-ray that my lungs got water that's why I have difficulty inj breathing.. I was discharge from the hospital after 4days and continue to take medicine for the next 2months.
Is
there any medication that could stop this kind of allergy from the dust and smoke. My allergy was trigger and become pneumonia and asthma all at the same time. I hate medicines.. i hope i could find solutions to this kind of allergy.. Posted on 12/15/2010 10:02:00 AM

                  Anonymous Me, my husband and one of my
kids had at the same time walking pneumonia and yes you need a lot ot bed rest, our bodies where very sencible , and it is
not hard to detect, because you feel awfull, your lungs are painfull and your body is suffering because you can not breath too easily
either, the doctor say that at least you need 5 days just stay calm and rest as nmuch
possible, we feel in the third day better and a soon as posible we want to go back to our routine of doing things and work , but it was possible , ours bodies werent ready, so be carefull what you read in the web side because not all of then they are true!
Jesica
PD: we stay in our bed for 7 days
plus 3 days just inside the house, we didnt want to have this sickness again , because the second time is really worst!! then take care of your self.first. Posted on 1/14/2010 11:17:00 AM

                  Anonymous My 10 year old son gets walking pneumonia every May.
This is his third year being diagnosed with it.
His main symptom is hives all over his body.
Last year he started with strep throat and was being treated with amoxocilian.
He bagan getting hives all over.
The E.R. immediately said, allergies to penecillan.
After three days of steroids the hives would not go away. I insisted he be tested for the walking pneumonia.
E.R. doctors find it hard to believe that he would have walking pneumonia with hives.
He is not having a hard time breathing and he has a low grade fever.
Hives will not go away with OTC medicines.
With Swine fever going on, he was immediately tested for that this year.
Of course that was negative.
I just hope this in not going to be a yearly problem for my young son. Posted on 5/3/2009 6:07:00 PM

                  Anonymous I suffered from valley fever 9 years ago. I have chronic issues with the respiratory system. I was in the hospital 10 days and they had prayer ceremony for me.
I obviously lived but not without some major issues. I am holistic and my ND just prescribed doxiclyclene, and a homeopathy for pneumonia. My symptoms. achy head, feels like someone hit me in the jaw, constant coughing, body aches, not green stuff...over all malaise. I am an avid yogi so embrace healing but his is too much. The pharmacist said it was allergies, everyone is battling them but I have never had allergies like this.

                  Anonymous In reply to Anonymous posting dated 1/21/2009 from 45 yr old woman.
I am a 47 yr old woman who suffered with chronic asthmatic bronchitus for years almost like clockwork twice per year. It was finally determined that two things were contributing to my distress. 1) low humidity in the air in my environment that was relieved by using a humidifier and 2) allergies.
I found Vicks vapor rub a real relief when rubbed into the chest and covered with a tee shirt for sleeping.
Hydration is very important,
Vitamin C very important (from rose hips especially - orange juice produced more phlem in my lungs).
The sore throat at the beginning leads me to believe the humidity may be drying your mucus membranes, lowering your resistance, followed by reaction to an allergen.
Consult another doctor for a second opinion. Posted on 1/27/2009 7:17:00 PM

                  Anonymous I generally have a bout of bronchitis twice and even three times a year.
I recognize the symptoms and then get pulmicort and sabutimal for a nebulizer to subside the coughing and rattling in my chest. lying down is difficult as it causes dry coughing for extended periods of time resulting in sleeping in a chair and compounded symptoms due to exhaustion.
Currently have bronchitis again and went to the doctor after about about 2 wks of symtoms of no relieve and nebulizer helping but not progressively getting better. Dr felt it was bronchitis with a secondary infection resulting in pneumonia. did chest xray and blood work.
gave me antibiotics.
I am concerned with the reoccurance
of bronchitis and the possibility of damage to the lungs as the result of bronchitis and pneumonia.
(I have had pneumonia prior to this for which I was hospitalized.
Otherwise I am a healthy 45 woman non smoker never smoked period... not exposed to second hand smoke than the average person.
I have pushed the dr to refer me to a specialist but wonder if there is any research I can do in the meantime.
It usually starts with a non productive dry cought that causes extremely sore throat to which I have not found releif

                  Anonymous I've been coughing and having breathing difficulties and wheezing and a head cold for a month.
I don't feel physically bad, but look pale with dark circles under eyes.
The dr. said it's pneumonia and I'm taking a z pak and prometh/cod.
I don't feel any different and I'm through with the z pak and have little prometh/cod left. Posted on 1/17/2009 1:43:00 PM

                  Anonymous I have been coughing excessivly for 10 days and now I am so sore through my ribs and stomach. I have lots of green mucus and ratteling in my chest when I cough.Runny nose and mostly cold symptoms that won't go away. Is the soreness from so much coughing? Im wondering if it could be walking pheunomonia. I am 38 years old, female and generally healthy. Thoughts? Posted on 1/11/2009 11:36:00 PM

                  Anonymous My 3 year old granddaughter was diagnosed with walking pneunomia about a week and a half ago.
Prior to her diagnosis, she had had a cold and was coughing for about two weeks.
The doctor gave her arithromycin and a nebulizer.
She had a visit with the doctor again and he said she no longer has it.
She finished her antibiotics a few days ago, but she is still coughing.
How long can it be before she stops coughing?
Does she need further testing? Posted on 12/3/2008 3:03:00 PM
