Dental disease remains a serious problem for Mississippi's school-age children. Results from our FY 2010 survey of third grade children found that: 63% of  3rd graders  have experienced  dental disease 31% have untreated dental needs 5% need urgent care that can be life threatening The survey also found that only 23.5% of third graders have received preventive dental sealants, a 3% decrease from 2005.  Oral health awareness activities are used to reduce the burden of dental disease and create happier, healthier smiles for Mississippi. This page last reviewed on Feb 23,
