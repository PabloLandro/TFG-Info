Decompression of the spine can be done through the use of minimally invasive spinal surgery techniques .  The three most common procedures are discectomy, laminectomy, and foraminotomy.  In the minimally invasive versions of these procedures, the muscles and ligaments are spared rather than completely removed.  This allows for the pressure in the affected area to be relieved without the negative side-effects of a more invasive procedure that includes the removal of muscle tissue.  After surgery, patients are sometimes able to return home the same day, and there are fewer complications than with the open spine surgical techniques. There are also non-surgical methods of back decompression that are available that might be able to provide relief of the symptoms.  These treatments include the use of a linear force pulling on the body to create negative pressure between each vertebra. This negative pressure will cause a misaligned disc to be sucked back into place and create more space between the vertebrae so that more blood and oxygen can get to the area. It also will remove any pressure on spinal nerves because of the misalignment. The type of treatment required depends on the specific cause of the symptoms, which your doctor can determine.  Discuss treatment options with your doctor.
