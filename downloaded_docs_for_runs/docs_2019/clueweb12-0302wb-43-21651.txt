POSE (Primary Obesity Surgery Endolumenal) is an incision-free weight loss surgery procedure which is performed through the mouth and inside the stomach, not through cuts in to the abdomen. About the POSE procedure The POSE procedure will be carried out by a specialist weight loss (obesity) surgeon, which takes around 60 to 90 minutes under general anaesthetic. The surgeon will use special tools to create folds in your stomach to reduce the volume and the amount of food it can hold so you feel fuller faster. The length of your stay at the hospital will be determined by your surgeon - typically, this type of procedure requires an overnight stay. It is important that you are committed to following the diet and exercise programmes after the surgery to help achieve the full benefit of the procedure. The success of the procedure also relies on being able to stop eating once you feel full - this will be a factor in considering if this is a suitable procedure for you. A potential benefit of POSE over other weight loss procedures is that it causes no external scarring because the entire surgery is conducted endoscopically (via the mouth). The procedure is also reversible, should you experience any problems. What is recovery like after the POSE procedure? Most patients should be able to return to work within a few days to a week, depending on the nature of their work. At first, you may experience a sore throat, bloating and some nausea, which should settle quickly. Following the POSE procedure, you will be restricted to a liquid only diet for the first 2 days consisting of water, juice, milk, thin soup etc. You will then gradually return to a normal diet over a short period of time. Over time, your ability to tolerate most types of food should improve, although the volume of food you are able to consume should be considerably reduced. You will be supported through this process by your consultant surgeon and the weight loss support team at the hospital with a course of follow up appointments with them. What risks are associated with POSE? The POSE procedure can cause temporary sore throat and nausea. All surgical procedures, no matter how expertly or carefully they are performed, carry risks and the importance of a full evaluation and consultation to discuss your understanding and expectations in relation to these risks cannot be over emphasised. Your consultant surgeon will spend plenty of time with you discussing these aspects of your treatment. How do I find out if I am a suitable candidate for POSE? A full evaluation of your individual needs and circumstances will be carried out by the specialist weight loss surgery team at the hospital, and you will be provided with a comprehensive verbal and written explanation of any recommended treatment. Patients are assessed on an individual basis but this procedure may not be suitable for people that have already had complicated upper abdominal surgery. POSE incision-free weight loss surgery from Spire Healthcare With Spire Healthcare you will see an experienced weight loss (obesity) consultant of your choice at a time that suits you. You will be treated in a premium private hospital, not a clinic, and you can be assured of our commitment to healthcare standards and infection control excellence.
