Role of Levofloxacin in the Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Taiwan:In Vitro Activity and Clinical Efficacy Review Role of Levofloxacin in the Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Taiwan: In Vitro Activity and Clinical Efficacy Po-Ren Hsueh , MD Chief, Section of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan Taiwan is one of the epicenters of antibiotic resistance among the common bacterial pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Although data regarding the causative pathogens responsible for CAP are limited in Taiwan, Streptococcus pneumoniae and two atypical pathogens ( Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae ) are assumed to account for the majority of cases. Several surveillance studies have demonstrated high levels of resistance to penicillin, other -lactams, macrolides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in S. pneumoniae , and to -lactamase production in Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and to macrolides in H. influenzae . With the persistence and continuous increase of resistance, therapeutic strategies need to be changed not only to overcome resistance but also to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Levofloxacin possesses a wide spectrum of activity against resistant bacteria and atypical pathogens and has a proven clinical efficacy and favorable safety profile making it a promising agent of choice in treating CAP.
