Although most conditions are not serious, many are irritating and annoying. However, if left untreated, some may develop into far more serious conditions. Some of the more common circulatory problems experienced may include: frequent leg fatigue; mild swelling and aches; varicose veins (pregnancy related and other); and some post-surgical conditions. The best form of treatment for these and similar conditions is to wear Medium Support (15-20 mmHg) Compression Stockings and Socks. And, the best Compression Stockings and Socks are produced by one of the oldest and most trusted names for medical hosiery – Sigvaris. All Sigvaris products are medically approved to provide you with the highest level of therapeutic care and comfort. Each pair of Sigvaris Medium Support Stockings or Socks is carefully engineered to apply the exact amount of graduated pressure that your legs require. When blood travels upwards in the veins towards the heart, it requires a certain amount of pressure to help prevent its flowing downwards. Greater pressure is needed at the furthest point from the heart, near the ankles and feet, while gradual lesser degrees of pressure are required towards the knees. Normally, the leg muscles supply this pressure. As the legs move, the muscles constrict the veins and push the blood along. When the muscle actions is inadequate, Sigvaris Medium Support Stockings replicate the natural amounts of pressure and compress the legs – and the veins – exactly where compression is needed. Ask your doctor about the right Compression Stockings for you. © 2011 DiscountSurgical.com All Rights Reserved Questions?
