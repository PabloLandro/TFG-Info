The fan-shaped leaves contain active chemicals which have been found to be beneficial to both the circulatory and the central nervous system. It may help to increase blood flow to the brain and extremities, by regulating the tone and elasticity of the blood vessels. Ginkgo can also help to reduce blood stickiness, thereby reducing blood clotting, a contributory factor in stroke and heart disease.

There is also an indication that ginkgo may make healthy people better able to focus their thoughts or to remember. The fact that Gingko aids blood flow to the brain, thereby increasing oxygen supply, is particularly important to the elderly who may have poor circulation and a build up of athersclerotic plaque in their arteries.  Diminished blood flow has been linked to Alzheimers disease, memory loss, headaches, depression, confusion and tinnitus.
Ginkgos antioxidant properties, may help it to maintain a healthy macular, which is found close to the retina in eye. Age related macular degeneration is a common disease in the over 50s and can lead to blindness.
