People often have arch pain due to excessive positions of the foot, such as high arches or low arches. The most common and most effective treatment for arch pain is arch supports (foot orthotics). Arch supports work to absorb shock, distribute your weight more evenly and correct any biomechanical problems. Foot Arch Overview The foot arch, located between the heel bone and the ball of the foot, is responsible for supporting the weight of the body and helping propel the body forward while walking. If you are having pain, your doctor may prescribe foot orthotics or arch supports. Foot orthotics work to distribute your weight more evenly when you are walking and to adjust the poor biomechanical alignment that may be a cause of your pain. Arch Supports/Foot Orthotics: Over The Counter or Custom? Arch Supports or orthotics are being used more and more commonly to treat a variety of conditions, including heel spurs, overpronation, metatarsalgia, and for plantar fasciitis treatment.There are two main kinds of arch supports. 1) Over the counter footbeds. (Also known as off-the-shelf arch supports or foot orthotics) 2) Custom-made shoe inserts. (Also called custom arch supports or custom foot orthotics) Arch Supports (Foot Orthotics) and Plantar Fasciitis Treatment Plantar Fasciitis is caused due to inflammation of the plantar fascia. This is a thick band of tissue that extends from the heels, through the arches, to the base of the toes. It acts as a support platform for your arches. The most effective solution for treatment of problems like plantar fasciitis is to focus on the cause of the problem. To do this, arch supports, also known as foot orthotics, are often worn to correct the abnormal foot mechanics. MacKenzie Orthotics has designed shoe inserts to specifically help with plantar fasciitis pain. High Arches Overview When individuals with high arches stand or walk, their ankles tend to roll slightly outwards. This altered alignment and altered mechanical approach to walking can cause painful problems. In most cases, foot orthotics or arch supports will be prescribed. Arch supports for high arches are designed to cushion the heel of your foot and help absorb shock. They also work to distribute your weight more evenly when walking. High Arch: The Low-Down If you have a high arch, you may find you have pain in the arch of your foot, heel pain, ball of foot pain, knee pain, or even lower back pain. Doctors may prescribe footbeds (orthotic insoles) to wear in your shoes. For a high arch, your orthotic insoles will be designed to cushion the heel of your foot, to help absorb shock, and to distribute your weight more evenly when walking.
