<110 mg/dL had a 99.4% chance of not developing gestational diabetes," said Nahum.  "None of the women who had a result of less than <104 mg/dL developed gestational diabetes.  This gives us a cutoff point.  Women who test in this range at 16 weeks are almost guaranteed not to develop gestational diabetes." Nahum said that for women who fall in the intermediate range (111 mg/dL to 134 mg/dL) at 16 weeks, a repeat glucose screening test should be given at 28 weeks to assess whether the woman should be sent for more in-depth testing. While it is a natural assumption to say that earlier screenings should lead to better outcomes for mother and baby, Nahum said more studies are needed to confirm that. "We don't know how earlier diagnosis of gestational diabetes will impact maternal-fetal outcomes because we didn't examine that in this study, but that is certainly something to focus on in future research," he said. Gestational diabetes occurs in 2-7% of all pregnancies in the United States.  Complications from gestational diabetes include above-average weight gain for the baby that can result in injury to the nerves in the baby's neck from a difficult delivery, an increased risk of newborn fractures, a higher likelihood of fetal distress and possible hypoglycemia, jaundice or breathing problems in the baby. Changes in diet and exercise are usually enough to help keep blood sugar levels within the normal range, but in some cases insulin injections are needed.  Most women who develop diabetes during pregnancy go back to having normal glucose tolerance after the birth of the baby; however, these women may be at greater risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Coauthors include Stephen B. Wilson, MD, University of Hawaii School of Medicine; and Harold Stanislaw, PhD, California State University.
