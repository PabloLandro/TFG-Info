        Reviews | Politics | Industry | Features Science News Aloe gel enhances wound healing in diabetic rats The slowed healing of skin wounds observed in diabetic patients may 
          be related to decreased levels of collagen, a compound that provides 
          structure and strength to skin tissue. In the present study, treatment 
          with aloe gel was shown to enhance wound healing, possibly by its effects 
          on inflammation and collagen synthesis. In the study, experimentally 
          induced skin wounds in diabetic rats were treated with topical or oral 
          administration of aloe gel. Wounds treated with aloe gel healed significantly 
          faster than wounds in control animals. In addition, levels of collagen, 
          total protein, and DNA were higher for the treatment groups than for 
          controls, particularly during the first 10 days of the study. The researchers 
          speculate that the possible hypoglycemic properties of aloe gel may 
          be responsible for its apparent ability to enhance wound healing in 
          diabetic individuals, and discuss possible biochemical mechanisms by
