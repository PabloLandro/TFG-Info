During the year before menstruation begins, a girl’s blood calcium level drops so abnormally low that she may become nervous, suffer from insomnia and tooth decay, and be so irritable that she is almost impossible to live with. The amount of calcium in a woman’s blood parallels the activity of the ovaries; the blood calcium falls to such an extent during the week prior to menstruation that nervous tension, irritability, and perhaps mental depression result.  At the onset of menstruation, the blood calcium takes a further drop, often causing cramps of the muscular walls of the uterus. This condition is especially severe during adolescence.  The decreased blood calcium acts as a stress, the production of cortisone and aldosterone are stimulated causing salt and water to be retained in  the body, often causing the breasts, hands, face and feet to swell, weight to increase 5 to 10 pounds, headaches to occur, and resistance to allergies and infections to decrease markedly.  Crimes of violence committed by women take place mostly during this period. During menopause, the lack of ovarian hormones cause severe calcium-deficiency  symptoms to occur. At these times unusually large amounts of calcium should be obtained and every step should be taken to ensure its absorption into the blood and to prevent its loss from the kidneys.  When these precautions are taken and the diet is adequate in other respects, the woman at menopause usually loses her irritability, hot flashes, night sweats, leg cramps, and mental depression. Even after the cessation of menstruation, a pseudo-menstrual cycle can usually be observed, and calcium-deficiency symptoms can be particularly noticed during one week of each month.  The calcium intake should be increased at such times. (The adrenal glands are orange-colored endocrine (hormone releasing)  glands which are located on the top of both kidneys. See picture below.) Cortisone and Aldosterone are hormones produced naturally by the adrenal glands in times of stress. Cortisone and Aldosterone are necessary for the regulation of body fluids. GETTING THE BASICS Calcium and magnesium go hand in hand. Calcium given alone can induce a magnesium deficiency. But when magnesium is deficient, large amounts of calcium are lost in the urine. Taking excessive amounts of magnesium can also prevent calcium from being absorbed. But if no Vitamin D is taken, more calcium can be excreted from the body than taken. But… Vitamin D can be absorbed into the blood only in the presence of fat. Fat is key to proper body function including hormonal balance and weight loss! Lack of good fat can cause weight to increase! Our point is this: Protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals and water are all essential for good health. Numerous surveys have shown that calcium and magnesium deficiencies are more widespread than that of any other nutrient, which is why we’re giving you Instant CalMag-C. But, it’s not all we think about. Being deficient in one vitamin or mineral can create deficiencies in other vitamins and/or minerals.
