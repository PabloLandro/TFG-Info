2012  April | The Vein Center Home Varicose Veins Spider Veins Our Physicians Contact Us Blog Archive for April, 2012 Compression Stockings Cannot Cure Varicose Veins Over 40 million men and women across the United States suffer varicose veins. Once regarded as a merely cosmetic problem, the medical community now recognizes varicose veins as a potentially serious medical issue.  It is now understood that when left untreated varicose veins have the potential to cause life threatening complications. Many individuals living with varicose veins suffer from lifestyle limiting symptoms including pain, swelling, and fatigue. Varicose veins and their associated symptoms will often worsen without treatment. Commonly, the first step in the treatment of varicose veins is the use of compression stockings. These medical grade elastic stockings provide the surface of the leg with an added layer of support and encourage circulation. Many insurance companies have adopted a policy requiring a period of wearing compression stockings to see if symptoms decrease before considering approval for any further treatments. Unfortunately, compression stockings cannot cure varicose veins, nor will they prevent new varicose veins from forming. Compression stockings can only relieve, not repair, the effects of venous disorders. Even if symptoms are significantly reduced, stopping usage of the hose will cause them to return and the vein damage to progress. For a long-term solution to eliminate the pain of varicose veins, contact The Vein Center at Virginia Surgical Associates to speak with a specialized vascular surgeon about the minimally invasive surgical options available. Contact us at (804) 477-8613 to learn more about compression stockings, permanent vein removal treatment options or to schedule an appointment Please note: Compression stockings should only be worn when prescribed by a doctor. Fit and strength instructions should be followed to ensure effective treatment. Stockings purchased at a department store will not provide the accurate level of compression and will be ineffective in relieving symptoms.
