Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive disorder in which brain cells (neurons) deteriorate, resulting in the loss of cognitive functions, primarily memory, judgment and reasoning, movement coordination, and pattern recognition. In advanced stages of the disease, all memory and mental functioning may be lost. A person with Alzheimer's disease has problems with memory, judgment, and thinking, which makes it hard for the person to work or take part in day-to-day life. The death of the nerve cells occurs gradually over a period of years. A person with Alzheimer's disease usually has a gradual decline in mental functions, often beginning with slight memory loss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain employment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to reason and exercise judgment. Communication ability, mood, and personality may also be affected. Most people who have Alzheimer's disease die within eight years of their diagnosis, although that interval may be as short as one year or as long as 20 years. Alzheimer's disease is the fourth leading cause of death in adults after heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Between two and four million Americans have Alzheimer's disease ; that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by the middle of the 21st century as the population as a whole ages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50s develop the disease (called early-onset Alzheimer's disease), Alzheimer's disease predominantly affects the elderly. Alzheimer's disease affects about 3% of all people between ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75 and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly more women than men are affected with ALZHEIMERâ€™S DISEASE, but this may be because women tend to live longer, and so there is a higher proportion of women in the most affected age groups. People with Alzheimer's disease can develop more and more problems as time goes by. Initially, memory loss is the most noticeable, although language difficulty (for example, trouble finding words) is also seen. Poor planning, poor judgement or becoming lost even in familiar settings are all symptoms of the problem. Personality changes can develop over time, along with agitation, depression, irritability, and, rarely, aggressivity. Finally, a person with severe Alzheimer's disease will be unable to talk, unable to sit up, and unable to control bowels or bladder. Understandably, many older people - and their children - fear the development of Alzheimer's disease. More information on dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, lewy body dementia, Pick's disease) What is dementia? - Dementia is a deterioration of intellectual function and other cognitive skills. Dementia may involve progressive deterioration of thinking, memory, behavior, personality and motor function. What types of dementia are there? - Types of dementia include Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementias, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, alcohol-related dementia, and Pick disease. What're the risk factors for dementia? - The main risk factor for dementia is age. People who have sustained serious head injuries through boxing are prone to dementia pugilistica. What causes dementia? - Dementia is caused by degeneration in the cerebral cortex including death of brain cells, conditions that impair the vascular or neurologic structures of the brain. What're the symptoms of dementia? - The early symptom of dementia is diminished short-term memory. Patients with severe dementia cannot perform activities of daily living. How is dementia diagnosed? - Diagnosis of dementia begins with a thorough physical exam and complete medical history, and followed by information-concentration-orientation test of Blessed et al. and the mini-mental state exam of Folstein et al. What's the treatment for dementia? - The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of dementia. Treatment of dementia begins with treatment of the underlying disease. What's the long term dementia care? - Long-term dementia care may be needed for some patients with dementia. Possible options include in-home care, boarding homes, adult day care, and convalescent homes. What's alcohol-related dementia? - Alcohol related dementia is a form of dementia related to the excessive drinking of alcohol. Alcohol abuse can lead to several forms of dementia. What's frontal lobe dementia? - Frontal lobe dementia is a set of degenerative diseases producing many of the same symptoms as vascular dementia. The frontal lobe governs people's mood and behaviour. What's senile dementia? - Senile dementia is the mental deterioration (loss of intellectual ability) that is associated with old age. Senile dementia is often used when referring to Alzheimer's disease. What's early onset dementia? - Early onset dementia is a term that covers a range of diseases affecting memory and thinking in people under the age of 65. What's AIDS related dementia? - HIV associated dementia (HAD) is comprised of a spectrum of conditions from the mild HIV-1 motor cognitive-motor disorder to severe and debilitating AIDS dementia. What's Alzheimer's disease? - Alzheimer's disease is a form of degenerative brain disease resulting in progressive mental deterioration with disorientation, memory disturbance and confusion. What types of Alzheimer's disease are there? - Types of Alzheimer's disease include early onset Alzheimer's, late-onset Alzheimer's, and familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). What're the stages of Alzheimer's disease? - Stages of Alzheimer's disease include no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive decline, moderate cognitive decline, moderately severe cognitive decline... What causes Alzheimer's disease? - The ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer's disease are still unknown, there are several risk factors that increase a person's likelihood of developing the disease. What're the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease? - The risk for Alzheimer's disease increases with age. People with a family history of Alzheimer's have a greater risk. What're the warning signs of Alzheimer's disease? - The warning signs of Alzheimer's disease include memory loss, difficulty performing familiar tasks, problems with language, poor or decreased judgment. What're the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? - The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include memory lapses, perform routine tasks, loss of judgment, and personality or behavior changes. How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed? - Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is complex. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease begins with a thorough physical exam and complete medical history. What's the treatment for Alzheimer's disease? - Some treatments for Alzheimer's disease that can be used to help manage and ease the symptoms. Medications help alleviate the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and delusions. What medications treat Alzheimer's disease? - Four medications, tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine tartrate and galantamine, are used to improve intellectual function in some patients with Alzheimer's disease. What's the dietary therapy for Alzheimer's disease? - Dietary therapy for Alzheimer's disease involves appropriate intake of darkly colored fruits and vegetables, soy, alcohol, folate and vitamin B12. What's the exercise therapy for Alzheimer's disease? - Aerobic exercise is very important for helping to protect against mental decline during aging due to Alzheimer's disease.
