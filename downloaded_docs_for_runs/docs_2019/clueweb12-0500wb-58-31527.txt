Cinnamon has also been shown to slow stomach emptying without affecting the feeling of fullness. A new study has looked at the effects of cinnamon, in doses of either 1g or 3g, tested again when added to rice pudding. In this latest study from Malmo University Hospital in Sweden, cinnamon did not affect the stomach emptying rate or blood glucose level of the 15 healthy volunteers, but a 3g dose of cinnamon did reduce the amount of insulin released in response to the carbohydrate provided in the pudding. Taking these results and using them to provide support for a new method of managing diabetes is another matter; however, and any potential developments will be some way off.
