This wax is not paraffin. Skin contains many tiny glands whose sole purpose is to secrete a variety of substances and ear wax is one of them. Earwax buildup in outer ear is a healthy sign the body has been busy making the right stuff to fend off ear canal invaders. It is not a matter of concern. It is an integral part of the self defense system of our body. Earwax is a lubricating agent with anti- bacterial properties which helps to clear the ear naturally. It catches anything foreign that enters in to the ear. There are two forms of earwax- one is the dry earwax which is slightly yellowish or sometimes grey in colour and the other is the wet earwax which is yellowish brown. Unwanted materials get entrapped by the wax and after some time the wax along with the dirt moves out of the ear opening quite easily because of the smooth lubricating surface of the wax. But there are some adverse effects of earwax too. Earwax can cause hearing loss, pain and cough. Hearing loss occurs when the earwax completely blocks the ear canal. It prevents sound to reach the ear drum. Some people form very hard wax which causes pain to the sensitive ear canal walls. Ear canal shares some of the same nerves which give sensation to the throat and earwax can affect the throat and cause irritation and coughing. Symptoms: Decreased hearing loss is the most common symptom. Pain in the outer ear canal may be a sign of earwax blockage. Feeling of fullness in ear. Body balance rests in ear. When the ear is blocked this balance can be interrupted. This results in vertigo, dizziness along with pain and discomfort. Other symptoms of earwax buildup include constant ringing sounds in the ear and feeling an obstruction in the ear. Cleaning Procedure Of Earwax: ENT doctors usually remove wax by suction or curette techniques. Over the counter wax removal systems use irrigation with a solution containing hydrogen peroxide or a similar chemical named carbamyl peroxide. But the liquid can get trapped between the wax and the ear drum. Here is a list of home remedies which can be helpful- One should use sea- water spray daily. A drop of olive or baby oil once or twice a week. A vinegar- water- peroxide solution (1:1:2), warmed to body temperature, can be applied to ear canal to soften wax. People with history of middle ear infection, swimmer’s ear or with a hole in the ear drum should not try any home remedy. They need to go to the ENT specialists for treatment.
