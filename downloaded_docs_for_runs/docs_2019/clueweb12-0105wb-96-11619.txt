        Infections Resist Common Antibiotics Stanford University
        researchers have documented the first cases of chronic
        ear infections with antibiotic-resistant strep. "It has been known
        that this pathogen was present in acute cases of otitis
        media.... but this is the first study to isolate cases in
        children with chronic ear effusions (fluid)," said
        Dr. Patrick Fitzgerald, who presented his findings
        yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Academy
        of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in San Francisco. In the study,
        Fitzgerald and his colleagues examined discharge from the
        middle ears of 49 young children who had chronic otitis
        media, or chronic middle ear infections. hey found that 23 of
        the 49 contained bacteria. Five of those were
        streptococcus pneumoniae; two of those were resistant to
        penicillin and most other antibiotics commonly used to
        treat otitis media. If untreated, chronic
        otitis media can lead to hearing loss and delayed speech Streptococcus
        pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia,
        necrotizing fasciitis (the so-called flesh-eating
        bacteria) and strep throat, as well as middle ear infections.
        Fitzgerald said there are about 7 million cases of acute
        middle ear infections each year in the United States,
        about 2 million to 3 million of which are caused by
        streptococcus pneumoniae. Reports have found as
        many as one-quarter of acute strep infections resistant
        to penicillin and other antibiotics . SF Chronicle - page #
