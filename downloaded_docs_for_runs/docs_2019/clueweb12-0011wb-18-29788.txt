Acupuncture can provide a natural, drug-free form of therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Admission for treatment of benzodiazepine abuse tripled from 1998 to 2008, compared to only an 11 percent rise in overall treatment admissions for all substances during this period. Admissions related to the abuse of benzodiazepine drugs rose from 22,400 in 1998 to approximately 60,200 in 2008. Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs introduced in the late 1950’s to replace barbiturates in treating anxiety. Although they can provide effective treatment for anxiety, benzodiazepines can be abused and this abuse can lead to addiction. Acupuncture treats the mental and physical symptoms of many anxiety disorders, including: · Generalized anxiety disorder. · Panic disorder. · Obsessive-compulsive disorder. · Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Acupuncture can reduce anxiety-related symptoms such as increased heart rate, nausea, headache, insomnia, dizziness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. By increasing levels of stress-reducing neurotransmitters, acupuncture can calm an overstimulated sympathetic nervous system. Acupuncture also reduces anxiety by lowering production of cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, and by increasing serotonin levels which can regulate mood imbalance. For information about acupuncture for the treatment of anxiety disorders call Dr. Richard Browne, Acupuncture Physician, at (305) 595-9500.
