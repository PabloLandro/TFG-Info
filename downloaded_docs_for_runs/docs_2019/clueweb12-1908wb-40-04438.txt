Alzheimer Society of Toronto - Vascular Dementia e-mail page text size: Vascular Dementia(VaD) usually has a sudden onset immediately following a   stroke. Strokes may alter the person’s ability to walk, cause weakness in an arm   or leg, slurred speech or emotional outbursts. VaD may follow a stepwise   progression, where function can deteriorate, stabilize for a time and then   deteriorate again. The cognitive symptoms may vary, affecting some areas of the   brain more or less than others (e.g., language, vision or memory) .
