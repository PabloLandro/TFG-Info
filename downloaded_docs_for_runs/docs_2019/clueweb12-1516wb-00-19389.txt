Thanks Emma bsheets 10-08-2009, 09:43 PM Magnesium will work a charm with your cramps  :) mistycat 10-08-2009, 09:46 PM Hi I think cramps are down to electrolyte losses especially when dinking a lot of water, lots of excersize and when its hot. Take an effective multivitamin which has magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride, manganese, and take plenty of calcium. They're flipping annoying I get them in my right calf muscle :mad: mistycat 10-08-2009, 09:47 PM Ah you beat me to it bsheets xx Motiv8me 10-08-2009, 10:02 PM Hi there, I was going to say the same thing... Magnesium I get cramps in my calves when dieting, I just take a good multi vitamin which seems to help a great deal... nothing worse than waking in the middle of the night with cramping calves...:( abloodredbird 10-08-2009, 10:50 PM Thank you all! I'm going to get some magnesium tomorrow! bsheets 15-08-2009, 11:09 AM Hi Saillyn, Welcome  :) If it's a pinched nerve or something else like that, I think you should have it looked at by a professional. All I could advise on a forum like this would be nutritional like a vitamin deficiency or something like that. As to the nutrients you track, often going over the "enough" mark, if you really need to, is ok. This obviously depends on how much you go over and what with (like you would never want to go over the RDA for Vitamin A, for instance). So if you are doing everything you can, it's time to bring in the big guns and have a professional look into it further. Perhaps you need some painkillers if it's something that can't be treated.

If so, you might find lack of sodium could be causing it. bsheets 15-08-2009, 02:50 PM Funny....all these darn doctors and NOT one has held my foot in their hands and tried to examine my feet to look for things like the bumps that come with gout. It is all about the expensive testing and drugs.  Sad here, honestly. Surely not everyone is like that. Have you asked them to find out if they can examine your feet? What about a podiatrist, they would definitely handle your feet. Sherrie 15-08-2009, 09:35 PM Ack that sounds horrible Saillyn :( bsheets 15-08-2009, 11:57 PM That's absolutely dreadful. That's malpractice in my opinion. Is there any way to be more assertive with what you will and will not accept from these people? bsheets 16-08-2009, 12:35 AM I worked for a podiatrist company for a few years and they didn't once inject anyone with anything, let alone without their consent. Are there any Dr clinics that you know of, that have a podiatrist practicing there as well? Perhaps they would communicate better if they worked together. vBullet
