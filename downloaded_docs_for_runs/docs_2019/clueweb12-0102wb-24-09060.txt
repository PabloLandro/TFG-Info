  Research Studies Clinical features 
        and weight loss in patients with morbid obesity after bariatric surgery To analyze the psychological status of morbidly obese patients suffering 
        changes after surgical procedure for weight reduction. Method We analyze the weight loss in 100 morbidly obese patients (85 female, 
        15 male) after bariatric surgery (vertical banded gastroplasty). We correlated 
        the percentage of weight loss with the age of these patients, initial 
        weight (body mass index at surgery), quality of life, eating behaviour, 
        psychopathology, personality, and marital status. Results We have found relation between initial weight and weight loss (heavier 
        patients lose more weight). The percentage of weight loss is associated 
        with the Eating Behaviour (Body Dissatisfaction, Disinhibition), the Quality 
        of Life (Positive Affect), the Psychopathology (Hostility), the Personality 
        Traits (Narcissist), and the Marital Status (Idealistic Distortion). Conclusion The weight loss in morbidly obese patients after surgery is major in 
        the more obese one. The satisfactory weight loss after surgery improve 
        the eating behaviour, quality of life, psychological and marital status. Source: Guisado JA, Vaz FJ, Lopez-Ibor JJ, Rubio MA. Departamento de Pisquiatria,
