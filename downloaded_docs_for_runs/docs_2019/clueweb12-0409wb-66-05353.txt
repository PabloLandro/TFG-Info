Electrolyte Replenishment - Why Its So Important and How to Do It Right By Steve Born Steve Born Steve's decade-plus of involvement in the sports nutrition industry, as well as nearly 15 years of independent research in nutritional fueling and supplementation, has given him unmatched familiarity with the myriad product choices available to athletes. Updated 06/2011 Electrolytes are analogous to the motor oil in your car—they don’t
make the engine run, but they’re absolutely necessary to keep everything
running smoothly. Proper functioning of the digestive, nervous, cardiac, and
muscular systems depends on adequate electrolyte levels. Muscle cramping, though there are many theories as to why it happens, usually
involves improper hydration and/or improper electrolyte replenishment. No one
wants to cramp, of course, but remember, cramping is a place far down the road
of electrolyte depletion. Cramping is your body’s painful way of saying “Hey!
I’m on empty! Resupply me now or I’m going to stop!” It’s
like the oil light on the dash; you never want it to get that low. That’s precisely why, just as you shouldn’t wait until you bonk
before you refuel, or you’re dehydrated before you replenish fluids,
you shouldn’t wait for cramps to remind you to take electrolytes. In this article, we’ll look closely at this vital, but often neglected
and misunderstood, aspect of fueling. We’ll tell you why salt tablets
don’t work and why Endurolytes is unquestionably the finest electrolyte
formula available. Proper fueling during exercise requires more than replenishing calories and fluids; it involves consistent and adequate electrolyte support as well. Electrolyte needs vary much more than either caloric or hydration needs, so you will have to experiment quite a bit in training until you have this aspect of your fueling tailored to your specific requirements under various conditions. What are electrolytes? Why do I need them? Electrolytes are chemicals that form electrically charged particles (ions) in body fluids. These ions carry the electrical energy necessary for many functions, including muscle contractions and transmission of nerve impulses. Many bodily functions depend on electrolytes; optimal performance requires a consistent and adequate supply of these important nutrients. Many athletes neglect consistent electrolyte replenishment because they've never had cramping problems. Even if you've been fortunate enough to have never suffered the painful, debilitating effects of cramping, you still need to provide your body with a consistent and adequate supply of electrolytes. Why? Because the goal in replenishing electrolytes is not so much to prevent cramping, but to maintain specific bodily functions at optimal levels. Cramping is your body's way of letting you know that, in terms of electrolytes, it's on empty. When you've reached that point, your performance has been severely compromised for some time. Remember, you want your body to perform smoothly, without interruption or compromise, so just as you shouldn't wait until you're dehydrated or bonking before you replenish fluids or calories, you never want to wait until you're cramping before replenishing electrolytes. Consistent replenishment of electrolytes is just as important as the fuel you consume and the water you drink during exercise. Can't I just use salt tablets? Salt tablets are an unacceptable choice for electrolyte replenishment for two reasons: They provide only two of the electrolytes your body requires - sodium and chloride. They can oversupply sodium, thereby overwhelming the bodys complex mechanism for regulating sodium. Each of these issues is important, and well discuss both of them. Right now, lets focus primarily on the second one. Far too many athletes have suffered needlessly with swollen hands and feet from water retention due to ingestion of salt tablets or electrolyte products too high in sodium during prolonged exercise in the heat. The body has very effective mechanisms to regulate and recirculate sodium from body stores. Excess sodium consumption interferes with or neutralizes these complex mechanisms. Sweat generates large sodium losses, which is monitored closely through hormonal receptors throughout the body. However, rapid sodium replacement neutralizes the system, allowing water intake to dilute the sodium content. High-sodium electrolyte supplementation contravenes the natural physiological control of serum electrolytes, and once the body detects an increase in sodium from exogenous sources (i.e., food, salt tablets, or products too high in sodium), the hormone aldosterone signals the kidneys to stop filtering and recirculating sodium. Instead, the kidneys will excrete sodium; another hormone, vasopressin, will redominate and cause fluid retention. While ingesting large amounts of sodium may temporarily resolve a sodium deficiency, doing so substantially increases the risk of
a number of problems, including increased fluid storage and thus swelling, or edema, in the distal extremities, elevated blood pressure, and increased rate of sodium
excretion. All of these inhibit performance. If you've ever finished a workout or race with swollen hands, wrists, feet, or ankles, or if you have experienced puffiness under your eyes and around your cheeks, chances are your sodium/salt intake was too high. The truth is that the human body needs only a minute amount of sodium to function normally. We require a mere 500 mg of sodium each day; athletes maybe 2,000 mg, which is easily supplied by natural, unprocessed foods. However, the average American consumes approximately 6,000-8,000 mg per day, well above the upper end recommended dose of 2,300 - 2,400 mg/day.* (See asterik on page 44) The average athlete stores at least 8,000 mg of dietary sodium in tissues and has these stores
available during exercise. In other words, you already have a vast reservoir of sodium available in your body from your diet, ready to serve you during exercise. In addition, your body has a highly complex and efficient way of monitoring and recirculating sodium back into the blood, which it does to maintain homeostasis. You do need to replenish sodium during exercise, but you must do so with amounts that cooperate with, and do not override, these complex body mechanisms. * In 2009, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided additional scientific evidence that the majority of Americans over the age of twenty should limit the amount of sodium (salt) they consume daily to 1,500 milligrams (mg) to prevent and reduce high blood pressure. High sodium health consequences Not only are high-sodium diets bad for your health, but those who consume large amounts of sodium in their diet are guaranteed greater sodium loss rates and require greater sodium intakes during exercise. Sodium, as you probably know, drives thirst, and thirst drives drinking until excess results . . . definitely not a performance-enhancing scenario. Don't I need to replace what I sweat out? It's easy to formulate a product that matches one of the many perspiration analysis studies and then sell it on the basis that athletes simply need to replace what they lose. Some products do just that. Unfortunately, there's a problem with this because individual sweat-loss differences vary greatly, and the human body does not and cannot efficiently replace what it expends during exercise at any intensity above a walking pace. Electrolytes lost are not replaced by electrolytes consumed. The body is able to replace, at best, only about one-third of what it loses during exercise; this is true for fluids, calories, and electrolytes. If you try to replace all the fluids at once, you may end up with dilutional hyponatremia (overly diluted blood sodium levels) or water intoxication. If you attempt to replace all the fuel you expend, your stomach will back up in total rebellion, and refueling will grind to a halt. Likewise, if you try to replace in equal amounts all of the electrolytes you lose, a number of hormonal triggers may create all sorts of problems such as gastric distress, edema, muscle spasms, and cramping. As emphasized in the LESS IS BEST *The right way to fuel* article at the beginning of this book, the key to successful fueling (fluids, calories, and electrolytes) is to NOT focus on what you lose, but rather on how much your body can effectively accept and absorb. Bill Misner, Ph.D., says, Give it [your body] 30-40%, even though it cries aloud for 110%. When it comes to the amount of fluids you drink, calories you eat, and electrolytes you replenish, this is an absolutely vital principle to remember. The closer you adhere to it, the greater your opportunity for success. THOUGHTS ON REDUCING SODIUM Consistent replenishment of fluids and calories is essential to maintain energy levels during workouts and races. Providing constant replenishment of electrolytes is an equally important component of proper fueling. Pre-loading sodium prior to a race? Bad idea! Courtesy of an article written by a registered dietician, one practice now being considered, and even adopted by many athletes, is to & increase sodium in the diet by pre-loading three to four grams of sodium about 12 to 24 hours before the race. What is bothersome about this recommendation is that one would think that a registered dietician ought to be well-versed on the health consequences of a high-sodium diet (which the overwhelming majority of Americans consume). Yet this particular person advocates additional sodium in the diet prior to a race. The question is: Is this a

Limiting sodium is recommended since research supports that chronic consumption of more than 2,300 milligrams per day may contribute to congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, muscle stiffness, edema, irritability, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), liver disorders, ulcers, and cataracts.

safe and healthy practice? A number of references are provided in the article, apparently to solidify these recommendations: 1) Eichner, E.R. Genetic and Other Determinants of Sweat Sodium. Current Sports Medicine Reports 7.4 Supp 1(2008): 236-S40. Comment : Our interpretation of Eichner's statements/conclusions is that the more sodium in the pre-event diet, the more plasma aldosterone level is suppressed, resulting in a higher rate of sodium loss in sweat during the event. Our position is that suppression of aldosterone prior to events by increasing sodium intake is counterproductive to keeping natural body homeostatic controls in the healthy norm range, which means consuming a low sodium diet of under 2,300 mg daily. Bottom line : More sodium in the diet equals more sodium lost during exercise.
2) Murray, R. and L. Kenney, Sodium Balance and Exercise. Current Sports Medicine Reports 7.4 Supp. 1 (2008): S1-S2. Comment : Our position is that over 2,300 mg/day results in harmful consequences to health proportionate to predisposed individual sensitivity, while a large majority of the human population reacts negatively to >5,800 mg/day. Bottom line : Keeping sodium intake levels between 1,500-2,300 mg/day will support sodium requirements without taxing the aldosterone pathway or the kidney organ's role in homeostasis. 3) Stachenfeld, N.S. Acute Effects of Sodium Ingestion on Thirst and Cardiovascular Function. Current Sports Medicine Reports 7.4 Supp. 1(2008): S7-S13. Bottom line : Salty foods and/or salt tablets will not cut it when it comes to electrolyte replenishment. Instead, adopt a low-sodium approach that emphasizes a balance of essential minerals that cooperatively enhance the body's natural hormone and enzyme actions. You want a product that will provide comprehensive electrolyte support without compromising internal regulation. Comment : The human body is
constructed to be sensitive in
monitoring homeostatic electrolyte
balance. This suggests that a
consistent intake of small amounts
of fluids and electrolytes help to
prevent severe deficits of fluids and
loss of electrolytes. How the body controls serum sodium Aldosterone is a hormone that
controls the rate of sodium
circulated in the human body. When
sodium levels dip too low, via loss in
perspiration or urine, aldosterone
is released, stimulating the
kidney tubule cells to increase reabsorption
of sodium back into the
blood. In basic terms, the body has
a very complex and effective way of
monitoring, recirculating, and thus
conserving its stores of sodium. High sodium intake will suppress
serum aldosterone, whereas low
sodium intake will elevate serum
aldosterone. In other words, too
much sodium, be it via diet and/
or during exercise, will suppress
and neutralize aldosterone's sodium
recirculation (and thus sparing)
effects, causing more sodium to be
lost. Conversely, a low-sodium diet
and a more conservative sodium
intake, in tandem with other
depleting electrolytes, during
a workout or race creates an
environment where lower amounts of
sodium are lost in sweat and urine. This is also why sweat rate
figures can be deceiving. You'll
find many a coach or researcher
stating something to the effect of
I've seen athletes lose up to several
grams of sodium during a onehour
training session. That may
very well be true for some athletes
during such a short-duration bout
of exercise, especially if it's under
a controlled environment (such as
riding a stationary bike in a warm room with no circulating air). However, that doesn't mean that those losses are sustainable hour after hour; again, the body's built-in chemical messengers and hormones (namely aldosterone) help prevent those losses from continuing down the same path. Yes, the body does need sodium replenishment but it has to be an amount that works in cooperation with aldosterone's sodium recirculation/conservation effects. A high-sodium diet and/or too-high sodium intake during a workout or race effectively negates aldosterone's desired effects, which means greater sodium losses. Bottom line : Instead of adopting a recommendation that more and more sodium be added to the already too-high and unhealthy amounts in the diet, athletes should focus more on lowering their daily sodium intake. It is almost virtually guaranteed that each and every one of us consumes far more sodium than we need on a daily basis, and the harmful effects of oversupplying the body with sodium above its daily needs is a real and present danger which will compromise optimal health. Lowering your sodium intake in the diet, keeping it in the range of 2,300 mg or less, is not only a more appropriate recommendation/protocol for general health purposes, it will also benefit athletic performance as well. Definitely do not pre-load sodium in the days leading up to a race. So what is the answer? How should I replenish electrolytes Proper electrolyte replenishment during endurance exercise requires a gradual, consistent approach that incorporates all of the electrolytes in amounts that do not override normal body mechanisms. Remember, electrolyte intake needs to be below systemic detection, yet help alleviate systemic depression. This means that you need to consume enough to support body functions and prevent heat-related issues such as cramping without
overwhelming your body; electrolyte
intake must slip under the body's
radar detection system while still
providing optimal support. Endurolytes, Endurolytes
Fizz, and Endurolytes Powder
are full-spectrum electrolyte
products designed to fulfill the
body's electrolyte requirements,
countering the effects of
hyperthermia, optimizing specific
bodily functions, and enhancing
endurance performance, especially
beyond the two-hour mark. The
electrolyte profile of the Endurolytes
formula balances cations
(positively charged ions) and
anions (negatively charged ions)
responsibly without emphasizing
one electrolyte over others. This is
a key note to remember: When a
balance of electrolytes of cations to
anions are managed in the energy
producing cell, assuming the cell
has adequate fuel and fluid, such
a cell will produce energy at a
higher rate than one overdosed
by a single cation mixed with an
irrational list of anions. That's a
darn good reason to avoid going
salt only or to use products, be
they fuels or supplements, that contain high levels of sodium, especially
at the expense of too-low amounts of other
electrolytic minerals. Additionally, we do not
formulate Endurolytes, Endurolytes Fizz, and
Endurolytes Powder to reflect the amounts
of electrolyte loss in sweat because each
person has a unique biological predisposition
in terms of minerals lost via perspiration.
Furthermore, the differences in an athlete's
size and fitness, as well as the pace of
exercise, and of course the humidity and heat,
can mean up to a 1000% difference when one
athlete's sweat rate is compared to another's.
A one size fits all formula based merely on
sweat rates cannot, and will not, adequately
support your specific electrolyte requirements. In the purest sense, the Endurolytes formula
is not so much an electrolyte replacement
product, but is better described as an
electrolyte stress support formula. It helps
the body perform better under the demands of
exercise, especially in heat, by providing a full
complement of minerals in the proper balance
without interfering with normal body control
systems. SUMMARY Consistent replenishment of fluids and calories is essential to maintain energy levels during workouts and races. Providing constant replenishment of electrolytes is an equally important component of proper fueling. Getting your fluid and caloric needs dialed in and nailed down is fairly easy to accomplish, but fulfilling your electrolyte needs requires more attention because you have much more variability to account for. Using Endurolytes, Endurolytes Fizz, or Endurolytes Powder in your training will resolve that challenge. They contain the right minerals in the right balance, and because they are independent of your caloric and hydration sources, they provide you with the necessary dosing flexibility. Regardless of your size, sport, training intensity, fitness level, or the weather, you can fulfill your electrolytic mineral needs accurately and precisely hour after hour with Endurolytes, Endurolytes Fizz, or Endurolytes Powder. The Hammer Nutrition website has several detailed articles on sodium and electrolyte replenishment. We especially recommend: The Endurolytes Rationale ( www.hammernutrition.com/za/HNT?PAGE=ARTICLE&ARTICLE.ID=770 ) Does a High Sodium Diet Inhibit Endurance Performance and Health? ( www.hammernutrition.com/za/HNT?PAGE=ARTICLE&ARTICLE.ID=4892 ) What is the Role of Sodium During Hyperthermic Endurance Events? ( www.hammernutrition.com/downloads/JOE/nov05.pdf ) The Endurolytes Formula Endurolytes contains chelated minerals. Chelation is the process of
bonding a mineral to another substance, ideally an amino acid, making
the mineral more bioavailable. Chelated minerals are the form most
often recommended because they provide greater absorption than their
non-chelated counterparts. For example, magnesium is 87% absorbed
when chelated, but only 16% when taken in an inorganic, non-chelated
form. One nutritional scientist wrote, Estimates of normal mineral
absorption average 10%; however, absorption of chelated minerals may
be as high as 60%. Let's examine each mineral... CALCIUM is the most abundant mineral
in the human body (about 2.85 lbs/.8 kg in
the average person). Normal heart rhythm,
healthy nerve transmission, and strong
muscle contractions require a constant blood
calcium level. During exercise, calciumdependent
enzymes produce energy from
fatty and amino acid conversion. Because
fatty acids are such an important fuel during
endurance exercise, providing 60-65% of
your energy needs when exercise goes
beyond two hours in length, having adequate
calcium available to efficiently convert them
into energy is crucial. When blood calcium
runs low, the body extracts it from the
bones, but this process can't keep up with
your exercise depletion rate. Serum calcium
deficiency during endurance events may
produce high blood pressure, muscle
cramps, and weakness. MAGNESIUM should accompany
calcium at a ratio of 1:2. When calcium
flows into working muscle cells, the muscle
contracts; when calcium leaves and
magnesium replaces it, the muscle relaxes.
Many enzymatic reactions necessary for fuel
conversion to muscular energy occur in the
presence of adequate magnesium. Deficiency
of magnesium contributes to muscle cramps,
tremors, sleep disturbances, and in some
cases, convulsive disorders. POTASSIUM is the chief cation
(positively charged ion) within all muscle
cells. It is necessary for maintaining the
optimal concentration and balance of
sodium. Potassium deficiency symptoms are
nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, muscle
spasms, cramping, and rapid heart rate.
Even though 100-200 mg are lost in sweat
alone (not counting internal muscle and
cell use), if we try to replace those
amounts all at once, optimal
sodium balance is altered.
In addition, too much
potassium is hard on the
stomach and can cause
severe stomach distress. SODIUM is the chief cation (positively
charged ion) outside the cell. The average
American carries 8,000 mg of excess sodium
in extracellular tissues. During endurance
events, a minimum of three to four hours is
necessary to deplete this mineral, which may
result in symptoms of abnormal heartbeat,
muscle twitching, and hypoventilation.
However, if sodium is replaced at or near
the same rate as depletion, it overrides
the hormonal regulating mechanisms that
enable the body to conserve electrolytes.
Consumption of too much sodium will
cause a variety of problems, the least of
which is fluid retention. Therefore, we highly
recommend a more moderate, body cooperative
replenishment of sodium. CHLORIDE is the relative anion
(negatively charged ion) that accompanies
sodium. This electrolyte is absolutely
necessary in maintaining the osmotic tension
in both blood and extracellular fluids. It's a
somewhat complicated process, but to put
it in the simplest terms, think of osmotic
tension as being the proper balance and
consistency of body fluids and electrolytes.
An appropriate amount of chloride (as sodium
chloride) supports, but does not override,
the function of the hormone aldosterone
in regulating and conserving proper
electrolyte levels. MANGANESE is included in
Endurolytes as it is necessary
in trace amounts for optimal
muscle cell enzyme reactions
for conversion of fatty acids and
protein into energy. Again, fatty
acids and protein are a crucial
part of the endurance athlete's
fuel supply, so while manganese
is not technically an electrolyte, its
importance cannot
be overstated.
Research also
shows that
manganese
deficiency plays a key role in blood sugar fluctuation, free
radical build-up from intense exercise, and
nerve function disorders, especially in older
athletes. PYRIDOXINE HCL (vitamin B-6) is a
coenzyme required in 60 enzymatic reactions
involving metabolism of carbohydrates, fats,
and protein. We include this water-soluble
B vitamin in Endurolytes because of its
active role in maintaining sodium-potassium
balance. L-TYROSINE is an amino acid added
to the Endurolytes formula to protect
thyroid and adrenal function. Blood plasma
deficiency during extreme endurance events
will lower thyroid and adrenal production,
which hinders the proper rate of metabolism.
Symptoms of l-tyrosine depletion first appear
as depression, later anger, then despondency
that degenerates into total despair. If any
of these has ever happened to you during
a long training session or race, it may be
due to low thyroid and adrenal production;
it can be easily avoided by the intake of
supplemental l-tyrosine via any of the
Endurolytes products. GLYCINE is an amino
acid added to Endurolytes
Powder to help neutralize the
naturally salty/bitter taste
of the minerals. Knowledge Search © Copyright 2012 Hammer Nutrition, LTD.
