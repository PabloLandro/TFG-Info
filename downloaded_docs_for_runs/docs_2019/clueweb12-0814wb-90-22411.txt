Thousands of sufferers are going natural with simple remedies that will prevent and cure UTIs. Fact! Did you know that almost 3 out of 10 sufferers will repeat their infection after using antibiotics? This statistic has helped launched thousands of patients to try effective alternative treatments to heal themselves from home. In this article, you will learn 5 tips to begin your UTI home treatment. UTI Antibiotics Don’t Work Sometimes Antibiotics work by destroying and killing the bad bacteria that is causing the infection. This looks great on paper; however, it doesn’t always work this way. Your urinary tract has both good and bad bacteria which either help or hurt your bladder’s health. The good bacteria is responsible for helping the tract run efficiently. The bad bacteria, E coli, is responsible for the pain you are feeling. Unfortunately, scientists have yet to make an antibiotic that can destroy just the bad bacteria. The result of killing both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bacteria is temporary healing and a weak immunity. Natural Urinary Tract Infection Remedy If you have suffered from repeat infections, you are the perfect candidate to try a natural UTI remedy. Here are some tips to begin your treatment at home. The first thing you need to do is begin to boost your immunity so it can help destroy the ‘bad’ bacteria. Your immunity is a lot different than antibiotics because it can distinguish the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bacteria. You can boost your immunity by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables which are loaded with minerals, nutrients and vitamins . Specifically, vitamin C is paramount for fighting off any type of infection. You can also supplement up to 3000 mg of vitamin C daily. Unfortunately, your body will flush out a lot of the vitamin C you consume because this vitamin is water soluble. Therefore, you must also supplement the mineral zinc because that will help your body absorb the vitamin. The next step for treating yourself at home is to begin flushing the E coli bacteria that is clinging to the walls of your urinary tract and bladder. There are a variety of remedies that work to do this. One great remedy that many of my customers have had success with is supplementing cranberry tablets. Studies show that the E coli bacteria will often be flushed when cranberry’s acid is present in the bladder. You can find cranberry tablets at most pharmacies or even Walgreens. What Else Can You Do?
