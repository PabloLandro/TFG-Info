I am a Clinical Hypnotherapist in St Albans working at the Ginger Natural Health Clinic and have helped numerous clients to quit in one session. My St Albans stop smoking sessions generally last for two hours and are structured so that you beat the habit in one session. As I set my clients up for success I always talk to all my clients first before booking them in for a stop smoking session to ensure they are sufficiently motivated to make the change. So if you are giving up because someone else has asked you to then I want you to think again. Nobody can make you do something that you don’t want you to.  The number one rule is make sure that you are ready and willing to quit and that is then where I can step in with my stop smoking St Albans program to help you finally achieve your goal. To increase the success rate I also ask my clients to change their brand of cigarettes before they come in for their first session and to carry those cigarettes in a freezer bag rather than the packet. Most smokers tend to prefer a certain brand of cigarette and smoking a different brand usually makes them want to smoke less as the taste is different. The freezer bag is used to remove some of the glamour attached to cigarette packets which have been deliberately been designed to be enticing. When the cigarettes are placed in a freezer bag they become what they really are, paper, tobacco and chemicals. This is only the start of the process and during any of my stop smoking sessions you will be asked to make further changes to your habits and routines so that you quit for good.  These tips and tricks combined with a powerful hypnosis session should be enough to stop your smoking habit in its tracks. So if you are interested in stopping smoking in St Albans or have any other queries about hypnosis then give me a call and we can discuss what I can do to help you.  Or alternatively pop into Ginger Natural Health to check my availability and ask for the stop smoking St Albans program.
