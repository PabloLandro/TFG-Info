Sep, 2011 by rssfaq in Health & Fitness , Women's Health Natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis is not hard to find. Natural remedies are cheap and they can also be found almost everywhere. Why should we favor them over conventional medicine? Drugs do not cure the root cause of bacterial vaginosis, hence it can come back once you have stopped taking your medication. Douching in order to eradicate the bad smell down there will not help either since this will only worsen the condition. Natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis is not only affordable, but it is effective as well. You can treat the disease by simply changing your diet. Since the bacteria that cause this disease feed on sugar, the first thing you need to do is to limit your sugar intake. Eat lots of plain yogurt since it is rich in bacteria culture that will help restore the natural bacterial balance inside your vagina. Cranberry juice is also a good natural remedy as well. Vitamin C, antioxidants, fiber, and potassium contained in pure cranberry juice will flush out toxins and bacteria in the kidney and urinary tract, making you less prone to vaginal infections. The juice is also rich in proanthocyanidins which has the ability to prevent the growth of bad bacteria. CLICK HERE TO NATURAL REMEDY FOR BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS Besides consuming yogurt and cranberry juice, you can also use tea tree oil. For immediate relief, apply few drops of tree tea oil to your vagina and wipe with a clean, soft cloth. Alternatively, you can put moderate amount of salt on your vagina. Keep in mind that the salt therapy is not for daily use. You can do this if necessary. Another thing you can do is to wash your intimate part with pH balanced, unscented, and soap-free body wash. Abandoning your old habit of wearing tight clothes and sleeping with underwear is also recommended. There are many alternatives available, you just have to try them all and find out which natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis works best for you.
