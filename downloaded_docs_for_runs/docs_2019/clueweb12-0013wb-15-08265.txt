An important part of mainstream medicine in Europe, with sales accounting for more than 1 percent of all pharmaceutical purchases, its widely heralded as a mental and vascular stimulant and a powerful protector of the brain, liver, eyes, and circulatory system." "As more than three hundred studies demonstrate, ginkgo facilitates better blood flow throughout the body, notably the brain, where it both protects and promotes memory and mental function, even for people with Alzheimers disease.  The greater flow of blood also can stabilize an irregular heart rhythm, help men to sustain erections, and ease the numbness and pain of intermittent claudication, a circulatory disorder of the legs. Taking the extract also can be helpful in treating cataracts, retinopathy, macular degeneration, tinnitus, dizziness, asthma, headaches, premenstrual syndrome, and depression." "Almost all of the ginkgo research tested an extract standardized to contain a 24 percent concentration of flavonglycosides, the plants active chemical ingredients. Weaker preparations might be beneficial, but Id stick with using those products, whose label specifies the 24 percent concentration .  No one with a serious mental or vascular problem should give in to drug therapy, I believe, without first trying ginkgo in a therapeutic range of 240-360 mg per day.  For general mental acuity, anyone forty years old or older should take 120-160 mg per day.  As a matter of fact, ginkgos wide range of benefits, combined with its virtual complete safety, makes it worth trying for just about anyone."
