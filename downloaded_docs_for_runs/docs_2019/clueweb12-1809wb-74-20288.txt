Ketocal can provide complete nutritional support or supplementary feeding for children over 1 year of age. Precautions Use under medical supervision. Not suitable for infants. Not for parenteral use. Patients should be monitored closely for hypoglycaemia, renal stones, adequate growth and hyperlipidaemia. Suggested Intake The quantity of Ketocal should be determined by a clinician or a dietitian only and is dependent on the age, bodyweight and medical condition of the patient. Preparation & Administration The recommended dilution is 1 in 5 i.e. 20g plus 80ml to yield a final volume of 100ml.  For a less concentrated feed a 1 in 7 dilution can be used, i.e. 20g plus 120ml water to yield a final volume of 140ml. The volume of feed may need to be increased gradually over several days to minimise the risk of any possible gastrointestinal symptoms. For tube or sip feeding:  1. Measure the required amount of warm water into a container that seals with a screw top lid. Ketocal must be made up with hot water (45 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€Å¡Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 500C or 1130 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€Å¡Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1220F) to fully dissolve. Measure the temperature using a thermometer or mix freshly boiled water and cold tap water in a 1 : 1 ratio to achieve this temperature. 2. Add the prescribed amount of Ketocal to the water. 3. Whisk or shake vigorously until the powder is completely dissolved 4. Remove the lid carefully. Chill in a refrigerator if desired and use within 24 hours of preparation. 5. Stir before use.  On standing, some settling of Ketocal may occur which is a normal feature of the product. This settling should not block an enteral tube however it is recommended that the tube is flushed with water between each feed. Carbohydrate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€Å¡Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ free flavourings may be added to the reconstituted product to taste based on individual preference. Pack Size Ketocal is available in 300g cans.
