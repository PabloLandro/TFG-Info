Using Music to Relieve Stress
Using music therapy for stress can be an effective tool to help you towards healing and wholeness.
One might ask what music has to do with the well being of one's mind or body. Scientific research has a lot to say when it comes to music and the effects it has on our body and mind.
According to the American Music Therapy Association, it is a "formal" established healthcare profession that uses music to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals of all ages. It is used to promote wellness, manage stress, alleviate pain, express feelings, enhance memory and help during times of physical rehabilitation. Board certified Music Therapist help many in this growing profession.
Unlike the formal profession, as listed above, there is an informal type of therapy that is very beneficial in self-help during times of stress. Using music as a form of self-help therapy has many benefits in regards to health and stress management. Music can reduce stress and promote a healthy mind and body.
Stanford University shares an interesting news release on "The Therapeutic Benefits of Music Rhythm". It is amazing to learn that they are using rhythmic music to treat a range of neurological conditions such as attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.
Not only does music have an effect on our brain waves but also on our breathing and heart rate. Music can also be used to induce a healthy, positive, state of mind as well as lowing blood pressure, boosting your immune system, and helping to release muscle tension.
It is scientifically proven that music has a profound effect on both mind and body and can also touch our soul in ways that nothing else can.
Faster rhythms can bring focus and motivation while slower rhythms can promote relaxation and some may even promote meditative qualities.
Today there is an extensive variety of different music styles. There is virtually something for everyone of different walks of life. Because of our unique, individual makeup, not all music styles are right for everyone. It is very important to find music you thoroughly enjoy. Music that produces good feelings and promotes healthy inner self-talk is most beneficial to those suffering with stress and stress disorders such as anxiety and depression.
People who struggle with anxiety and depressive disorders are easily influenced by negative lyrics. When listening to music with lyrics, you are better off choosing music with positive, uplifting and encouraging lyrics and sounds.
It is true that music has the ability to affirm positive thinking. When it comes to lyrics, it is very important to recognize what you are listening to and how it is making you feel inside.
Music can easily be added to any exercise routine. As we know, there are many benefits to exercise. Music can motivate you with energizing beats during aerobic exercise or it can relax you when you are exercising your mind during visualization and/or meditation. It can simply be in the background when you are working or just cleaning your house. Music therapy is a very powerful tool that can enhance your road toward recovery.
No matter how you look at it, music has the ability to impact us and how we experience the world around us.
