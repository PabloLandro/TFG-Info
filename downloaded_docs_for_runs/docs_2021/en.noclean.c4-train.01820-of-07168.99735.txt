IMPORTANT FEATURES
Generic Imitrex is a recognized and clinically proven drug for migraine and its associated symptoms.
It acts faster and provides instant relief from pain and discomfort in head.
It will not help prevent the attack of migraine.
Generic Imitrex medicine is available at a very cheaper price.
DRUG MECHANISM
Usually, cluster headaches and migraines are a result of vasodilatation i.e. dilatation of blood vessels in the brain. Hence, it is essential to constrict the blood vessels in order to relieve pain in head, and Generic Imitrex (Sumatriptan) does the same. It has an antagonistic effect on certain receptors that are present in central nervous system. By inhibiting these receptors, Sumatriptan releases the intracranial pressure from blood vessels and sensory nerves, thereby constricting the blood vessels and suppressing the inflammation. This is how Generic Imitrex works in eliminating migraine and cluster headaches.

After dosage, if your headache comes back, take the dose at least two hours after previous dose.
