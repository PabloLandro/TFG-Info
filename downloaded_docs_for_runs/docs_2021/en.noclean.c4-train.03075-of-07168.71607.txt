Everyone has mucus, a “stringy gooey” substance that you blow into a tissue when you have cold or sinusitis [1].
Mucus is a substance produced by the mucus-producing tissue in the blood vessels of our body and also in other parts of the body.
It is usually produced in the mouth, nose, throat, sinuses, and gastrointestinal tract [1].
Many people are not aware of the fact how important mucus is to our body. Mucus is a natural lubricant for the body.
It not only keeps tissue surfaces from drying and cracking, it also traps harmful invaders such as bacteria before they can enter the body [1].
Mucus only becomes bothersome when there’s too much of it, as it results in stuffy nose, itchy throat and difficulty in breathing [2].
These symptoms can signal a cold, allergy, or other viral or bacterial infections [3].
We have researched and created the following list of best natural remedies to expel excess mucus. These remedies are effective and have been proven by research. It is our utmost request for you to stay and read on.

15 Home Remedies for relieving Mucus
1. Steam
Steam inhalation is said to be beneficial for people who have excessive mucus.
People believe that steam has a cleaning effect on the airways, and at the same time, it helps loosen and soften the mucus to make it easier to expel.
WebMD describes this natural method as a “simple way of relieving nasal congestion”.
An animal study done in 2010 reports that inhalation of steam can expel phlegm and relieve a cough [4].
Apart from being highly effective, this remedy is also very simple to put together.
If you don’t have a vaporizer, you can simply boil water, put it in a bowl, and inhale the steam.
Adding volatile compounds to the steam may also prove to be helpful, although researchers recommend further studies done on this matter [5].
Essential oils, for example, can facilitate a quicker drainage of the mucus.
What You’ll Need:
5 drops of peppermint oil
1 teaspoon of almond oil
1 bowl of hot water
Recommended Directions:
Combine the two oils.
Apply the mixture to your throat.
Take a steam shower.
Or you can add peppermint oil to a bowl of hot water.
Inhale the steam coming from the bowl.
Do this twice a day for one week.

A cross between water mint and spearmint, peppermint is a plant that’s native to Europe but has been naturalized in Canada and northern parts of the United States [6].

When you apply in on the throat area, you’ll feel a cooling sensation that immediately relieves congestion and makes you feel better.
In a clinical trial involving 62 subjects suffering from nasal congestion, half of the participants were given a lozenge with 11 mg of menthol while the other half received a placebo [7].
Results show that those who received menthol recovered more quickly compared to those who were in the placebo group [7].
It was reported that menthol can improve nasal airflow in as short as 10 minutes [7].
