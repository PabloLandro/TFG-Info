How Is Fungus on the Skin Treated?
Fungus on the skin is treated by prescribed antifungal creams or oral medications, medicated suppositories and OTC topical medications. The different forms of fungal skin infections include ringworm, jock itch, athlete's foot and yeast infections, states WebMD. Most fungal skin infections are caused by either yeast (Candida) or dermatophytes, which are fungi that live on the uppermost layer of the skin.
The types of fungal infections caused by dermatophytes include ringworm, jock itch and ringworm, notes Cleveland Clinic- Center for Continuing Education. Some symptoms of athlete's foot are blister formation on the feet and peeling skin that may be red and itchy. To treat these symptoms, doctors can recommend a topical antifungal cream for mild infections, but severe infections may need an oral antifungal medication.
Jock itch, which affects the genitals or buttocks region, can cause itching and a rash. Treatment for this condition can be either OTC or prescribed antifungal creams or powders, notes WebMD. Ringworm causes red and scaly patches to form on the scalp. This infection is treated with antifungal topical creams, such as Lamisil (terbinafine) or Lotrimin (clotrimazole). These are OTC products, but severe infections are treated with prescribed antifungal medicines.
Yeast skin infections are commonly caused by the yeast species called Candida albicans, states Healthline. The different types of yeast infections include diaper rash, oral thrush and vaginal yeast infections. However, a yeast infection can affect other parts of the body. The treatment option is dependent on the specific infection type. For oral thrush, medicinal lozenges may be useful, while vaginal yeast infections may require medicated suppositories.
