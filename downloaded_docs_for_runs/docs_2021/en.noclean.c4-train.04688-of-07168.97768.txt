Nairn Healthcare News April 2017
Here's the April newsletter from Nairn Healthcare
Stafffing
April has brought a lot of changes to the NHG team. We welcomed back Dr Laura Thomas from maternity leave and we will also be welcoming back Dr Kirsty Clark from maternity leave in the coming weeks.
We have a new foundation year 2 doctor, Dr Kirsty Macdonald, who has joined NHG for a 4 month placement.
The Practice has also said hello to new receptionist, Lynsey and goodbye to Margaret, receptionist based at the Ardersier branch.
A big congratulations is extended to our Practice Paramedic, Kevin, who achieved his black belt in karate recently. Well done Kevin!
NHG Medical Students' Rural Projcet interests MSP
Iona Robertson and Blair Wallace, medical students on placement at Nairn Healthcare, along with their other Fourth Year University of Dundee medical student peers met with MSP David Stewart to talk about their experience of a pilot project between NHS Highland, NHS Dumfries and Galloway and the University of Dundee.
The longitudinal clerkship is looking at delivering a significant change in medical education to
promote general practice and ensure the new doctors are comfortable both in community and hospital settings.
The partnership sees fourth year medical students based in general practice for five to six sessions a week and spending the rest of the week in secondary care or other community settings.
Dr Emma Watson, director of medical education for NHS Highland explained that the clerkship has been developed due to its education value in creating excellent doctors but also to help address recruitment issues in General Practice and rural areas.
MSP David Stewart states “I am acutely aware of GP recruitment problems and this is another way of bringing home to students what could be on offer to them when it comes to healthcare in our communities”

April is Bowel Cancer Awareness month.
Bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in Scotland but it is treatable and curable especially if diagnosed early. Taking part in bowel cancer screening is the best way to get diagnosed early.
If you are aged between 50-74, the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme will invite you for screening every 2 years. A kit will be sent to your home address where it is to be completed and returned to the screening centre based in Dundee.
1 in 20 over 50s will get bowel cancer at some point in their lives, screening aims to find bowel cancer at an early stage and if the cancer is detected early enough, there is a 90% chance of treating the disease successfully.
Screening saves lives but at the moment, in some areas of the UK, only a third of those who receive a test in the post complete it. Thousands of people are missing out on the best way to detect bowel cancer early when it is easier to treat and there is a greater chance of survival.
For more information call the helpline on 0800 0121 833 or visit www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/screening.
Winter is now officially over and we are all looking forward to Summer and getting out in the countryside and gardens.
However, the country undergrowth from Spring until Autumn is covered in tiny ticks which may carry bacteria and can transfer to people when the tick attaches itself. If the tick is removed properly and correctly, there is no risk to health but there is a risk of developing Lyme disease if this is not
done correctly.
A symptom of Lyme disease is a red skin rash which can be cured with a simple antibiotic. If the rash goes unnoticed, it can result in joint pain or nerve problems which may require stronger antibiotics.
If you find a tick on yourself or your child, wait until you get home and calmly remove the tick with a tick removal tool which is designed to get underneath the tick and lift it off safely. Don’t attempt to remove it with your fingers. Using fingers or tweezers risk squeezing the tick and actually injecting the Lyme disease bacteria into your blood.
DO NOT USE VASELINE, CIGARETTES OR ALCOHOL
For more information, please pick up the Tick Information Guide from reception or read online at http://www.nairnhealthcaregroup.co.uk/website/S55041/files/tick%20information%20sheet.pdf. You can also visit www.checkforticks.org.uk.
