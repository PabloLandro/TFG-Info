In its advice, the SMC states that dupilumab can be used within the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema) who have had an inadequate response to existing systemic immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, or in whom such treatment is considered unsuitable.
In the SMC advice, Dupixentwas considered a therapeutic advancement by the clinical experts consulted.
National Eczema Societychif executive Andrew Proctor said: “This new treatment is a highly significant step forward for people living with more severe atopic eczema in Scotland.
“Atopic eczema can be a cruel, never-ending condition, with constant itching and inflamed painful skin, and the many negative physical and mental health effects have a profound impact on people’s day-to-day life. Dupilumab offers people with a more severe form of atopic eczema a much needed new treatment option in a disease area where therapies have been limited.”
In the United Kingdom, approximately 1.5 million (3%) adults have atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema.3,4
Within the general UK population, it is estimated that there are 14 adults per 100,000 with moderate atopic dermatitis and 6 adults per 100,000 with severe atopic dermatitis who may be eligible for treatment with dupilumab.
Sanofi Genzyme UK and Ireland general manager Peter Kuiper said: “From the start of the dupilumab journey, we have been committed to supporting the physical and emotional well-being of people with atopic dermatitis. Today’s advice from the SMC means this innovative treatment is available to patients in greatest needand marks another important milestone for dupilumab.”
Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is characterised by rashes often covering much of the body, and can include intense, persistent itching and skin dryness, cracking, redness, crusting and oozing.
Itch is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients and can be debilitating. In addition, people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experience impaired quality of life, including disrupted sleep as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that is designed to specifically inhibit overactive signaling of two key proteins, interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 (IL-4 and IL-13), which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis.
Dupixent was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union on 27 September 2017.
