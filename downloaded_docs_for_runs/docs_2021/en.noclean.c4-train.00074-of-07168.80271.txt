Currently I use minoxidil foam in the morning and a compounded liquid minoxidil (5%) solution with progesterone (2%) at night. I use probably more than the recommended half capful of foam in the morning, because no one really uses that little.
Does nyone here use minoxidil more than twice a day? I'm wondering if there are diminishing returns on using minoxidil foam additionally in the afternoon/evening. I figure i'd just use a capful of foam after i get off work or something because i'm just hanging out at home but it also dries quick so I can leave the house and do whatever i need.

I use 1ml of 5% minoxidil once a day and I see no reason to use it more often. There is no evidence that mega-dosing minoxidil is going to be helpful.

22 hour half life makes more than twice a day pointless
I do use WAY more than the recommended dosage per application

It actually says on the packaging that "using more, more often will not increase results"

I think Minoxidil is useless by itself. If people aren't using some anti androgen, they're just
throwing their money in the toilet.

Well, if their hairloss isn’t too aggressive it might buy them a few years, or at least allow them to bald at a more graceful pace. But yea, don’t expect results to be permanent if dht is still active....

Yeah but if you used it more than twice a day, it would mean that you dosed your scalp with more minoxidil. Sure, this is why 5% is more effective than 2% minoxidil, but the question is in whether or not there are diminishing returns on using a percentage minoxidil higher than 5%, or using it more times per day.

So just use a larger amount in one of your 2x a day applications

Currently I take concentrated Minoxidil (30% at night, and 15% during the day).
I'm only doing it for faster hair growth. I'm trying to go from a buzz cut to long hair.
It helps my hair grow faster, I don't think Minoxidil by itself it can give permanent regrowth, but
I do think more can temporarily bring in hair growth, on it's own.
Right now it's growing around 2.5 centimeters/one inch all around my scalp, because it goes
systemic.

Any side effects on your skin ? Other than the normal aging progress ?

I do have darker circles around my eyes, but that is only
with the 30% solution. When it is down to 15% the circles are not there.
