Hello, Anon!
Thank you for posting.
Please note that urgent questions should not be posted to our website. We answer questions within 24 hours. If your child is ill, has a high fever, and you are concerned, please don't hesitate to call your child's doctor for advise and/or seek medical care.
Acetaminophen can lower your child's temperature. The dosage will be listed on the label of the bottle by age. Another option is Ibuprofen. Again, dosing instructions will be listed on the label. If you are unsure, ask your doctor how much to give her.
Some things that can also help her feel better:
-A a cool compress on the head.
-Keeping the room at a moderate temperature, not too hot and not too cold.
-Dressing in one layer of light clothing with a blanket.
-A cool to lukewarm (not cold) bath or sponge bath.
-Drinking plenty of fluids.
