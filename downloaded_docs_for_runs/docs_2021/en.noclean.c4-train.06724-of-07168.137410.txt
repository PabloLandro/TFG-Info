Achilles Tendon Injury Walking Boot
Achilles Tendon Walking Boot With Wedges
The Bledsoe Achilles Boot saves time by eliminating casting series required to stretch the achilles tendon during rehab.
Our Hi Top boot with heel wedges places the foot in a plantar-flexed position using wedges in the heel. As the condition improves, wedges are removed, gently stretching the Achilles tendon and relieving tension on the tendon during rehab.
Indications For Brace Use
This device is indicated for immediate application following injury to or reconstruction of the achilles tendon.
Contraindications
This device is contraindicated for unstable fractures and proximal tibial or fibular fractures.
Brace Features
Aluminum boot shell and upright system that, unlike plastic boots, can be reformed to fit virtually any leg or ankle shape
Four cast inter-locking 10° urethane wedges provide fast change of foot angle
Contains three layers of pads that contour to the ankle shape and support the ankle for total control
Unique rocker design allows patients to closely simulate a near normal gait without abnormal loads on any joints
Also available in Lo-Top and PTB (patella tendon bearing) versions (call for more information)
Optional air ankle/heel pad allows for ability to adjust ankle pressure for increased comfort and provides pneumatic ankle support.
