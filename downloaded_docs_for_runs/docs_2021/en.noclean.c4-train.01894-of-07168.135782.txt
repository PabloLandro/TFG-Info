Warts on the Face - Treatments and Remedies for Removal

A note about Warts on the Face - Treatments and Remedies for Removal
In natural health and healing, we believe in holistic health and healing, as we realize that different parts of the human body are highly interlinked, often beyond Man's understanding. We also believe that the body has the ability to heal itself of any disease, even supposedly incurable diseases.
In order to do so, the body needs the support of some basic dietary and lifestyle good health habits, such as a full body detox and a proper understanding and application of nutrition. No matter how remote or unrelated a health condition may seem, these fundamental health steps will greatly magnify the effects and benefits of any of our health-promoting efforts, including the use of specific natural health remedies.
When using straight salicylic acid, pat yourself dry after a shower and apply to damp skin. Before showering the next day, use an emery board to file the wart. Repeat this treatment as needed. Though this can take several weeks, it has been shown to be effective.
Cryotherapy is another popular method that involves freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen. It is a relatively painless method with the treatment lasting just a few minutes, but the resulting blisters take time to heal, and repeating treatment will probably be necessary.
Other medical treatments involve surgically removing the warts, burning them away, or removing it with laser treatment. As with anything pertaining to the face, use caution; the same is true for warts on the face. For some areas, it may be wise to see a physician, as the skin on your face is very sensitive, with some areas quite fragile.
Because the warts are the outward sign that the human papilloma virus (HPV) is present in the body, they can be difficult to treat without treating the root problem as well. Often, the virus runs its course and the warts disappear on their own. Some warts respond to only one treatment, while others may be treated repeatedly without showing any signs of clearing.
To help deal with warts on the face from the inside out, strong immunity is important. And, to help the immune system, it is important to eat well during this time, concentrating on raw fruits and vegetables as your main source of nutrition, with added whole grains, soy products, nuts and seeds for good amino acid consumption.
One treatment known as cantharidin has a fairly good track record. It is a chemical that is applied to the wart and left alone for 24 hours before being washed off. It is painless and chosen many times for use with children as a result. Depending on where the wart is located, this method is often excluded for warts on the face because it can cause blistering, and the procedure has to be repeated every two weeks until the wart has disappeared.
To avoid treatments that are painful or leave behind scarring, many people are turning to natural products or remedies that use natural ingredients. This is particularly true for warts on the face, since everything is so noticeable on the face.
Several homeopathic remedies work well, addressing the problem from the inside of the body as well as the outside. This is also true with a number of the readily available essential oils.
Duct tape has been used as a home remedy for warts removal for many years, and it works well on the face because the tape can be cut down to the size of the wart and left for up to a week. This can be repeated as often as necessary, being sure to clean any tape residue in between times. Barring appearance, this method has been proven to be as effective as cryotherapy, at the cost of a roll of duct tape.
To use duct tape for removing warts on the face, simply cover the wart with duct tape for up to 7 days. After you remove the duct tape, soak the wart in warm water, and then use an emery board or pumice stone to try to file the wart off. This process can then be repeated until the wart is gone.
