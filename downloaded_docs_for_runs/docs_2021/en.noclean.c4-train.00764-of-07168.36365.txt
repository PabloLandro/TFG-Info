If you have been diagnosed with depression, you may be following the traditional depression treatment of antidepressant medications and therapy. In addition, your doctor may recommend some lifestyle changes that can help you feel better. One of the best is adding exercise, because physical activity has been shown to reduce depression symptoms.
Depression Treatment: Why Exercise Helps
“There is a connection between stimulating your heart rate and your brain function,” says Julie Walther Scheibel, MEd, a counselor at Concordia Seminary Counseling and Resource Center in St. Louis, Mo.
In a detailed analysis of 80 studies on the subject of exercise and depression, researchers found that:
Exercise helped depression both immediately and over a span of time.
Exercise helped all those studied, but especially people who were in the worst state, physically or psychologically speaking, at the beginning of the exercise program.
Exercise helped adults in particular, and men and women equally.
The more someone exercised, the less depressed he became.
The best anti-depression regimen was a combination of psychotherapy and exercise.
More studies are still needed to determine exactly how exercise helps, but scientists think activity reduces levels of stress hormones and improves physical fitness, thereby alleviating the depression symptoms. In addition, the socialization, distraction from daily stress, and self-esteem that often come with group exercise may play a part in relieving symptoms.
Depression Treatment: What Type of Exercise Is Best?
The answer to that question isn’t clear; what is clear is that any exercise is better than none at all.
After consulting with your physician, "I would recommend exercising at least three to five times a week for an hour,” says Walther Scheibel, who recommends a combination of cardiovascular exercise — also known as aerobic exercise — and weight training.
“There is no excuse not to exercise,” adds Walther Scheibel. She suggests that people should participate in physical activities that they enjoy and that work with their lifestyle and budget. “Walking, running, biking, swimming, and group exercise classes" are all good exercise options.”
Depression Treatment: Getting Started
If you are interested in exercising to relieve your depression symptoms, talk with your mental health provider. He or she can work with you to help figure out how to fit exercise into your overall depression treatment plan.
Talk with your primary doctor as well, especially if you have a health condition like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure. Your doctor can recommend exercises that will be safe and effective for you.
Healthy adults can aim for 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercises, like walking, jogging, or biking, each week; add strengthening exercises, such as push-ups, sit-ups, or weight training, at least twice each week.
A qualified personal trainer at your gym or local community center can help you develop a comprehensive routine that sets fitness goals as well. And recruiting an exercise partner may be just the motivation you need to commit to a regular program that will bring you both physical and psychological benefits.
