Light therapy as a medical tool for treating sleep disorders, jetlag, SAD and more
Light therapy has become increasingly popular in the last few years as a treatment for a wide range of medical problems related to daylight exposure. Research has made it more and more evident that daylight has a large impact on our health. Lack of daylight can lead to sleep disorders, jetlag, lack of energy and depression. Light therapy can provide an effective solution to these problems.
Light therapy lamps for home use

The Davita light therapy lamps (light boxes) were awarded the rating 'Good' more than once by 'Stiftung Warentest', the German consumer association, and recommended for treating seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also known as winter depression or winter blues. The light boxes are certified and comfortable to use. Light therapy can be done at home to treat for example:
