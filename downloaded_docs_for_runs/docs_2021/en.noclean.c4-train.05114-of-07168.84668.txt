5 Home Remedies For Dry Cough And Sore Throat
By ritamehta Cough & Sore Throat, Featured, Health Care, Home Remedies 0 Comments
[toc]Sore throat is annoying. It burns, feels scratchy and also causes pain because of which you feel difficulty in talking and swallowing food and makes you feel exhausted. Generally, sore throat is caused by bacteria and virus and often accompanied by dry cough; but there are some other reasons like smoking, allergic reaction, postnasal drip or dry heat that can cause sore throat.
Though there are more than enough over-the-counter medicines for cough and sore throat but they are not as effective as these natural remedies to overcome dry cough and sore throat. There is no need to run to the doctor’s office, unless sore throat is accompanied by other symptoms like high fever and green mucus. Pregnant ladies must also take doctor’s advice before using any natural cures. You can get relief from sore throat and dry cough using these natural remedies.

5 Home Remedies For Sore Throat And Dry Cough
Salt Water Gargling
Salt water gargling is the best remedy to cure sore throat and dry cough naturally. It works even better than store-bought mouthwash. It brings fast relief because it works as a mild antiseptic and washes away the mucus lining the throat and helps to clear the phlegm. When the mucus cleans up and the lining is exposed, it kills the germs. Salt destroys the bacterial growth and hot water brings relief from the dry cough that has been triggered by irritated, sore throat by soothing the inflammation of the throat. All you have to do is dissolve 1 tsp table salt in a glass of warm water, gargle and spit out three or four times.
Repeat this process three or four times a day to find quick relief. Gargling with baking soda solution may also help in getting relief from sore throat. Just mix half tsp baking soda in a glass of warm water, stir thoroughly and gargle as many times as you can. Gargling with salt water often brings quick relief but the real relief comes when you strengthen your immune system. Sipping hot water throughout the day may also bring relief from dry cough by preventing the throat from drying up.
Lemon And Honey
Honey has been used for centuries as a sore throat remedy. Its anti-bacterial properties kill germs and speed up healing by drawing up water from the inflamed tissue. This results in reducing swelling and inflammation. Lemons are a rich source of vitamin C and flavonoids and work to relieve the body from pain and fever by increasing perspiration.
In a glass of hot water, add half a lemon and a spoonful of honey. Drink 2-3 cups a day to get instant relief from sore throat and dry cough. Sip it slowly to loosen the mucous in your chest and throat. The antibiotic and natural sweetening properties of honey will soothe your throat. You can add half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to this drink to speed up the healing process.

Steam And Water Vapor
Another effective natural cure for sore throat is inhaling steam. There are various ways of doing this. The best way of inhaling steam is boiling water in a vessel and adding few drops of eucalyptus oil or vapor rub in it. Cover your head and the vessel in such a way that allows you to inhale the steam properly. If steam gets too much, uncover yourself for few seconds to breathe fresh air. Continue inhaling the steam till the water cools down.
This process will help to loosen mucus from the throat, chest and nasal passage and speed up healing process. Other alternatives for steam inhalation include taking a hot bath or hot shower. You can use 2-3 drops of eucalyptus oil in your bathing water as well. Running a humidifier or cool-mist vaporizer may also help in preventing the air from drying by adding moisture. Dry air makes the lining of throat too dry which initiates coughing.
Ginger Tea
Ginger has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties which help to inhibit the growth of bacteria, fungus and other microorganisms that contribute to sore throat. To prepare ginger tea, add 1 tsp. powdered ginger or 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger root in a cup of boiling water. You can add 1 tbsp honey and squeeze half a lemon to make it more beneficial and delicious.
Cayenne
Cayenne contains an active ingredient capsaicin which has the ability to relieve pain. Besides this, it also contains flavonoids, carotenoids and vitamin A and C. It brings relief from the intensity of the sore throat. In a cup of boiling water, add half teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1 tsp honey to get relief from dry cough. To avoid recurrent bouts of sore throat, strengthen your immune system by taking good nutrition, herbs and vitamins.
