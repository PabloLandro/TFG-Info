Braces for Achilles Tendonitis
Achilles tendonitis is a chronic and painful condition caused by microtears in the tendon that occur through repetetive use. When the achilles tendon starts to swell, it causes pain in the lower foot area - you might even see or feel bumps in the spots that hurt. Achilles tendonitis can also be caused by bone spurs, pushing your body too hard without giving it time to recover, or not warming up before intense exercise.
Shop-Orthopedics has many different foot braces that can help compress your achilles tendon and provide some relief. There are even a few braces listed here that can provide therapeutic hot or cold to the affected area to alleviate pain!
