About This Condition
Vitiligo is a type of skin discoloration characterized by progressively widening areas of depigmented (very white) skin.
The depigmentation that occurs with this condition is associated with the local destruction of melanocytes, the cells that produce the pigment that darkens the skin, called melanin. Vitiligo affects 1–4% of the world’s population.1
Symptoms
Symptoms of vitiligo include decreased or absent pigmentation in localized or diffuse areas of the skin. Hair in these areas is typically white, and the skin tends to sunburn more easily.
Other Therapies
Other treatment includes cosmetic creams and tanning solutions. Treatment may also involve the management of any underlying medical condition, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, scleroderma, melanoma-associated leukoderma, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and autoimmune disorders (including Grave’s disease, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, and Addison’s disease). Rarely, skin transplants may be necessary.
