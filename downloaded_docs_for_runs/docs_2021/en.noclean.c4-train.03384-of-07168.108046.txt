Men are most commonly affected, but women can also suffer from hair loss.

Once considered an incurable condition, baldness can now be treated in various ways. There are a number of preventative measures and home remedies that can protect you from baldness.

One of the very main and common reasons for hair loss in women is physical or emotional stress. Divorce, a big surgery, trauma, etc. can all be major stress-inducing factors, and, therefore, one may experience a significant amount of hair-loss during this period. It happens as a result of your body putting effort into directing its resources towards getting you through the situation. Physical changes like sudden weight loss, high fever, etc., can also result in hair loss.
Hair health depends a lot on person’s diet. In most of the cases, hair loss is triggered by improper diet. Generally, people under-nourish themselves when it comes to eating. They do not care about proper balance of nutrients in their diet. People with a tendency to lose hair should take a well-balanced and complete diet. According to experts, a diet containing good quantities of seeds, nuts, grains, vegetables and fruits can provide adequate amounts of all the vital nutrients required for good hair growth. Also, foods like milk, vegetable oils, honey, wheat germ, yeast, liver, etc. also prove to be really good for hair growth.

Both minoxidil and finasteride require a lifelong commitment, but for users looking for a treatment with permanent results, hair transplant surgery may be the solution.

These procedures are costly and may require multiple sessions depending on the patient.
Minoxidil – Minoxidil was originally developed to treat high blood pressure. People who used this medication were seen sprouting new hair on their scalp as well as other areas of the body. Many clinical trials were then conducted on this drug and later it was introduced in the market under the brand name Rogaine. Rogaine is a topical hair loss that inhibits DHT in the hair follicles. Today, millions of men and women are known to benefit from the use of this drug to arrest hair fall. The success rate of Minoxidil in reversing hair loss is nearly 90%. It is useful for treating alopecia in both men and women. The topical formula of Minoxidil, Rogaine, is a colorless odorless liquid that needs to be applied twice daily to the scalp in the balding areas. Minoxidil pills are also sold under the brand name of Loniten. Rogaine is available over-the-counter. You can buy up to 5% concentrations which are deemed safe for use and have very little side effects.
