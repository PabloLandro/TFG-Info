Learn How UV Light for Eczema Gives Patients Relief
Light Sources > UV Light Therapy > Learn How UV Light for Eczema Gives Patients Relief
Eczema is an irritating skin condition which causes painful, itchy patches of dry skin in varying degrees of severity and UV light for eczema is proven to provide relief. Eczema can cause emotional stress to those suffering with this skin condition who only want relief. There are different types of eczema, which include:
contact dermatitis
atopic dermatitis
seborrheic dermatitis
nummular eczema
stasis dermatitis
dyshidrotic eczema
Symptoms can be different among people suffering with eczema, although most people experience the most common symptoms reported as extreme itching, inflamed red skin, rough scaly patches of skin, dry, sensitive skin and areas of swelling. Itchiness is associated with all types of eczema and can make symptoms worse if people scratch too much. Eczema may develop in babies and children who may outgrow the condition, or eczema may develop in adulthood.
Eczema currently has no known cure, although there are effective treatments in the form of topical ointments, creams and ultraviolet (UV) light therapy.
How UV Light for Eczema Works
Topical treatments may work for some people, although UV light for eczema has been proven to give relief to many patients. UV light therapy, also called phototherapy, should be in a controlled setting under a physician’s care with the proper type of UV lamp. The right type of lamp must be used with the proper wavelength administered as exposure to the wrong type of UV radiation could worsen symptoms.
Some people notice an improvement in their symptoms during the sunny, summer months, these patients are more likely to see improvement with UV light therapy. People living in the northern hemisphere may notice that a UV lamp improves their symptoms during the winter months when sunlight is scarce. Consistency is key with UV light for eczema treatment as improvement usually takes one to two months of regular exposure.
Light is divided into colors and measured in wavelengths, with the unit of measure in nanometers (nm). Ultraviolet light is in the electromagnetic spectrum of radiated energy which is invisible to the human eye. Ultraviolet light is divided into three areas of UVA, UVB and UVC radiation. UVA and UVB radiation is often prescribed to treat eczema.
UVA light is in the wavelength between 315 to 400 nm, UVB radiation is between 280 and 315 nm with narrow band UVB light measuring 310 nm. UVB radiation is the most common type of light therapy for eczema and emits wavelengths which are similar to the sun’s rays and are proven to give relief to many patients. Some patients prescribed UVA treatments are also prescribed a medication called psoralen which makes their skin more receptive to the UVA treatments.
All types of UV light for eczema treatments are proven to help patients by suppressing the overactive immune system which reduces inflammation, itching and pain. UV phototherapy can improve vitamin D production and increase the skin’s own bacteria fighting systems. Phototherapy is proven to help about 70% of those suffering with this irritating skin condition to find relief from symptoms, or at least calm them down and in some cases put them in a state of remittance.
