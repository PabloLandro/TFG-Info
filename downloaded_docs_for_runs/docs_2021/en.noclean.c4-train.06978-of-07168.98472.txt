Leg scars can look unsightly and may cause you to feel embarrassed about exposing your legs. Although it is not possible to completely remove scars, there are many creams and gels, medical procedures and home remedies that can significantly reduce their appearance. Whether the scars are a result of burns, surgery, injuries, chicken pox, acne or insect bites, there is a treatment that will target each of these. Read on to find out more.
Steps
Method 1
Reducing the Appearance of Scars
1
Know what scars you have. Before you choose a treatment, it is essential that you know what scarring you are dealing with, as some treatments will only work for certain types of scars. You should always consult with a dermatologist before pursuing any treatment. The main scar categories include:
Keloid scars: these are large, growth-like scars that result from a wound that heals itself too aggressively. Keloid scars may grow larger over time and sometimes even return after treatment. They are particularly common in people with darker skin tones.
Hypertrophic scars: these are raised scars which are initially red or pink. They will fade on their own over time. These scars may be the result of burns or surgery and can be itchy.
Atrophic scars: these scars are the deep pits that are left behind after severe acne or chicken pox.
Stretch marks: these are thin, reddish-purple scars which happen because of rapid weight gain or loss. They are particularly common in pregnant women. Over time, these scars will fade and become white-ish.
Contracture scars: these scars are usually caused by severe burns and may cover a large area of skin. These scars may feel tight, especially if they are around the joints, and can potentially limit body movement.
Dark spots: these types of marks are not actually scars, but a type of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, usually caused by mosquito or other insect bites.
2
Begin treating scars as soon as they appear. You should begin treating your scar - with a suitable cream or other treatment - as soon as the wound has completely healed. Most scar treatments will be much more effective on newer scars than on old ones, thus saving you time and money down the road.
3
Exfoliate regularly. Most scars will eventually disappear on their own as skin rejuvenates itself - shedding old layers of skin and growing new ones. You can help this process along by exfoliating your skin regularly in the shower, using a body scrub or a bristled brush.
Avoid exfoliating over fresh scars or healing wounds. Aggressive scrubbing can slow the healing process, or even make fresh scars worse.
4
Apply sunscreen. This is one often overlooked piece of advice that can significantly reduce the appearance of scars. What many people fail to realize is that new scars are extremely sensitive to UVA rays, and exposure to sunlight can cause them to become much darker than they would be otherwise. By applying a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to newly scarred skin, you can significantly minimize discoloration.
If you have a larger scar – or a scar in a location that is frequently exposed to the sun – you may need to regularly apply sunscreen for up to a year while paying close attention to the scar's healing progress.
5
Massage your legs. Regularly massaging your legs can help to break down the fibrous tissue which causes scarring. It also improves circulation which can aid with discoloration. Your can massage legs in the shower using a body brush, or you can use your hands to rub each leg using long, circular strokes.
6
Use concealer. A good concealer can do wonders to hide scars on the legs. Make sure to get a concealer that matches your skin tone, and that you blend it in well with the surrounding skin. A waterproof concealer is best if you will be exposing your legs to unpredictable weather conditions, and theatrical make-up (which is much thicker than regular make-up) can work wonders for those with particularly bad scars.
Method 2
Using Home Remedies
1
Use vitamin E oil. Vitamin E has been used in many health and beauty treatments for many years and many people swear by it as a successful treatment for scars. Vitamin E oil is moisturizing and contains powerful antioxidants, helping it to repair skin and improve the appearance of damaged tissue.
You can take vitamin E capsules orally or you can apply the oil topically by bursting a capsule with a pin and applying the oil to the affected area.[1]
You may want to test the vitamin E oil on a small patch of skin first, before you apply it to any large areas of skin, as vitamin E oil may cause an allergic reaction in some people, resulting in contact dermatitis.[2]
Be careful not to exceed the daily recommended dose of vitamin E oil, whether you're applying it topically or taking it orally.
2
Try cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is a natural product, which helps to reduce the appearance of scars by moisturizing and softening the outer and middle layers of skin, while simultaneously smoothing out the surface of the skin. You can use pure cocoa or use a lotion containing cocoa butter, which you should apply to the scarred area between 2 and 4 times a day.[3]
You should massage the cocoa butter into the skin using circular motions, making sure that it is almost completely absorbed by the skin.
Be aware that cocoa butter will be most effective on newer scars than older scars, though you should still see an improvement either way.
3
Apply lemon juice. Lemon juice is a common home remedy for scar treatment, which receives mixed reviews. It is believed to lessen the appearance of scars by acting as a bleaching agent to minimize redness, while also exfoliating, to help skin regenerate. While lemon juice has helped some people to reduce their scars, this method is not recommended by dermatologists, as lemon juice can be harsh and drying on the skin, and has not been scientifically proven to remove scars.[4]
If you do decide to try lemon juice on your scars, cut a small slice of lemon and squeeze the juice directly onto your scars. Leave the lemon juice on overnight or for several hours. Do not apply fresh juice more than once a day.
If you feel the pure lemon juice is too strong, you can dilute it with water before applying or mix it with some blended cucumber to limit the harshness of the treatment.
4
Use Aloe Vera. Aloe vera is a plant whose sap has well-known moisturizing and soothing properties. It is often used to treat burns, but can also be used as an effective natural scar treatment. Aloe vera contains anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, making it most effective in the treatment of fresh scars (though it should not be applied to open wounds). The aloe vera soothes the skin and helps it to regenerate, thus reducing the appearance of scars over time.[5]
To apply, break a leaf from an aloe vera plant and squeeze the clear, gel-like sap directly onto the scarred skin. Massage the sap into the skin using small circular motions. Aloe vera is very gentle on the skin, so you can reapply the sap up to four times a day.
If you cannot get your hands on an aloe vera plant (though they should be available at most plant nurseries) there are many creams and lotions available which contain aloe vera extract, that may be equally effective.
5
Give olive oil a try. Olive oil is another natural treatment which has been said to improve the appearance of scars. Extra virgin olive oil, in particular, is believed to produce the best results as it has a higher acidity level than other olive oils and a greater quantity of vitamins E and K. The oil works by softening and moisturizing the skin, causing the scar tissue to slacken, while acidity in the oil exfoliates the skin.
Apply a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil to the affected area and massage using small circular motions until the oil is absorbed. You can also use the olive oil as an exfoliating scrub by mixing it with a teaspoon of baking soda, which you can massage into the scars before rinsing off with warm water.
You can increase the effectiveness of the olive oil treatment by blending it with another oil. Combine two parts olive oil with one part rosehip, chamomile or calendula oil and apply this blend to the scars. The added oils will increase the soothing properties of the olive oil.
6
Try cucumber. Cucumber is a safe natural treatment which has been said to break down scar tissue, while cooling and soothing any inflamed skin around the scar. Again, this treatment will work better on fresh scars than on older ones. To use, peel a cucumber, chop roughly and blend in a food processor until it achieves a paste-like consistency. Apply a light layer of this paste to the scarred skin and leave it on overnight, or apply a thicker layer and wash off after 20 minutes.[6]
The remaining cucumber paste will keep covered in the fridge for several days, and you should continue to apply it to the affected area each night.
You can increase the effectiveness of this treatment by mixing the cucumber paste with some of the aforementioned products, such as lemon juice, olive oil or aloe vera.
Method 3
Using Over-The-Counter Products
1
Try scar reducing creams and gels. There are many products available over-the-counter at the pharmacy that claim to reduce the appearance or even remove scars. Whether these products will work for you, will depend on the type and severity of your scarring.
Though medical professionals may be skeptical about the success rates of such creams[7], many people have found products like Mederma and Vita-K to be effective.
Mederma works well for stretch marks and other types of scarring, if it is systematically applied 3 to 4 times a day, for up to six months. It works by softening and smoothing the scars, on the legs or any other area of the body.
2
Use a silicone based scar sheet. Silicone scar sheets are a great, innovative way to deal with scars, especially those that may look unsightly. The scar sheets are self-adhesive, so they will stick to your skin while the silicone technology works to hydrate, soften, and fade the scars. The silicone sheets are available for purchase over-the-counter or online and each box will usually provide an 8 to 12 week supply.
The silicone sheets have been proven effective in treating scars, but it will take time and patience to achieve noticeable results. The sheets must be worn over the scar every day, for 12 hours a day, over a 2 to 3 month period.[8]
3
Try bleaching creams. Bleaching creams, such as those containing the ingredient hydroquinone, reduce the appearance of scars such as stretch marks and dark spots by targeting the hyperpigmentation, which causes dark brown, black, bright red or purple scars. These creams will effectively lighten the color of the scars, causing them to become less noticeable over time.
Be aware that hydroquinone-based creams, though effective, have been banned in the European Union as they are thought to contain carcinogenic properties and heighten the risk of skin cancer.[9]
Hydroquinone products are still available over-the-counter in the US, in concentrations up to 2%. Anything higher than that requires a prescription.
Method 4
Using Medical Treatments
1
Try dermabrasion. Dermabrasion is a method of exfoliating the skin, using a rotating wire brush or diamond wheel, which removes the top layers of skin over and around the scar. In the weeks following the procedure, new skin will grow back, and the appearance of the scar will be greatly reduced. Dermabrasion is usually used for acne and other facial scars, though it can be performed on the legs by a qualified surgeon. Dermabrasion on the legs is a delicate procedure as the skin on the legs is very thin and runs the risk of doing more harm than good if done incorrectly.[10]
Dermabrasion on the legs is usually only recommend for dark spots or indented scars caused by mosquito bites, etc. Keloid or hypertrophic scars (raised scars) should not be treated with dermabrasion.
Make an appointment with a board-certified plastic surgeon who can analyse your scarring and decide whether you are a good candidate for dermabrasion. Be aware that these kinds of aesthetic procedures are not usually covered by insurance.
2
Get a chemical peel. Chemical peels can be used to treat superficially scarring on the legs, and works particularly well for scars caused by hyperpigmentation. During a chemical peel, a dermatologist will apply a layer of acidic solution to the scarred skin and leave it on for approximately two minutes. You will experience a burning sensation, which should cease once the acid has been neutralized and the solution washed off. In the two weeks following the procedure, the top layers of skin will begin to peel away, leaving smooth, new skin behind.[11]
Depending on the scarring, you may need to go through several chemical peel procedures before you see a noticeable difference in the appearance of your skin.
Be aware the new skin that is exposed after a chemical peel will be particularly sensitive and you will need to protect it by avoiding sun exposure and using a sunscreen with a high SPF for several weeks.
3
Try laser treatments. Laser treatment is a great option for improving the appearance of deeper scars than those targeted by dermabrasion and chemical peels. Laser treatment works by burning away the scar tissue, allowing fresh, new skin to grow and replace the scarred surface. The area is numbed with a special cream before the procedure, so the treatment is not particularly painful. Another advantage is that the laser can pinpoint the scar precisely, so the surrounding skin remains unaffected.[12]
Laser treatment should only be received at a reputable clinic with a well-trained staff, as lasers can be dangerous if used incorrectly.
You may need to return to the clinic for a series of treatments to fully remove the scar. The downside of this option is that laser treatment can be expensive, ranging from $1000 to $5000, depending on the size and depth of the scar.
4
Get steroid injections. Steroid injections have been successfully used to treat keloid scars, which are notoriously difficult to get rid of. For small keloids the steroid injections, which contain substances such as hydrocortisone, are injected directly into the skin around the scar. Larger keloids are sometimes sliced or frozen off before the steroids are used.[13]
Steroid treatment is a process rather than a once-off procedure, and you will need to return to the clinic every two to three weeks to receive another injection.
This treatment has a high rate of success, but is relatively costly and may cause skin discoloration in darker skinned patients. Consult with a cosmetic surgeon to decide if this treatment is best for you.[14]
5
Try collagen or other fillers. Injections of collagen or other fats can be very helpful in improving the appearance of indented scars, such as the pockmarks caused by chicken pox. Collagen is a natural animal protein, which is injected into the skin with a fine needle, thus filling in the indented scars. Though very effective, the results of collagen treatments are not permanent, as the body absorbs the natural collagen. You will need to get the scar refilled after about four months.
Each collagen injection costs approximately $250, so this going down this route for scar treatment can be costly.
You will need to have a skin test done before you receive any collagen injections, to ensure that you will not have an allergic reaction to the treatment.

There are variable strengths of chemical peels. You can buy chemical peels over the counter, but they will be less strong than the ones available in salons, spas, or medical doctor offices.

You will need to develop a plan with your doctor to stop the constant irritation that picking does to your skin. You may opt for applying an oil or cream to the area by rubbing, which may alleviate the itching and not create worsening scars and scabs.

Question
I have something black all over my legs that is inside the skin and appears to be soft and rubber like. What can I do?
Community Answer
Try a deep exfoliant. Make your own with brown sugar, coconut oil, olive oil, tea tree oil and lavender oil. Heat the coconut oil. Add other liquids. Let cool until it starts to solidify then pour it into the sugar. Mix and let it firm up. Use daily all over, but specifically on mentioned areas. You should still see a dermatologist.
