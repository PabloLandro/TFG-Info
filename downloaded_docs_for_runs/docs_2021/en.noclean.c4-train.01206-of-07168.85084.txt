Foot Injured Runner Wants to Continue to Marathon

Tags: Sports Therapist foot rehabilitation physical therapist running injury
Paula Radcliffe, last run was thought to be at the 2011 Berlin Marathon. Radcliffe continued to suffer a nagging, uncomfortable foot injury. But, believes running one last top-level marathon will help her persevere and just remain competitive—rather than trying to beat her world record.
Not only that, but it will allow her to make up for remaining on the sidelines of the 2012 London Olympics, but most importantly, let her end her career on a note of her choosing.
The runner has this to say about preparing and training for the Virgin Money London Marathon this April, “I will never say ‘retire’ because I am never going to finish running. I am still going to be getting out for a run and I don’t want to jeopardize that because it’s important.But I want to ask [my feet] to run one more marathon.”
If you are an athlete and want to know more about rehabilitation for foot and ankle injuries, consider contacting a podiatrist like Dr. Nicholas Crismali of Crismali Foot and Ankle. Dr. Crismali can teach you about the different rehabilitation options that are available and help you decide on one that’s right for you.
Foot Rehabilitation for Athletes
Injured athletes are always looking for better, faster ways to aid their recovery and get back to the sport they love. To do this, podiatrists and physical therapists are often consulted so the injured athlete can get back onto the field as soon as possible. But rehabbing an injury is just as serious as the injury itself, and going through the motions of physical therapy or rehabilitation is a necessary process to keeping that injury at bay.
Sports Therapist or Physical Therapist?
If an athlete gets a foot injury, it is essential to receive foot rehabilitation to ensure proper healing. Sports therapists are more focused on athletic-related injuries than general physical therapists. It is important for an athlete to become healed properly because if they attempt to get back into their game before they are physically well, they could re-aggravate the original injury or even suffer a new one due to their weakened state.
Physical Therapy Gives Hope
Physical therapy helps to keep athletes as active as they are physically capable, which will get them ready to return to the field once their feet become healed. Physical therapy often gives hope to athletes.
