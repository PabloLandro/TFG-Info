RejuvaSil Scar Gel 1oz/ 30ml
The Effective and Proven Scar Gel Treatment
The new RejuvaSil® has more effective ingredients than any other liquid silicone products and at a much more affordable price. Scar Heal Inc. has added the following ingredients to maximize the products effectiveness:
Emu Oil
Squalene (Shark Oil)
Silicone (Dimethicone)
Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate. Stable form of Vitamin C
RejuvaSil® is available in tubes of 15ml Rejuvasil and 30ml Rejuvasil
While silicone sheeting is the gold standard for treating scars, you now have the option of using Scar Fx® Silicone Gel Sheeting or applying the RejuvaSil™ in a gel form. There are many studies that have proven both technologies effectiveness in treating the
following scars:
• Keloid Scars
• Hypertrophic Scars
• Surgical Scars
• Traumatic Scars
• Burns
Most of the liquid silicones made for Scar Treatment have similar properties and effectiveness for treating scars. The research and chemist at Scar Heal, Inc. discovered that the addition of Emu Oil, Squalene (shark oil) and Vitamin C makes our product highly effective.
The RejuvaSil® unique formula allows the gel to penetrate into the skin without leaving a residue or stickiness found in other products.
RejuvaSil Scar Gel uses a a blend of silicone, emu oil, shark oil and stable vitamin C to thoroughly reduce the appearance of scars. Effective on keloids, hypertrophic scars, surgical scars, and burns, it restores an even skin tone and texture without residue or stickiness.
