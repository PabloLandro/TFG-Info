After doing some research on the amino acids, I came across some interesting fact about one called “L-Theanine”. It plays a role in the formation of GABA and neurotransmitters for a calming effect which is exactly what I am looking for. Here’s what it says:
Theanine functions, uses, and health benefits
L-theanine is involved in the formation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). GABA influences the levels of two other neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin, producing a relaxation effect. GABA serves a sedative function that brings balance to excitability that can lead to restlessness, insomnia, and other disruptive conditions. Theanine also appears to increase levels of dopamine, another brain chemical with mood-enhancing effects, which can reduce blood pressure.
L-theanine is an amino acid that helps promote a mild, restful, relaxed state without diminishing daytime alertness. Stress impairs the immune system, leaving us vulnerable to opportunistic infections, and can cause depression. People under stress can mitigate many of the harmful effects of stress with l-theanine. L-theanine reduces stress and anxiety without the tranquilizing effects found in many other calming supplements.
Theanine has a reputation for promoting mental and physical relaxation, and decreasing stress and anxiety without inducing drowsiness, as measured by increased generation of alpha-waves. L-theanine directly stimulates the production of alpha brain waves. By increasing the brain’s output of alpha waves, theanine may control anxiety, increase mental focus, improve concentration, and promote creativity.
Also found this:
THEANINE (Non-Essential)
L-Theanine is a derivative of Glutamic Acid. It is the active agent found in green tea. It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, increasing levels of GABA and dopamine. It has been shown to lower blood pressure and reduce the effects of PMS. Theanine acts as a non-sedating relaxant to help increase the brain’s production of alpha-waves (those associated with “relaxed alertness”). This makes Theanine extremely effective for combating tension, stress, and anxiety, sharpening mental focus, improving concentration and promoting creativity without inducing drowsiness.
I went to a number of different health food stores and I always have a hard time looking for amino acids as there is never a standard. Each store will carry a few but never all. When I finally came across a store that had it, I decided to pick up another “hard to find” amino acid that I’ve done some reading about called Acetyl-Carnitine so I’ll pick up that too!

Woke up this morning with the vibration. I really hate the fact that it comes and goes. I’ve learned to take things that will help me and make it stop but nothing ever seems to “cure it”.
Sad to think I’ve been at this for two and a half years and I’ve learnt so much and yet, I know nothing. The big thing now is at least I can control it and deal with it because I know what works.
Back to the amino acid research…

Interesting day this morning…
I was late leaving the house this morning and I had my vitamins with me but I forgot to take them until I got into work. Since I started taking 3mg of copper per day my cold hands have completely disappeared. Until today.
Early into my morning routine I start getting the cold hands and it hits me right away that I forgot to take my copper. So I take that along with everything else and the cold hands disappear.
It’s not fun but it’s great to have an experience like this to reinforce my theory on the copper deficiency. Got to keep checking my tongue for those cracks so I don’t take it too far again…

One full day taking Glycine and once again, I can feel a slight difference with the candida. I’m starting slow by taking one teaspoon in the morning and again at night. I can feel the benefits from it but it also gives me a weird feeling whenever I take it. Almost like it has an effect on my magnesium. So I’ve been adding one or two 250 mg of magnesium during the day. Not sure why it has the effect or maybe it’s because my copper is still low enough to effect the magnesium.
I guess I really need to focus on taking the 3 mg of copper a day along with some higher dosages of magnesium and build those up for a while…

The past couple of days I’ve been doing more research regarding amino acids and although the Arginine did make a difference with the candida, there must be something else. I go out on my lunch to check out a number of health food stores and body building stores along Yonge street during my lunch. Not one had Glycine but one store did say they could order it for me next Friday but I didn’t want to wait that long.
After getting back to the office I make a few phone calls and actually found a store on Bloor street that have it in stock made by AOR. Exactly the one I’ve been looking for. They put it aside with my name on it and I pick it up on my way home.
GLYCINE is a non-essential glucogenic amino acid that can readily convert to serine. It is the simplest of all the amino acids and can be synthesized from acetic acid and Vitamin B. Necessary for optimal growth, glycine is involved in phospholipid and collagen production, and in the release of energy. Glycine received its name because it resembled the sweet taste of glucose and glycogen.
Glycine is an integral part of bile salts and the heme pigment in the RBC’s (red blood cells). It is also a major part of of the amino acid pool available for the synthesis of non-essential amino acids when required.
Glycine is essential for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), as well as that of bile acids. It is used as a gastric antacid and a dietary supplement, and in the treatment of various myopathies (disease of the eye muscles). It also functions as an inhibitory nerotransmitter in the central nervous system. Glycine retards muscle degeneration by supplying additional creatine. It is necessary for central nervous system function and a healthy prostate. Its inhibitory action helps prevent epilepsy and has been used in the treatment of bipolar depression. It is sometimes utilized in liver detoxification compounds with glutathione.

Today I decided to join a ball hockey game with some guys at work. I feel better but I’m still not perfect or as good as I should be. Maybe some exercise would do some good. I’m still a little paranoid about the stress of playing hockey so I took one magnesium just before the game and homeopathic magnesium during the game.
Two hours later I was absolutely exhausted but I felt pretty good having not done anything thing like that in at least seven years. Maybe longer…

A couple of days with the liquid amino and I can’t say I feel a difference. Once again, I’m impatient for results and probably need to take it a while longer. I will say one thing through… I’ve felt the positive effect that Arginine has on my candida. Another deficiency. So here’s my theory on Candida and all the web sites and supplements that suggest they work.
If someone has Candida, there is an underling deficiency. The worse the candida, the more deficiencies exist. This includes all Vitamins, all Minerals and all Amino Acids.
I’m of the opinion now that the amino complex might be the same as a multivitamin whereas you can’t solve a deficiency unless you focus on a single amino acid.

Today I was taking to friend at work about how great books are for learning and he mentioned that Indigo and Chapters are now his favorite stores. I agreed but I suggested going to the library instead making it much more cost effective. I also suggested that some books are available online through ebooks. He had never heard of this so I logged into my account and the only book I knew for sure on ebooks was Dr. Jensen’s book on body chemistry and nutrition. I pulled up the book and was showing him how it worked just like a regular book and he was impressed.
Our conversation ended there and I continued to flip through the book. I came across a chart that explained the chemical needs of each body tissue and the minerals required for optimum health. I remember seeing it the first time because I was very interested when I saw that zinc was required for the adrenals.
This time, I happened to notice that the mineral required for the spleen was COPPER!! Wow, I couldn’t believe it. I did go too far with the high dosage of zinc. So if the weird cracks on my tongue was because the copper was too low then this time, I will have an indication as to when my copper has balanced.
This is great and totally unexpected! So I do have an issue with my spleen…

With all my research on amino acids and the trouble actually finding them individually, I decide to try a complex that contains all of them: Liquid Amino
I picked this one because I thought the actual dosage for each amino was high in comparison to other supplements I’ve seen. Each dose of 4 tablespoons contains the following:
ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS
L-Leucine 689 mg
L-Threonine 489 mg
L-Isoleucine 378 mg
L-Methionine 178 mg
L-Valine 578 mg
L-Phenylalanine 489 mg
L-Lysine 1000 mg
L-Tryptophan 98 mg
NON-ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS
L-Arginine 1900 mg
L-Glycine 5976 mg
L-Aspartic Acid 1467 mg
L-Histidine 164 mg
L-Cystine 16 mg
L-Proline 3289 mg
L-Alanine 2067 mg
L-Serine 711 mg
L-Glutamic Acid 2467 mg
L-Tyrosine 44 mg
I’ll start of slowly and see what effect it has…

I’ve been checking my tongue every day in the mirror to see how my candida is changing with the different supplements I try. Today I noticed some cracks in the middle section about 1/4 of an inch back from the tip. I remember from the chinese tongue analysis that this is an indication of something but I can’t remember what. Dr. Google?
Tongue Analysis
As a whole the tongue reflects the condition of the digestive system and the organs associated with blood, nutrient assimilation, and excretion. You can also see how ‘hot’ or how ‘cold’ your internal organs are. Therefore it has a high value as a diagnostic tool.
Your tongue accurately reflects the state of your digestive system- from rectum to esophagus, including the stomach, small intestines, colon (large intestine), pancreas, spleen, liver and gall bladder.
So I possibly have a problem with my stomach or spleen? I google a little more to find out more about the spleen and how I can use nutrition to help heal it. I didn’t find too much but I think it’s weird that these cracks have shown up just when I thought I was making things better.

Now maybe it’s just me… but when I went to the Neurologist and he diagnosed me with “anxiety” he wasn’t interested in helping me in any way except with Paxil. (Which he said wouldn’t really help me…)
Amino Acids and Neurotransmitters
In addition to the need for sufficient amounts of amino acids to produce them, neurotransmitters can also become depleted by too much caffeine, sugar, or alcohol. In some cases, people find that a supplement of l-tyrosine benefits the body by providing the means to replenish neurotransmitters.
Why Are Amino Acids Called the “Building Blocks of Life?”
All protein, 100%, is made up of amino acids… and proteins regulate nearly every biochemical reaction in the body. Amino acids account for 75% of dry body weight (total weight minus water weight).
100% of neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, acetylcholine, aspartate, glutamate, are made of amino acids.
100% of hormones are made up of amino acids. Sex hormones are made up of amino acids plus fat or lipids.
100% of neuropeptides, the substances the brain releases with every thought, are amino acids.
100% of peptides are made up of amino acids.
95% of muscle is made up of amino acids.
95% of the heart is made up of amino acids.
The most promising treatment on the horizon for AIDS, namely Peptide-T. Peptide, is a string of 6 amino acids. DNA requires amino acids. In other words, amino acids are necessary for our genes to function properly. While vitamins and minerals are important, they only make up 1.5% of dry body weight. You need the right vitamins and minerals, but if your amino acids are out of balance, you will not be healthy. Glucose and oxygen are the primary fuels for the Amino Acid Miracle that we are.
Given these numbers, do you think that amino acids might have something to do with health, illness . . . and recovery?
And I found another site that was a little bit more detailed:
Flexible and tough skin is made from amino acids.
Muscles are made from amino acids.
Tendons and ligaments are made from amino acids.
The clear gels that fills the eyes is made from amino acids.
The clear lenses of the eyes are made from amino acids.
The retina of the eyes is made from amino acids.
Blood vessels are made from amino acids.
Nerves are made from amino acids.
Hair, finger nails and toe nails are made from amino acids.
Collagen matrix structures in bones are made from amino acids.
Natural killer (NK) immune cells are made from amino acids.
All other immune cells are made from amino acids.
Low-friction surfaces in the joints are made from amino acids.
Brains cells are made from cholesterol and amino acids.
Male semen is made from amino acids.
Female vaginal lubricants are made from amino acids.
Lipoproteins in the blood are made from amino acids.
Now if these neurotransmitters are so important to the healthy function of the nervous system, and 100% made from amino acids, wouldn’t it seem logical that amino acids would be the first place to look? Of course not. It would make too much logical sense.

Building Blocks of Life, Building Blocks of Healing
What are Amino Acids? They are the most important, powerful and significant nutrients we can consume. However, Medicine, and society at large, has not yet grasped their power and importance. Did you know that your body, minus water, is 75 percent amino acids? Or that all neurotransmitters, except one, are amino acids? That 95 percent of hormones are amino acids, and 100 percent of all protein is amino acids? And that amino acids govern and participate in every chemical reaction in the body?
When we correct profound amino acid deficiencies, the body is able to cure itself and energy sky-rockets.
I do not recommend that people walk into a health food store and ask for assistance in choosing amino acids. Without blood testing, it is impossible to accurately determine specific amino acid deficiencies, and you can cause new deficiencies if you take the wrong ratio of supplements. Let’s take a look at a few amino acids, and what they can do in the right ratios:
allergies – methionine
depression – s-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe)
heart disease – carnitine
GI problems – glutamine
high cholesterol – lysine/taurine
muscle weakness – leucine/isoleucine/valine
blood sugar problems – alanine
arthritis – histidine
insomnia – GABA
bipolar illness and epilepsy – taurine
mental exhaustion – tyrosine

Very happy with the improvement in my candida since I started Arginine. It’s not perfect but it is a slight improvement…once again. I’ve been doing a ton of research on amino acids lately and it’s now my humble opinion that they are more important than vitamins and minerals.
The Therapeutic Role of Amino Acids
Data and statistics have made it clear that amino acids are not only the building blocks of life, they are also the stepping stones to recovery from illness. You may (if you haven’t yet) want to review Why Are Amino Acids Called the “Building Blocks of Life?”
Amino acids account for 75% of dry body weight. (Vitamins and minerals account for only 1.5% of dry body weight). Amino acids make up all neurotransmitters except for one. 100% of hormones are made up of amino acids. DNA and RNA, our genetic material, require amino acids. Protein IS amino acids. Amino acids influence every system in the human body and every endocrine gland. A few examples of amino acid dynamics within endocrine functions are:
Thyroid
The various forms of thyroid hormone are all made of amino acids. The thyroid gland is our “energy burner” and helps us maintain a normal metabolic rate. Too little thyroid hormone, and we become exhausted, dull-witted, depressed, and sluggish. The fuel that thyroid hormone burns is glucose, whose levels are maintained by the hormone insulin which is made by the pancreas.
Pancreas
Insulin is one of the main hormones made by the pancreas, and is made up of a long chain of amino acids. Insulin is essential for maintaining normal levels of blood sugar. Problems with insulin can lead either to hypoglycemia or diabetes.
Adrenal
The adrenal gland makes a host of hormones among which adrenaline is one of the most important (Adrenaline is made from the amino acid, tryosine). Adrenaline is essential for the fight-or-flight reaction. We need adrenaline in times of real danger. Those of use who are chronically stressed have adrenals that are “burning out”. That’s because each episode of stress is handled by the adrenals as if our lives were in danger. One of the important functions of adrenaline is that it “tells” the liver to break down glycogen, our glucose store, so that our body has an immediate rush of energy.
Pituitary
Human Growth Hormone (HGH). HGH is a major contributor to longevity, energy, vitality, muscle strength and endurance. HGH is a long chain of amino acids.
Sex Hormones
The sex hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are amino acid based.
Thus far, you know that amino acids are crucial to the nervous system and endocrine system. We can correct many abnormalities in these two systems by replacing deficient amino acids.
Specific Essential Amino Acid Functions
They prevent aging and degenerative disease through their anti-oxidant functions. They keep the gastrointenstinal tract working. Amino acids are critical to immune system function and thus help us fight viruses, bacteria, parasites, yeast, and cancer.
The sulfur-containing amino acids help detoxify heavy metals within our bodies.
Muscles are built and repaired by amino acids, such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine.
Connective tissue, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and joint surfaces, are made of amino acids, especially L-Proline and L-Lysine.
Heart muscle is dependent on amino acids, as is heart rate and rhythm.
The nervous system relies heavily on amino acids to serve as neurotransmitters, the molecules that carry information from one neuron to another. They regulate blood sugar levels, and therefore, energy.
The amino acids cysteine and methionine fight allergies. The amino acid taurine prevents epileptic seizures. Growth hormone requires the amino acids ornithine and arginine. This is vitally important as growth hormone keeps us young, strong, and fit.
The amino acid glycine is required for wound healing. L-Carnitine is a “heart tonic.”
Histidine fights arthritis. Histidine increases libido.
Lysine helps fights viruses and is essential for bone growth. In times of serious health crises, such as wasting from cancer, amino acids help rebuild muscles, improves the immune system, and can help restore vitality.
Obesity, and weight in general, can be fought with tryptophan. D-L
Phenylalanine helps relieve pain.
Threonine helps prevent buildup of fat in the liver.
These are the facts. Most of all, we have found that amino acids work. They help alleviate symptoms, cure disease, and help us live longer and healthier.

Found some Arginine at my local health food store but I tried several other places looking for Glycine but I can’t seem to find it anywhere. The store clerks seem confused whenever I mention that I’m looking for it.
L-Arginine Dosage
2 to 30 grams. Each person has biochemical individuality, and significantly differing needs for amino acid supplements. When supplementing arginine orally, some researchers recommend taking the supplements for two months, then discontinuing for two months before starting a new “cycle.” A Take a small dosage for one week, note the benefits and the side effects, and increase or decrease the dosage until the benefits are maximized and the side effects minimized.
I’ll start with three capsules a day…
