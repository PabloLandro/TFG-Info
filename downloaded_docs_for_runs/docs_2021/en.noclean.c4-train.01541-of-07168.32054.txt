Vitamin and Mineral Supplements for People with Asthma
Posted on September 28, 2018 by HealthFoods.com Editorial Team
To have a fit lifestyle, a balanced diet is necessary and the same applies in the case of asthma. You just need a healthy eating habit to at least minimize the effects of asthma as there is no single vitamin, mineral or supplement can treat or cure asthma completely.
However, there are certain vitamins, minerals, and supplement which can improve the lung function and provide much relief to the body. Check out the list of elements below which can be used to reduce the impact of Asthma.
Vitamin D
Increase your intake of vitamin D if you are facing asthma attacks. Consumption of vitamin D can improve the lung functioning and other breathing issues. Eat food products like eggs, salmon, and other fortified foods that can give you a high amount of vitamin D.
Vitamin A
Vitamin A is considered as an essential element in controlling asthma. It is also a very effective vitamin for other lung disorders. Vitamin A is extremely necessary for the healthy development and function of lung airways. You can get an ample amount of vitamin A from beef and lamb liver, salmon, cod liver oil, cheese, carrots, leafy greens etc.
Vitamin B6
Foods rich in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) help to reduce the intensity and frequency of asthma attacks. Pyridoxine plays a vital role in the production of adenosine triphosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate, molecules that help to relax bronchial smooth muscle tissue. B6 rich food like a banana is considered as an essential asthma-fighting vitamin.
Magnesium
As per research, it is found that lack of magnesium in body impacts the lung functioning which can create a worse condition for an asthma patient. Thus, to improve the lung function, it is advised to increase the consumption of magnesium through dietary sources such as spinach, banana, pumpkin seeds, dark chocolate, etc.
Zinc
Studies found that higher intakes of zinc during pregnancy may protect against childhood wheezing and asthma. So, in case, your body is lacking zinc, you can have foods like beans, nuts, red meat, oyster, dairy products, etc. in your meal.
