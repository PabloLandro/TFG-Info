Scar Repairex® cream helps to reduce scars which are up to 2 years old. Its excellent for burns, accident, post-surgery, caesarean & keloids scars.

Scar Repairex® cream is excellent for reducing inflammation on damaged skin e.g. after hydroquinone, Retinoic acid or topical steroid abuse or after Laser treatment of skin.
*Independent trials have shown up to 60% reduction in scar area over a 6-month period.
