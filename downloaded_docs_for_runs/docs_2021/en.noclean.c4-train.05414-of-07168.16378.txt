Ask the Nurse
My daughter is 18 and she has strong pain every month. The doctor said she probably has some cysts on her ovaries. Can this be true if she is this young?
Yes, beginning with the onset of menstruation until menopause, ovarian cysts are made monthly. This is normal. Cysts are usually not cancerous and are small. When they enlarge more than five centimeters doctors may advise birth control pills and repeat a transvaginal ultrasound to determine if the cyst resolves.
Although normal, many women do make cysts. Frequently, physicians will recommend low dose birth control pills (BCPs) to suppress the formation of cysts. Luckily, 90% of women who take BCPs will favorably respond and have decreased pain.
Often a combination of BCPs and OTC products (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen) will relieve menstrual cramps or pain.
All My Best,
