The list of benefits of yoga asanas and pranayamas extends way beyond weight loss, inner peace, and flexibility. There are many more ways in which yoga can make a huge difference in your life. Here are 8 unexpected benefits of yoga for health. Let’s see if you can guess any of these!
Lesser Known Health Benefits Of Yoga
1. Lesser Food Cravings
That’s right, yoga for health doesn’t just help you lose weight – it also helps curb food cravings. That’s because it reduces cortisol and fatigue levels, both of which make us crave for unhealthy comfort foods. Yoga also brings inner peace, which helps us be happy in the present moment rather than chasing bodily pleasures.
2. Asthma Management
Yoga can be immensely helpful for asthma patients. Asanas like Triangle Pose, Fish Pose, and Warrior 2 improve respiratory health. Pranayamas like Alternate nostril Breathing and Skull Shining Breath help soothe the condition. Yoga also reduces inflammation, which helps manage asthma.
3. Better Bowel Movements
Regular yoga sessions are very good for digestion. Issues like heartburn, diarrhea, and constipation reduce in frequency when you practise yoga for health. It’s especially helpful when practised during the morning since it wakes up the digestive system and reduces sluggishness.
4. Improved Athletic Performance
The benefits of doing yoga are experienced also while doing other physical activities like sports. Yoga significantly improves mind-body coordination, boosts flexibility, and makes you more strong. It increases endurance as well as stamina. All of this make one a better athlete. Here are the best yoga poses for strength and stamina.
5. More Productivity At Work
Not just on the field, but you can also notice the benefits of yoga asanas at the workplace. Yoga improves memory, focus, and concentration. At the same time, it reduces anxiety as well as mental dullness. Regular yoga practitioners find it much easier to function efficiently in a high stress environment.
6. Emotional Healing
Yoga helps us face emotional issues and heal the wounds with love and care. It can be very helpful as a complimentary therapy for those who have suffered from emotional trauma since it improves the body’s ability to manage the associated stress. Yoga increases courage, compassion, and self-love. It also soothes depression and anxiety.
7. Increased Fertility
For those trying to conceive a child but facing difficulties, yoga offers hope. Yoga poses improve blood circulation in the male and female reproductive systems. They reduce stress and blood pressure. They also promote better hormonal balance and can boost libido.
8. Better Memory Power
Among the unexpected benefits of yoga asanas is that they can help you remember better. Plenty of studies have found that yoga boosts brain health. It refreshes the brain with increased oxygen and blood flow. It significantly reduces stress. And yoga also lowers the rate of inflammation – all of these help you focus on and remember information much better.
