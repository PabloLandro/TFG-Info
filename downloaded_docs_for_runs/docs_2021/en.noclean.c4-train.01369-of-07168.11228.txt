Lone parents
In children under 5, a fever is considered to be a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.
Fever is very common in young children. More than 60% of parents with children aged between 6 months and 5 years say their child has had one.
It's usually caused by a minor viral infection, such as a cough or cold, and can normally be treated at home.
A high temperature can be quite worrying for parents and carers, but most children recover with no problems after a few days.
How to tell if your child has a fever
Your child may have a fever if they:
feel hotter than usual when you touch their forehead, back or stomach
feel sweaty or clammy
have flushed cheeks
If you suspect your child has a fever, you should check their temperature with a thermometer.
Safe, cheap digital thermometers are available from your local pharmacy, supermarket or online retailers.
Forehead thermometers shouldn't be used as they can give inaccurate results.
Read more about how to take your child's temperature.
How to care for your feverish child
To help keep your child comfortable, you should:
encourage them to drink plenty of fluids – offer regular breastfeeds if you're breastfeeding
only offer them food if they seem to want it
look out for signs of dehydration – these can include a dry mouth, no tears, sunken eyes and, in babies, fewer wet nappies
check on your child from time to time during the night
keep them away from childcare, nursery or school – let the carer, nursery or school know your child is unwell
there's no need to undress your child or sponge them down with tepid water – research shows neither actually helps reduce fever
avoid bundling them up in too many clothes or bedclothes

Medicines and fever
If your child seems distressed, consider giving them children's paracetamol or ibuprofen. These shouldn't be given together.
But if you give your child one medicine and it doesn't seem to be helping, it's OK to try the other one before the next dose is due.
Paracetamol can be given to babies from 2 months old. Ibuprofen is suitable for babies aged 3 months or over who weigh more than 5kg (11lbs).
Always check the instructions on the bottle or packet carefully, and never exceed the recommended dose.
Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16.
If your child suffers from asthma, seek advice from your GP or pharmacist before giving them ibuprofen.

What to do if you're worried
If you're worried about your baby or child, call your GP practice.
If the practice is closed, call NHS 111 or contact your GP out-of-hours service – there will be a phone number on your GP's answerphone.
The doctor or nurse you speak to will ask you questions about your child's symptoms. Your answers will help them decide whether your child can be cared for at home or whether they should be seen at the GP practice, out-of-hours centre, or hospital.
Always get medical advice if:
your baby is under 3 months old and they have a temperature of 38C (101F) or higher
your baby is 3 to 6 months old and has a temperature of 39C (102F) or higher
you think your child may be dehydrated
your child develops a red rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it
your child has a fit (convulsion)
they're crying constantly and you can't console or distract them, or the cry doesn't sound like their normal cry
has a high-pitched or unusual sound when crying
the fever lasts for more than 5 days
your child's health is getting worse
you have any concerns about looking after your child at home
Read more about spotting the signs of serious illness.
Call 111
if you can't speak to your GP and don't know what to do next.
