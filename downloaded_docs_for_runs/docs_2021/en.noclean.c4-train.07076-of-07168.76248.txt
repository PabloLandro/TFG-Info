A burn is an injury to tissues from direct contact with or exposure to thermal (fire, steam, hot liquids, hot objects), chemical, electrical, or radiation sources. Burns are incredibly painful. Minor burns can usually be treated at home, but more serious burns can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. It is important to recognize the difference so you can get the care you need as quickly as possible. If you are uncertain of the source of a burn, treat it as a severe burn and seek medical care immediately.
Steps
Part 1
Categorizing the Severity of Your Burn
1
Determine whether you have a first-degree burn. First-degree burns are the most common burns. You have a first-degree burn if only the outermost layer of skin is affected. These are the least severe type of burn and can usually be treated at home. Symptoms involve:[1][2][3]
Pain
Area is sensitive to the touch and warm to the touch
Minor swelling
Reddening of the skin
2
Examine whether you have a second-degree burn. Second-degree burns are more serious than first-degree burns. The damage goes beneath the outer layer of skin to affect the layer underneath. You may have a scar after it heals. Symptoms of a second-degree burn include:[4][5][6]
Pain
Swelling
Blistering
Red, white, or blotchy skin
Reddened areas “blanch,” or turn white, when pressed with finger
The burned area may look wet
3
Identify a third-degree burn. Third-degree burns involve severe damage that includes tissues beneath the skin such as the layer of fat below the skin and possibly even the muscle or bone. Symptoms include:[7][8][9]
A waxy or leathery appearance to the skin
Reddened areas do not “blanch” or turn white when pressed on, but remain red
Swelling
Black or white areas on the skin
Numbness where the nerves have been damaged
Breathing problems
Shock — pale, clammy skin, weakness, blue lips and fingernails, and decreased alertness
4
Seek medical care if needed. Someone with a third-degree burn requires immediate emergency care and EMS (9-1-1) should be called. If you have less serious burns you may still need to go to the emergency room. Seek professional medical care if:[10][11][12]
You have a third -degree burn.
You have a second-degree burn that covers more than 3 inches of skin.
You have a first or second-degree burn on your hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or a joint.
The burn is infected. Infected burns may seep liquid from the wound, and have pain, redness and swelling that gets worse over time.
The burn has extensive blistering.
You have a chemical or electrical burn.
You have inhaled smoke or a chemical.
You have problems breathing.
Your eyes have been exposed to a chemical.
You are uncertain of the severity of the burn
You have severe scarring or a burn that doesn’t heal after a few weeks.
Part 2
Treating Minor (First- and Second-Degree) Burns at Home
1
Soothe the burn with cold water. Cool water will lower the temperature of the burned area and stop the damage from progressing. Gently run cool water over the burn for at least 10 minutes.[13][14]
If the movement of water flowing over the burn is too uncomfortable, you can apply a clean, cool, wet towel.
Do not put ice or very cold water on the burn. The extreme temperatures may increase the damage to your tissues.
2
Take off jewelry that is on the affected area. If you have jewelry or other items that may restrict blood flow if the area swells, remove it immediately.[15][16]
Items that may need to be removed include rings, bracelets, necklaces, anklets, or any other item that could cut off circulation during swelling.
Swelling will start immediately so remove the items as soon as possible, but do so gently to avoid further irritation to the damaged tissues.
3
Apply aloe on the burns that are not open wounds. The gel from aloe plants reduces pain and inflammation. It also promotes healing and helps your body repair damaged skin. Do not apply it to an open wound.[17][18]
Aloe is found in many gels and moisturizers. If you have a commercially prepared aloe vera gel, apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
If you have an aloe plant in your house, you can obtain the gel directly from the plant. Break off a leaf and split it open lengthwise. You will see a clear, greenish goo inside. Dab it directly onto the burn and let it absorb into the skin.
If you do not have aloe, you can apply another moisturizer to prevent the burn from becoming too dry as it heals.
Don’t put greasy materials like butter on the wound.
4
Don’t pop blisters. If you pop blisters, this creates an open wound and makes you vulnerable to an infection. If the blisters burst on their own you should:[19][20]
Wash the wound with soap and clean water.
Gently dab an antibiotic cream over the area.
Protect the area with a nonstick bandage.
Go to the doctor if you have blisters that are larger than 1/3 of an inch in diameter, even if they have not burst.
5
Combat pain with over-the-counter medications. Burns can be extremely painful. You may need painkillers to help you get through the day or fall asleep at night. Over-the-counter medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be effective; however, they may interfere with other medications so discuss them with your doctor before taking them. Medications with aspirin should never be given to children. If your doctor says it is ok for you, you can try:[21][22]
Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB)
Naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
6
Check to see if your tetanus shot is up to date. Tetanus is a disease that occurs when the tetanus bacteria infect an open wound. Your doctor will likely suggest that you get a tetanus shot if:[23]
The burn caused a deep wound or it is dirty.
You haven’t had a tetanus shot in the past five years.
You don’t know when your last tetanus shot was.
7
Monitor the burn for signs of infections. Your skin provides you with a barrier against pathogens in the environment. A burn makes you vulnerable to infection. If you develop any of the following symptoms, go to the emergency room right away to have it checked by a doctor:[24][25]
Pus or fluid seeping from the wound
Swelling, redness, or pain that increases over time
Fever
Red streaks spreading from the burn site

Question
My baby spilled hot food on herself and developed blisters that popped later. The open wounds looked dry, but as she plays, the dry skin peels off. What do I do?
Brian Salazar-Prince
Top Answerer
Clean the wound regularly with soap and water. Pat it dry and apply antibiotic cream. Cover the wound with a band-aid or a non-stick dressing to allow it to heal without further injury.
Thanks!

Question
What do I do if I burn my fingers?
Community Answer
Cool water is the best way to cool the site. If the skin has broken, you need to clean the site thoroughly with soap and water. Do not put any chemicals such as peroxide or alcohol on a burn. Cover the burned area with antibacterial ointment and a bandage. If the skin is not broken, simply cooling and gently cleaning the area is sufficient. If it blisters, do not pop them.
Thanks!

Question
How long does it take for the burn to go away?
Brian Salazar-Prince
Top Answerer
Different people and burns heal at different rates, and the rate of healing is further augmented by the treatment of the burn. Most minor burns will heal within 2 weeks without issue though.

Question
What do I do if hot water fell on my foot but there is no sign of a burn?
Community Answer
You may still have a minor burn. There's no harm in putting cold water and/or aloe vera on the area, especially if you feel any pain.
Thanks!
Yes No

Question
Why does burns occur when you drop boiling water on your skin?
Community Answer
The same reason you get burned by fire, a hot stove, or anything else extremely hot. Extreme heat is powerful and can destroy or damage a lot of things, including human skin, which is soft and sensitive. A burn is damage to your skin.
Thanks!
Yes No

Question
Is honey useful for burns?
Brian Salazar-Prince
Top Answerer
Technically, yes. There are certain types of honey which are being explored for their abilities to help promote healing in treating certain types of wounds, including burns. I do not, however, encourage you to go pour honey from the grocery store on your hand. You would be much better off with aloe vera.
Thanks!
Yes No

Question
What do I do if I burn myself with a hot glue gun?
Community Answer
First, you should remove any hot glue that may have stuck to your skin. If the burn is minor (pain, redness/swelling), run cold water on it or hold a cold washcloth on the burn. Then apply antibiotic ointment or aloe vera to the burn. If you have burn cream, use that. Then wrap it with some sterile gauze and leave it alone. If your burn is severe, (blisters, open wound, bleeding, black skin, severe pain/swelling, or covers a large area) you should seek medical attention immediately.
Thanks!

Question
What happens if I burn myself with a curling iron?
Community Answer
It depends on how hot the curling iron was, and how long it was on the skin (as well as where on your body it burned). If you have a minor burn, you would most likely experience redness, some pain, and limited or no scarring at all.
Thanks!
Yes No

Question
What if I get a dark blister?
Community Answer
That is most likely a 2nd or 3rd degree burn. You should get medical attention right away.

Article SummaryX
If you’ve suffered a first- or second-degree burn, gently run cool water on the burn for about 10 minutes, or lay a clean towel dipped in water over the burn instead. If the skin is unbroken, gently apply aloe gel to the burn to help soothe your pain and inflammation. Do not pop any blisters, as this will increase your risk of infection, and treat the area with an antibiotic cream and a bandage if you have a blister that pops on its own. Call your doctor right away if you see any signs of infection, like fluid seeping from the wound or red streaks spreading from the burn site. Read on for tips from our medical reviewer on how to tell the difference between first, second, and third-degree burns.

"My son is 2 years old. As I was cooking and cleaning the kitchen, he grabbed his chair and placed his hand on top of the burner I turned and tried to catch him before he did it, but I was too late. It was very quickly when he felt the heat, but it still burned his skin; not bad at all, thank God, but I ran it under water, put antibiotic ointment on it and wrapped it up. I gave him Motrin for the pain, and I just searched to make sure I did everything correctly. I'm glad to see that I did."..." more
