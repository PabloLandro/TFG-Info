Product Description
Get rid of scars from acne and enjoy flawless healthy skin!. The Acne Scars Correcting Serum with Vitamin B3, NAG, Vitamin C and Retinol reduces hyper-pigmentation and fades acne scars while improving skin texture by enhancing collagen production. Containing the two super stars of skin care, Vitamin B3 and Vitamin C, this product is great for acne scar home treatments.
Vitamin C increases collagen production, reduces skin discoloration, and enhances skin’s repair process. Vitamin B3 increases ceramide and free fatty acid levels in skin, prevents skin from losing water content, and stimulate microcirculation in the dermis.
