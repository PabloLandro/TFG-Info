The outcome measure represents the average of the mean number of the headaches, migraine headaches, and treated migraines per month of the study participants in the 6 Month, 12 Month, and ITT Populations. A treated attack is defined as a migraine treated with the Combination Tablet.
Number of Total Migraines Headaches and Migraines Treated With the Combination Tablet [ Time Frame: Baseline through End of Study (up to Month 12) ]
The total number of migraine headaches and the number of migraine headaches treated with the Combination Tablet during the study were summarized.
Number of Migraine Attacks Rated With the Indicated Pain Severity [ Time Frame: Baseline through End of Study (up to Month 12) ]
The number of migraine attacks treated at the mild, moderate, or severe intensity were counted. Pain severity was assessed by participants based on a scale of 0-3: 0=no pain, 1=mild, 2= moderate, 3=severe.

Mean Change From Baseline in the Migraine Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire for Adolescents (MSQ-A) Score at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 [ Time Frame: Baseline and Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 ]
The MSQ-A consists of 14 items measuring how migraines affect QOL: Role Function (RF)-Restrictive (items 1-7) and RF-Preventative (items 8-11), examining the degree to which performance of daily activities is limited or interrupted, respectively, by migraine; RF-Emotional (items 12-14, examining frustration/helplessness due to migraine). Dimensions (dim.) are scored independently. The 14 items are reverse coded onto a 1-6 scale; dim. are then created by summing specific item scores and transforming raw total score onto a 0-100 scale. For each dim., higher scores indicate better health status.
Number of Participants Categorized by Response to Each of the 3 Global Satisfaction Questions From the Patient Perception Migraine Questionnaire-Revised (PPMQ-R) at the Screening Visit [ Time Frame: Screening ]
The PPMQ-R is a fully validated 32-item questionnaire assessing participant satisfaction with acute migraine medication and includes 3 questions that assess satisfaction with respect to efficacy, side effects, and overall satisfaction (i.e., How effective the medication is overall, side effects of the medication, overall satisfaction with the medication). Each item is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from "very satisfied" (1) to "very dissatisfied" (7).
Number of Participants Categorized by Response to Each of the 3 Global Satisfaction Questions From the Patient Perception Migraine Questionaire-Revised (PPMQ-R) at Month 12 [ Time Frame: End of Study/Month 12 ]
The PPMQ-R is a fully validated 32-item questionnaire assessing participant satisfaction with acute migraine medication and includes 3 questions that assess satisfaction with respect to efficacy, side effects, and overall satisfaction (i.e., How effective the medication is overall, side effects of the medication, overall satisfaction with the medication). Each item is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from "very satisfied" (1) to "very dissatisfied" (7).
