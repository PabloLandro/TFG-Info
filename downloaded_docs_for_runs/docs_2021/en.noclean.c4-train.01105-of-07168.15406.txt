About
What is covered
This interactive flowchart covers the care and management of osteoarthritis in adults.
Osteoarthritis refers to a clinical syndrome of joint pain accompanied by varying degrees of functional limitation and reduced quality of life. It is the most common form of arthritis, and one of the leading causes of pain and disability worldwide. The most commonly affected peripheral joints are the knees, hips and small hand joints. Pain, reduced function and effects on a person's ability to carry out their day-to-day activities can be important consequences of osteoarthritis. Pain in itself is also a complex biopsychosocial issue, related in part to a person's expectations and self-efficacy (that is, their belief in their ability to complete tasks and reach goals), and is associated with changes in mood, sleep and coping abilities. There is often a poor link between changes visible on an X-ray and symptoms of osteoarthritis: minimal changes can be associated with a lot of pain, or modest structural changes to joints can occur with minimal accompanying symptoms. Contrary to popular belief, osteoarthritis is not caused by ageing and does not necessarily deteriorate. There are a number of management and treatment options (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological), which are covered in this interactive flowchart and which represent effective interventions for controlling symptoms and improving function.
Pharmacological management of osteoarthritis
NICE intends to undertake a full review of evidence on the pharmacological management of osteoarthritis. This will start after a review by the MHRA of the safety of over-the-counter analgesics is completed. For more information, see the NICE guideline on osteoarthritis.
In the meantime, the recommendations in this interactive flowchart on the pharmacological management of osteoarthritis remain current advice. However, the GDG would like to draw attention to the findings of the evidence review on the effectiveness of paracetamol that was presented in the consultation version of the osteoarthritis guideline. That review identified reduced effectiveness of paracetamol in the management of osteoarthritis compared with what was previously thought. The GDG believes that this information should be taken into account in routine prescribing practice until the planned full review of evidence on the pharmacological management of osteoarthritis is published (see the NICE website for further details).

Guidelines
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Diagnosis
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults aged 45 or over are diagnosed with osteoarthritis clinically without investigations if they have activity-related joint pain and any morning joint stiffness lasts no longer than 30 minutes.
Rationale
There is often a poor link between changes visible on an X-ray, MRI or ultrasound scan and the symptoms of osteoarthritis: minimal changes can be associated with substantial pain, or modest structural changes to joints can occur with minimal accompanying symptoms. It is recommended that a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis is made for adults aged 45 years or over with typical symptoms without the need for further investigations. This will reduce both potential harm from exposure to radiation from X-rays and costs of unnecessary imaging procedures. However, if an alternative diagnosis is possible it may be necessary to carry out further investigations, including imaging, to aid diagnosis.

What the quality statement means for service providers, healthcare professionals and commissioners
Service providers (such as GPs and community healthcare providers) ensure that they have clear policies and processes for diagnosing osteoarthritis clinically. Service providers should also monitor the use of imaging for diagnosing osteoarthritis in adults to ensure that it is not being used inappropriately.
Healthcare professionals diagnose osteoarthritis in adults aged 45 years or over clinically without investigations if the person has typical symptoms.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) ensure that they commission services with clear policies and processes for diagnosing osteoarthritis clinically. Commissioners should also require providers to show that imaging is not being used inappropriately for diagnosing osteoarthritis in adults.
What the quality statement means for patients, service users and carers
Adults aged 45 years or over who go to their GP with joint pain that is typical of osteoarthritis are usually diagnosed with osteoarthritis without the need for an X-ray or a scan. This is because the results of X-rays and scans do not explain symptoms or help when deciding about treatment, and will mean that people do not have unnecessary X-rays or scans.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Alternative diagnosis
If an alternative diagnosis is possible, it may be necessary to carry out imaging or other investigations to confirm the diagnosis. Alternative diagnoses include gout, other inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis and malignancy. A history of trauma, prolonged morning joint-related stiffness, rapid worsening of symptoms or the presence of a hot swollen joint may indicate the need for further investigations to identify possible additional or alternative diagnoses.

Assessment at diagnosis
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis have an assessment that includes pain, impact on daily activities and quality of life.
Rationale
Adults with osteoarthritis may experience a number of challenges because of their symptoms, which may affect their ability to carry out their daily activities, work and enjoy a reasonable quality of life. It is important that an assessment is carried out at diagnosis that goes beyond the clinical presentation of osteoarthritis, to include pain, impact on daily activities and quality of life, while taking comorbidities into account. This will support self-management that empowers the person by focusing on their individual goals and preferences and allows healthcare professionals to give patient-centred advice and support that is positive and constructive. This has been shown to increase patient satisfaction and the effectiveness of the treatment plan, thereby reducing demand on the health service.

What the quality statement means for service providers, healthcare professionals and commissioners
Service providers (such as GPs, community healthcare providers and hospitals) ensure that systems and resources are in place for adults newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis to have an assessment that includes pain, impact on daily activities and quality of life.
Healthcare professionals carry out an assessment that includes pain, impact on daily activities and quality of life for people newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) ensure that they commission services in which adults newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis have an assessment that includes pain, impact on daily activities and quality of life.
What the quality statement means for patients, service users and carers
Adults who have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis have an assessment in which they are asked about their pain, how they are managing on a day-to-day basis and how the condition is affecting their life overall, including their mood. This will help when deciding the best way to try to improve their symptoms and quality of life.
Source guidance
Osteoarthritis (2014) NICE guideline CG177, recommendation 1.2.1
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Assessment
An assessment for people newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis includes:
a pain assessment
the impact on the person’s day-to-day activities, including activities of daily living, employment and leisure activities
the person’s overall quality of life, including their mood.
The assessment should be adapted to meet the person’s individual needs and take comorbidities into account.
[Adapted from Osteoarthritis (NICE guideline CG177) recommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.3]
Equality and diversity considerations
Healthcare professionals should take into account cultural and communication needs (including any learning disabilities) when assessing an adult newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis.
Self-management
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults with osteoarthritis participate in developing a self-management plan that directs them to any support they may need.
Rationale
Providing a framework that encourages and supports self-management is an important tool to support shared decision making and ensure that people are at the centre of their care. Self-management principles empower the person by enhancing their understanding and knowledge of osteoarthritis and its management, and by enabling them to identify their own priorities and goals for their treatment. This may include developing skills such as problem solving, goal setting, coping strategies and managing relationships. They can then use this knowledge and their skills to access resources and build on their own experiences of managing their osteoarthritis. Self-management can improve patient experience and health outcomes, as well as increasing adherence with the treatment plan and reducing reliance on healthcare interventions.

Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for service providers, healthcare professionals and commissioners
Service providers (GPs and community healthcare providers) ensure that processes are in place so that adults with osteoarthritis participate in developing a self-management plan that directs them to any support they may need. Service providers should also agree local referral pathways that may include support provided by voluntary sector organisations.
Healthcare professionals work with adults with osteoarthritis to develop an individual self-management plan that gives the person information and advice and directs them to any support they may need to help them manage their condition.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) ensure that they commission services in which adults with osteoarthritis participate in developing a self-management plan that directs them to any support they made need, and which have local arrangements in place to ensure that support is available, including services provided by the voluntary sector. Commissioners should request monitoring data and consider an audit of community healthcare providers to check that self-management plans are in place for all adults with osteoarthritis. Commissioners should also ensure that community care providers have sufficient capacity to offer specialised support if needed, including from physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dietitians and podiatrists.
What the quality statement means for patients, service users and carers
Adults with osteoarthritis agree a self-management plan with their GP or nurse that covers what they can do to help manage their condition, including improving their symptoms and quality of life. The plan should identify where they can get the support they may need to help them do this.

Healthcare professionals should take into account cultural and communication needs (including any learning disabilities) when providing information and support for adults with osteoarthritis. This should include providing printed information for people who cannot access information online and providing information in accessible large print and easy read formats where required.
Not all people will want to self-manage osteoarthritis or be able to do so, and healthcare professionals should identify any vulnerable people who may need additional support.
Exercise
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults with osteoarthritis are advised to participate in muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise.
Rationale
Exercise is a core treatment for osteoarthritis that will improve joint pain and function. It is important that people are advised to undertake specific exercise that is relevant for their condition, including muscle strengthening that targets affected joints and general aerobic exercise. Healthcare professionals will need to make a judgement about the best way to encourage participation in exercise, because this will vary for each person depending on their needs, circumstances and self-motivation, and may change over time. It is important that support and encouragement to exercise is ongoing and reinforced at every opportunity.

What the quality statement means for service providers, healthcare professionals and commissioners
Service providers (GPs and community healthcare providers) ensure that processes and referral pathways are in place so that adults with osteoarthritis are advised and encouraged at both diagnosis and review to participate in muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise. It may be useful to compile information about local exercise classes, groups and facilities, so that people can be given information about any that are suitable.
Healthcare professionals ensure that they advise and encourage adults with osteoarthritis at both diagnosis and review to participate in muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise, and provide information about suitable local exercise classes, groups and facilities.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) ensure that they commission services in which adults with osteoarthritis are advised and encouraged at both diagnosis and review to participate in muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise. Commissioners also ensure that there is sufficient capacity in physiotherapy and exercise support resources to meet demand for adults with osteoarthritis.
What the quality statement means for patients, service users and carers
Adults with osteoarthritis are advised and encouraged by healthcare professionals to exercise, both for general fitness and to strengthen the muscles that support their affected joints, because this may help to improve their symptoms.

Weight loss
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults with osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese are offered support to lose weight.
Rationale
Weight loss is a core treatment for osteoarthritis that will improve joint pain and function. Adults with osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese should be offered support to help them to lose weight, which may include weight-loss programmes tailored to their individual needs. It is important that support and encouragement to lose weight are ongoing and reinforced at every opportunity. Ongoing weight management support may be needed to ensure that a lower weight is maintained.

Overweight or obese
An adult with a BMI of 25–29.9 kg/m2 is classified as overweight and an adult with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more is classified as obese. Waist circumference may be used in addition to BMI to identify health risk in people with a BMI below 35 kg/m2. BMI may be a less accurate measure of body fat in adults who are very muscular, so BMI should be interpreted with caution in this group. Some other population groups, such as people of Asian family origin and older people, have comorbidity risk factors that are of concern at different BMIs (lower for adults of an Asian family origin and higher for older people.
[Adapted from Obesity: identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in children, young people and adults (NICE guideline CG189) recommendations 1.2.7 and 1.2.8]
Support to lose weight
Support to help someone with osteoarthritis to lose weight should focus on diet and physical activity, and may also include pharmacological and surgical interventions. The level of support should be determined by the person’s needs, and be responsive to changes over time. Weight management programmes should be delivered by a trained professional. They should include behaviour change strategies to increase physical activity and encourage healthy eating. Pharmacological and surgical treatment options should be considered only after dietary, exercise and behavioural approaches have been tried and evaluated.

Equality and diversity considerations
Healthcare professionals should take into account cultural and communication needs (including any learning disabilities) when providing information and support for adults with osteoarthritis. This should include providing printed information for people who cannot access information online and providing information in accessible large print and easy read formats where needed.
When referring adults with osteoarthritis to a weight loss service, any potential difficulties in accessing services, which may include distance, disability and financial obstacles, should be taken into account.
Timing of review
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults with osteoarthritis discuss and agree the timing of their next review with their primary healthcare team.
Rationale
Adults with osteoarthritis should be offered regular reviews to assess the progress of the condition and its impact on their quality of life, provide support for self-management and review treatments to reduce further deterioration and the need for additional medication and/or referral for surgery. It is important to address appropriate medication use, including prescribed and over-the-counter analgesics, monitor side effects and review polypharmacy. The timing of reviews will depend on individual needs, including severity of symptoms and response to treatment. It is important that adults with osteoarthritis are made aware of the need for reviews, and for the timing to be discussed and agreed with their primary healthcare team.

Core treatments before referral for consideration of joint surgery
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Adults with osteoarthritis are supported with non-surgical core treatments for at least 3 months before any referral for consideration of joint surgery.
Rationale
Core treatments for adults with osteoarthritis are: verbal and written information to support a better understanding of the condition, activity and exercise, and weight loss if the person is overweight or obese. Core treatments support the person to self-manage their condition and help to relieve symptoms. It is therefore important that these treatments are tried before a surgical solution is explored. Currently a relatively low proportion of people referred for possible joint surgery progress to hip or knee replacements, and ensuring that core treatments are tried first will help to reduce referrals that may not be needed. People who do go on to have surgery are likely to have improved outcomes if core treatments are undertaken pre-operatively.

What the quality statement means for service providers, healthcare professionals and commissioners
Service providers (GPs, community healthcare providers and hospitals) ensure that policies and processes are in place so that adults with osteoarthritis are not referred for consideration of joint surgery until they have been supported with non-surgical core treatments for at least 3 months. Hospitals should provide information to commissioners about inappropriate referrals and referrals for people who have not been offered 3 months of core treatments.
Healthcare professionals ensure that they do not refer adults with osteoarthritis for consideration of joint surgery until the person has been supported with non-surgical core treatments for at least 3 months.
Commissioners (clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) ensure that they commission services in which adults with osteoarthritis are not referred for consideration of joint surgery until they have been supported with non-surgical core treatments for at least 3 months. Commissioners should consider audits of people referred for consideration of joint surgery to ensure that the patient record shows that they were supported with core treatments for at least 3 months before referral.
What the quality statement means for patients, service users and carers
Adults with osteoarthritis are given information, and are advised and supported to exercise and (if appropriate) lose weight to help with joint pain and stiffness, for at least 3 months before any referral for possible joint surgery.

Referral for consideration of joint surgery
This quality statement is taken from the osteoarthritis quality standard. The quality standard defines clinical best practice in osteoarthritis care and should be read in full.
Quality statement
Healthcare professionals do not use scoring tools to identify which adults with osteoarthritis are eligible for referral for consideration of joint surgery.
Rationale
There is currently considerable variation in the criteria used to decide whether an adult with osteoarthritis is eligible for referral for consideration of joint surgery in England, with no evidence to support the range of scoring tools used and the decisions made. The person with osteoarthritis should be given support and advice by their healthcare professional to reach a shared decision on whether surgery is likely to be beneficial, based on the severity of their symptoms, their general health, their expectations of lifestyle and activity, and the effectiveness of any non-surgical treatments. Ensuring that inappropriate scoring tools are not used will improve equality of access to surgery.

Healthcare professionals ensure that they do not use scoring tools to identify which adults with osteoarthritis are eligible for referral for consideration of joint surgery.
Commissioners (clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) ensure that they commission services that do not use scoring tools to identify which adults with osteoarthritis are eligible for referral for consideration of joint surgery. Commissioners should not restrict referral pathways on the basis of arbitrary referral thresholds, but should ensure that thresholds are agreed with patient representatives, referring clinicians and surgeons.
What the quality statement means for patients, service users and carers
Adults with osteoarthritis who are considering joint surgery discuss this with their healthcare professional to decide if it is right for them, and are not denied a referral because they have not met particular requirements.

Scoring tools
The use of orthopaedic scores and questionnaire-based assessments to identify people who are eligible for referral for consideration of joint surgery has become widespread. These usually assess pain, functional impairment and sometimes radiographic damage. The commonest are the New Zealand score and the Oxford Hip or Knee score. Many (such as the Oxford tools) were designed to measure population-based changes after surgery, and none have been validated for assessing appropriateness of referral.
[Adapted from Osteoarthritis (2014) NICE guideline CG177, full guideline section 11.1.7]
Equality and diversity considerations
Age, sex, obesity, smoking, disability (including learning disabilities) and comorbidities should not be barriers to referral for consideration of joint surgery.
