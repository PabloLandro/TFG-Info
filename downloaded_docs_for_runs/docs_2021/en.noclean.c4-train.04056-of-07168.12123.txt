What are ovarian cysts?
The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They’re located in the lower abdomen on both sides of the uterus. Women have two ovaries that produce eggs as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone.
Sometimes, a fluid-filled sac called a cyst will develop on one of the ovaries. Many women will develop at least one cyst during their lifetime. In most cases, cysts are painless and cause no symptoms.
Types of Ovarian Cysts
Functional ovarian cysts – the most common type. These harmless cysts form part of the female’s normal menstrual cycle and are short-lived.
Pathological cysts – these are cysts that grow in the ovaries; they may be harmless or cancerous (malignant).
Symptoms of an ovarian cyst
Often times, ovarian cysts do not cause any symptoms. However, symptoms can appear as the cyst grows. Symptoms may include:
Abdominal bloating or swelling
Painful bowel movements
Pelvic pain before or during the menstrual cycle
Painful intercourse
Pain in the lower back or thighs
Breast tenderness
Nausea and vomiting
Complications
An ovarian cyst often causes no problems, but sometimes it can lead to complications.
Torsion: The stem of an ovary can become twisted if the cyst is growing on it. It can block the blood supply to the cyst and cause severe pain in the lower abdomen.
Burst cyst: If a cyst bursts, the patient will experience severe pain in the lower abdomen. If the cyst is infected, pain will be worse. There may also be bleeding. Symptoms may resemble those of appendicitis or diverticulitis.
Cancer: In rare cases, a cyst may be an early form of ovarian cancer.
Treatment
Treatment will depend on:
the person’s age
whether they have undergone menopause or not
the size and appearance of the cyst
whether there are any symptoms
Watchful waiting (observation)
Sometimes watchful waiting is recommended, especially if the cyst is a small, functional cyst (2 to 5 centimeters) and the woman has not yet undergone menopause
An ultrasound scan will check the cyst a month or so later, to see whether it has gone
Birth control pills
To reduce the risk of new cysts developing in future menstrual cycles, the doctor may recommend birth control pills. Oral contraceptives may also reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer.
