Sabona Tudor Copper Magnetic Wristband
Copper wristbands and magnetic products are considered to be unproven remedies. However, magnets have been used in different cultures over the years by those who believe magnets worn on the body promote good health. The theory is that magnet therapy may be beneficial by affecting the circulatory system, the blood flow in the body. Increased circulation is beneficial because the body gets more of the nutrients it needs from the blood.
