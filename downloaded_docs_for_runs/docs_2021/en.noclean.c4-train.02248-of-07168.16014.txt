I truly cannot believe how I feel this year! I use the Northern Light desk lamp every morning for twenty minutes. This is the first time in decades I feel energetic, awake and full of life. I normally suffer from the winter “blahs”…ok lets just call it depression, but not this year. Thank you so much for a life altering product!

Hi, thank you for the kind review and all the questions! Here are some answers for you and others who may be wondering the same thing.
1) Does this lamp help improving vitamin D levels in the body ?
No. This lamp filters out UV. UV on the skin can help the body absorb more vitamin D. If you lack vitamin D you can take supplements. UV from tanning lamps can cause cancer and are not recommended. Vitamin D is not proven to help with winter blues or depression.
2) Is there a user manual I can have please ?
There are instructions available for all of our units on our website here :
https://northernlighttechnologies.com/resources/light-therapy-product-instructions
3) Is there a maximum number of hours we could be exposed directly to this lamp ? I use it on my desk.
There is no maximum. I generally say if you use it to replace summer daylight hours is fine. Using bright light at night will keep you awake.

I have used my Northern Light Boxelite for years now. The only thing that I can say is that if you have the blues, depression, SAD get this product and use it diligently. It can make all the difference in how you feel. I started using it and within a few days use, I felt so much better. Whenever it is gray outside, I turn it on and within minutes my mood changes. I have bought one for my children and as presents for friends. Thank you Northern Lights for this wonderful technology.

I was suffering from SAD for the past 3 winters (NYC). I researched light therapy and realized that I wanted to keep my morning routine – a cup of coffee in bed while I peruse my emails for a good 1/2 hour. Then up and out. I read so much info on the web but took the time to call Northern Lights customer service and was delighted to have a specific and helpful conversation so I could understand how to use the lamp and for how long. I chose this lamp and every morning I pull it to the side of my bed (I marked the floor) so it is always the right distance in front of my face. I sit for 35-45 minutes and it has been, to say the least, life-changing. I knew it in 2 weeks (started the week before daylight savings). For the first time in 3 years in the winter, I’m ‘myself’ …I go out and talk to people and feel normal again. AND…it seems to have reset my horrible (non) sleep cycles. I used to sleep 2-3 hours at a go and wake then sort of back again. Now I’m sleeping 7-9 hours straight through. Clearly, I’m a poster child for light therapy. I know there are a lot of products out there but I’m happy to say that this is a reputable company making a solid product. Thanks.

Between this Luxor lamp, and my discovery of Premier League Football on TV (soccer), my Fall and Winter months are considerably better than the years prior; the effect on mind, body and spirit just short of “eureka!” I turn on the Luxor on my standing desk first thing in the morning, and get a sense of well-being not unlike sitting on my sailboat in August. For me, this is the answer.

This desk lamp provides instant relief from severe seasonal affective disorder. I feel the effects from the first treatment and they last the whole day. I’ve tried many other products and technologies. This is the only lamp that works for me.

After moving from sunny Southern California to New England several years ago, I developed Seasonal Affective Disorder. My doctor recommended daily light therapy. I now use the desk lamp every morning from October through March and I truly feel an improvement in my mood and energy level during these dark months.
Debra Droniak
Wow, thank you so much for the remarkable review. It is so great to hear feedback from people still getting great use out of one of our products after so many years! I am amazed at your attention to detail in our manufacturing and design. You are quite correct that every part was made to put as much light forward while keeping it easy on the eyes.
The only thing I would mention after having a light for over 10 years is that the bulbs may dim a bit. If you feel like you’re not getting enough light you can always replace the bulbs. Many hardware stores will carry them (bring them with you so you ensure you get the right ones) or you can purchase some from us online.
Hope it keeps the coming winter bright and all your plants happy too!
All the best,

I have had this for the past 3 years and absolutely love it! I love the features for sunrise and sunset. It even wakes up my dog! Would highly recommend it!

I was diagnosed with SAD officially in 2006 but suspected it long before then – during the 1990s, the office I worked in had no natural light – only ceiling-based fluorescent – and I found myself falling into moderate depression each year between the time when daylight saving time ended and the time when it began again the following year. Once I had been switched to an office with floor-to-ceiling windows with abundant natural sunlight, the problem disappeared so I recognized that I likely suffered from the disorder.
My sister, who also worked in government, had a fellow worker with the condition and when the person retired and left this lamp behind, she obtained the lamp for me and I used it to “self-medicate” for my (at the time) undiagnosed SAD.
This lamp is one of the best I have come across and still provides relief for my symptoms more than a decade after I first acquired it. It is of top quality and, unlike others that I have tried, doesn’t “blind” me by having to look directly at the bulb(s) – the combination of the U-shaped full-spectrum fluorescent tube and the parabolic reflector behind it spreads the light out and diffuses it into a beam that isn’t difficult to look directly at – plus it also ensures that the half of the light generated by the back of the fluorescent tube is redirected to the front of the lamp instead of being lost/absorbed where it cannot be seen, making it a very effective treatment device that directs virtually all the light generated by the source forward to where it is most needed.
Living along the 45th parallel, it has proved to be an excellent item for treating my disorder efficiently and effectively with great efficacy during the dark times of the year when most needed. I highly recommend this lamp to anyone suffering from the “winter blues” or with an suspected or official diagnosis of Seasonal Affective Disorder.
Additionally, it makes a great desk lamp for reading or for doing any form of fine work that requires a bright and diffuse full-spectrum light source – there are no bright and dim areas in the light field unlike some others I’ve tried – just a wide and universally consistent light field is created anywhere the reflector unit is directed towards. I’ve even used it successfully as a grow light for my houseplants to provide supplemental light to keep them healthy and vibrant over the winter months.
This item has so many varied uses to which it can be put and it performs them all admirably and reliably – and is solidly built, well-balanced, and easy to adjust. I can’t recommend this lamp more highly – it is a superior piece of kit and provides me relief from my condition along with a myriad of other uses. If it were possible, I’d have rated it 7 stars out of 5 for all the extra uses for this light provides beyond its awesome treatment of providing complete relief of my SAD.

I have two of these and I really notice the effect of using them! I had a ballast go bad in one and sent it to Northern Light for warranty work. The package was lost and misidentified. After some work on their part they verified that the package had reached their facility and then they sent me a new lamp.
The lamp looks slightly industrial and that just means it is well built to me.
A great product.

This is the best alarm clock I have ever bought. It is well worth the money.
I am thinking about buying one for my eldest son soon, so that he can also wake up to a gentle sunrise, even in the darkest depths of winter!

A family member (Who is a doctor) was so impressed by your Flamingo lamp that she sent one to my wife & I for Xmas. I was very skeptical. “Persevere” she said and I am glad I did. You see I don’t suffer with SAD and I don’t get depressed; however, I was suffering with severe pain in the groin and upper thigh of my left leg and for the last year I could only walk using a cane. After 9 days of using the Flamingo first thing in the morning for 25 minutes I am completely pain free and no longer need the cane; I certainly didn’t expect that to happen and I am very happy that I “persevered” And, by the way, I also feel much calmer and more relaxed than I did before. I recommend your product to all who will listen and believe me everyone is really surprised at the difference in me; I no longer feel that I am crippled. Thank You very much for creating this lamp it truly is amazing.

I am very pleased with the value and quality of this product. My MD recommended light therapy and specifically Northern Light. My light arrived quickly, well packaged and was easy to set up. I like this model as I can set it higher than my head, one book I read on light therapy for depression suggests this is at the angle sunlight would be to the eye, so most effective. I worked up to 30 min. Per day over about a week and have followed the guidance in the literature of starting the therapy within the first hour of awakening and trying to keep my wake up time within an hour of the same time day-to-day. From the very first week, I could tell a difference, it was like moving from a black and white movie to seeing things in color again. I felt like I was thawing out and enjoying my life more, wanting to do things that are fun again and feeling more energetic in the evenings instead of struggling to do anything. Depression for me is insidious- I don’t realize the effect on my quality of life until I start to come out of of it. I am so grateful for this light. I have been using this since the early fall and now at mid winter, I am able to tell a huge difference in how the winter is going. Thank you Northern Light!

I’ve had this for quite awhile. It’s great. I’m a morning person until January. It seems my SAD kicks in and this is my solution to morning trouble. In addition to the gentle wake up, it’s great if because I have pets. We have a cat and dog. They don’t accept daylight savings time and spend the winter waking me at 4 instead of waiting until 5. I have now trained them to leave me alone, and know I’ll get up when the light is brightest. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I bought this model 3-4 years ago after considerable research, using my MD’s recommendations. The quality and reliability are stellar. I also find the unit more attractive than most. I am now looking at getting a light-box for my office, as I sit in an alcove with no natural light. Once again, I am compelled to buy this model. There are cheaper models and way more expensive models – I recommend this one without reservation.

Quite happy with this lamp. Sturdy construction, ready to use right out of the box, lights up the room and has helped keep the December blahs at bay. So far I’m happy and would recommend this as a quality product that lives up to the manufacturer’s description.

I really love this product. It has been a notable amazing help in my mood in the fall and winter. When I forget to use it for a few days my energy and emotional levels start to go down again, but after about a week of regular use things get better!! Expensive but one of the best purchases I’ve made in my life.
Only downside or suggestion for perfection would be for it to have a wall mount that allowed it to be pointing downwards towards my face, as this would be maximum exposure to this happiness sunshine light.
Thanks for the great product!

I bought this light five years ago as directed by my doctor. I cannot tell you what a difference it has made in my mood. Since it is surrounded by tall trees, my house is dark, so I use my lamp all year long. If I miss a morning I am sluggish all day. I would recommend this light because it is well designed, sturdy, and attractive. In fact, I am going to buy the floor lamp model for the den and keep this one in my home office.

Glad to hear you’re still loving your Lumie Bodyclock! If you do need to replace the bulb it’s just a 60W incandescent – E12 (CES). For any other questions don’t hesitate to contact us here or call us at 1-800-263-0066.

I’m back again – now I’ve had the Bodyclock for almost three years and I still love it! I have never had to replace the bulb yet and I was checking to see if I could use any bulb when it eventually stops lighting; I don’t think so, but I don’t see the right light bulb here.
I checked the manual about the security light tonight and indeed my clock does have the ability to turn itself on and off randomly between 4 and 11 pm to make it look like someone is home. Sure wish I had noticed that before

This lamp saves me from depression, poor quality of sleep and anxiety during the long dark days of winter and spring in Wisconsin. I placed it right beside my bed and sit under it as soon as I wake in the morning, and find it a very relaxing and calming start to my day. Without a SAD/Happy lamp I’d be in real trouble healthwise!! Thanks for this great design!

Hi, our BOXelite unit is equipped with a ballast that will work on 220V 50Hz. You just need an adaptor that will fit to your outlet.
Thank you for contacting us, please feel free to ask any other questions.

I have had two lights over the years but this one has lasted me 15 years or more of lighting. Currently it is not working and I certainly can feel the difference. I am not as happy and energetic as I was. I see my psych doc in March and hope to get a replacement. Great lamp, a definite must buy.

I absolutely love my floor lamp! I have suffered from SAD for many years and this lamp really does help! My wife and I jokingly call it my happy lamp. It’s great; I like to turn on beach noises, lay under it on my couch, and close my eyes. It really feels like a warm sunny day on the beach. I would HIGHLY recommend this lamp to anyone who suffers from SAD.

13 years ago, I was hospitalized for depression in the Pacific Northwest. Luckily, a psychiatrist was well educated regarding SAD and prescribed this lamp. It helped me to climb out of depression and live a vibrant life again. I am deeply grateful.

This is an exceptional product; it was recommended to me by my MD. It’s helped me through two winters now — significantly. I live in SoCal and the fact that we may have warmth and sunlight during the day doesn’t matter, it’s the lessening, and then lack of sunlight the same as elsewhere. I have tried all of the other vendor’s products, and although the diffusiveness of the light is nice, I felt none of the uplifting affects or reduction in SADD symptoms as I have with the Northern Light desk unit. Thanks!
Cyd
Very glad to hear this product is still working for you and your husband after so many years! Our new products have a clip with a locking mechanism so the tubes shouldn’t come loose ever. And if you ever feel the light isn’t as bright as it used to be, you can get new tubes from us and your unit will be good as new!
Thank you for the feedback and kind words,

I have had the light for over seven years. I forget to use it some years and get gloomy, then recall I store it in summer and pull it back out on a dark winter morning. It feels like a miracle drug. My husband and I sit in front of it drinking our morning coffee and reading stuff in the morning at 6 am. After about 30 minutes we go about our day and at 8pm we realize the amount of energy we had all day was due to the light. One bulb easily comes loose and falls out of the socket but we love the box so much it is worth the time to unscrew the cover and wiggle the bulb until it lights again. People need to learn about this brand. The quality of the light is awesome – it really works!

So far this light box has done a good job at keeping the SAD away. I just got it back out, I used it last winter and it kept my mood pretty stable. Since I don’t want to take a chance on the depression coming back, I’ve started using it earlier this year. I know it is pricey, however my insurance reimbursed me for the cost of mine.

Have been using this lamp seasonally and am very satisfied with the quality, the construction, reliability and results. I researched many products and this was not the cheapest available. I recommend it without reservation.

These are extremely useful.
I own two, which I use for my oil painting (and I may be purchasing a third). The spectrum emitted from the light are similar to sunlight at the perfect time of day for a full spectrum of color. Also, this light is great for my SAD. When I use it, I feel better very quickly.
I would suggest getting one of these even if you do not have SAD.
If you are an artist, it will also allow you to paint inside, and get a similar spectrum as if you were working in the sunlight.
The light, since it is florescent, also diffuses, which is great for artists because you don’t get much shadowing.

This unit is great. We use it at the army reserve center. I used it for 2 years at work and eventually bought one for myself to use. I recommend this unit if you are sitting all day with no window access.

My life has improved immensely since I purchased my Flamingo floor lamp. I read under it for about 1 hour a day & I noticed an improvement in my mood within one week of using it. I’ve had mine for about 2 years. I would recommend your product to anyone who has seasonal depression. This product took it away! It has made my life much happier.

Unit is very portable and lite. Breaks down and stores in case very well. Only have had it a few weeks, but it is a quality product. I would buy it again. It is a little on the expensive side.

I am delighted to contribute a review. By chance, I found my description of the Chromolux 150 W bulbs. ($6.99 each)! I am an academic physician. Wonderful, sturdy lamp that was very helpful to my wife for many years. I purchased 3 extra bulbs initially to keep the intensity and spectrum as full and balanced as I could, as noted above, by one of my family physician colleagues. It has been in use for many, many years. Never a problem. Now it is used primarily as a desk lamp rather than for SAD relief. I’m back using the old bulbs. They clearly last longer than 3,500 hours. The effect is subtle but for the correct individual it adds another component contributing to improvement in mood.

I love this clock! It has completely changed how I feel when I wake up and have to get out of bed. I use the waves to wake up because I’m really, really not a morning person and the idea of a rooster or birds is just overwhelming 😉 When I’m feeling too wound up to just jump into bed and sleep, but have to get to sleep I like the setting when the light dims and turns off, it helps me relax.
I bought mine a year ago, this one may be a bit updated already (I don’t remember mine having the setting for when you are not there or the night light, but who knows, I use what I liked right off). If I were asked to recommend improvements, I would ask that the birds chirping would not loop so quickly. My brain follows the pattern and because it’s not long before it repeats I can’t use it for as long as I would like because I anticipate the loop (I like to use it when I’m getting ready for bed). If a couple more sound tracks were added it would make this clock even better… you know, something like forest sounds, soft raindrops, etc.
If you need someone to test a new prototype, I’ll be happy to be your tester 🙂

I bought a used one earlier this year and have started using it for about an hour in the evenings while watching TV and on the laptop. Haven’t used it long enough to know of it’s effects but I’ll five-star it anyway. It’s a sturdy unit that will last an eternity!

This lamp has made such a difference! As the winter approaches I turn on the lamp and my life continues to be productive and joyful. I have had mine for a year with no problems. It is well made and it looks great in my bedroom near my chaise lounge. Thank you Northern Lights for making my life easier!

I’m a Family Doctor, and have used this same lamp for 20 years for SAD. My kids also use it now on winter mornings–we call it the “wake up lamp” at our house. Don’t forget to replace the bulbs every two years!

I bought this light the second Northern Light Technologies stocked it (maybe 3 years ago?) and I LOVE it. My last apartment had black out curtains so it was really helpful to have Lumie to wake me up. I also really like the sunset feature. There are a few annoying aspects (such as the method for updating the alarm setting) but they are vastly overshadowed by how wonderful the light is. I recommend Lumie to all of my friends. One of my favorite purchases of the last 5 years. It’s that good.

Bought my light in 2003 and ordered extra bulbs. My light experienced heavy use, in addition to using it up close for SAD, I also used it as a light in my dimly lit office at work. It has run an average of 8 hours a day for 5 days a week for the last 9 years. It finally gave out in the last week. I never used the extra bulbs I ordered. I have ordered a replacement and of course it is from Northern Light Technologies.

I purchased this light a few years ago, and it has been great to treat my SAD. About 20 minutes in the morning and I can feel the difference for the rest of the day. A quality product and it works fantastic for SAD. It is a bit bulky for travel purposes though, pretty much a stationary light.

I have had my Flamingo Floor Lamp for over 5 years! It has made my life so much more productive during the winter. I finally need a replacement bulb. Especially, since moving to a dark North facing apartment this year! Thank You for such a great product. I can use it in the kitchen, bedroom or desk. I only wish I had one for every room as I go about my morning!
