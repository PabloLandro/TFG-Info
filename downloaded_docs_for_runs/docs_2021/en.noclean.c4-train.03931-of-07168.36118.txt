Ultimate Weight Management & Stress Relief Program
Posted on October 18, 2017 by ihbPT
We live in an age of where chronic stress is fast becoming the major contributor to weight gain (and weight loss), and chronic illness in our bodies. Stress about our relationships… our family… our children… and our health, and throw in workplace and environmental stress and you have a toxic minefield. And with our modern busy lives, it often feels like its never-ending battle, trying to eat well and live a balanced lifestyle.
And unfortunately, by only focusing on diet and/or exercise when trying to release weight, can lead to stagnant results and a lack of motivation that keep you stuck… preventing you from releasing weight… especially those stubborn bits in all the wrong places.
While diet and exercise are an important part of a weight release program, there are two other crucial important areas that you will need to look at if you are ever to succeed in your weight release or weight gain program. You will need to look at adequate nutrition, and the part that your emotional mind plays in the equation.
Firstly, due to over production and growth of food on the planet’s available soils, the soils of the world are fast becoming deficient in essential minerals and nutrients, and as a result, we are not getting the nutrition from the food we eat like our forefathers and mothers did. So unless you are sourcing or growing your own certified organic wholefoods you are probably not getting all the nutrition your body needs.
Therefore, it’s vitally important in this modern age to supplement with high quality and preferably pharmaceutical-grade vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, probiotics and antioxidants to ensure our bodies are getting the nutrition it craves. If you are feeding your body with the correct balance of quality nutrients then the hunger cravings, and the cravings for nutrition-less junk food, processed refined packaged foods and sugary foods will subside.
Secondly, if you’ve struggled and gone from one diet and/or exercise program to another, from low-carb to Paleo, from aerobics to boot camp… you’re likely to continue the trend UNLESS you get to the root of your weight issues… both excess weight and under-weight issues… and many times those issues lie in your unconscious emotional mind. Unless addressed, stress in our daily lives can accumulate and create emotional blockages (source) in the body that show up (symptoms) as skin conditions, sickness, illness, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, chronic pain… and weight gain or weight loss.
The challenge is that the ability to eat well, exercise, and feel safe releasing weight are all run unconsciously in your emotional mind, and if your emotional mind’s belief is that it is not safe to release weight, and you do not address why, then you are setting yourself up for failure. And these negative emotional beliefs create what we call emotional blockages in the body.
Fortunately, hypnotherapy is a fast and powerful way to access your unconscious emotional mind and remove these stress-related emotional blockages, and adjust or eliminate any habits, patterns or beliefs that are no longer serving you. In our program we also use powerful specific therapeutic massage, designed to remove the emotional blockages (think stubborn fat) from your body.
Paul Holcroft and Khloe Syllebranque working together have created the Ultimate Weight Management & Stress Relief Program. A program designed for under-weight and excess-weight management success. This newly designed holistic program features specialized hypnotherapy, remedial massage and lifestyle changes for everyone wanting to bring their body back into balance.
Not only is this program a new approach to weight management issues, it also addresses other stress related issues including skin conditions, self-confidence and self-esteem issues, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, chronic fatigue, nagging pain and chronic pain in the body. Each person is consulted and assessed on an individual basis so as to ascertain the best possible approach to each individuals needs.
Your first consultation is free and is an informal meeting over coffee to discuss your individual needs from the program, and to ascertain whether the program is the best step forward for you at this time.
If you have tried everything else and are serious about getting to the source of your issues and bringing your body back into balance then the Ultimate Weight Management & Stress Relief Program is for you. Call or message us now for a free initial informal consultation on 0424 671 411 or PM us through Facebook and begin the journey back to ultimate health.

Nutritional Supplements for Stress & Anxiety
Nutritional Supplements for Stress & Anxiety Related Issues
Can nutritional supplements help ease stress and anxiety levels? Latest research is suggesting that balanced quality nutritional intake can bring your body and mind back into balance and, if you take steps to resolve the source of your stress and anxiety through therapy, then the results can be impressive.
Alleviate stress with the powerful nutrition
Best stress treatment
The best way to treat stress over the long term is to identify the root causes of it, and see if your lifestyle can be changed to reduce it. Much of the stress you feel will be emotional stress, which can create emotional blockages within the body and often show up as excess weight or pain in the body, and sometimes both. Hypnotherapy is a quick and powerful way to eliminate emotional stress but you can also try meditation, yoga, controlled breathing, tai chi or exercise, like relaxing walks in nature, to help cope with stress.
The following are some nutritional supplements you can try for yourself but if you are taking any medications you should always check with your physician before taking nutritional supplements as they could conflict with your medication.
Co-Q10, 5-HTP, Quercetin, L-Tryptophan, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid), Skullcap Extract, Ashwagandha Extract, Bacopa Monnieri Extract, Valerian Root Extract, Passion Flower Extract, Hops Extract, Chamomile Extract, Melatonin, L-Theanine, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin D3, Vitamin E, Vitamin B-Complex: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin, folic acid, and the cobalamins (B12),
Probiotic: L. Helveticus (Lactobacillus helveticus), Glutamine, Chromium as Chromium AAC (Amino Acid Chelate), Phenylethylamine or PEA, Amylase, Wheat grass powder, Magnesium, Ginger Root Extract, Licorice Root, Eleuthero root extract, Citrus Aurantium Extract (Bitter Orange), Aspartic Acid, L-Serine, White Tea Extract, Satiereal™ Saffron Extract (crocus), Ginkgo leaf extract, St. John’s Wort, Phosphatidylserine, Lemon Balm, Kava, Guarana, Garcinia Cambogia, Fish Oil.
Please Note: The following ingredients research is not company supplied but based upon my own independent Google research, you are welcome to do your own research…
Co-Q10
A recent study in Cairo, Egypt has uncovered an unusual property of Co-Q10 that is rather surprising: It eliminates depression and anxiety.
After stressing out the mice with forced swimming and chronic restraint stress (CRS), something cruel kids might do, anxiety and depression were artificially induced in the mice, a standard lab gimmick. Then they were fed large amounts of Co-Q10 for three weeks.
It became apparent that most of the observed anxiety and depression abated during the Co-Q10 feeding. The biological markers also showed increased antioxidant activity in the hippocampus, reversing oxidative cellular and DNA damage.

A small study found that out of 31 patients who suffer from migraines, 19 of them reported the number of days they had migraines cut in half. Another small study of 42 migraine sufferers compared Coenzyme Q10 to an inactive placebo. In that study, of CoQ10 and migraine, the supplement was three times more likely than placebo to reduce the number of migraines.
A larger study of 1,550 patients ages 3 to 22 with migraine measured their Coenzyme Q10 levels. Of those migraine sufferers, 33 percent had low levels of CoQ10. Those with low levels received Coenzyme Q10 supplements and had fewer migraines.

5-HTP
“5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) is a naturally occurring substance derived from the seed pods of Griffonia simplicifolia, a West African medicinal plant. In humans, 5-HTP is the immediate nutrient precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). This means that 5-HTP converts directly into serotonin in the brain (see Figure 1). Serotonin has many profoundly important functions, including a role in sleep, appetite, memory, learning, temperature regulation, mood, sexual behavior, cardiovascular function, muscle contraction, and endocrine regulation.” –Source: http://www.life-enhancement.com/magazine/article/178-5-htp-enhance-your-mood-your-sleep-and-a-lot-more
“5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), an antioxidant and a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, has been shown in studies to prevent both migraines and tension-type headaches. Taking 5-HTP as a supplement is believed to help reduce headache frequency and severity by modulating serotonin and increasing endorphin levels. “
“In one clinical trial, 124 patients with chronic migraines received either 5-HTP or methysergide (a drug used to prevent migraines) for 6 months.[5] Significant improvement in frequency and number of severe attacks occurred for 71% of those in the 5-HTP group, which was the same effect achieved with the prescription medication. “
“5-HTP has also been used successfully in the prevention of chronic tension-type headaches.[6] Since 5-HTP is also beneficial for insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms, it is especially appropriate for individuals who have headaches accompanied by sleep or mood disorders.” -Source: https://universityhealthnews.com/daily/pain/3-therapies-for-natural-migraine-relief-and-other-headache-remedies/
The amino acid 5-hydroxytryptophan, or 5-HTP, is another natural option for upping serotonin levels. As a serotonin precursor, 5-HTP may help those for whom SSRIs like Prozac don’t seem to work, says Katie Baker, ND, owner of Stone Turtle Health, a naturopathic family medicine practice in Seattle. “SSRIs block the uptake of serotonin so it sticks around longer,” she says. But that won’t do much good if not much serotonin is around to begin with. In contrast, 5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the body. “With 5-HTP, you are not plugging up the drain, so to speak; you are just putting more into the sink,” says Baker. A six-week study of 63 people found that those who took 300 mg daily of 5-HTP had the same depression relief as those who took prescription antidepressants-but with fewer side effects.

Quercetin
Have you ever wondered what makes a “superfood” super? Or what key superfoods like red wine, green tea, kale and blueberries all have in common? The answer is quercetin, a natural compound tied to what all of us seek: better longevity, heart health, endurance, immune system and more.
Research shows that anti-inflammatory foods containing quercetin can help manage a number of inflammatory health problems, including heart disease and blood vessel problems, allergies, infections, chronic fatigue, and symptoms related to autoimmune disorders like arthritis. -Source: https://draxe.com/quercetin/
“Quercetin has been found to powerfully stabilize mast cells, helping prevent stress-induced anxiety and allergic reactions. A chain of recent discoveries helps place the significance of these discoveries in context, with far ranging implications for human health, and improved nerve tolerance for managing stress.”
“Another new study shows that stress turns up the volume on mast cells3, priming them to release inflammatory chemicals that are typically involved with allergies, asthma, skin conditions, and digestive problems. Furthermore, the communication coming from mast cells feeds back to nerves, and modulates behaviour through a sense of anxiety.” –Source: https://www.wellnessresources.com/news/quercetin-skin-issues-and-stress
L-Tryptophan for Anxiety and Stress Relief
One of the most useful benefits Tryptophan for anxiety provides is mood regulation, through the production of the neurotransmitter Serotonin. Supplementing with L-Tryptophan and its by-product 5-HTP may improve mood and relieve stress.
Once consumed, L-Tryptophan is converted into 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) and other metabolites in the liver. 5-HTP, which is also available as a mood supplement, travels through the blood stream to the brain. Once there, it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier.
In the brain, 5-HTP is converted into Serotonin, the neurotransmitter most commonly associated with the regulation of mood.
In addition to the role it plays in regulating mood, Serotonin is also converted into the hormone Melatonin. Melatonin is a sleep-regulating neurotransmitter that controls the sleep/wake cycle (circadian rhythm).
During the day, the brain produces more Serotonin, and Melatonin production is very low. When light levels drop at dusk, Serotonin is converted more readily into Melatonin, and levels rise in the body.
Melatonin helps you stay asleep throughout the night and wake feeling rested. This may help to control anxious thoughts during the day.

Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)
What is it? Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) is a chemical made in the brain and often taken as a supplement to relieve anxiety, improve mood, reduce PMS symptoms, and treat symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Does it work? There’s limited evidence to suggest that orally-administered GABA supplements can help promote relaxation and immunity and reduce anxiety during times of stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
GABA is a highly important element in the brain. Essentially, it plays a key role in regulating the depressive neuroactivity in the human brain. In other words, it’s responsible for helping your mind switch from “work mode” to “relaxation mode”. It also plays a role in sedative changes in the brain, which are key to falling asleep at night.
How GABA helps reduce stress: GABA, in supplement form, is used for its relaxation-inducing effects, and to help relieve stress. It has also been shown to help improve mood, which can also lead to less stress in the future. Essentially, it works by blocking brain signals that incite anxiety and stressful feelings, allowing the brain to remain calm and inducing relaxation.

Skullcap Extract
Skullcap herb is an amazing plant for stress, tension, anxiety, nervousness and panic attacks. If I were pressed to simply list one application for skullcap it would be its ability to relieve stress and anxiety. It works well in acute situations and can be taken over time to decrease chronic stress (along with lifestyle modifications of course).
It works well for acute and sudden onset anxiety or panic attacks. For people susceptible to sudden onset anxiety or panic attacks, fresh skullcap tincture can be kept on them at all times.
Experienced herbal medic, Sam Coffman, shares his reliance on skullcap herb for shock-related anxiety.
Skullcap (Scutellaria spp.) and Passionflower are two that have never failed me as a formula to help someone cope quickly with shock-related anxiety. – Sam Coffman, Plant Healer Magazine 11
Not just for acute cases, skullcap can be taken over time as a nerve tonic to support nervous system health in people who have been through prolonged periods of stress and feel like their nerves are constantly on edge.

Ashwaghanda
I hold Ashwaghanda very high on my personal list of most effective herbs against anxiety. Ashwaghanda’s main use is to help the adrenals adjust to stress in our daily lives. It basically produces stress hormones when you need them, and stops producing them when you don’t need them, how cool is that! But the benefits of Ashwaghanda don’t end there, this ‘magic herb’ as I like to call it improves your immune function and greatly improves sleep.

Promotes Graceful Aging
Stress, both metabolic and emotional, dramatically affects aging. Cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, contributes to muscle loss and weakness, wrinkles, and cognitive impairment. Research has found that Ashwagandha improves resistance to stress, possibly decreasing cortisol production. [1] One study of 64 individuals observed a reduction in stress and a significant decrease in cortisol levels in individuals taking Ashwagandha compared with placebo.
Menopausal Support
Ashwagandha acts on the endocrine system by encouraging hormone balance. A study involving 51 menopausal women supplementing with Ashwagandha noted a significant reduction in symptoms such as hot flashes, anxiety, and mood. [2]
Mood Booster
Ashwagandha is a known mood-boosting herb, and research suggests that the therapeutic plant may play a potential role in fighting mood imbalance. [6] Women battling mood swings may benefit from supplementing with Ashwagandha.
Sexual Potency
The Kama Sutra, one of the oldest surviving texts on human sexuality, mentions Ashwagandha in its literature as a potent sexual stimulant for both men and women. Research indicates that the herb supports sexual health and vitality by increasing blood flow and reducing bodily tension. Women taking Ashwagandha typically experience an increase in sexual desire and satisfaction.
Memory Support
Recent research has shown that Ashwagandha reduces memory impairment in animal models. The herb may also protect the brain from the oxidative stress that leads to neurodegeneration. Relaxation, a benefit derived from the herb’s stress-fighting effects, also improves long-term visual memory. [3] [4]
Revitalization
Another benefit many women report after taking this herb is in regards to energy levels. This anecdotal evidence is supported by scientific investigation; a recent study reported Ashwagandha’s benefits for improving energy while reducing stress-related disorders. [5]
Fertility
Stress, illness, hormone imbalance, and nutrient deficiencies — all of these issues threaten female reproductive health and make it difficult for a woman to conceive. Research shows that Ashwagandha supports thyroid function, an organ responsible for regulating hormones. [7] Also, by decreasing stress, Ashwagandha may encourage a situation that is optimal for fertility. [8] More research is needed to clarify whether or not Ashwagandha is effective for helping infertile females struggling to conceive.

Bacopa monnieri
Bacopa monnieri is an herbal nootropic, a plant-based supplement that boosts brain power and reduces anxiety naturally. Bacopa monnieri is one of the oldest and most well-respected nootropic supplements. A traditional Ayurvedic medicine, sometimes referred to as Brahmi, has centuries of history as a potent cognitive enhancer, stress reliever, and brain protectant.
Bacopa monnieri is used to improve memory formation and speed of recall, make learning faster and easier, enhance clarity of thought, and augment overall brain function. It is also believed to act as a brain protectant, and studies show that it has potential as a treatment for dementia.
Bacopa has also been shown to have significant anxiolytic or anti-anxiety effects, producing a feeling of calmness and tranquility and reducing feelings of stress. Users report that it is an excellent general relaxant and can improve the quality of sleep, so they wake feeling rested and refreshed.
-Source: https://www.braintropic.com/nootropics/bacopa-monnieri/
Valerian Root
What is it? Valerian is an herb commonly used to treat insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Although it’s considered safe for most adults, the effects of long-term use are unknown. Short-term side effects include headaches and sluggishness in the morning, especially if taken at higher doses.
Does it work? Early research indicates it could be helpful in reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of pressure when under stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
Some herbal supplements reduce anxiety without making you sleepy (such as L-theanine), while others are sedatives. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is squarely in the second category. It is a sleep aid, for insomnia. It contains sedative compounds; the German government has approved it as a treatment for sleep problems.
Valerian smells kind of nasty, so most people take it as a capsule or tincture, rather than a tea. If you want to try it, take it in the evening—not before you go to work! Valerian is often combined with other sedative herbs such as hops, chamomile, and lemon balm.
-Source: http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20669377,00.html#valerian-2
Valerian is a very helpful form of herbal stress relief if you suffer from tension and anxiety, or have a tendency to get easily over-excited and/or hysterical. It is very calming but is unlikely to make you sleepy (although I wouldn’t suggest taking large quantities and then driving) and you can use it without any worries about getting addicted to it. If you have trouble sleeping, try taking valerian an hour or so before you go to bed. If your body gets so tense that you experience pain, taking valerian can help to relieve the discomfort. –Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Passionflower
Studies have shown that passionflower lowers anxiety in mice, but only one study has been carried out in humans, according to Lenz. That randomized, placebo-controlled study was done in 2001 in patients with general anxiety disorder, and found that 45 drops of liquid passionflower daily was as effective in treating the disorder as the drug oxazepam. Still, more research on its safety and effectiveness is needed, Lenz wrote in his study.
-Source: https://www.livescience.com/16975-herbal-supplements-stress-reduction.html
Passion flower is extremely useful if you suffer from long term insomnia. It can be taken over a long period of time. It helps you get to sleep, sleep well and wake up without any of the heavy feeling of some sleeping tablets. It has a generally tranquillizing effect. It can help to relieve restlessness, irritability, nervous stress and anxiety and can also be used where great tension is causing spasms in the body as it is also an antispasmodic. -Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Hops Extract
Hops work as a central nervous system relaxant. This makes them a very helpful form of herbal stress relief if you suffer from insomnia and the stress states caused by not getting enough sleep. Hops help to relieve tension and anxiety and are helpful in reducing restlessness. Hops have a strong muscle relaxing effect so if being stressed gives you headaches, indigestion, stomach pains, palpitations or a nervous cough, then taking hops, especially in the form of a tincture, could prove very helpful for you.
-Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Chamomile Extract
Chamomile is a mild relaxant and sedative. A cup of chamomile tea before bed can help you to fall asleep easily and sleep well. Like lemon balm, it also has anti-spasmodic properties. This is a wonderful tea for children. It can be slightly bitter so sweeten it with a little honey if you like. -Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Recent clinical and laboratory research has determined that chamomile is not only relaxing, but it can significantly decrease anxiety and even fight depression.
The most recent study, from the UK’s University of Nottingham Medical School, found that chamomile significantly relaxed blood vessels and smooth muscle fibers. This effect was indicated specifically with the application of three of chamomile’s central constituents, apigenin, luteolin and bisabolol – all hydroxylates.
The fact that chamomile is an anti-anxiety and anti-depression herb was cemented by a clinical study at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. This study was done in 2009, but its data and findings were re-investigated and confirmed last year.
The researchers enlisted 19 people diagnosed with anxiety with depression, along with 16 people who were diagnosed as having a history of anxiety and depression. These groups were studied along with a control group of 22 people who had no anxiety or depression – past or present.
The study was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. The researchers gave the subjects either 220 milligrams of chamomile extract (standardized to 1.2% apigenin) or a placebo study, both in capsules.
The researchers found that 57% of the group using the chamomile extract had significantly reduced (greater than 50%) anxiety scores using the HAM-A system.

Melatonin
What is it? A hormone produced by the brain’s pineal gland, melatonin helps control sleep cycles. Because sleep and mood are closely connected, supplementing with melatonin can alleviate stress. It’s considered safe, but can cause side effects like headaches, short-term feelings of depression, dizziness, and irritability.
Does it work? Early research indicates it could be helpful in reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of pressure when under stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
Generally, people use Melatonin supplements to help with sleep disorders, such as primary insomnia. It also used for a variety of health conditions that include bipolar disorder, dementia, depression, endometriosis and anxiety.
Melatonin is a hormone made by the brain to regulate sleep cycles, but it can also play a role in mood and anxiety. It helps to control the level of stimulation and activity experienced by the body, and demonstrates anxiolytic effects.
If you have anxiety, melatonin may help make it easier to fall asleep at night, since insomnia is a common side effect of this mood disorder. It can also improve depression symptoms in patients with both anxiety and depression.

Theanine (L. Theanine) (Found in Green Tea)
There’s been a resurgence of interest in the anxiety-relieving powers of L-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea.1
Discoveries over the past two years have uncovered exciting additional properties of this nutrient best known for inducing calming, tranquilizing effects while simultaneously improving alertness.
L-theanine relieves anxiety in large part because it bears a close resemblance to the brain-signaling chemical glutamate. L-theanine produces the opposite effect in the brain.
While glutamate is the brain’s most important excitatory neurotransmitter, L-theanine binds to the same brain cell receptors and blocks them to glutamate’s effects. This action produces inhibitory effects.1,2 That inhibition to brain overactivity has a calming, relaxing effect in which anxiety fades.3
In addition to blocking excitatory stimuli at glutamate receptors in the brain, L-theanine also stimulates production of the inhibitory, relaxing neurotransmitter GABA, adding to its calming, anti-anxiety effects.2
Unlike prescription anti-anxiety drugs, however, some of which mimic GABA’s effects, L-theanine produces its anti-anxiety effects without producing sleepiness or impairing motor behavior.4 In fact, L-theanine has been shown in human studies to moderately improve alertness and attention while exerting its anxiety-reducing effects.5
Of particular interest are studies showing that L-theanine supplementation prevents the abrupt rise in blood pressure that some people experience under stress.1 The reason this is so critical is that many people have normal blood pressure readings at rest that spike up to dangerously high levels when subjected to stressful situations.
There’s a link between anxiety, reaction to stress, and the brain’s most fundamental function, maintaining cognition. Studies over the past two years suggest a potential role for L-theanine in supporting cognitive function and preventing its loss.
-Source: http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2016/3/brain-benefits-of-l-theanine/page-01
How L-theanine helps reduce stress: Primarily, L-theanine helps to relax the body and mind, without having sedative effects. So, it’s a great way to help manage stress, and you can use it during the day because it won’t cause drowsiness. Theanine supplements may also help to reduce the perception of stress and help you stay in a more positive mindset. Theanine has also been shown to work synergistically with other supplements, including caffeine. Research has shown a combination of 200mg of theanine with 200mg of caffeine promotes significant improvements in cognition and attention.
Many people consider L-theanine a way to “take the edge off”, so to speak. Particularly when used in combination with stimulants, like caffeine, the relaxing-but-not-sedative effects of L-theanine really come into play. Also, while most people drink caffeine on a daily basis, few people know that coffee and caffeinated beverages can actually worsen anxiety and stress symptoms. But when combined with L-theanine, you shouldn’t experience any negative effect from the caffeine, and you can still enjoy that helpful pick-me-up from a cup of coffee, combined with the calming effects of the amino acid supplement.

Vitamin B-12
Vitamin B12 benefits your mood, energy level, memory, heart, skin, hair, digestion and more. Vitamin B12 is also an essential vitamin for addressing adrenal fatigue, multiple metabolic functions — including enzyme production, DNA synthesis and hormonal balance — and maintaining healthy nervous and cardiovascular systems.
Because of its wide-reaching roles within the body, a vitamin B12 deficiency can show up in many different negative symptoms, many of which are very noticeable, such as potential chronic fatigue, mood disorders like depression, and chronic stress or feeling run down. Vitamin B12, sometimes also called cyanocobalamin, also helps with digestion and heart health.
Vitamin B12 benefits the central nervous system in many important ways: It helps maintain the health of nerve cells — including those needed for neurotransmitter signalling — and helps form the protective covering of nerves, called the cell’s myelin sheath. This means that when vitamin B12 levels are low, almost every cognitive function can suffer.
-Source: https://draxe.com/vitamin-b12-benefits/
Vitamin D3
There is evidence that stress, fatigue, and depression are connected to low serum levels of vitamin D, in addition to known immunity, illness and disease issues.
Dr. Lipman is the founder of the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in NYC. He lists fatigue, restless sleep and poor concentration among other symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Over 80% of his clients are vitamin D deficient, which correlates with the general population epidemic. [1]
Dr. Anna Dorothea Hoeck, MD, from Cologne, Germany, has treated fatigue with vitamin D therapy, using the 25(OH)D3 test first, then boosting those readings accordingly.
She has discovered with actual clinical treatments that those with lower levels of chronic fatigue recovered quickly, while more severe cases required adding minerals with the vitamin, especially calcium and magnesium.
http://www.naturalnews.com/041772_vitamin_D_levels_stress_fatigue.html
Clinical Trials have proved Vitamin D3 to be superior to Vitamin D2
A 2011 Cochrane Database study highlighted the significant differences between the two and examined mortality rates for people who supplemented their diets with Vitamin D2, versus those who did so with Vitamin D3. The analysis of 50 randomised controlled trials, which included almost 100,000 participants, showed a 6% relative risk reduction among those who used D3, and a 2% relative risk increase among those who used D2.
Your body deals with the different types very differently
According to recent research, Vitamin D3 is approximately 85% better in raising and maintaining Vitamin D concentrations in the body and produces 200-300% greater storage of Vitamin D than Vitamin D2.
With either form your body must convert it into a more active form, and Vitamin D3 is converted 500 percent faster than Vitamin D2.
Vitamin D2 has a shorter shelf life and it binds poorly with proteins in your blood which further hinders its effectiveness.

Vitamin E
Vitamin E is important for strong immunity and healthy skin and eyes. In recent years, vitamin E supplements have become popular as antioxidants. These are substances that protect cells from damage.
Balances Hormones
Vitamin E can play a crucial role in balancing your endocrine and nervous systems, naturally working to balance hormones naturally. (5) Symptoms of a hormonal imbalance may include PMS, weight gain, allergies, urinary tract infections, changes in the skin, anxiety and fatigue.
Helps PMS Symptoms
Taking a vitamin E supplement two to three days before and two to three days after a menstrual period can reduce the cramping, anxiety and cravings and other PMS symptoms. Vitamin E can decrease pain severity and duration, and it can reduce menstrual blood loss. It does this by balancing your hormones naturally, and it helps keep your menstrual cycle regulated.
Important during Pregnancy for Growth and Development
Vitamin E is critical during pregnancy and for proper development in infants and children because it protects critical fatty acids and helps control inflammation.
Other vitamin E benefits include its role as an important fat-soluble vitamin that’s required for the proper function of many organs, enzymatic activities and neurological processes.
Source: https://draxe.com/vitamin-e-benefits/
Vitamin B-Complex
What is it? The vitamin B-complex refers to all of the known essential water-soluble vitamins except for vitamin C: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin, folic acid, and the cobalamins (B12). B vitamins are important for cell metabolism. Most people who eat a balanced diet should have adequate B vitamins, but a vegan diet or an immune disorder such as lupus can lead to B12 deficiencies.
Does it work? Some research indicates B-complex vitamins are linked to improved mood.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
How B vitamin complex helps to reduce stress: In several clinical trials, B vitamin complex supplements have shown great potential in reducing stress levels. Taking a b-vitamin daily helped patients to improve mood by improving the body’s natural production of serotonin and other neurotransmitters. It also helped to reduce levels of homocysteine, a toxic amino acid that can lead to many health issues down the road. B vitamins also play a key role in energy production, and as you likely know, stress is much easier to counter when you’re feeling energized.

Probiotic: L. Helveticus (Lactobacillus helveticus
Supplementation with the probiotic combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 is an evidence-based, biologically plausible approach to addressing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Studies show favorable biochemical and behavioral changes in animals treated with the probiotic, and sharp and significant decreases in symptoms of depression and anxiety in human trials.
For anyone experiencing anxiety and/or depression, regular supplementation with this probiotic combination seems a natural and worthwhile practice. It is conceivable that such supplementation could reduce reliance on prescription medications and deliver freedom from the burdens of these common mental illnesses.

Glutamine
Glutamine supplements may have a beneficial effect on depression and patients suffering from depression may have lower levels of glutamine in their brains. If you experience high levels of stress, your body may need a higher amount of glutamine, as it is easily depleted by high levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
Depression Facts
Clinical depression occurs in several forms, including major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, dysthymia and postpartum depression. According to NYU Langone Medical Center, depressive symptoms vary from person to person — some people experience just a few symptoms while others may experience a combination of many symptoms.
Some of the common symptoms of depression include feelings of low self-worth, irritability, sadness, a lowered mood, sleep problems, appetite changes, a decreased sex drive, fatigue, a lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed and, in some people, suicidal thoughts or gestures. Researchers believe a number of factors contribute to depressive disorders, including genetics, stressful life events, drug and alcohol addiction, lack of social support, medical illnesses and changes in brain chemistry.
Additionally, nutritional deficiencies can also cause depression. Although research on the benefits of glutamine for depression is limited, some people believe that it may help reduce depressive symptoms.
Clinical Evidence
A study published in the February 2007 issue of the “Archives of General Psychiatry,” a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Medical Association, found that depressed study participants had lowered levels of glutamine in their prefrontal brain tissue. However, most of the evidence confirming the benefits of glutamine supplementation on depression is anecdotal.
A systematic review published in 2002 in the “Medical Journal of Australia” states that only an uncontrolled experiment has been performed to verify the benefits of glutamine supplements on depression.
The experiment referred to is a study published in the July-August 1976 issue of the Belgian medical journal, “Acta Psychiatrica Belgica.” This study showed that l-glutamine supplementation showed antidepressant properties on adult study participants suffering from depression. However, more clinical research is needed to fully evaluate the potential benefit of glutamine supplementation on depression.
Considerations
Glutamine supplements are sold online and in health food stores in powder and capsule form. However, you should not use glutamine as a cure for depression or as a substitute for conventional medical care. -Source: http://www.livestrong.com/article/477074-glutamine-depression/
Chromium as Chromium AAC (Amino Acid Chelate)
Chelated chromium is a nutritional supplement that allows cells to receive and absorb blood sugar for energy, according to Source Naturals. Chelation is the process of bonding with amino acids. This bond allows the mineral content to stay intact, and it provides maximum assimilation into the body.
Chromium is also used for depression, Turner’s syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), lowering “bad” cholesterol, raising “good” cholesterol in people taking heart medications called beta blockers, metabolic syndrome, heart attack, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and binge eating disorder.

Phenylethylamine or PEA
PEA supplements are great for helping with the symptoms of anxiety. Since PEA is so good at increasing natural levels of dopamine, which is one of the ‘feel-good’ hormones, it is great at combatting negative feelings of anxiety.[7]
Low levels of dopamine are known to cause anxiety and depression, along with a number of other mental illnesses. Taking phenylethylamine boosts your dopamine levels.[8] Increased dopamine levels make you feel happier, calmer and more sensual.
Another great benefit is phenylethylamine for studying. By increasing catecholamines and dopamine, phenylethylamine give a clear focus and energy boost, associated with increases in cognitive power and learning capabilities.

Phenylethylamine Benefits:
May significantly improve mood and produce overall feeling of well-being
Helpful for reducing high levels of stress and anxiety
Known to assist with those experiencing symptoms of depression
A common element used in treating anxiety and depression
Produces higher energy levels
Minimize fatigue that can often be associated with depression anxiety symptoms
Ability to increase Acetylcholine levels. Increased levels of this neurotransmitter will commonly result in faster memory recall and retention.
Many have reported improved attention span and overall learning aptitude.
Enhanced ability in focus and concentration

Amylase
Stress is by far one of the worst things in the world for your health, particularly chronic stress. Research is showing that amylase can be a very helpful and accurate marker of stress levels.
One study looked at the whether or not the salivary enzyme alpha-amylase could indicate stress-reactive bodily changes. Researchers repeatedly measured salivary alpha-amylase and salivary cortisol as well as plasma catecholamines and cardiovascular activity before, during and after 30 young men underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Results indicated that salivary alpha-amylase is sensitive to psychosocial stress and may be a very helpful additional parameter for the measurement of stress in humans. (9)

Wheat grass powder
Wheatgrass powder is made by freeze-drying, oven-drying or air-drying fresh wheatgrass. Adding wheatgrass to your diet is an effective way to get your quota of five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day, according to Illinois State University.
Restores pH Balance
Wheatgrass is an alkaline food supplement and it balances the body’s pH levels. Hence, it is beneficial for reducing the acidity in the blood and restoring its alkalinity (9).
Reduces Fatigue
Tiredness often symbolizes sleep deprivation and a weak immune system, which can be effectively treated with the help of wheatgrass. This amazing ingredient contains chlorophyll, which, apart from boosting our immune system, also assists in cell regeneration. This, in turn, helps heal our body and reduces fatigue. Additionally, chlorophyll helps boost our adrenal system, which is essential for the prevention of chronic fatigue.
Helps Improve Mood
Wheatgrass also helps uplift your mood in a number of ways; it is rich in vitamin K and magnesium. It boosts the adrenal system and helps your body deal with stress. Additionally, wheatgrass contains a good quantity of iron, the deficiency of which can cause fatigue that eventually worsens your mood. It also helps fight depression.
Increases Libido: Consuming wheatgrass powder regularly helps in enhancing the reproductive health of both men and women. It also increases vigor and helps in conception (21).
Is Good For The Liver
With its detoxifying properties, wheatgrass can revitalize your liver. In a study conducted in 2014, it has also been shown that having wheatgrass regularly can protect the liver from the harmful effects of alcohol. -Source: http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-wheatgrass-powder-for-skin-hair-and-health/
Magnesium
What is it? Magnesium is a mineral essential for nerve and muscle function. Although most people who eat a balanced diet get enough magnesium, an analysis of data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that a majority of Americans consume less than they should.
The supplement is considered safe, but side effects can include stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Rarely, large doses can cause irregular heartbeat and low blood pressure.
Does it work? Early research indicates it could be helpful in reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of pressure when under stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
Although it is found in several dietary sources, as well as included in most multivitamins, magnesium deficiency is extremely common. An estimated 57% of Americans do not get adequate magnesium in their diets, and that number is even higher in many other countries. A deficiency in magnesium can cause all sorts of health problems, and can worsen stress and anxiety. The good news is that it’s easy to fix magnesium deficiency by changing your diet or adding a supplement.

Ginger Root Extract
Ginger Increases Brain Levels of Important Neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals used by brain cells to communicate with each other. They control your ability to focus, concentrate, and remember, and regulate mood, cravings, addictions, sleep, and more.
It’s estimated that 86% of Americans have suboptimal levels of neurotransmitters. (13) Ginger increases levels of these important brain chemicals, including dopamine and serotonin. (14) Dopamine is considered the “motivation molecule” that helps you get focused and be productive. It’s also in charge of your pleasure-reward system. Serotonin is your “happiness molecule” that is critical for keeping up a positive mood.
Ginger Root Reduces Adrenal Fatigue
Overwhelming tiredness is not the only symptom of adrenal fatigue. Other symptoms include brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and an inability to handle stress. (29)
Dr. Michael Lam is an expert on adrenal fatigue syndrome and the author of Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome – Reclaim Your Energy and Vitality with Clinically Proven Natural Programs.
He recommends ginger root along with ginkgo and ginseng as part of his natural adrenal fatigue protocol. (30) These adaptogenic herbs strengthen the adrenals, increase resilience to stress, and modulate levels of the stress hormone cortisol. -Source: https://bebrainfit.com/ginger-root-benefits/
Licorice Root
There is research that shows that the Glycyrrhizic acid that is in licorice root can help with nervousness and depression by encouraging the function of the adrenal glands. Our adrenal glands control stress hormones including cortisol. When one’s stress hormone levels are low it can often be the cause of persistent fatigue, melancholy, anxiety, and having less resistance to infections and allergens. Licorice root also happens to also have the Asparagine amino acid that is needed to preserve equilibrium in the body’s nervous system.

Eleuthero root extract
Some of the most important health benefits of eleuthero include its ability to help relieve stress, increase cognitive function, boost the immune system, reduce fatigue, lower inflammation, protect heart health, prevent degenerative diseases, boost respiratory health, and increase energy levels.
Reduce Fatigue
One of the major claims to fame for eleuthero is its ability to boost energy levels. This is accomplished by its impact on the nervous system, boosting the metabolism, increasing circulation, and reducing cloudiness and fatigue. For people who regularly need naps during the day, feel the mid-day exhaustion following a large meal, or find themselves tired without a good explanation, regular supplementation with eleuthero can get you back to normal.
Stress Relief
Eleuthero is considered an adaptogen, one of those rare herbs that can actually help your body adapt and change to better handle various stimuli or conditions. For example, eleuthero has been shown to improve user response to stress, namely in the way that their body responds when anxious or upset. Eleuthero’s powerful components actually teach the body to handle bio-chemical situations in the best way possible.
A Final Word of Warning
There is some controversy about the various applications of eleuthero, and it’s important to understand the risks. If you suffer from certain mental conditions (mania or insomnia) or hormone-related disorders, it can be dangerous to take eleuthero. Also, in the case of heart conditions, diabetes, or cancer, eleuthero use can be beneficial, but only under the strict guidance of your medical provider. This is a very powerful herb and can have complex interactions with other drugs, so caution and consultation is highly recommended.

Citrus Aurantium Extract (Bitter Orange)
Background and objectives
Reducing anxiety is very important before operation. Preoperative visit and use of premedication are popular methods to achieve this goal, but the role of anxiolytic premedication remains unclear and postoperative side-effects may result from routine premedication.
Citrus aurantium is used as an alternative medicine in some countries to treat anxiety, and recently the anxiolytic role of this medicinal plant was established in an animal model study. The aim of this study was to assess the anxiolytic effect of Citrus aurantium blossom on preoperative anxiety.
Methods
We studied 60 ASA I patients undergoing minor operation. In a randomized double-blind design, two groups of 30 patients received one of the following oral premedication two hours before induction of anesthesia: 1) Citrus aurantium blossom distillate 1 mL.kg-1 (C-group); 2) Saline solution 1 mL.kg-1 as placebo (P-group). Anxiety was measured before and after premedication using the Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI-state) and the Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale (APAIS) before operation.
Results
After premedication, both the STAI-state and the APAIS scales were decreased in C-group (p < 0.05); while exhibiting no significant changes in P-group.
Conclusions
Citrus aurantium blossom may be effective in terms of reduction in preoperative anxiety before minor operation.

Aspartic Acid (Women’s Formula Only)
Aspartic acid, also known as L-aspartate, is thought to help promote a robust metabolism, and is sometimes used to treat fatigue and depression. Aspartic acid plays an important role in the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle, during which other amino acids and biochemicals, such as asparagine, arginine, lysine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine, are synthesized.
Aspartic acid gets its reputation as a treatment for chronic fatigue from the crucial role it plays in generating cellular energy. Aspartic acid moves the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules from the main body of the cell to its mitochondria, where it is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fuel that powers all cellular activity.
In short, the more NADH a cell has, the more chemical fuel it produces, and the more energy you have to get through your day. (Some studies have shown that aspartic acid actually increases both stamina and endurance levels in athletes.) In addition, this amino acid helps transport minerals needed to form healthy RNA and DNA to the cells, and strengthens the immune system by promoting increased production of immunoglobulins and antibodies (immune system proteins).
Aspartic acid keeps your mind sharp by increasing concentrations of NADH in the brain, which is thought to boost the production of neurotransmitters and chemicals needed for normal mental functioning. It also removes excess toxins from the cells, particularly ammonia, which is very damaging to the brain and nervous system as well as the liver.

Aspartic acid is used as a testosterone booster aging and infertile men. Men taking D-aspartic acid during the 90-day study dramatically improved sperm count and motility. As a result, they became more fertile and pregnancies increased among their partners. [7]
After taking D-aspartic acid for 12 days, participants increased lutheinizing hormone and testosterone levels by 33% and 42%, respectively.[8] These are just a few benefits of high testosterone levels:
Greater muscle growth and strength
Fat loss
Better sleep quality
High libido
Positive mood
More Energy
Aspartic Acid is also used by athletes as a temporary booster. Elevated testosterone levels only last a week to a week and a half in healthy men, with testosterone returning to normal afterward.
During the 1950s and 1960s, European researchers discovered a simple and inexpensive way to treat physical and mental fatigue — including the kind caused by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).aspartic acidThey found that aspartic acid supplements could seriously boost stamina and alertness and benefit health in many ways.
It’s no wonder that scientists believe aspartic acid can cure CFS. In fact, CFS may result from a deficiency of aspartic acid, which lowers cellular energy — and subsequently decreases your stamina.
Aspartic acid is responsible for the production of cellular fuel. The more of it your body has, the more energy you have throughout your day.
A study published in The Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences in September of 2006 documented that additional energy was created when rats were dosed with aspartic acid. For the study, 2 groups of rats swam until metabolic exhaustion set in. Researchers noted that the exhaustion point for the group given aspartic acid arrived after a significantly longer swim time.
The results of the study indicate that aspartic acid will typically increase physical endurance. Recent studies conducted with human athletes support these conclusions.
The athletes who took mineral salt preparations of aspartic acid experienced greater aerobic competency. It also appeared that the mineral salts increased endurance and stamina levels overall.
Other studies showed that 75% to 94% of patients suffering fatigue due to a multitude of different causes experienced notable improvement when treated with aspartic acid.
In fact, in one study of 80 patients who had struggled with post-surgical fatigue for more than one year, one gram of potassium-magnesium aspartate twice daily brought more than 90% complete relief from all symptoms within 2 weeks.

L-Serine (Women’s Formula Only)
The syndrome fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that affects many people. It is characterised by diffuse tenderness, widespread pain, cognitive disturbance and fatigue. The exact causes of fibromyalgia are unknown, however people suffering from this condition have lower levels of serine in their blood compared with healthy people.
Source: http://aminoacidstudies.org/l-serine/
Recent research being done in Australia has led to the conclusion that people who suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFIDS), especially those with more neurological symptoms, may actually have a treatable amino acid deficiency. At the February 1998 CFIDS conference in Sydney, doctors from Newcastle University in Callaghan, Australia, who have formed the Collaborative Pain Research Unit (CPRU), presented their intriguing discovery that a substantial number of CFIDS patients have a deficiency in the amino acid, serine.

D-serine vs. L-serine
This article includes references from studies using both enantiomers of serine. The two may have somewhat similar effects since L-serine is converted to D-serine by serine racemase, an enzyme that requires vitamin B6 to function. It is thus important to supplement vitamin B6 when supplementing L-serine.
Mood and Depression
D-serine produces both acute[1] and chronic[2] antidepressant effects in animal models. Chronic use was also reported to lower markers of anxiety. Studies have also shown that it may prevent cognitive impairment in subjects exposed to stressful situations[3] (like a job interview) but not in normal day-to-day situations. D-serine, therefore, does not strictly meet the definition of a nootropic. It is, however, ubiquitous in the body, and with many interesting effects in promoting cerebral health, certainly a worthy supplement.

White Tea Extract
White tea flavonoids and Caffeine can ease depression by stimulating release of hormones in brain and thus reduce stress.
This remarkable tea has also been shown to fight free radicals from sun, stress and poor diet, and reverse some of the signs of aging. According to a study by Kingston University in London, it seems that white tea may be an interesting option for reducing and preventing wrinkles. Out of 21 different compounds tested, white tea was found to contain by far the highest concentration of antioxidants.
Is there anything this tea doesn’t help improve? Well, let’s see here, white tea may also reduce blood sugar and lessen the symptoms of diabetes. This astounding tea has shown to reduce stress and yet increase energy levels. Now who doesn’t want to have more energy throughout the day?

Satiereal™ Saffron Extract (crocus):
Satiereal is the name given to an extract from saffron. The extract is called Crocus Sativus.
“Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that saffron extract or its constituents have antidepressant,[51] anti-inflammatory,[10] anti-tumor effects, radical-scavenging, learning and memory improving properties.[52–54]”
-Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249922/
“In a 2005 study of women who were depressed, 45 women were randomly given 30 mg of saffron or a placebo for 6 weeks. Women getting the saffron (Crocus sativus, which is what Satiereal comes from) scored better on depression questioners compared to women who got the placebo.”
“Several other studies exist, which also hint that saffron can help mild to moderate depression too.” -Source: https://supplement-geek.com/thrive-patch-review/
Ginkgo leaf extract
Ginkgo’s been widely studied for its effective anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, platelet-forming and circulation-boosting effects. According to current research, ginkgo biloba benefits include improved cognitive function, positive mood, increased energy, improved memory and reduced symptoms related to multiple chronic diseases — for instance, it’s been used as an asthma natural remedy, ADHD natural remedy and dementia treatment. In fact, it’s believed to be so effective that it’s even a prescription herb in Germany! -Source: https://draxe.com/ginkgo-biloba-benefits/
Phosphatidylserine
What is it?: Phosphatidylserine (PS) occurs naturally in the body and supports cellular function, especially in the brain. Although the supplement form is considered safe for most adults and children, it can cause side effects like insomnia and stomach upset, particularly at doses over 300 mg.
Does it work?: Some research suggests that athletes taking PS during strenuous training might experience less muscle soreness, but there are conflicting results. One study found preliminary evidence that a combination of soy-based PS and lecithin may moderate the body’s reaction to stress.

St. John’s Wort
In one study of 40 patients with social anxiety disorder, taking St. John’s wort for two weeks seemed to slightly improve anxiety symptoms; however, the difference between the groups in the study may have been due to chance, and the study itself was poorly designed, according to Lenz.
Many herbal supplements are sedatives and should not be taken with other sedative drugs or alcohol, Lenz said.

Guarana
“Guarana acts on the central nervous system to prevent fatigue and break down lactic acid from muscle stress. Guarana also discourages blood clots, stimulates the urinary system, and promotes production of digestive juices. Guarana was used to treat diarrhea, decrease fatigue, reduce hunger, and to help arthritis. Guarana has been thought as a high energy source that increases mental alertness, slows the pulse, decreases the appetite, fights fatigue, an excellent mood elevator.” –Source: https://www.practo.com/healthfeed/8-benefits-of-eating-guarana-3438/post
Guarana is marketed as the rocket fuel behind energy drinks and demonised as a dangerous form of supercharged caffeine, but what’s the naked truth to this Brazilian herb?
Guaraná contains caffeine, the stimulant found in coffee, tea, yerba mate, colas and chocolate. “Guaraná also contains a whole mix of other compounds that act together to stimulate you over and above its caffeine content,” says Professor Stephen Myers, Director of NatMed-Research at Southern Cross University.
In fact, at the University of Tasmania a study comparing the effects of coffee, guaraná and yerba mate showed that guaraná produced the greatest alertness and improvement in the performance of mental tasks. Coffee produced a peak in alertness after about 30-45 minutes then rapidly fell away, while the effects of guaraná were still continuing – and increasing – after 150 minutes. “There might be substances in guaraná that delay the metabolism of caffeine or slows the absorption of caffeine to prolong its effect,” Professor Myers explains.
Like other forms of caffeine, guaraná may interact with certain medications, and too much guaraná carries all the risks associated with high levels (over 300mg) of caffeine – insomnia, trembling, anxiety, dehydration and palpitations. Unlike coffee, however, laboratory tests have shown no evidence of toxicity even in large doses, but guaraná should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation, or when there is high blood pressure.

Garcinia Cambogia
Garcinia cambogia (GC) is a small pumpkin-shaped fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and India. The key active ingredient found in garcinia cambogia is Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA), which some research suggests can help certain people lose weight. Developing research suggests that HCA might prevent fat storage, control appetite, and increase exercise endurance.
This weight loss supplement does more than just inhibit fat development. It also affects the brain. It is important to understand how garcinia cambogia improves your mood and how this affects weight loss.
The main ingredient in Garcinia Cambogia is called Hydroxycitric Acid, or HCA. HCA affects the body in a few different ways. It prevents your body from storing unused carbohydrates as fat that could add to your weight.
It also creates a full sensation while eating so that it becomes easier to consume fewer calories while dieting. The third important effect is that the HCA in Garcinia Cambogia increases the production of serotonin in the brain. Higher levels of serotonin have been proven to improve mood over time.
Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in the brain. It is responsible for several things. Serotonin helps to regulate many functions in the body. It also allows messages to pass freely through the brain. Low levels of serotonin can lead to lethargic behavior, depression and anxiety. These factors can put you in a bad mood regardless of what is really happening around you.
Taking Garcinia Cambogia regularly will naturally stimulate the production of serotonin in your brain. You will begin to feel emotionally better. You will have fewer problems with depression, anxiety and feelings of hopelessness.

What is Hypnotherapy?
Posted on March 19, 2016 by ihbPT
By Paul Holcroft, an International Credited Hypnotherapist & NLP Practitioner
There are many external and internal forces that cause stress within our bodies and these stresses throw our lives out of balance. Hypnotherapy healing is based on the concept of making whole… it is holistic in nature and is about removing stress and emotional blockages and bringing about harmony and balance within.
Hypnotherapy is similar in many ways to counselling except a hypnotherapist works on a deeper level… the unconscious mind and, can involve several different methodologies within the session including; Erickson Hypnosis, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Time Line Therapy and Body Wisdom.
The outcomes and powerful results that can be achieved through hypnotherapy are many and varied and can include personal, professional, emotional and health benefits at extraordinary levels.
Many people have a fear or are sceptical of hypnosis. This is due to television and stage performances which portray people being put under hypnosis against their will. The reality is hypnosis is not something that is done to you. The hypnotherapist, utilizing different deep mindful techniques, is merely the guide that leads you to a state of deep relaxation and a state of heightened mental awareness.
Once in this state of deep relaxation and heightened awareness you are able to communicate with the unconscious part of your mind where you can uncover any unconscious patterns you may be running that are controlling your life… and many times you are not even consciously aware that these patterns even existed.
Hypnotherapy empowers you with tools that you can use to adjust and tweak these unconscious patterns to better serve you and the goals you have for your life. Hypnotherapy allows you to transform yourself… and the transformation happens from the inside out… it comes from within. The transformation comes from the insights you discover inside (the unconscious mind)… not from the external information you receive (conscious mind).
Did you know that many famous people from all walks of life including sports stars, business executives, professional speakers, singers, stage actors and movie stars use hypnotherapy on a regular basis to remove stage fright, emotional stress, self-confidence and self-esteem issues as well as keeping themselves positively on track with their life goals. Hypnotherapy is one of the most powerful methods for getting permanent results. You only need to Google this to discover more.
You see there’s nothing strange or mysterious about hypnotherapy. It’s just a profession like any other profession. Hypnotherapists are trained professionals just like a psychologist or a solicitor or an architect… except in our case we are a profession that leads the way for business goal setting, getting the right mindset, creating abundance, tackling self-confidence and self-esteem issues, dealing with stress, anxiety and panic attacks, phobias, pain management, quitting cigarettes, weight-loss, sports performance enhancement and many, many other issues people have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. And it all has to do with the power of the unconscious mind.
You may have heard people describe the mind in many different ways but let’s look at the structures of the mind – the conscious part of the mind and the unconscious part of the mind. The conscious mind being what we are consciously aware of at any point in time in the present moment. The conscious mind is where we do all the analysing an evaluating. It is where we make all the day-to-day decisions.
The unconscious mind is where everything else is stored, everything we have ever seen, heard, felt, smelt or experienced… good and bad… much of which, we may no longer be even consciously aware of. Your unconscious mind is also responsible for all of the body’s automatic functions. It makes your eyes blink, your heart beat, makes you breath faster or slower when you need to. It digests your food and controls your hormones.
What I am saying, metaphorically speaking is to look at your unconscious mind as your automatic pilot. Your unconscious mind runs your life for you.
Every event and experience you have ever witnessed is all stored in the subconscious mind. All learning, all behaviour, all change is in fact programmed into your unconscious mind. And you have been programming things you learn, beliefs, values, morals, habits (good and bad) and all sorts of other things into your unconscious mind since the day you were born. These habits and beliefs then create neurological patterns.
When we learn things, we store them in the unconscious mind and they become automatic. You see, everything you do automatically, without thinking, is an unconscious habit. Even you’re breathing… it just happens for you.
If you run and your body needs more oxygen pumped to the cells in your muscles, you don’t need to think about it, you automatically breathe faster and heavier and your heart rate increases to pump that extra oxygen around your body quickly to get it to where it is needed. Your unconscious mind takes care of all of the body’s autonomic functions for you.
When you need to think about something to do it – it is a conscious process. For example when you first learnt to read, you really had to think about every letter – every sound – and just take in small pieces of information at a time – because that is all the conscious mind can handle.
When you learnt to drive a car – it was think, think, think … gears … blinkers … brake … check mirrors …. And so on. It was difficult concentrating on so many things at once. That’s because the tiny conscious part of the mind gets overloaded very easily.
So what happens is that when we practice something over and over again, the conscious mind downloads that information to the powerful unconscious mind which then handles all those sorts of things and they become automatic – an easy habitual behaviour.
So you learn something, you practice it, you relegate it to the unconscious mind, the unconscious takes over that function for you – and then you get access to it on automatic pilot. So you see, when you no longer need to think about something … when you do it automatically, it is unconscious.
It has been programmed into the unconscious mind which then takes it on board as an automatic behaviour or habit. Now some of these habits and learning are useful – like driving a car or reading and writing. But some habits and learning are not useful – such as smoking or overeating … or phobias or panic attacks.
Whatever we program into the unconscious mind will become an automatic function that is no longer under our conscious control.
You may have tried previously to change unhealthy habits or unwanted programmed responses with conscious willpower but how hard is that? You see, the reality is we come hardwired to actually protect those old habits because it’s the job of the unconscious mind hold onto them.
It doesn’t forget or let go of them. It holds onto them to protect us and keep us alive. You don’t unlearn something that you have programmed in. And remember… the unconscious mind does not analyse whether it is a good or bad habit or response or program… it simply accepts what you have programmed into it, runs that program and holds onto to it to protect us.
Take for instance; driving a car, you wouldn’t all of a sudden forget what you have to do. The unconscious mind holds onto everything so we don’t have to relearn them all over again… it is our survival mechanism. The unconscious mind protects the body by protecting the habits and learning that you have formed and programmed into the subconscious mind.
That’s right! The unconscious mind never forgets. That’s why when you consciously try to break a bad habit, the unconscious mind holds onto it… to protect you… and it feels like there’s a battle going on inside. This is because that is exactly what is happening. There is an inner conflict between the conscious and the unconscious mind.
So whenever you try to stop smoking or lose weight, or break any of those unwanted habits or responses, the conscious mind may be trying to release it – but the unconscious mind hold on to it because it thinks it is protecting you..
So it naturally follows that when you want to make changes to these programmed patterns and behaviours the changes must be made at an unconscious level… and this is what is achieved through hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy, simply stated, bypasses the conscious mind and speaks directly to and reprograms the unconscious mind.
By using hypnotherapy we can bypass all that difficult practice/relearning stage… the hard way… and then changing unwanted habits and behaviours becomes easy… an automatic process.
It is a method of controlling or breaking a habit in a quick, easy and effortless way and regaining control of our lives. And when hypnotherapy is done correctly, that’s exactly what happens.
So where do habits come from? Let’s look at smoking. Many people tried smoking in their younger days because it was ‘cool’ or for some other ‘feel good’ reason. They did it consciously and battled through the coughing and spluttering – the awful taste – and then they kept repeating this behaviour until the unconscious mind said okay… I’ve got it… I’ll make this an automatic habit for you.
And the unconscious mind programmed it in as a ‘feel good’ habit because at the time, that’s what it was… it was “cool” or you felt part of a group, or you believed it relaxed you. And from that moment onwards you became a smoker.
Now you can tell yourself consciously “I will not smoke, I will not smoke, I will not smoke” but you find yourself desperately wanting to reach out for a cigarette because the conscious mind is the thinking part of the mind but the unconscious mind is the feeling emotional part of the mind… and it runs the show.
The unconscious mind is much larger, much stronger and far more powerful… it’s your survival mechanism. And your feelings (emotions) will always over-ride your conscious thoughts unless you elicit tremendous will-power.
Therefore, it is a simple fact that when you try making changes consciously, it is difficult because the unconscious mind holds the power and it will keep running the programmed behaviour – in this case, smoking because it is programmed in as a “feel good” habit.
The reason hypnotherapy is so powerful in changing unconscious habits and behaviours, is because you do not have to consciously try over and over again to think a certain way or to behave a certain way. Hypnotherapy speaks directly to the unconscious mind so the change is instantaneous – automatic. It makes it easy and effortless… and it makes it permanent.
So now that we know that hypnotherapy is a totally normal and natural everyday occurring state where you’re totally safe and in totally in control, the question is, does hypnotherapy really work? The answer is a definite yes.
So as you can now see, during a therapeutic hypnotherapy session, you and the hypnotherapist are working together toward the same positive outcome. This is the reason we tailor our programs so carefully for each individual and the reason we maintain such a high level of success.
What makes our practice so unique is the advanced processes and innovative techniques we use to address the individual requirements of each client. We conduct a free first session to talk about your particular challenge and see if we are indeed able to help and, if not, we will gladly refer you to the appropriate professional.
Many studies, conducted over long periods of time, have proven the success of hypnotherapy and, modern technology is now actually scientifically able to monitor its effectiveness. So it certainly works and not only that, we have, over time, actually improved it. Our advanced hypnotherapy techniques are achieving phenomenal success in many different areas… and normally in just one session.

A Simple 7-Minute Workout System that Really Works!
Posted on June 7, 2014 by ihbPT
A Simple 7-Minute Workout System that Really Works!
A healthy lifestyle includes exercise but it does NOT have to be a gruelling 1-hour session. Do you really think that “core” exercises and spin classes can change your body faster than resistance training adopted by world class athletes around the world?
Have you ever watched people in the gym sweating away in an aerobics class or pumping weights for hours on end… do their body shapes REALLY change… even after months of working out? Statistics reveal that only ½ of 1% of gym-goers and exercisers make any significant body transformation over a YEAR.
What about those who participate in age-increasing forms of exercise like running, cycling or boot camps. Watch them… do their bodies really change that much? Not from what I have observed… but I do know one thing… the acid build-up in their bodies from these types of exercise with rapidly age them.
We have been misled or just plain lied to. Look at all the second-hand gym equipment bought from magazine or late night infomercial hype lying around in peoples’ garages. Many people believe in the saying “no pain… no gain” but it is just not true… you do not have to work out longer and harder.
So what is missing?
Targeted muscle resistance training and simple diet changes are the keys to getting the sculpted body you have always wanted… it’s that simple. Forget the hype, you only have to work out 7-minutes a day but that exercise needs to be targeted to different muscle groups.
The real key here though is providing enough recovery time… 5-10 days before working on that group of muscles again. And don’t be fooled into thinking that working on your calf muscles doesn’t help your abs or hips… it does!
The 7-minute workout was developed by a former world class body builder and world martial arts champion, who has also trained three additional world champions, so this system really does work regardless of your age or present fitness level.
Here is an invite to their private Facebook group page where you can see people from all walks of life sharing their body sculpting results: http://www.fbgroupinvite.com/30_day_challenge/?id=Synergy
There is no obligation just an opportunity for you to see real life results from people of all ages and walks of life getting stunning results. Want to lose weight? Then join the 30-day challenge… lose 20 pounds (9kg) in 30-days doing just 7-minutes per day! http://www.fbgroupinvite.com/30_day_challenge/?id=Synergy

What is a Biological FAT Switch and How Do We Turn it Off?
Posted on May 13, 2014 by ihbPT
What is a Biological FAT Switch and How Do We Turn it Off?
Our body’s biology is programmed to use fat to protect us and, even though we may not be in imminent danger, threatened by famine or enduring freezing temperatures in our daily lives, there are a vast variety of modern day emotional stress factors that can trigger that FAT switch.
Environmental stresses, stress in our workplace, and stress in our relationships all trigger our ancestral survival trigger… and we put on weight to protect ourselves from the perceived danger.
This FAT SWITCH is part of our genetic programming that we inherited from our hunter and gatherer ancestors. And when our subconscious mind switches the fat switch on, no diet or exercise program, drug or pill we try will help us lose weight and keep it off… at least not in the long term.
This is why programs that advocate gruelling exercise like “The Biggest Loser” and Boot Camps inadvertently fail… because they DO NOT address the underlying issue, which is emotional NOT physical. Not that there is anything wrong with exercise, it IS important to maintain an active lifestyle but we need to address the underlying problem first.
So how do we switch the FAT switch off? In order to turn the fat switch off we need to reprogram our subconscious mind so we can eliminate the emotional stresses that are keeping us trapped. When we do that, our subconscious mind will automatically switch the FAT switch off, and our bodies will naturally shed weight. We will crave less “bad” food and crave more nutritious food, our metabolism will naturally speed up, and our bodies become very efficient at burning fat.
Find out more about how to switch off the fat switch with a free 3-day e-course here: http://innerhealthblog.com/goto/zeroweight.html. Your journey to the body and life you deserve starts today.

Weight Loss Weight Gain Emotional Stress Triggers
Posted on April 13, 2014 by ihbPT
When you look for the reason why you are struggling with weight loss you may or may not find it, but even if you do, it won’t change anything. All it will do is make you feel bad about it and at the same time add a little more anxiety and stress to your life each time you think about it, which ultimately leads to more weight gain or loss in the case of anorexia.
You see the trap many people fall into, once they find out “WHY” they struggle with weight-loss or weight gain, are they get to label their condition and, can opt out doing anything about it. They say things like I can’t help it because:
I am a diabetic
I’ve inherited a fat gene
I’m just naturally thin
I’m big-boned so am naturally over-weight
I have a slow metabolism so that’s why I can’t lose weight
I have a fast metabolism that’s why I can’t gain weight
I was rejected.
I was abused.
I was abandoned
I ………………. (fill in the blank)
Now while all these conditions may be true, they cannot free you. In fact they keep you trapped in a vicious circle by reinforcing your belief system that you cannot do anything about it and many of the drug companies and even support groups attest to this… but the truth is you can!
Recent research is showing that the reason many people cannot lose weight or gain weight (anorexia) lies in emotional stress triggers. They are carrying an emotional trigger (or triggers) that prevent them from gaining or losing weight.
And most people struggling with weight issues are not consciously aware of this emotional stress trigger… because it is buried deep in the subconscious mind. It could have been some event (major or minor) that happened many years ago or even in childhood and your mind created this trigger to protect you.
At the time when this emotional trigger was created it was the only way your subconscious mind could protect you from the threat (real or imagined) and it was the correct decision at that time. However the issue is… your subconscious correct decision made in the past is not the necessarily the right decision for today… and so now the past solution has become the present problem… and your subconscious mind, not your conscious mind, runs the show.
This subconscious conditioning, of solutions to past problems, which were right at the time, are the cause of new problems and blockages… in all areas of life… health, weight, relationships, stress, anxiety, depression, mental health, spiritual development… and the list goes on.
Many people believe that pure willpower or positive affirmations will solve their problem, and it may… for a little while… but you will soon slip back into the old patterns. This is because the subconscious mind (remember it runs the show, not your conscious mind) needs to be re-programmed, and to do this you must bypass the “inner gatekeeper” that protects it.
This is why positive thinking and a lot of programs like “The Biggest Loser” and “Boot Camps” tend to fail… , it wasn’t through a lack of commitment and desire to change… something was missing from the formula. They focus on the conscious mind or the physical body and are not addressing the real problem… the subconscious emotional blockage.
Yes exercise is an important of a healthy lifestyle but is not the be all and end all of weight loss and, if done excessively (over-exercising), can become a problem of its own… what is the emotional trigger behind over-exercising or the obsession with bulking up and poisoning the body with weight-gain supplements?
Most diet and weight loss programs rely on external motivation and that’s exactly why they fail… it’s not your fault… you have just being given the wrong recipe.
Thankfully there’s a simple weight loss or rather emotional weight release method you can learn which is designed to erase practically any dysfunctional emotional behaviour pattern. Visualise having the capability to eliminate any kind of detrimental block which is preventing you realizing what you desire in every area of your life, and living the lifestyle you always desired.
This approach is NOT yet another self-help technique… it is a subconscious mind paradigm shift method that enables you to clear away the memories, encounters and self-limiting belief systems which have trapped you inside a self-defeating and self-destructing sequence… and get rid of them permanently!
Perhaps you have sensed that maybe you might be self-sabotaging your life but cannot comprehend exactly why? If you responded yes to the above question then this unique training course is designed for you. This is NOT a weight-loss or diet program but a emotional weight release solution.
Discover how you can release unwanted fat out of your life straight away and remove it permanently… imagine never needing to shed weight ever again!
Discover the everlasting formula that will finally end staying on a diet regime once and for all…
Expose the genuine root cause of your current lack of ability to shed weight and the reason why it’s actually not your fault…
We refer to this method as the zero resistance weight release solution and it works on the subconscious and emotional level, and that is the location where the genuine challenge with gaining weight exists.
The actual difference between you and your optimal bodyweight is related to your current emotionally charged fat survival switch… it’s actually a mind body relationship.
The true secret to getting rid of unwanted weight resides in the psychological, emotive and spiritual stress triggers, and weight loss is usually simple and easy once you deal with these kinds of activators.
You need to understand precisely why these triggers keep your fat survival button on and, you must learn the way to switch those triggers off!
When you get this approach correct the remainder is easy and you simply won’t believe how rapidly you’re going to get positive weight loss effects.
Diet plans are not effective and will never ever work until this switch is off and, in order to accomplish that we have to align the subconscious and conscious minds. Absolutely no dieting will be necessary when you get this alignment right; you are going to lose weight easily, effectively and effortlessly.
