Noninsertional achilles tendinopathy treated with gastrocnemius lengthening.
Duthon VB, Lübbeke A, Duc SR, Stern R, Assal M.
Foot Ankle Int. 2011 Apr;32(4):375-9.
BACKGROUND:
Surgery is frequently considered an option for refractory, symptomatic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy. Gastrocnemius equinus can result in mechanical overload of the Achilles tendon and may be a factor in its etiology. Our hypothesis was that reducing load transmission to the Achilles tendon by gastrocnemius lengthening (Strayer procedure) may be an effective treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
A prospective case series of all patients with a minimum 1-year symptomatic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy who underwent gastrocnemius lengthening was evaluated before surgery, and at 1 and 2 years after surgery. There were 14 patients (17 tendons).
RESULTS:
One year after surgery, the median American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score was 100 points, as compared to 71 points preoperatively (p < 0.001). The median total Foot Function Index (FFI) decreased significantly from 39 to 12 points at 1 year (p < 0.001) and remained stable (12 points) at 2 years. An electronic goniometer recorded a mean gain in ankle dorsiflexion of 13 degrees. At 1 year after surgery the MRI in all eight patients (ten tendons) with a preoperative MRI demonstrated a decrease in signal hyperintensity and tendon size, signifying an improvement of the tendinopathy. At 2 years after surgery, patient satisfaction assessment revealed that all but one patient was satisfied with the result and 11 of the 14 (79%) patients were able to resume their previous sporting activities. There were no complications.
CONCLUSION:
Gastrocnemius lengthening was an effective treatment for chronic Achilles noninsertional tendinopathy. Two-year results show good to excellent clinical outcome.

Safety and outcome of surgical debridement of insertional Achilles tendinopathy using a transverse (Cincinnati) incision
N. Maffulli et al
Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - British Volume, Vol 93-B, Issue 11, 1503-1507.
This is a prospective analysis on 30 physically active individuals with a mean age of 48.9 years (35 to 64) with chronic insertional tendinopathy of the tendo Achillis. Using a transverse incision, the tendon was debrided and an osteotomy of the posterosuperior corner of the calcaneus was performed in all patients. At a minimum post-operative follow-up of three years, the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment scale – Achilles tendon scores were significantly improved compared to the baseline status. In two patients a superficial infection of the wound developed which resolved on antibiotics. There were no other wound complications, no nerve related complications, and no secondary avulsions of the tendo Achillis. In all, 26 patients had returned to their pre-injury level of activity and the remaining four modified their sporting activity. At the last appointment, the mean pain threshold and the mean post-operative tenderness were also significantly improved from the baseline (p < 0.001). In patients with insertional tendo Achillis a transverse incision allows a wide exposure and adequate debridement of the tendo Achillis insertion, less soft-tissue injury from aggressive retraction and a safe osteotomy of the posterosuperior corner of the calcaneum.

Treatment of Chronic Noninsertional Achilles Tendinopathy With Endoscopic Achilles Tendon Debridement and Flexor Hallucis Longus Transfer
Tun Hing Lui
Foot Ankle Spec March 5, 2012
Decompression with debridement has been shown to be effective in pain management in patients with chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy; however, augmentation with the flexor hallucis longus tendon can provide additional mechanical support. The technique of endoscopic debridement of the tendinopathic tendon together with flexor hallucis longus transfer is described to treat patients suffering from chronic painful noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy with the potential advantage of minimally invasive surgery.

Achilles tendinoscopy and plantaris tendon release and division in the treatment of non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy
Christopher J. Pearce et al
Foot and Ankle Surgery Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 124–127
Background
The mainstay of treatment for non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy is non-operative, however a proportion of patients will fail conservative measures. We describe the results of Achilles tendinoscopy with plantaris tendon release in patients who have failed first line conservative treatment for at least 6 months.
Methods
A consecutive series of 11 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow up.
Results
The mean AOFAS scores significantly improved from 68 pre-op to 92 post op (p = 0.0002) as did the AOS scores for both pain (28% pre-op to 8% post op (p = 0.0004)) and disability (38% pre-op to 10% post op (p = 0.0005). The mean SF-36 scores also improved but were not statistically significant (pre-op 76, post op 87 (p = 0.059). There were no complications. 8 of the 11 patients were satisfied, the other 3 somewhat satisfied.
Conclusions
The results of Achilles tendinoscopy and division of the plantaris tendon are encouraging but further studies are required to compare it to other treatments. It is minimally invasive and low risk so should not affect the ability to perform a formal open procedure if unsuccessful.

Achilles Tendon Reattachment after Surgical Treatment of Insertional Tendinosis Using the Suture Bridge Technique: A Case Series
Bryan L. Witt, Christopher F. Hyer
Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery, in press
Achilles tendinopathy is a clinical diagnosis characterized as a triad of symptoms including pain, swelling, and impaired performance of the diseased tendon. Achilles tendinopathy is divided into Achilles tendonitis and tendinosis based on histopathological examination. Achilles tendinosis is viewed microscopically as disorganized collagen, abnormal neovascularization, necrosis, and mucoid degeneration. Insertional Achilles tendinosis is a degenerative process of the tendon at the junction of the tendon and calcaneus. This disease is initially treated conservatively with activity modification, custom orthotic devices, heel lifts, and immobilization. After 3 to 6 months of conservative therapy has failed to alleviate symptoms, surgical management is indicated. Surgical management of insertional Achilles tendinosis includes Achilles tendon debridement, calcaneal exostosis ostectomy, and retrocalcaneal bursa excision. In this case series, we present 4 patients who underwent surgical management of insertional Achilles tendinosis with complete tendon detachment. All patients underwent reattachment of the Achilles tendon with the suture bridge technique. The Arthrex SutureBridge® (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, FL) device uses a series of 4 suture anchors and FiberWire® (Arthrex Inc.) to reattach the Achilles tendon to its calcaneal insertion. This hourglass pattern of FiberWire® provides a greater area of tendon compression, consequently allowing greater stability and possible earlier return to weight-bearing activities. The patients were followed up for approximately 2 years’ duration. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. At final follow-up there was no evidence of Achilles tendon ruptures or device failures. All patients were able to return to their activities of daily living without the use of assistive devices. The patients’ average visual analog pain scale was 1 (range 0 to 4), and their average foot functional index score was 3.41 (range 0 to 10.71). The suture bridge technique is a viable option for Achilles tendon repair after surgical management of insertional Achilles tendinosis.

Fixation of the Achilles Tendon Insertion Using Suture Button Technology
Nathan J. Fanter et al
Am J Sports Med July 16, 2012
Background: In the operative treatment of Achilles insertional tendinopathy, no guidelines exist concerning which form of fixation of the Achilles tendon insertion is superior.
Hypothesis: Transcalcaneal drill pin passage does not place any major plantar structures at risk, and the addition of a Krackow stitch and suture button to the fixation technique provides a significant increase in ultimate load to failure in Achilles tendon insertional repairs.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: The Achilles tendon insertions in 6 fresh-frozen cadaveric ankles were detached, and transcalcaneal drill pins were passed. Plantar dissection took place to evaluate the drill pin relationship to the plantar fascia, lateral plantar nerve and artery, flexor digitorum longus tendon, and master knot of Henry. The Achilles tendons were then repaired with a double-row suture anchor construct alone or with a suture button and Krackow stitch added to the double-row suture anchor construct. The repairs were then tested to maximum load to failure at 20 mm/min. The mode of failure was recorded, and the mean maximum load to failure was assessed using the Student t test for distributions with equal variance.
Results: Transcalcaneal drill pin passage did not place any selected anatomic structures at risk. The mean maximum load to failure for the suture bridge group was 239.2 N; it was 391.4 N for the group with the suture button (P = .014). The lateral plantar artery was the structure placed at greatest risk from drill pin placement, with a mean distance of 22.7 mm (range, 16.5-29.2 mm) between the pin and artery.
Conclusion: In this laboratory study, transcalcaneal drill pin passage appeared to be anatomically safe, and the use of suture button technology with a Krackow stitch for Achilles tendon insertional repair significantly increased repair strength.
Clinical Relevance: Achilles tendon insertional repair with suture button fixation and a Krackow stitch may facilitate the earlier institution of postoperative rehabilitation and improve clinical outcomes.

Single-row Versus Double-row Repair of the Distal Achilles Tendon: A Biomechanical Comparison
Holly Pilson, MD, Philip Brown, MS, Joel Stitzel, PhD, Aaron Scott, MD
Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery; Article in Press
Surgery for recalcitrant insertional Achilles tendinopathy often consists of partial or total release of the insertion site, debridement of the diseased portion of the tendon, calcaneal ostectomy, and reattachment of the Achilles to the calcaneus. Although single-row and double-row techniques exist for repair of the detached Achilles tendon, biomechanical data are lacking to support one technique over the other. Based on data extrapolated from the study of rotator cuff repairs, we hypothesized that a double-row construct would provide superior fixation strength over a single-row repair. Eighteen human cadaveric Achilles tendons (9 matched pairs) with attached calcanei were repaired with single-row or double-row techniques. Specimens were mounted in a servohydraulic materials testing machine, subjected to a preconditioning cycle, and loaded to failure. Failure was defined as suture breakage or pullout, midsubstance tendon rupture, or anchor pullout. Among the failures were 12 suture failures, 5 proximal-row anchor failures, and 1 distal-row anchor failure. No midsubstance tendon ruptures or testing apparatus failures were observed. There were no statistically significant differences in the peak load to failure between the single-row and double-row repairs (p = .46). Similarly, no significant differences were observed with regards to mean energy expenditure to failure (p = .069). The present study demonstrated no biomechanical advantages of the double-row repair over a single-row repair. Despite the lack of a clear biomechanical advantage, there may exist clinical advantages of a double-row repair, such as reduction in knot prominence and restoration of the Achilles footprint.

US AND DOPPLER-GUIDED SURGICAL TREATMENT BASED ON IMMUNO-HISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS IN MIDPORTION ACHILLES TENDINOPATHY SHOWS GOOD CLINICAL RESULTS AND FAST RETURN TO ACTIVITY
H Alfredson, G Andersson, L Backman, J Bagge, P Danielson, and S Forsgren.
2nd International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium; Vancouver Sept 27-29 2012
INTRODUCTION
Treatment of midportion Achilles tendinopathy has been known to be difficult. Recent ultrasound(US) and Doppler(CD) findings (high blood flow outside ventral tendon), together with results of immuno-histochemical analyses (marked presence of blood vessels accompanied by nerve fascicles in the ventral peritendinous tissue) have led to new treatment approaches like sclerosing polidocanol injections, where US and CD-guided injections in the region with high blood flow and nerves outside the tendon have shown good results. However, for satisfying pain relief multiple injection treatments were often needed. Therefore, based on the same principles as for the sclerosing injections, a more radical and one stage mini-surgical procedure has been invented.
METHODS
107 patients (66 men, 41 women), mean age 43 years (range 24-77), with tendinosis in 125 Achilles tendons were, in local anaesthesia, treated with a US+CD-guided new surgical approach outside the ventral tendon. Pain during tendon loading activity (VAS) and satisfaction with treatment, were evaluated.
RESULTS
Before surgery, the mean VAS was 77. After surgery (follow up mean 18 months, range 6-33) the mean VAS was 2 in 111 tendons (89%) from satisfied patients back in full Achilles tendon loading activity.
CONCLUSIONS
US+CD-guided scraping/tenolysis in the region with rich vascularity and innervation outside the ventral tendon show good short term clinical results in midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Ultrasound-guided dry needling and percutaneous paratenon decompression for chronic achilles tendinopathy
A Yeo, N Kendall and S Jayaraman
J Bone Joint Surg Br 2012 vol. 94-B no. SUPP XXXIX 56
Introduction Chronic Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury. There are several modalities of treatment, reflecting difficulties in its management. In particular, due to the well-recognised morbidity associated with surgical decompression, treatment has steered towards a less invasive route.
Dry needling has been efficacious in managing other tendinopathies. This study therefore assessed dry needling and percutaneous hydrostatic decompression of the Achilles tendon as a novel treatment for this condition.
Methods Twenty-two patients with 27 sonographically-confirmed chronic Achilles tendinopathy were prospectively enrolled. All were symptomatic for >6 months and have failed alternative conservative treatments.
Ultrasound-guided dry needling of neovascular areas and paratenon hydrostatic decompression was performed by a dedicated musculoskeletal radiologist on a 6-weekly basis until symptomatic resolution or no improvement was evident. Sonographic assessment of the tendon's thickness and neovascularity was undertaken. Following treatment, a standardized physiotherapy regime was adopted. At baseline and 6 weeks post-final procedure, visual analogue scores (VAS) at rest and during activity were obtained. Telephonic interviews were carried out 12 and 24 months post-treatment.
Results 24 tendons (in 19 patients) were successfully treated - 1 patient had spontaneous symptomatic resolution and 2 progressed to surgical intervention. The mean number of treatment sessions was 2. There was no significant change in neovascularity or tendon thickness after treatment.
Therapeutic intervention led to a significant improvement in VAS at rest (42 v 18.4, p=0.0005) and during activity (74 v 33.7, p< 0.0001). At 12 months, 77% of patients were >80% satisfied with their outcome of the procedure, with 85% of patients able to return to their sporting interests. At 24 months, 90% of patients were >80% satisfied with their outcome, with nearly half having complete symptomatic resolution.
Conclusion Dry needling and percutaneous paratenon decompression under ultrasound guidance shows promise as an alternative treatment for this chronic condition.

Unilateral surgical treatment for patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy may result in bilateral recovery
Håkan Alfredson, Christoph Spang, Sture Forsgren
Br J Sports Med doi:10.1136/bjsports-2012-091399
Background Bilateral midportion Achilles tendinopathy/tendinosis is not unusual, and treatment of both sides is often carried out. Experiments in animals suggest of the potential involvement of central neuronal mechanisms in Achilles tendinosis.
Objectives To evaluate the outcome of surgery for Achilles tendinopathy.
Methods This observational study included 13 patients (7 men and 6 women, mean age 53 years) with a long duration (6–120 months) of chronic painful bilateral midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The most painful side at the time for investigation was selected to be operated on first. Treatment was ultrasound-guided and Doppler-guided scraping procedure outside the ventral part of the tendon under local anaesthetic. The patients started walking on the first day after surgery. Follow-ups were conducted and the primary outcome was pain by visual analogue scale. In an additional part of the study, specimens from Achilles and plantaris tendons in three patients with bilateral Achilles tendinosis were examined.
Results Short-term follow-ups showed postoperative improvement on the non-operated side as well as the operated side in 11 of 13 patients. Final follow-up after 37 (mean) months showed significant pain relief and patient satisfaction on both sides for these 11 patients. In 2 of 13 patients operation on the other, initially non-operated side, was instituted due to persisting pain. Morphologically, it was found that there were similar morphological effects, and immunohistochemical patterns of enzyme involved in signal substance production, bilaterally.
Conclusion Unilateral treatment with a scraping operation can have benefits contralaterally; the clinical implication is that unilateral surgery may be a logical first treatment in cases of bilateral Achilles tendinopathy.

Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon Transfer in Treatment of Achilles Tendinosis
Lew C. Schon; Jennifer L. Shores; Frances D. Faro; Anand M. Vora; Lyn M. Camire; Gregory P. Guyton
J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2013 Jan 02;95(1):54-60.
Background:
In patients with Achilles tendinosis, Achilles tendon debridement can be supplemented with flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer. Outcomes have not been studied prospectively in older, sedentary, and overweight patients.
Methods:
Fifty-eight consecutive limbs in fifty-six consecutive older, sedentary patients with insertional or midsubstance Achilles tendinosis were enrolled prospectively and underwent the procedure. Ten patients were lost to follow-up, leaving forty-eight limbs in forty-six patients available for evaluation after twenty-four months.
Results:
The forty-six patients who were included in the study had an average age of 54 ± 10 years with an average body mass index of 33.8 ± 6.8 kg/m2. Significant improvement was observed between baseline and twenty-four months in terms of the visual analog scale for overall pain intensity (6.7 ± 2.3 versus 0.8 ± 2.0; p < 0.001), the Short Form-36 physical score (34.3 ± 8.0 versus 49.0 ± 9.3; p < 0.001), the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale pain (54.4 ± 19.2 versus 1.9 ± 2.7; p < 0.001) and dysfunction (62.6 ± 21.4 versus 11.0 ± 24.2; p < 0.001) subscale scores, and performance of a single-leg heel rise (1.9 ± 3.0 versus 7.3 ± 2.7 cm; p < 0.001). Significant improvement compared with baseline was observed at three or six months except in the single-leg heel rise. Improvements in terms of pain and function occurred over twenty-four months, with the most improvement occurring in the first twelve months. At twenty-four months, maximum gastrocnemius circumference was significantly less in the involved compared with the uninvolved leg (40.2 ± 5.1 versus 41.2 ± 4.8 cm; p < 0.001). The mean passive range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint decreased from 85.1° ± 25.3° preoperatively to 68.1° ± 36.7° (a 20% change) at six months (p = 0.03). Most patients reported no hallux weakness (57%; twenty-six of forty-six patients) and no loss of balance due to hallux weakness (76%; thirty-five of forty-six patients). Postoperative peroneal tendinitis was observed in seven patients. Complications included deep-vein thrombosis (two patients), superficial infection or delayed wound-healing (six), scar pain (four), and early disruption of the reconstruction due to a fall (one).
Conclusions:
Surgical debridement of the Achilles tendon with flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer was associated with significant improvement in terms of Achilles tendon function, physical function, and pain intensity in a group of relatively inactive, older, overweight patients. When present, hallux weakness had minimal functional sequelae.

Intermediate and Long-Term Outcomes of the Suture Bridge Technique for the Management of Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy
Robert M. Greenhagen, Andrew B. Shinabarger, Kyle T. Pearson, Patrick R. Burns
Foot Ankle Spec January 24, 2013
Introduction. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is a problem frequently encountered by the foot and ankle surgeon. Conservative care yields mixed results, and this condition is often treated surgically. Our hypothesis is that the suture bridge technique through a central posterior incision allows adequate visualization for thorough debridement and exostectomy and provides a stable tendon-to-bone interface for healing. Material and Methods. The medical records of 35 patients who underwent surgical treatment for insertional Achilles tendinopathy with the suture bridge technique, by a single surgeon, between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot instruments as well as a subjective questionnaire were utilized. Results. In all, 30 individuals who met the inclusion criteria for the treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 28.93 ± 16.99 months. We included 10 men and 20 women, with a mean age of 49.1 ± 9.2 years. The mean preoperative AOFAS score was 56.6 ± 14.0. The average postoperative AOFAS score significantly increased to 91.7 ± 10.4 (P < .0001). One participant required revisional surgery, consisting of a flexor hallucis longus transfer performed by another physician. There were no wound complications or infections. Overall, there was a 97% (28/29) satisfaction rate. Conclusion. The central incision with complete detachment of the Achilles tendon and reattachment with the suture bridge technique for the treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy provides an effective treatment with good to excellent clinical outcomes in 97% of patients, with a mean follow-up of 29 months.

Gastrocnemius Recession for Chronic Noninsertional Achilles Tendinopathy.
Kiewiet NJ, Holthusen SM, Bohay DR, Anderson JG.
Foot Ankle Int. 2013 Feb 11.
Background:In patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy, several operative techniques have been described for treatment. A case report has shown that gastrocnemius recession as treatment can normalize MRI findings and relieve clinical symptoms consistent with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The purpose of this study was to present the results of the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy with gastrocnemius recession.
Methods:Of 12 patients, 8 (7 females, 1 male) who underwent gastrocnemius recession for refractory Achilles tendinopathy between July 2004 and January 2009 were available for follow-up. All patients filled out a SF-36 health survey, a foot function index, an AOFAS ankle and hindfoot scale, and a simple survey formulated by our group of investigators. Of the 8 patients, 7 were available to return for clinical assessment. Patients had an average age of 49.9 years (SD = 11.6) at the time of surgery and average time of follow-up was 34.6 months (SD = 18.1).
Results:The mean pain score (VAS 0-10 scale) significantly decreased from 7.3 (SD = 1.7) preoperatively to 1 (SD = 1.8) postoperatively at the time of follow-up (P < .001). The mean AOFAS ankle and hindfoot score was 94.4 (SD = 9.8), which was significantly improved when compared with previously published scores for patients who underwent Achilles debridement with FHL transfer (P = .007). All 8 categories on the SF-36 health survey showed no significant difference with published data for US population values and previously published data for patients who underwent FHL transfer.
Conclusion:Gastrocnemius recession for the treatment of refractory Achilles tendinopathy was a viable treatment option following the failure of nonoperative management. All 8 of our patients had excellent pain relief, good clinical outcome, and were satisfied at the time of follow-up.

Results of proximal medial gastrocnemius release in patients with Achilles tendinopathy
S Gurdezi, J Kohls-Gatzoulis and M Solan
Bone Joint J 2013 vol. 95-B no. SUPP 1 11
Background Most patients with Achilles tendinopathy (AT) are treated successfully with physiotherapy ie eccentric calf training. In some patients gastrocnemius contracture persists. Three other publications have reported improvement in AT following gastrocnemius release, but this is the first series of patients to have proximal medial gastrocnemius release (PMGR) for AT. The purpose of this study was to review patients with refractory non-insertional and insertional AT treated by PMGR with a minimum followup of 18 months.
Method Sixteen PMGRs were performed over a two year period. Nine patients (10 PMGRs) were available for followup. The mean age of patients was 45 (Range, 25 to 63) years, with five female and four male subjects. The average followup period was 2.5 (range, 1.7 to 3.3) years. The sample was divided into non-insertional and insertional tendinopathy, with five PMGRs per group. Outcome measures were VAS scores, VISA-A scores, AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score and overall satisfaction. Complications and further procedures were also recorded.
Results At an average of 2.5 years follow-up, two-thirds of patients were highly satisfied. The non-insertional tendinopathy group enjoyed better results than the insertional group: mean improvement in VISA-A scores were 59% (non-insertional) vs 22% (insertional); mean AOFAS scores improved by 29% (non-insertional) vs 15% (insertional). The improvement in the non-insertional group was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in all three outcome measures. Our findings further support that insertional tendinopathy is more resistant to calf stretching/lengthening treatments.
Conclusion In contrast to open or percutaneous debridement of the Achilles tendon, PMGR is a day surgical procedure that is well tolerated with excellent wound healing. Patients with non-insertional tendinopathy who have failed conservative treatment can expect significant improvement with VISA-A scores normalising after the procedure. We recommend PMGR for patients suffering recalcitrant non-insertional AT in whom gastrocnemius contracture persists despite an eccentric stretching program.

Surgical Treatment of Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy: Long-Term Results of the Endoscopic Technique
Javier Maquirriain
Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery; Article in Press
Surgery has long been established as a valid alternative for chronic Achilles tendinopathies that have failed conservative treatment. Endoscopic procedures have shown satisfactory preliminary results for managing such injuries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of endoscopic surgery in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We evaluated 27 endoscopic procedures in 24 patients (mean age 45.5 ± 8.9 years; 12 males and 12 females) with chronic Achilles tendinopathy and at least 5 (mean 7.7, range 5 to 14) years of follow-up. All ambulatory procedures consisted of paratenon debridement and longitudinal tenotomies. The clinical evaluation included 2 specific functional rating systems (the Achilles Tendon Scoring System and the Victorian Institute Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire) and a pain visual analog scale. Patient satisfaction with the procedure was assessed using a patient global assessment response to therapy Likert scale score. All patients had an improved clinical outcome at the final follow-up visit. Both scoring systems showed significant improvement in all clinical outcomes at the last follow-up visit. The Victorian Institute Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire score had improved from 37.0 ± 4.9 points preoperatively to 97.5 ± 12.1 points postoperatively (p = .0006). The Achilles Tendon Scoring System score had improved from 32.6 ± 13.1 points preoperatively to 97.2 ± 12.3 points postoperatively (p = .000006). The pain visual analog scale score averaged 0.2 ± 1.1, and the patient global assessment response to therapy score was 0.25 ± 0.71. The percentage of patients with an excellent patient global assessment response to therapy score was 85.1%. Two postoperative problems were reported (7.4%): a delayed keloid lesion and a seroma with chronic fistula. The infection rate and systemic complication rate were 0%. In conclusion, endoscopic surgery provided a high rate of excellent long-term results in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Debridement of the paratenon and crural fascia, along with longitudinal tenotomies, using a minimally invasive procedure provided completely resolution of symptoms at 7 years postoperatively in 96% of patients in the present consecutive series.

Biomechanical Properties of Double- and Single-Row Suture Anchor Repair for Surgical Treatment of Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy.
Beitzel K, Mazzocca AD, Obopilwe E, Boyle JW, McWilliam J, Rincon L, Dhar Y, Arciero RA, Amendola A.
Am J Sports Med. 2013 May 3.
BACKGROUND:Because of intratendinous ossifications, retrocalcaneal bursitis, or intratendinous necrosis commonly found in insertional tendinosis, it is often necessary to detach the tendon partially or entirely from its tendon-to-bone junction. HYPOTHESIS ouble-row repair for insertional Achilles tendinopathy will generate an increased contact area and demonstrate higher biomechanical stability. STUDY DESIGN:Controlled laboratory study. METHODS:Eighteen cadaver Achilles tendons were split longitudinally and detached, exposing the calcaneus; an ostectomy was performed and the tendon was reattached to the calcaneus in 1 of 2 ways: 2 suture anchors (single row) or a 4-anchor (double row) construct. Footprint area measurements over time, displacement after cyclic loading (2000 cycles), and final load to failure were measured. RESULTS:The double-row refixation technique was statistically superior to the single-row technique in footprint area measurement initially and 5 minutes after repair (P = .009 and P = .01, respectively) but not after 24 hours (P = .713). The double-row construct demonstrated significantly improved measures for peak load (433.9 ± 84.3 N vs 212.0 ± 49.7 N; P = .042), load at yield (354.7 ± 106.2 N vs 198.7 ± 39.5 N; P = .01), and slope (51.8 ± 9.9 N/mm vs 66.7 ± 16.2 N/mm; P = .021). Cyclic loading did not demonstrate significant differences between the 2 constructs. CONCLUSION ouble-row construct for reinsertion of a completely detached Achilles tendon using proximal and distal rows resulted in significantly larger contact area initially and 5 minutes after repair and led to significantly higher peak load to failure on destructive testing. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:In treatment for insertional Achilles tendinosis, the tendon often has to be detached and anatomically reattached to its insertion at the calcaneus. To our knowledge there is a lack of biomechanical studies supporting either a number or a pattern of suture anchor fixation. Because the stresses going across the insertion site of the Achilles tendon are significant during rehabilitation and weightbearing activities, it is imperative to have a strong construct that allows satisfactory healing during the early postoperative process.

TOPAZ RADIOFREQUENCY MICRO-DEBRIDEMENT FOR ACHILLES TENDINOSIS
I. Basu, et al
Bone Joint J 2013 vol. 95-B no. SUPP 19 31
Introduction Achilles tendinosis results from a chronic degenerative process within the tendon. Topaz micro-debridement aims to restore the degenerate micro-architecture within the tendon reducing painful symptoms experienced by patients. Topaz micro-debridement has been used to successfully treat upper limb tendinopathies but its application to tendinopathies of the foot and ankle is relatively new. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes following topaz radiofrequency micro-debridement for Achilles tendinosis.
Materials/Methods All cases of topaz micro-debridement for Achilles tendinosis were identified from hospital records spanning a five year period. VISA-A assessment questionnaires were sent to these patients to assess the patients functional status pre and post-surgery. Patients were asked to comment on their overall satisfaction and to report any complications they had experienced. Eight responses were received and included in analysis. Hospital records and imaging results were investigated for those that responded.
Results Average VISA-A scores improved from 18/100 to 63/100. The difference between the pre and post-surgery group was significant at the 0.02% level. All cases demonstrated objective improvement in functional outcome. Seven cases reported overall satisfaction but one was complicated by Achilles tendon rupture seven weeks following the procedure. This is the second reported case of rupture noted in current literature.
Conclusion This study confirms topaz micro-debridement is an excellent treatment for Achilles tendinosis, but that rupture is a real risk which persists for at least two months following the procedure. We would therefore recommend the procedure with a suitable period of rehabilitation to ensure full recovery.

SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR MIDPORTION ACHILLES TENDINOPATHY- A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
Sina David, Tanja Nauk, Heinz Lohrer
Br J Sports Med 2013;47:e3
Background Purpose of this systematic review was (i) to provide means of judgement to assess the benefits and tradeoffs related with different surgical treatments for midportion Achilles tendinopathy and (ii) to highlight possible alternative treatments for Achilles tendinopathy in cases when conservative treatments fail to reach patient satisfaction.
Methods To identify studies about surgical treatment of patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database and Google databases (1945 till November 2012) were searched. After excluding several articles due to our selection criteria, the remaining articles were analyzed and evaluated using the Coleman Methodology Score. Additionally, success rate and the complication rate were determined.
Results Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. These reports evaluated five different operative techniques. A total of 353 tendons were treated in 347 patients with open or minimally invasive techniques. The mean patient satisfaction was 71.4% (range 48% to 100%). The mean rate of minor complications was 4.6% (range 0% to 9.5%). The average of major complications was 3.3% (rang 0% to 14%). The studies assessing minimally invasive techniques reported an average success rate of 62% (range 49% to 75%), 2.7%, minor complications (range 0% to 8%), and no major complications. The open invasive procedures show an average success rate of 78% (range 52% to 86%), a minor complication rate of 6% (range 0% to 9.5%), and a major complication rate of 5.8% (range 0% to 12%).
Conclusions All investigated operative methods were demonstrated to improve patients's conditions, though success rates varied between operative techniques. The complication rate differs between used techniques. Minimal invasive operative techniques seem to be related with fewer complications but open techniques report on higher success rates. Results vary between subjects according to sex and activity level.

Achilles Tendoscopy for Non-Insertional Tendinopathy
Giovanni Carcuro, Leonardo Lagos, Hugo Henríquez, Natalio Cuchacovich, Manuel Pellegrini, Christian Bastías
International Journal of Clinical Medicine, 2013, 4, 1-4
Achilles tendinopathy is a very common pathology, especially in the athletic population. Its etiology is multifactorial and the underlying pathophysiology is still not fully understood. For non-insertional tendinopathy is increasingly recognized the influence of paratendinopathy in the genesis of patients symptoms, so various surgical treatments have been accordingly developed; they are indicated when conservative treatment fails. The Achilles tendoscopy is one of these techniques, it has the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, resulting in a low complication rate and good functional results. In relation to this procedure we review the surgical technique, which is exemplified by the case of a high performance athlete treated satisfactorily.

Multiple Percutaneous Longitudinal Tenotomies for Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy in Runners
A Long-Term Study
Nicola Maffulli, et al
Am J Sports Med July 10, 2013
Background: Multiple percutaneous longitudinal tenotomies have been successfully undertaken in runners with isolated midportion Achilles tendinopathy (nodular lesions <2.5 cm) without any sign of paratendinopathy.
Hypothesis: In the long term, minimally invasive multiple tenotomies allow the patient to remain involved in middle- and long-distance running. Clinical and ultrasound (US) evidence of paratendinopathy is a negative prognostic factor.
Study Design: Case series study; Level of evidence, 4.
Methods: A total of 39 patients were reviewed at an average follow-up of 17 years (range, 15-22 years) after US-guided multiple percutaneous longitudinal tenotomies for chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire was completed by each patient, maximum calf circumference and isometric plantarflexion strength of the gastrocsoleus complex were measured in both the affected and contralateral legs, and functional assessment was scored by the 4-point Boyden scale. Achilles tendon changes were also assessed according to the grayscale US grading system.
Results: At the final follow-up, the maximum calf circumference and the strength in the operated leg were not significantly different than those measured preoperatively, but they were significantly lower than those on the contralateral side. This did not affect patients’ daily or sports activities. All patients had returned to their preinjury working occupation; 20 patients were still active in middle- and long-distance running, with an average current level of sport and function that was 60% ± 13% compared with baseline status (before onset of symptoms). Thirty of 39 patients (77%) reported good or excellent outcomes according to the Boyden assessment. On US assessment, the tendon was generally thicker than the contralateral asymptomatic tendon (average, 7.0 vs 8.7 mm, respectively; P = .003). There was no significant difference (P > .05) when comparing patients with good or excellent Boyden results versus those with fair or poor outcomes. The mean VISA-A score was 78.5, with no significant difference between patients with and without paratendinopathy on US assessment (P > .05). All of the patients who did not return to running or who gave up sports activities had signs of paratendinopathy.
Conclusion: This approach to the management of midportion Achilles tendinopathy is safe, has a low cost, and is effective in the long term.

Central tendon splitting combined with SutureBridge double-row
technique as a surgical treatment for insertional Achilles tendinopathy
LIN Yuan, WANG Zhi-wei, ZHANG Bo, PAN Jiang, QU Tie-bing and HAI Yong
Chin Med J 2013;126 (20): 3860-3864
Background Surgical treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy should be considered when a variety of conservative
measures fail. To achieve a satisfactory outcome, thorough debridement of the Achilles tendon is critical, besides excision
of the bursitis and the calcaneal exostosis. Central tendon-splitting provides straightforward access to the calcified or
degenerative tissue within the Achilles tendon. For Achilles tendon reconstruction if detachment is present, several surgical
techniques have been reported. Controversy surrounds the technique can provide maximum security for reattachment of
the Achilles tendon. The SutureBridge double-row construct, initially used in rotator cuff repair, is probably a good choice.
Methods Ten consecutive patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy underwent tendon reattachment using the
SutureBridge technique through a central tendon-splitting approach. We retrospectively evaluated the surgical outcomes,
which included pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), postoperative Maryland Foot Score (MFS), postoperative
range of motion of the affected ankle, and related complications. Follow-up was performed in the outpatient department.
Results One patient was lost to follow-up. Nine patients (two male and seven female; 12 feet) were reviewed with a
minimum follow-up of six months (range 6–30 months). The postoperative VAS pain scores were markedly lower than
the preoperative scores. Postoperative MFS was 92.1±8.0 (range 74–100). No intra- or postoperative complications were
found, except for one case of delayed healing incision. At last follow-up, all affected ankles achieved their normal range of
motion, and patients were able to resume daily activities without any assistive device.
Conclusions Although a randomized control trial with a larger sample may be necessary to compare the central tendonsplitting
combined with the SutureBridge technique with other techniques, our results confirmed that it was a promising
alternative for treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy.

Ultrasound and Color Doppler-Guided Surgery for Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy-Results of a Pilot Study
Håkan Alfredson, Martin Isaksson
Open Journal of Orthopedics, Vol. 4 No. 1, 2014, pp. 7-14
Background: Treatment of insertional achilles tendinopathy is known to be difficult. Eccentric calf muscle exercises and extracorporeal shockwave therapy have been proposed as the primary treatments for this condition, but surgery is indicated after failed conservative management. There is no consensus about the most efficient surgical treatment.
Objectives: To evaluate a new ultrasound and color Doppler-guided surgical treatment for insertional achilles tendinopathy. Patients and methods: 24 consecutive patients (13 men and 11 women, mean age 47 years) with a long duration of insertional achilles tendon pain (median 18 months) were included in the study. The surgical procedure consisted of extirpation of the subcutaneous and retrocalcaneal bursa, scraping of the ventral distal achilles tendon and removal of prominent bone at the upper calcaneal tuberosity (Haglund’s deformity). In 13 patients, the plantaris tendon was also cut and excised. VAS for pain during activity, satisfaction with the treatment result and the SF-36 score to measure quality of life were used for evaluation.
Results: The mean VAS had decreased from 72 before surgery to 19 after surgery (p < 0.001), and 20/24 (83%) patients were satisfied with the result and had returned to full tendon loading activity at the one-year follow-up. The SF-36 score had improved significantly.
Conclusion: Ultrasound and color Doppler-guided surgical treatment seems to be a good method for treatment of chronic painful insertional achilles tendinopathy. Longer follow-up studies on larger materials are needed.

Major physical but also psychological effects after pain relief from surgical scraping in patients with Achilles tendinopathy—A 1-year follow-up study
Anna Ruergård, Håkan Alfredson
Pain Studies and Treatment, 2, 21-25. doi: 10.4236/pst.2014.21005.
Treatment with Ultrasound (US) and Color Doppler (CD)-guided surgical scraping has shown good short-term clinical results in patients with chronic painful midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The objective was to prospectively follow the patients 1-year after surgery. Material: Sixty- four tendons in 47 patients (28 men and 19 women, mean age 52 (+/-12 years) on different activity levels) were in local anaestesia operated with US+CD-guided surgical scraping. In 43/64 tendons, there was also removal of the plantaris tendon. Methods: Questionnaires evaluating activity level, VAS for pain during activity, satisfaction with treatment result, and the SF-36 score (quality of life), were used before and 1-year after surgery. Results: At follow-up, the mean VAS for pain during activity had decreased from 62 (+/-20) before surgery to 15 (+/-15) after surgery (p < 0.001). All patients were satisfied with the result and had returned to full tendon loading activity. There were no complications. Both the physical and psychological parameters in the SF-36 score had improved significantly. Conclusions: For patients with chronic painful midportion Achilles tendinopathy, US+CD-guided surgical scraping, often combined with plantaris tendon removal, seems to be an efficient treatment method to recover physically and psychologically.

Results of surgical treatment of calcaneus insertional tendinopathy in middle- and long-distance runners.
Rousseau R, Gerometta A, Fogerty S, Rolland E, Catonné Y, Khiami F.
Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc. 2014 Apr 19.
PURPOSE:
Calcaneus insertional tendinopathy in runners is common and involves important therapeutic controversies. The object of this study was to determine the delay and level of return to sport after insertional surgery in runners, with and without tendon damage.
METHODS:
Eighteen runners underwent surgery for insertional calcaneus tendinopathy. Nine required an exostosectomy/bursectomy, and nine others required a tendon reinsertion/autograft. All patients were clinically assessed pre- and post-operatively with AOFAS scores and post-operatively with ATRS. This series included analysis of "pure conflicts" and "severe insertional lesion" scores. If the insertional tendon was free or the lesion was smaller than 50 %, the group was classified as "pure conflict/minor tendon damage". In the situation in which a loss of tendon occurred or the tendon lesion was greater than 50 %, the group was classified as "major tendon damage". Pre-operatively, the AOFAS "overall", "pure conflicts/minor tendon damage" and "major tendon damage" groups' scores were 58.5 ± 15, 68.2 ± 8.8 and 48.9 ± 13.9/100, respectively.
RESULTS:
Post-operatively, the AOFAS "overall", "pure conflicts/minor tendon" and "major tendon damage" groups' scores were 93.7 ± 8.2, 93.2 ± 10.2 and 95.2 ± 5.7/100, respectively. The AOFAS score gain for each group was, respectively, 35.2 ± 19, 24 ± 17 and 46.3 ± 14.1. The ATRS "overall", "pure conflicts/minor tendon damage" and "major tendon damage" groups' scores were 81.5 ± 14.9, 78.3 ± 20.1 and 84.7 ± 6.7/100, respectively. The global sport recovery delay was 9.3 ± 4.1 months; it was 6 ± 3.3 months for the pure conflict/minor tendon damage subgroup and 10 ± 4.6 months for the severe tendon damages subgroup.
CONCLUSION:
Achilles insertional tendinopathy surgery on this population results in few complications with good functional results if the surgical technique is adapted to the type of tendon injury. The clinical relevance of this study is that it highlights the various forms of calcaneus insertional tendinopathy and various treatment options. The authors show that in the case of major tendon damage, time to return to sport is longer.

Calcaneoplasty and reattachment of the Achilles tendon for insertional tendinopathy.
Lin HA, Chong KW, Yeo W.
J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong). 2014 Apr;22(1):56-59.
PURPOSE. To report the one-year outcome of 44 patients treated with a novel technique of calcaneoplasty and reattachment of the Achilles tendon.
METHODS. 15 men and 29 women (mean age, 53 years) with insertional tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon underwent calcaneoplasty, retrocalcaneal bursa excision, debridement and reattachment of the Achilles tendon with suture anchors via a lateral approach. Outcome was measured using the visual analogue score (VAS) for pain, the SF-36 health survey, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores. Patient expectation and satisfaction were also assessed.
RESULTS. Of the 44 patients, 37, 43, and 21 were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months. The mean VAS for pain and AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved significantly up to 6 months. The mean SF-36 score improved significantly up to 6 months for physical functioning, role functioning (physical), and bodily pain. Patient expectation and satisfaction also improved significantly. No patient had postoperative infections or rupture. Three patients had delayed wound healing, which resolved after simple dressings.
CONCLUSION. Calcaneoplasty and reattachment of the Achilles tendon via a lateral approach for insertional tendinopathy enables early weight bearing and achieves good outcome and pain relief.

Results of operative treatment for recalcitrant retrocalcaneal bursitis and midportion Achilles tendinopathy in athletes
Heinz Lohrer, Tanja Nauck
Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery; June 2014
Background
The results of operative treatment for recalcitrant midportion Achilles tendinopathy and recalcitrant retrocalcaneal bursitis were evaluated using the patient administered, disease specific, and validated VISA-A-G questionnaire.
Methods
A cohort of 89 patients was prospectively followed. These patients underwent operations for sport induced midportion Achilles tendinopathy (39 procedures) or retrocalcaneal bursitis (55 procedures). Depending on the individual intraoperative findings the patients of either disease were treated with two respective operative modifications (tendon repair or no tendon repair). Preoperative and follow-up status (3, 6, and 12 months) were investigated using the VISA-A-G questionnaire.
Results
Preoperatively, the four groups scored from 37.0 ± 17.6 to 45.9 ± 15.2 (p = 0.376–0.993) on the VISA-A-G questionnaire. Six and 12 months postoperatively, the VISA-A-G scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). Twelve months postoperatively, the groups’ scores were not different (p = 0.100–0.952) and ranged from 80.8 ± 17.9 to 90.3 ± 10.6.
Conclusion
Retrocalcaneal bursitis and midportion Achilles tendinopathy responded equally well to operative treatment. When repaired, additional tendon lesions did not influence this result. We demand to differentiate not only between midportion Achilles tendinopathy and retrocalcaneal bursitis but also to identify additional Achilles tendon lesions to specifically address these lesions during operative procedures.

Open surgical treatment for chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy: faster recovery with the soleus fibres transfer technique.
Benazzo F, Zanon G, Klersy C, Marullo M.
Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc. 2014 Sep 6.
PURPOSE:
The study aimed to compare two methods of open surgical treatment for midportion Achilles tendinopathy in sportsmen. A novel technique consisting in transferring some soleus fibres into the degenerated tendon to improve its vascularization and longitudinal tenotomies are evaluated and compared.
METHODS:
From 2006 to 2011, fifty-two competitive and noncompetitive athletes affected by midportion Achilles tendinopathy were surgically treated and prospectively evaluated at 6 months and at a final 4-year mean follow-up. Twenty patients had longitudinal tenotomies, and thirty-two had soleus fibres transfer. Clinical outcome was evaluated by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score. Time to return to walk and to run and tendon thickening were also recorded.
RESULTS:
Patients in the soleus transfer group had a higher increase in AOFAS and VISA-A score at 6 months and at the mean 4-year final follow-up (by 5.4 points, 95 % CI 2.9-7.9, p < 0.001 and by 5.7 points, 95 % CI 2.5-8.9, p = 0.001, for AOFAS and VISA, respectively). They also needed less time to return to run: 98.9 ± 17.4 days compared to 122.2 ± 26.3 days for the longitudinal tenotomies group (p = 0.0019). The soleus transfer group had a greater prevalence of tendon thickening (59.4 % compared to 30.0 % in the longitudinal tenotomies group, p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS:
Open surgery for midportion Achilles tendinopathy is safe and effective in medium term. Despite similar outcomes in postoperative functional scores, soleus transfer allows a faster recovery but has a higher incidence of tendon thickening. These results should suggest the use of the soleus graft technique in high-level athletes.

Achilles Tendinopathies
Susan N. Ishikawa, Brian G. Donley, David R. Richardson, G. Andrew Murphy
Sports Injuries; 2014, pp 1-12
Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition in both athletes and non-athletes, but the exact pathology involved remains unclear and the cause is believed to be multifactorial, involving both patient-related (e.g., age, medical conditions, obesity) and activity-related factors (e.g., running, jumping, training errors). Diagnosis usually is clinical, although imaging may be required to rule out other conditions. Initial treatment of both insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy is nonoperative, but approximately 24–45 % of patients eventually require surgical treatment, most often tendon debridement. Surgical treatment is successful in approximately 80 % of patients.

Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy: Good Clinical Results And Tendon Remodelling After Surgical Scraping
Håkan Alfredson, Lorenzo Masci
Br J Sports Med 2014;48:A6 doi:10.1136/bjsports-2014-094114.9
Introduction For many years midportion Achilles tendinopathy was known to be difficult to treat. Recent advances using immunohistochemical analyses of tissue specimens have clarified the neural patterns in this condition, and new treatment approaches focusing on the blood vessel and nerve rich ventral side of the Achilles have shown good clinical results.
Material 125 tendons from 103 patients (66 males, and 37 females).
Methods Ultrasound (US)+Doppler (CD)-guided scraping in local anaesthesia. Clinical and US+DP follow-ups.
Results Follow-ups at 18 months (mean) showed good clinical results in 111/125 tendons, VAS from 73 to 3.
US follow-ups have shown a thinner tendon with improved structure.
Discussion Surgical scraping treatment on the blood vessel and nerve rich ventral side of the Achilles midportion has a high potential to reduce tendon pain and also to improve tendon structure and decrease tendon thickness. Our group have on-going studies using a new tool to investigate tendon structure, ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC), to try to properly evaluate the tendon effects of this procedure. The potentials in the soft tissues on the ventral side of the Achilles are in focus for intensive research.

Knotted Versus Knotless Suture Bridge Repair of the Achilles Tendon Insertion: A Biomechanical Study.
Cox JT, Shorten PL, Gould GC, Markert RJ, Barnett MD Jr, Laughlin RT.
Am J Sports Med. 2014 Sep 15.
BACKGROUND:
Surgical treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy often involves detachment and debridement of the Achilles tendon insertion. A recent study has shown that knotted suture bridge fixation of the Achilles to the calcaneus is biomechanically superior to single-row fixation, but there is an absence of literature on the use of different suture bridge constructs to repair the Achilles tendon.
HYPOTHESIS:
There will be no significant difference in the load to failure, mode of failure, tendon strain, tendon stiffness, repair site gapping, or footprint size when comparing knotted suture bridge repair to knotless suture bridge repair of the Achilles tendon after detachment for insertional Achilles tendinopathy.
STUDY DESIGN:
Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS:
A single specimen from each pair of 10 cadaveric Achilles tendons was randomized to 1 of 2 Achilles insertion repair groups: knotted (n = 10) or knotless (n = 10) suture bridge repair. Repaired footprint size was measured, and then cyclic testing from 10 to 100 N for 2000 cycles was performed. This was followed by measurement of tendon strain, repair site displacement, load to failure, and tendon stiffness.
RESULTS:
The knotted suture bridge repair had a significantly higher load to failure compared with the knotless suture bridge (mean ± SD, 317.8 ± 93.6 N vs 196.1 ± 12.1 N, respectively; P = .001). All constructs failed at the tendon-suture interface. Tendon strain after cyclic testing was significantly greater in the knotless (1.20 ± 1.05) compared with the knotted (0.39 ± 0.4) suture repair groups (P = .011). There was no significant difference in footprint size between the knotted (230.3 ± 63.3 mm2) and knotless (248.5 ± 48.8 mm2) groups (P = .40). There was also no significant difference in stiffness (knotted = 76.4 ± 8.0 N/mm; knotless = 69.6 ± 10.9 N/mm; P = .17) and repair site displacement after cyclic testing (knotted = 2.8 ± 1.2 mm; knotless = 3.6 ± 1.1 mm; P = .17).
CONCLUSION:
During suture bridge repair of the Achilles tendon after detachment, knots at the proximal suture anchors significantly improve the biomechanical strength of the repair.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
This study demonstrated that the knotless suture bridge repair had a significantly lower load to failure than the knotted suture bridge. Surgeons should be aware of these biomechanical differences, as they influence the postoperative rehabilitation protocol and may lead to higher surgical complication rates.

Release of the medial head of the gastrocnemius for Achilles tendinopathy in sedentary patients: a retrospective study
Nicola Maffulli, Angelo Del Buono
International Orthopaedics; October 2014
Purpose
Our aim was to ascertain whether releasing the medial head of he gastrocnemius improves clinical and functional outcomes of sedentary patients with long-standing tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon and allows return to daily activities.
Methods
Eighteen patients (seven men, 11 women) underwent release of the gastrocnemius medial head to manage chronic unilateral Achilles tendinopathy. Pre- and postoperatively, each patient completed the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles tendon (VISA-A) questionnaire. The maximum calf circumference and isometric plantar flexion strength of the gastrocsoleus complex were measured in both the affected and the contralateral leg. Function was scored using the 4-point Boyden scale at the last assessment.
Results
At the last appointment, at an average follow-up of 54 months, maximum calf circumference and strength of the operated leg were not significantly different than pre-operatively and were significantly lower than the contralateral leg. All patients could satisfactorily perform the same work and daily activities as before symptom onset. At the last follow-up, the average VISA-A score was improved from a preoperative average value of 52.3 to 75 (range 51–94) (p < .001).
Conclusions
This approach to managing isolated Achiles tendinopathy is safe, effective, low cost and allows safe return to preinjury daily activities.

Isolated Gastrocnemius Recession for Treatment of Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy
A Pilot Study
Valerie K. Tallerico, DPM; Robert M. Greenhagen, DPM; Clinton Lowery, DPM
Foot Ankle Spec November 10, 2014
Introduction. Many surgeries exist for treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Another surgical option to consider is an isolated gastrocnemius recession. Recent studies have demonstrated the success of a gastrocnemius recession for noninsertional Achilles tendinitis. We hypothesize that an isolated gastrocnemius recession can be a successful, effective, and less invasive surgery for patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Materials and Methods. This article presents a retrospective review of one surgeon’s results of 11 patients (2010-2012), with an average age of 59 years who presented with chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Gastrocnemius recessions, either endoscopic or open, were performed after an average of 6.2 months of conservative treatment. All patients’ radiographs were reviewed preoperatively for any calcaneal spurs and divided into groups accordingly. Average follow-up time postoperatively was 13.8 months. Plantarflexion strength, equinus deformity, as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot instrument was assessed. Results. In all, 10/11 (91%) patients had high patient satisfaction, pain relief, no residual equinus deformity, loss in muscle strength and returned to regular activities successfully at 1-year follow up. All patients and groups had significant improvement in AOFAS scores. The median postoperative AOFAS score was 94.8. All patients and patient groups had significant improvement pre- to postoperatively. Patients without spurs appear to do better than patients with spurs. One patient developed recurrence of insertional heel pain and equinus deformity. Other complications included 2 sural nerve parasthesias, which resolved. Conclusion. An isolated gastrocnemius recession for chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy can provide high satisfaction, pain relief, and a faster recovery period with few or no complications.

Flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer in the reconstruction of extensive insertional Achilles tendinopathy in elderly: an improved technique.
El-Tantawy A, Azzam W.
Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol. 2014 Nov 30.
BACKGROUND:
Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is a degenerative disease associated with disabling posterior heel pain, gait dysfunction and significant morbidity. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of complete excision of the pathological tendo-achilles segment in elderly patients with extensive involvement, and reconstructing the defect using a modified technique which was proposed to allow early weight-bearing and rehabilitation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
Thirteen patients (mean age 58.2 years) with extensive insertional Achilles tendinopathy (seven with spontaneous rupture and six without rupture) were operated between January 2008 and July 2012. The average tendon gap after debridement was 6.8 cm. All patients were reconstructed with flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer augmented with a modified turn-down flap. Patient's satisfaction was evaluated using the American orthopedic foot and ankle society (AOFAS)-ankle-hindfoot scale.
RESULTS:
The mean follow-up period was 24.5 months. The AOFAS scores improved from 57.5 ± 8.44 preoperatively to 98.3 ± 1.01 at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Complete pain relieve was achieved in ten patients, while the other three had mild occasional pain. Eleven patients had excellent results, and two had good results. There was no single case of re-rupture, and two patients acquired superficial wound infection which was resolved conservatively.
CONCLUSIONS:
The modified technique provides a transfer with sufficient length and strength that can restore large tendo-achilles defects in elderly, and is stable enough to allow early protected weight-bearing and rehabilitation with favorable clinical result and minimal morbidity. Resection of all degenerated tendon tissue alleviates pain and improves function.

Anatomical study for flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer in treatment of Achilles tendinopathy
Haijiao Mao, Zengyuan Shi, Keith L. Wapner, Wenwei Dong, Weigang Yin, Dachuan Xu
Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy; December 2014
Purpose
The purpose of the study was to describe the anatomical variations of the connection between the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendons in the knot of Henry in Asians, and quantify the length of FHL tendon graft with different incisions.
Methods
Sixty-four embalmed feet of 32 cadavers were analyzed anatomically with respect to the individual cross-links in the planta pedis. Single incision technique graft length was measured from the musculotendinous junction of FHL and the point at sustentaculum tali. Double incision technique was measured from musculotendinous junction of FHL and the level of the master knot of Henry. Additionally, minimally invasive incision technique was measured from musculotendinous junction of FHL to the first interphalangeal joint. These three techniques were then combined to determine the total potential tendon graft length obtainable using different approach.
Results
Only two different configurations were found. Type 1, a tendinous slip branched from the FHL to the FDL (62 of 64 feet). Type 2, a slip branched from the FHL to the FDL and another slip from the FDL to FHL (2 of 64). The average length of the FHL graft available from a single incision measured 5.08 cm (range 3.32–10.35, SD = 1.09), double incision technique measured 6.72 cm (range 4.69–12.09, SD = 1.03), and minimally invasive incision measured 17.49 cm (range 13.51–20.52, SD = 1.80). The difference between the lengths obtained from these three techniques was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
The absence of no attachment and FDL tendon to the FHL between the two tendons in the foot may be more frequent than previously reported. Only two configurations of the anatomical relationship were found in this study. In over 96 % of the feet, a proximal to distal connection from the FHL to the FDL was found, which might contribute to the residual function of the lesser toes after FDL transfer.

Isolated Gastrocnemius Recession for Achilles Tendinopathy: Strength and Functional Outcomes
Deborah A. Nawoczenski, PT, PhD; Heather Barske, MD, FRCSC; Joshua Tome, MS; Laura K. Dawson, DO; Jason P. Zlotnicki, BS; Benedict F. DiGiovanni, MD
J Bone Joint Surg Am, 2015 Jan 21;97(2):99-105. http://dx.doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.M.01424
Background: Gastrocnemius recession has emerged as a viable intervention for patients with recalcitrant foot and ankle disorders associated with isolated gastrocnemius contracture. The purpose of this case-control study was to investigate the effects of an isolated gastrocnemius recession on pain, patient-reported function, and strength in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy and an isolated gastrocnemius contracture.
Methods: Thirteen patients with unilateral Achilles tendinopathy (mean age [and standard deviation], fifty-two ± 7.7 years) who received a gastrocnemius recession and ten matched-control subjects participated. A visual analog scale was used to assess pain, and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure was used to evaluate patient-reported function in activities of daily living and sports. Patients were asked about their satisfaction with the results of the gastrocnemius recession. Ankle plantar flexion peak torque was assessed at 60°/sec and 120°/sec. Appropriate t tests were used to assess limb symmetry and strength differences between the groups.
Results: The mean duration of follow-up was eighteen months (range, twelve to twenty-eight months). Gastrocnemius recession provided significant pain relief (mean preoperative visual analog scale score [and standard deviation], 6.8 ± 1.8; mean follow-up visual analog scale score, 1.4 ± 2.7; p < 0.05). Foot and Ankle Ability Measure outcomes showed between-group differences in activities of daily living (Achilles tendinopathy group, 89.7; control group, 98.5; p = 0.05) and sports subscales (Achilles tendinopathy group, 71.9; control group, 95.1; p = 0.05). The activities reported to be the most challenging included going up hills, climbing stairs, running, and jumping. Eleven of the thirteen patients in the Achilles tendon group were satisfied with treatment. Side-to-side strength comparisons showed no differences at 60°/sec. Significant differences were observed at 120°/sec (Achilles tendinopathy group, 21%; control group, 3%; p < 0.05); however, the involved limb reached a peak torque similar to that in the control limb.
Conclusions: Isolated gastrocnemius recession provides significant and sustained pain relief for chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Good function can be expected for activities of daily living, but power and endurance activities were more problematic for the Achilles tendinopathy group. Isokinetic strength assessment may not effectively capture patient-reported functional deficits.

Surgical Treatment of Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy With or Without Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon Transfer
A Prospective, Randomized Study
Kenneth J. Hunt, MD; Bruce E. Cohen, MD; W. Hodges Davis, MD; Robert B. Anderson, MD; Carroll P. Jones, MD
Foot & Ankle International May 19, 2015
Background: Chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy is a common pathology that can be difficult to manage. Some experts have advocated augmentation with the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon in patients over age 50 and those with more severe tendon disease. We hypothesized that FHL augmentation would be associated with superior clinical outcome scores and greater ankle plantar flexion strength compared with Achilles debridement alone.
Methods: Consecutive patients older than 50 years who had failed nonoperative treatment for chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy were randomly assigned to Achilles decompression and debridement alone (control group) or Achilles decompression and debridement augmented with FHL transfer (FHL group). Outcome measures included American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle/hindfoot score, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, ankle and hallux plantar flexion strength, and a patient satisfaction survey. A total of 39 enrolled patients had a minimum 1-year follow-up, 18 in the control group and 21 in the FHL transfer group. The average patient age was 60.5 years.
Results: AOFAS and VAS scores improved in both groups at 6 months and 1 year with no difference between groups. There was greater ankle plantar flexion strength in the FHL group at 6 months and at 1 year compared with the control group (P < .05). There was no difference between the 2 groups in hallux plantar flexion strength preoperatively and at 1 year after surgery. Some 87% of patients were satisfied with the outcome of their procedure. There was no significant increase in wound complications in the FHL group (P < .05).
Conclusion: We found no differences in pain, functional outcome (as measured by the AOFAS ankle/hindfoot scale), and patient satisfaction when comparing patients treated with Achilles debridement alone versus FHL augmentation for chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Ankle plantar flexion strength appeared to be improved with FHL transfer, with no loss of hallux plantar flexion strength. Although FHL transfer was a safe adjunct to tendon debridement and partial ostectomy for insertional Achilles tendinopathy in older patients with little compromise in function, it may not be necessary for primary cases.
