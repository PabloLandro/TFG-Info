Managing an Osteoarthritic Hip
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease which is caused as a result of cartilage breakdown around the articulating surfaces of bone. These cause a further breakdown of the joint ultimately leading to bones rubbing on each other and complete destruction of the joint.
Osteoarthritis may prevent you from exercising. A lack of exercise may even contribute to osteoarthritis and muscle atrophy. Regular physical activity can help strengthen muscles, improve balance, and make your hip joints more stable.
A physical therapist always creates a treatment plan that is individualized to specific patient needs to help improve symptoms and manage pain. Such individualized treatments include but are not limited to the following;
Low-impact exercise
Some low impact exercises include:
Walking
This is the best low impact exercise as it is cheap, easily accessible and can be carried out at all times during the day. A physical therapist will, however, give cues to improve the quality of this activity.
Stationary bike
Using a stationary bike on an easy setting allows you to slowly build your strength. Using the bike in your home allows you to avoid traffic and stop when you feel strained.
Aquatic Therapy
Carrying out exercises in water has the added benefit of reducing weight-bearing forces at the joints and joint relaxation properties underwater cannot be overemphasized.
Anti Gravity Treadmill
A great alternative to aquatic therapy is the Anti Gravity Treadmill.
Aquatic therapy is a traditional recommendation to reduce body weight during exercise, which in turn reduces stiffness and inflammation after exercise. But aquatic exercise does not ensure a normal gait pattern.
The AlterG® Anti-Gravity Treadmill™ can take PT for OA patients to the next level by:
Allowing walking and running with a normalized gait pattern. The PT can work with the patient on gait kinematics in a safe environment.
Decreasing pain by controlling the load from 20% to 100% of body weight with NASA-patented Differential Air Pressure technology.
Decreasing stiffness and inflammation through motion to assist with joint health and improved range of motion that allows for proper cartilage loading.
