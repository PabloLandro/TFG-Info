Being able to distinguish between a good pain and a not-so-good pain is critically important for all of us who engage in regular vigorous exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle.
Many of us want to improve our level of fitness, but don't know what to do or how to begin. The Eleatic philosopher Zeno, writing almost 2500 years ago, famously propounded several paradoxes purportedly proving that various conceptions of the physical universe were false. Glutathione is probably the most important cellular defense that allows the body to prevent and fight infections and disease. Gutathione plays crucial roles in the immune response, DNA repair, and the detoxification process that neutralizes drugs, chemicals, radiation, metabolic wastes, beats down viruses, bacteria and reduces toxins and carcinogens that are increasingly present in our environment. The immune system cannot function properly without plentiful glutathione and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E rely on it to function properly within the body. Glutathione is manufactured by every one of our trillions of cells, and the level of glutathione in our cells is predictive of how long we will live. Low glutathione levels, low cg syndrome or low GSH levels are associated with over 74 diseases or conditions and is a major biological player when it comes to dealing with viral infections.
Over 98,000 scientific studies and articles on Glutathione are recorded in PubMed, the official U.S. In another major active defensive pathway, glutathione makes sure that all components of the immune system are strong and operating efficiently. The first step in anti-viral or bacterial medicine is to build the strength of the immune system. Glutathione boosts white blood cell production to fight infection, particularly the T-cells, which are called lymphocytes.
GSH protects us from viruses, such as the herpes virus, flu viruses, and probably from Ebola as well. Extracellular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral protein R causes reductions in astrocytic ATP and glutathione levels compromising the antioxidant reservoir.[4] Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels were determined in liver biopsy specimens obtained from patients with chronic liver disease including chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis.
This is the strongest Glutathione 1.5 (1,500mg reduced glutathione) available on the market. Healthcare providers give glutathione by injection into the muscle for preventing poisonous side effects of cancer treatment (chemotherapy) and for treating the inability to father a child (male infertility). Glutathione can be nebulized for treating lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and lung disease in people with HIV disease. The association between viral disease and nutrition has long been thought to be due to effects on the host immune system.[6] This theory suggests that when a host is malnourished, the immune system is compromised, and thus increased susceptibility to viral infection will occur. When it comes to human papilloma virus or HPV, or any virus problem for that matter, it is crucial that you are getting adequate amounts of selenium in your diet or using a supplement. Selenium holds one of the keys to resolving the killer Cytokine storms that kill Ebola victims. The pre-cursors of glutathione synthesis are the amino acids glutamate, glycine and cysteine, with cysteine being the most important amino acid.
The difference is that the genes in the Zaire strain of Ebola genes appear to need 10 times more selenium than does HIV, and Ebola’s greater dependence on selenium may partly account for the speed with which it kills.
Special Note: Some people feel that Nano Silver cures Ebola, and though I agree that such treatments could prove to be more than helpful, I stick with proven basic medicines and never suggest that any single agent should be used or thrust forward as a cure.
Other substances are very necessary like Vitamin C because Ebola vanquishes all of the body’s stores of C and that is why patients hemorrhage.
The same mania that sweeps people into mouthing off about Nano Silver can be seen with those who champion MMS as a cure all for everything. If you need to improve one's health or recover from a serious disorder learn how to treat yourself and your loved ones safely at home. For more advanced and detailed presentation we offer Treatment Essentials, which has all the information for you to practice Natural Allopathic Medicine, including the important chapter on dosages. I have a friend who has cirrhosis of the liver…she was told recently she needs to be on the a liver transplant list because she only has a few weeks to live.

Case studies, easy to understand explanations about the CranioSacral System, Visceral Manipulation, products to use between sessions, and much more. Brown enjoys hiking with her black lab, Tyler, and spending time with her family and friends. Glutathione is the natural defense of every cell in our bodies working hand in hand and dependent on a plentiful supply of selenium for its existence and function.
Glutathione (GSH) and the GSH-replenishing enzymes keep the antioxidant status of normal cells at a level where they can avert oxyradical-derived mutations.
Without the cleaning and chelating work of Glutathione (magnesium and sulphates needed) cells begin to decay as cellular filth and heavy metals accumulate – excellent environments to attract deadly infection like Ebola. It is like sticky flypaper, whatever GSH attaches itself to cannot escape and is removed from the body. Without the interaction of GSH with the immune system it remains weak and unbalanced thus leaving patients with infections, vulnerable to death. The product I have been recommending for years is less expensive but offers much less glutathione per dose. Julian Whitaker writes, “Alpha lipoic acid also ramps up glutathione synthesis and significantly enhances detoxification, and we use it at the clinic, along with selenium and silymarin, to treat hepatitis and other liver diseases. The selenium I recommend for oral use can be taken at very high dosages and is safer than aspirin because it is designed like liposomal Vitamin C.
As people age or experience disease, glutathione levels in the blood decrease, causing a reduction in this life-sustaining antioxidant. Russell Blaylock, low magnesium is associated with dramatic increases in free radical generation as well as glutathione depletion and this is vital since glutathione is one of the few antioxidant molecules known to neutralize mercury.
Normal immune defenses against Ebola would be handicapped if the host-an animal or person-were deficient in selenium.
Care for critically ill patients with Ebola is hazardous, to say the least, and the utmost care needs to be taken for the patient and healthcare providers. What I dislike about such people and their claims is that they never talk about anything else.
We offer a FREE introductory guide to Natural Allopathic Basics which outlines a simple to follow protocol that you can use inexpensively and safely at home. For example ergotioneine is found in mushrooms and favours DNA protection during radiotherapy. High homocysteine levels we could lower by betaine supplementation ( sour beetroot) and remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.

Duch has been involved as a content advisor with the Spanish language multimedia company Todobebe Inc. Where he had the honor of attending many lectures and workshops with Dr Vasant Lad of the Ayurvedic Institute. Stress is a natural part of life, but we have the tools (the 8 pillars) at our disposal to mitigate it's impact, in our life. Huang is one of the first graduates to become a Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from Bastyr University, the largest Acupuncture school in the northwest, after receiving a Master's degree of AOM from Florida College of Integrative Medicine. Glutathione, the most important antioxidant in the body, is that place where sulfur and selenium meet up to protect us from cancer as well as viral infections.
Without sufficient GSH, the body accumulates toxins and acid residues, degenerates rapidly, ages prematurely and dies more easily from viral and bacterial infections. Those articles reveal the remarkable role glutathione plays in the protection and function of every cell in the human body and the support of optimal health and function. GSH is our body’s natural scavenger, knows what is normal and belongs and what does not. It does not matter if a virus or bacteria has mutated or not, it will be recognized by GSH and removed. Glutathione is the protector of the immune cell and allows newly formed immune cells to proliferate to attack germs and viruses. They need an abundant supply of glutathione to be able to effectively protect us from invading micro-organisms and viruses.
When it’s administered by a medical doctor who has a total picture of your health and body chemistry it is safe. Selenium is a trace mineral that the body incorporates into proteins to make over 25 different selenoproteins including the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. Dietary sources of glutathione are therefore necessary to replenish stores and avoid losses.
Orville Levander, a nutritional chemist at the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service, described how a run-of-the-mill coxsackievirus mutated into the deadly, rapidly reproducing strain when an infected person or animal was deficient in selenium or vitamin E.
Glutathione is not something that most practitioners or patients think of using but there is no medicine more basic that the body needs to defend itself from all manner of attacks. In the case of MMS iodine is a better safer alternative with many if not all of the same results through the fulfillment of nutritional law instead of the use of a substance that is alien to the body.
She has coordinated and supervised mental health services for pregnant women, infants, toddlers, preschoolers and their families at this program for the last five years.
She has expertise in the areas of psychological, neuropsychological and educational assessment, early childhood and bilingual evaluations, consultation and direct intervention with children in group, individual and family therapy. She helped develop UNICEF’s strategic plan for their sponsored preschool programs and trained local teachers and administrators in the areas of early childhood development, education, assessment and special needs.
She is a senior evaluation consultant for Owen Consulting Inc., leading large multi-site evaluations of after-school programs in New York City. His path to Alternative Medicine started after he graduated from medical school in Taiwan as an Occupational Therapist. They also show the terrible consequences of low glutathione levels, and how those lower levels accelerate the aging process.
Obviously, anything that is not normal like bacteria, viruses and fungi will be quickly removed if there is enough GSH present to do the job. GSH is a basic first line of defense and should be used for all life threatening infections.
Researchers working with the flu virus discovered that animals deficient in selenium were more susceptible to infectious diseases.
When selenium is deficient, we can assume that glutathione levels will be dramatically lower. Even healthy people would benefit from glutathione supplementation though at much lower dosages that people under viral attack. Sulfur itself is another basic nutritional medicine that is instrumental in raising glutathione levels. The products discussed are not intended to diagnose, cure, prevent or treat any disease but are proven useful for health and life extension. She is a licensed psychologist and a certified school psychologist in the State of New York.
She also trains Columbia University public health students and family medicine residents in child development. The office complex is on the right side (look for red tiles on the walls flanking the entry driveway). While he practiced in Taiwan, he realized something was missing as he was helping patients through rehabilitation.
Bottom line when fighting nasty infections—without sufficient GSH you will die but you will not see it listed by the authorities as a treatment for Ebola.
Many people on IV glutathione go once or twice a week and at upward of $900 each administration so one can see how cost effective suppositories are.
Animals with a selenium deficiency, when contaminated with the flu virus, the flu virus mutated into a far more virulent form when it was passed on to the next animal. We always recommend when and wherever possible that licensed local healthcare professionals be consulted.
One day, while working with one of his patients who was recovering from a severe stroke, he started to see dramatic positive results in the patient's progress towards rehabilitation.
The AIDS infection rate is highest in those African countries with low levels of selenium in their soil. Huang asked the patient what happened and his answer was that he had received Acupuncture treatment.
Tingsen Xu of Emory University on the scientific benefits of Tai Chi at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
With a combination of Western and Chinese Medicine as his background, he determined that every disease has its own root cause. Once you treat the root and remove the cause, the problem will be resolved and in many instances disappears by itself.a€? His vision is to help patients regain their quality of life.
Huang specializes in pain management, allergy treatment, cancer supportive care, hormone and metabolism balance, internal disease, fertility, and more. The most important part of his approach is his sincerity, he always treats his patients as if they were his own family.
