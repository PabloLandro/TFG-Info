Yoga For Natural Asthma Relief
Breathe easier with these 2 moves
By Ana Mantica
Nov 3, 2011
Yoga can't cure asthma, but certain poses can certainly help open up your airways, helping you breathe better. To keep your airways clear and prevent a coughing fit from coming on, try these two poses recommended by Baxter Bell, MD, a medical acupuncturist and registered yoga instructor in Oakland, CA.

Mountain Pose
Standing poses such as this one help keep your back in a neutral position, allowing your lungs to work more efficiently. When you're standing, gravity pulls your belly organs down toward the floor, so your diaphragm has greater freedom to move, making it easier to breathe.
Start by standing with your feet together. Keep your spine straight, head erect, shoulders down, and arms alongside your body with palms facing inward, fingers spread. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed on both feet. Hold this position for five to 10 breaths.
Goddess Pose
This relaxing pose helps open up your chest, which may ease symptoms like coughing almost immediately.
Grab a bolster or a long, round pillow. Begin by sitting on the floor. Lay a bolster directly behind you, running the same direction as your spine. Place the soles of your feet together, with your knees open to the sides in a diamond shape. Lie back, making sure your lower back, upper back, and head are supported on the bolster. Place your arms alongside your body with forearms and elbows against the floor, palms facing up. Hold this position for 5 to 20 minutes.
