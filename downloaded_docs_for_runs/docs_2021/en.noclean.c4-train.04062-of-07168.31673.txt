What causes athlete's foot?
Athlete's foot, known medically as tinea pedis, is a common fungal infection that affects the feet, caused by parasites on the skin called dermatophytes.
Symptoms of athlete's foot include itchy, cracked and scaly skin and redness. It is a common condition in young people and adults, but you don’t have to be a professional athlete to suffer from this fugal foot infection.
The fungi love warm, moist places, which is why they are primarily a problem for people who wear tight-fitting trainers regularly or don't dry their feet properly.
Athlete's foot is contagious and it can be spread by direct skin-to-skin contact and indirectly through towels, shoes, floors, etc. It can infect any part of the foot, but most often grows between the toes.
What are the symptoms of athlete's foot?
There are two variants of the condition:
Classic athlete's foot: the infection is caused by one of the most common fungi.
A red itchy rash in the spaces between the toes and possibly small pustules.
Often a small degree of scaling.
The infection can spread to the rest of the foot and other parts of the body.
Rarer athlete's foot: infection of the soles of both feet by Trichophyton rubrum.
The skin reddens and its furrows become marked, resembling chalked lines.
If the condition is not treated, a similar rash may appear on one or both palms.
After a while, the rash becomes scaly, resembling eczema.
Can you prevent athlete's foot?
There are a number of things you can do at home to minimise the chances of getting athlete's foot:
Wash your feet daily and dry properly before putting on shoes and socks.
Use a separate towel to dry your feet.
To avoid passing the infection on you should not share towels with anyone else.
Wear socks made of cotton or wool, and change them at least twice a day or when they have become damp.
Avoid wearing shoes which are made of synthetic materials. Wear sandals or leather shoes instead.
Powder the feet and the inside of the shoes with an antifungal powder.

How is athlete's foot treated?
Athlete's foot can be treated locally with antifungal creams, sprays, liquids and powders that are available from your pharmacist without a prescription.
Imidazole antifungals are most effective and include clotrimazole (eg Canesten AF) and miconazole (eg Daktarin). Other antifungals include zinc undecenoate (Mycota), terbinafine (Lamisil AT) and tolnaftate (Mycil).
Treatment should be continued for two weeks after the symptoms have disappeared to ensure the infection has been treated effectively.
Some antifungal creams also contain hydrocortisone, eg Daktacort HC. These are useful when the skin is particularly red and inflamed, as the hydrocortisone reduces inflammation and irritation. They should not be used for longer than seven days. They are not suitable for children under 10 or during pregnancy and breastfeeding, unless prescribed by a doctor. After seven days, treatment should be continued with a plain antifungal.
If the athlete's foot has not started to respond after two weeks' antifungal treatment you should see your doctor, who may prescribe a stronger antifungal cream or antifungal tablets.
The condition can sometimes disappear simply through being exposed to fresh air, but medical treatment is usually required. An infection of the foot may be accompanied by an infection of the nails.

What causes athlete’s foot?
Athlete's foot is caused by parasites on the skin called dermatophytes. Dermatophytes can be divided into three groups according to their favourite hosts:
Fungi preferring soil (geophile)
Fungi preferring animals (zoophile)
Fungi preferring humans (anthropophile).
Athlete's foot is usually caused by anthropophile fungi. The most common species are Microsporum, Epidermophyton and Trichophyton. These account for 90 per cent of all skin fungal infections, commonly referred to as ringworm (tinea corporis).
The medical terms for athlete's foot are tinea pedis or dermatophytosis palmaris, plantaris and interdigitalis – the latter indicates that, in addition to the soles and toes of the feet, the palms of the hands can also become infected.
We all have one or more of the fungi that can cause athlete's foot on our bodies. They feed on dead skin cells and are usually harmless.
