Canesten Cream
Canesten Cream treats fungal skin infections such as ringworm, athlete's foot, fungal nappy rash and fungal sweat rash. It also relieves irritation of the vulva (external thrush) or the end of the penis, which may be associated with thrush.
Canesten Cream contains the active ingredient clotrimazole, an antifungal agent which fights the cause of fungal skin infections.
If the feet are infected, they should be washed and dried thoroughly, especially between the toes, before applying the cream.
Canesten Cream should be applied thinly and evenly to the affected areas two or three times daily and rubbed in gently.
A strip of cream (½cm long) is enough to treat an area of about the size of the hand.
The duration of the treatment depends upon the type of infection. Generally a minimum of two weeks is required, although up to four weeks may be necessary.
If you have athlete’s foot, it may help to use an antifungal dusting powder as well. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend one.
The symptoms of skin infection, such as itching or soreness, should improve within a few days of treatment although signs such as redness and scaling may take longer to disappear. If symptoms persist, consult your doctor.
Active Ingredient: Clotrimazole 1% w/w.
Other Ingredients: Benzyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Palmitate, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Octyldodecanol and Purified Water.
This product contains cetostearyl alcohol which may cause local skin irritation (e.g. rash, itching or redness).
As with other creams, Canesten Cream may reduce the effectiveness of rubber contraceptives, such as condoms or diaphragms. Consequently, if you are using this cream on the vulva or penis, you should use alternative precautions for at least five days after using this product.
If you are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a baby, tell your doctor or midwife before using Canesten Cream. If you have informed your doctor or midwife already, follow his/her instructions carefully.
Do not use Canesten Cream:
If you (or your baby if treating nappy rash) are allergic (hypersensitive) to clotrimazole or any of the other ingredients, including cetostearyl alcohol, of Canesten Cream.
To treat nail or scalp infections.
