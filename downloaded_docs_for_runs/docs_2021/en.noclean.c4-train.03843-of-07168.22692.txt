8 Ways to Maximize Your Depression Treatment

Tailor Your Depression Treatment

Although depression can make you feel like you’re alone, the truth is that you’re not: Major depression affects nearly 15 million adults in the United States every year, according to the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA). However, depression treatment can be different for everyone. "Depression is unique to the individual," says Steve Koh, MD, MPH, chair of the American Psychiatric Association Scientific Committee and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. That’s why it’s important to work with your doctor to find the right depression treatment plan. Although medication is a mainstay of treating and managing depression, it’s not the only answer — and it can take time to find just the right treatment for you. "Medication can have different effects, good and bad, so you should have good communication with your doctor to ensure that it’s not only working well, but that it’s also not causing any side effects," Dr. Koh says. Consider these tips to help increase your chances of successful depression treatment.
Stick With Your Depression Medication Plan

According to the DBSA, about 50 percent of unsuccessful depression treatment is due to not taking medication as prescribed. However, when depression medications are taken properly, depression treatment has a high rate of success. That’s because antidepressant medication can help regulate your mood and keep depression in check, but only if you take it as prescribed, which means taking the right dose at the right times without variation, unless otherwise discussed with your doctor, Koh says. Also keep close communication with your doctor about your medication and any problems you're having with it, he says.
Add Talk Therapy to Your Depression Treatment

Although following a medication schedule is key, there are other important factors in treating depression. "Treatment for depression comes in many shapes and forms," Koh says. "Medication is certainly important, but so is engaging in and staying in therapy." Psychotherapy, often called talk therapy, can be a very useful tool in successfully managing depression. From cognitive-behavioral therapy to problem-solving therapy to interpersonal therapy, there are several counseling approaches that can help treat depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Combining psychotherapy with antidepressant medication can provide better long-term results for major depression than taking medication alone can, according to research published in April 2016 in the Journal of Affective Disorders. If you haven’t already, talk to your doctor about which form of psychotherapy might be best for you to try.
Add Exercise to Your Depression Treatment Plan

Talk therapy isn’t the only natural treatment for depression that can help: Exercise boosts mood by releasing endorphins — chemicals in the brain that naturally ease pain and improve sleep, says the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). In fact, regular exercise has a significant antidepressant effect for people with depression, according to research published in June 2016 issue in the Journal of Psychiatric Research. The greatest benefits come from moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise, researchers found. Try any fitness routine that brings you joy, whether that's biking, yoga, Zumba classes, or a walk outdoors. Opt for morning exercise for good sunlight exposure to help regulate your body's sleep-wake cycle, Koh says.
Take Control of Stress

While excessive and chronic stress can be harmful to anyone's health, it can be particularly troublesome for someone with depression. Unchecked chronic stress can contribute to the development of depression, the American Psychological Association (APA) says, and the combination is particularly harmful to heart health. People with depression and anxiety may have twice the risk for heart disease that people who don’t have depression or anxiety do, according to the APA. But there’s plenty you can do to help minimize the effects of stress on your body. To soothe stress, commit to regular exercise and sleep schedules, a nutritious diet, and relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing, the ADAA suggests.
Monitor Your Weight
Mediabakery
There's a vicious cycle involving stress, depression, and weight gain — all three are connected. And there's a strong connection between obesity and depression, according to the APA. For instance, when you're stressed and depressed, you may engage in binge eating or chose unhealthy foods. Treating obesity can help decrease depression symptoms, but work closely with your doctor to make sure your weight-loss goals are attainable and won’t just add to your stress. If you’re unsure if you’re at a healthy weight, talk to your doctor. "Discuss and plan a target weight with your doctor to maintain," Koh says. Practice portion control and focus on lean proteins, whole grains, and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Avoid Drugs and Alcohol

Using mood-altering substances such as drugs and alcohol can be risky for people with depression, so it's best to avoid them, Koh says. Although drugs and alcohol can seem to provide a temporary escape, they may interact with antidepressant medication and worsen how you feel. "Alcohol is a depressant and will actively make depression worse," Koh says, adding that stimulant drugs just mask depression, and your symptoms may return worse than ever. Leaning on substances instead of a proper depression treatment plan can also trigger problems such as dependence, psychosis, and anxiety, he says. If you’re using drugs or alcohol to cope with depression, talk to your doctor.
Build a Support System

No one should have to cope with depression alone, so create your own support team by leaning on friends and family. "Plan scheduled time to spend with them," Koh says. It's also a good idea to give a little of yourself to others as part of managing depression. "Consider volunteering your time to get involved with support groups so you can learn good strategies to deal with your depression from others and share your experiences," he says.
Be Mindful
Thinkstock
It's easy to get distracted and simply go through the motions each day. But taking a little time to focus on and savor the present may help in your battle against depression. Mindfulness means paying attention to your thoughts and sensations without judging them. People with depression who practiced mindfulness saw reduced depression symptoms compared with those who didn't engage in the practice, according to research published in April 2014 in the journal PLOS One. To try mindfulness for yourself, you might find a quiet corner and focus on your breathing without judging the thoughts that come to mind. Or try noticing the sounds, sights, smells, and touch sensations around you for a few minutes, and then let them go.
