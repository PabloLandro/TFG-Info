Tinea medication
2-minute read
Listen
Tinea is a rash that is caused by a fungus growing on the skin. Tinea can be treated with a medicine on your skin or medicines taken orally.
Tinea makes the skin itchy and red, causing it to crack, split and peel. It is known by many other names. If the rash is circular, it can be called ringworm. It is also called athlete’s foot and jock itch, depending on where it is.
You can also get tinea on your head and on your toenails and fingernails.
Types of tinea medicines
There is plenty you can do to help. It is important to keep the area dry. It can help to wearing clothing made of natural fibres that ‘breathe’.
Most people will be able to heal their tinea with medications that you put on the skin. These could be creams, ointments and gels. These contain an antifungal medicine and sometimes a steroid-type medicine. You can get most of these over the counter from your pharmacist.
Some people will also need oral medications. They might be needed if the tinea is widespread, if the treatment to the skin hasn’t worked, if it is on the head or if it keeps coming back. You need a prescription from your doctor to get these.
Important information about tinea medication
All medicines can have side effects.
Before using tinea medicines you can ask your doctor or pharmacist about:
the side effects of your tinea medicines
their benefits
what to do if you miss a dose
what to do if you experience side effects
Talk to your doctor as soon as possible if you feel unwell when taking your medicines. Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your doctor.

Antifungal medicines for treating children with ringworm | Cochrane
Tinea capitis, or ringworm, is a fungal infection of the scalp caused mainly by two species of fungi called Trichophyton and Microsporum. It is common in children. Most fungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams applied directly to the skin (topical treatments). However, because the fungal infection is found at the root of the hair follicles, where topical treatments cannot reach, tinea capitis always requires medication administered by mouth so that the treatment spreads throughout the entire body (systemic treatments). There are several different types of antifungal medicines available.

Oral antifungal drugs for treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis) | Cochrane
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the feet that is easily spread and difficult to get rid of. This review compared different oral antifungal drugs (i.e. drugs taken by mouth), and it included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. There are several different kinds of oral treatments, and the trials we found considered all the oral drugs used to treat athlete's foot. We found terbinafine and itraconazole to be more effective than placebo. And we found terbinafine to be more effective than griseofulvin. Griseofulvin is a treatment that was developed much earlier than the new treatments, such as terbinafine and itraconazole; these newer treatments tend to be most evaluated. Trials of other drugs were not large enough to show differences between them. All drugs had side-effects; gastrointestinal effects were the most common.
