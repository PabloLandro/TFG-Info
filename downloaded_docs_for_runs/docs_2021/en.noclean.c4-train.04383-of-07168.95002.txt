Our Price Match Guarantee does not apply to competitor's bonus offers, Ebay auctions, free offers, auction websites, non-retail(wholesale) websites, private sales, special orders, typographical errors, clearance sales, liquidation sales, mail-in rebate offers, or where a service commitment is included in the transaction.

Why are online bracing products less expensive than the ones purchased in a physician office?
When you purchase your brace online, there are certain services and benefits that you won’t receive. Services that you will receive from your medical professional in the office but not from your online retailer may include:
assessing your medical condition to determine the most appropriate brace
measuring you to determine the appropriate brace size
assessing brace fit
billing your insurance company for the brace
in person brace return or exchange if necessary
Comparing the cost of a device online vs. the cost of the same device provided in a medical professional’s office is not a valid comparison. As the consumer, you have to decide what is right for you and consider the trade-offs. Sure, online products tend to be less expensive – but you also lose the important services and benefits outlined above. Please make your decision carefully and, when in doubt, consult your medical provider and insurance company.
Moneyback Guarantee
Quite simply, we want your purchase to work for you. Our no-risk, unconditional 30-Day Money Back Guarantee allows you ample time to see if your investment in your health is doing the job you expect and deserve. If, after trying the product, you are not completely satisfied, you may exchange the item or return the product for a refund of the full purchase price (minus shipping & handling) within 30 days of the purchase. Be advised the return must be received in our warehouse prior to the end of the 30 days for your refund to be processed. Please note: The DonJoy Defiance Custom Knee Brace does not qualify for the 30 Day Money Back Guarantee because it is custom made.

Product Description
Is the Airheel Arch & Heel Brace right for me?
Designed to support Plantar Fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis. May be worn during activity. Try our Brace Advisor for personalized product recommendations to meet your needs!
Designed to support and protect:
Plantar fasciitis
Achilles tendonitis
Best for:
All activities
Our Best Solution For Foot Pain
The Aircast AirHeel™ brace supports plantar fasciitis and achilles tendonitis by applying pulsating compression with every step, which helps reduce swelling and enhance circulation. The AirHeel brace is ideal for all activity levels. Constructed of lightweight breathable fabric, the AirHeel brace is simple to apply - just slip it on like a sock and adjust the fit with one strap.
Here's how it works...The AirHeel™ brace is equipped with two interconnected aircells located under the foot arch and in back of the achilles tendon. When you take a step, the first air chamber (under the arch) begins to collapse thus reducing the stress to the plantar fascia under the arch. Air is forced into the chamber surrounding the achilles tendon which then inflates. The inflated achilles chamber applies compression to the achilles tendon to shorten the lever arm thus reducing strain on the tendon.
Product Features...and the benefits you'll experience!
Aircell Technology
You'll feel like your foot is getting a massage with every step due to the pulsating pneumatic compression that minimizes swelling and enhances circulation.
Complete Comfort
Lightweight and breathable materials makes this brace extremely comfortable to wear with a shoe.
Universal Fit
Can be worn on the left or right foot
Extra Support
Optional removable stabilizers that contain 2 small plastic stays in the sides of the ankle for added ankle support (not necessary for plantar fasciitis).
Latex-Free
Made of a latex-free, compression spandex with air cells encased in waterproof nylon and adhered together with a Velcro strap.
Streamlined Design
Easily fits in shoes and can be worn in all activities.
Product Care
Hand wash with mild detergent

Will this product help drop foot
The Aircast AirHeel is designed for Plantarfacistis, Heel pain, and Achilles Tendonitis. For drop foot we do have an AFO that is designed to help provide the needed support. https://www.betterbraces.com/procare-super-lite-a-f-o
salman at 8/3/2016 11:08 AM
i have planter and flat arch in my left foot wanted to know if i should get the product for both feet? cause i feel that way it would support and keep both my legs aligned? and also wanted to know would this product fit in my existing shoe size which is a 9, or should i buy a bigger size shoe? and since i have both plantar and flat foot, this product will give me arch support also?
If both of your feet are hurting, then yes, you should get them for both feet. Otherwise just the affected foot. The brace should fit in your normal size of shoe.
Sydney at 7/24/2016 1:17 AM
I work on my feet for 8+ hours a day, sometimes never getting the chance to sit. I have developed somewhat severe plantar fasciitis and have heel spurs. Will this help me out?
The Aircast Airheel Arch and Heel Brace will assist with the Plantar Fasciitis due to the air cell begins to collapse as you take a step, reducing the stress to the plantar fascia under the arch.
Teresa at 7/21/2016 8:00 AM
Is the air puff ball like inside called the stabilizer? Or is the stabilizer a metal rod.
The optional removable stabilizers that contain 2 small plastic stays in the sides of the ankle for added ankle support. These stays prevent the ankle from rolling.
Evan at 7/8/2016 9:00 AM
I have been diagnosed with tarsal tunnel in both ankles and slight nerve damage in my left ankle. Would this brace provide the support I need to run again and begin training for long distance running?
This brace will provide support for plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and general heel pain. It applies compression with every step to help reduce swelling and enhance circulation. It is also made form very breathable material. The Aircast Airlift PTTD Brace may be another you take a look at. https://www.betterbraces.com/aircast-airlift-pttd-brace
Richard O. at 7/6/2016 4:57 AM
I have Plantar Facilitus what is the best solution for me . My shoe size is 12 Wide. thank you
The Airheel Arch & Heel Support is the best brace we carry for plantar fasciitis. The sizes are differentiated by women's and men's shoe sizes and the size chart is located on the website. https://www.betterbraces.com/aircast-airheel-ankle-brace
Mairead at 6/29/2016 6:16 PM
My 9 year old plays sports and is very active. She was just told by the pediatrician that she has Aquilies tendinitis. We are doing the exceecises by the dr and she is wearing heel cups in her cleats. She is still in pain. Would this be something that a 9 year old would benefit from? She is a shoe size 4/5 so I'm not sure if they come in child sizes? Thank! Your reviews were excellent so I am eager to hear your response.
Unfortunately we do not have child sizes, the Small fits up to a woman's size 8 which would be too big for your daughter. The DonJoy Double Strap Ankle Wrap may provide some achilles tendonitis relief and is sized by the circumference of the ankle which may fit your daughter better. https://www.betterbraces.com/donjoy-double-strap-ankle-wrap
Sue at 6/22/2016 5:09 PM
My shoe size is right at 8.5 (Womens size) some shoes I buy are size 9. What size do you recommend?
If the majority of your shoes are 8.5 we would suggest the small Aircast Airheel Arch & Heel Support. The spandex expands so it will stretch to accommodate your foot.
Jen at 5/11/2016 10:35 PM
Im a stay at home mom so im around the house 24/7, can i wear the brace around the house with no shoes and it still be benificial?
Yes you can wear this brace without shoes and still get a benefit from it
Matt at 4/21/2016 8:34 PM
I have recently sprained my ankle and usually I can walk on it without any pain within 4 days. This current sprain has lasted 11 days and I can barely walk on it, probably the worst sprained ankle I've had... and I've had about 3 on this ankle. Would this product be recommended for this? I plan on using it for daily use.
If you want something to help you walk with less pain you should take a look at one of our walking boots. Any of them can be worn and it will immobilize the ankle and give it time to heal and allow you to walk with less pain. If you are looking for an ankle support to wear then I would suggest the Aircast Air Sport ankle brace
https://www.betterbraces.com/aircast-airsport-ankle-brace
Madison at 4/10/2016 2:52 PM
2 questions. I am debating between getting a small or medium. I wear womens 8-8.5 wide. I am also a long distance runner & would I be able to wear it in my sneakers for running?
I suggest the medium and yes you can run in the brace
Jill at 3/29/2016 4:26 AM
I broke my heel bone in the middle of December 2015. Lucky for me no surgery was needed just a soft cast no weight on my foot for 3 weeks then a walking cast with minimal weight for 4/5 weeks. My heel still experiences some pain when walking in flat soled shoes for short distances and walking over a mile in sneakers. Will this product be my best chance to get back to moderate workouts (jogging and spin)?
Yes this would be the best brace to wear to cusion that heel
Trudy at 12/8/2015 8:32 AM
I am recovering from foot surgery(Oct1) they repaired the Achilles tendon and removed a heel spur.I stiil have a heel spur on the bottom of my right foot(the surgery foot) I'm on my feet 8hrs a day on concrete floors Would the Aircast air heel be beneficial to use? I want to avoid more surgeries.
Yes the Aircast air Heel will cushion the heel while you are on your feet and should alleviate some of your pain.
Barb at 11/30/2015 7:26 PM
What are the stabilizers?
Barb
The Stabilizers are two rigid plastic pieces that are inserted at the top of the brace to give mild ankle support. They are removable
Emily at 11/30/2015 7:14 AM
HI i was wondering If this brace was good i am a horseback rider and i am always having my heals down and would it fit in a riding boot and be good for riding. thanks and also is it returnable.
Emily
It would fit into the boots fine and there is a 60 day return policy
beck at 11/5/2015 12:12 PM
hello, i have plantar fasciitis:
will this help me
should i order with stabilators or without
i need to order for my left and right foot but I couldn't find option on checkout section. thank you
You do not need the stabilizers for plantar fascitis
Ben Dize at 11/5/2015 7:02 AM
I have severe tendonosis in my Achilles tendon. Would this product help that situation?
Ben
This brace could be some benefit to you. The air cushion in the heel is compressed with every step and the air moves into the Achilles area to provide compression which can help decrease pain.
Sheila at 10/29/2015 1:51 PM
I am recovering from a fractured fifth metatarsal and going from an aircast to a sneaker .. Would this help support the foot?
Hello,
Thank you for Contacting Donjoy.
The Airheel can be used to help with plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis, and heel pain.
Please call us with any additional questions.
thank you.
Angela at 10/22/2015 8:21 PM
My 12 year old daughtet dances ballet on pointe 5 days a week. She has developed achilles tendonitis. Is your product appropriate for wearing in pointe shoes? Can this help her?
Angela
The brace is very thin except where the air bladder is located under the heel. I do not believe it would fit inside that shoe
Jim at 9/7/2015 5:50 AM
I usually wear a size 11 shoe but I have wide feet and ankles should I order a M or L?
Jim
These can run a little small so I would order the large
Joan at 8/6/2015 11:13 PM
Can I wear air cast to sleep?
Joan
Yes you can wear this brace while you sleep
md at 7/28/2015 12:09 PM
How much does one of these weigh without the ankle support insertion?
.55 lbs in weight.
Michele at 6/30/2015 7:17 AM
I have been diagnosed with tenosynovitis and told to tape. The tape is ripping the skin off of my foot. Any suggestions? Will the aircast air heel work with or without being taped?
An ankle brace will provide better support without the breakdown of the skin. The Stabilizing Pro Ankle brace is most like a ankle tape

Lee Buff at 6/18/2015 3:09 PM
I am wondering if the small pump device that is sold to pump air into the larger boots will also work for these airheel support braces.
No, the Aircast Airheel can not be pumped up externally. They are pre inflated aircells
Lisa at 1/13/2015 6:11 PM
How do I know whether I should order this brace with or without stabilizers?
Lisa
The stabilizers are for ankle support and can be removed if you do not need them
Jayson at 12/20/2014 1:24 PM
I have Achilles tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and longitudinal split tear of the peroneus brevis. I am looking for a brace I can wear with my shoes to help with these ailments. From your product selection would this be the best fit?
Jayson
The Airheel will help decrease pain associated with the Achillies tendonitis and bursitis because of the air cusions in the heel and in the back of the brace. the stabilizers in the brace will proved mild stability of the ankle .
kim at 11/2/2014 5:01 PM
I just received this brace. Should I wear it all the time to start, or should I start off slowly with only a few minutes (or hours) at a time?
Kim
You can wear the brace full time from the start
Bicky at 10/15/2014 5:34 PM
I am a gymnast and I was wondering if the air cells would pop if I jumped on the brace. I would be landing on it hard, but I only weight 85 pounds. I would be using it everyday.
Bicky
The Aircast Air Heel has been tested to hold under 1000lbs of pressure so it should not pop from you landing on it
Brad at 10/9/2014 5:16 AM
Good morning I'm having some ankle and foot issues with plantar faciiatis and bone spurs would this product be helpful for both? Thanks
Brad
Yes this would be a great product for you to try. There is a iar bladder under the heel that will cusioin the heel area that gets painfull in plantar fascitis
Jannetta at 9/22/2014 12:34 PM
Are the stabilizers removable? Do the stabilizers keep the ankle from bending?
Jannetta
The stabilizers just give more support for the ankle but they do allow the ankle to move. They are removable
Nancy at 8/23/2014 7:18 AM
I have a torn plantar fascia ligament, not plantar fasciitis. Will this brace help with that? Thanks
Nancy
If you are having heel pain then the brace will help. If you are having foot pain I would suggest a walking boot to immobilize you foot and ankle. https://www.betterbraces.com/procare-xceltrax-ankle
Erin at 8/23/2014 4:48 AM
I wear a size 9 shoe but have a narrow foot. Would the small be a better fit for me? Also, what does with stabilizers consist of?
Erin
These are not very wide so I would stick with the medium. The stabilizers are two plastic pieces that are removable that are in the ankle portion of the brace for ankle stabilization
kviest at 8/22/2014 7:45 AM
My 11 year old son is a gymnast. Are the closures on this product strong enough for barefoot tumbling on a spring floor and for sprint running on a vault runway?
Also, is the arch support/cushion positioned toward the inside of the cast? In the photo it looks like it is also along the outside edge which would defeat the purpose of wearing it for him.
Thank you.
The Airheel is not an arch support, it is for plantar fascitis and heel pain, so the air bladder is over the heel of the brace. It will withstand running and tumbling. The Airsport PTTD Brace is an arch support and the air bladder is along the arch of the foot. This brace also has two plstic stays anlong either side of the ankle. There is only a small strap going across the back of the brace at eh achillies area. This brace is for ankle support and arch support.
Anthony Serritella at 8/18/2014 11:45 AM
Depending on manufacturer, my shoe size is 11, 11.5 or 12. Should I go with medium or large?
Anthony
I would suggest the large.
Tim at 6/24/2014 7:18 PM
If I plan to jog using the aircast, should I get one for each foot? I only have pain in my right foot.
No you would not need to get one for the other foot, only the foot that is bothering you
Dea at 5/4/2014 2:45 PM
I have plantar fasciitis, loose ligaments, tight tendons, a neuroma, and a metatarsal that is too long in both feet. I sprained both ankles and fractured my leg a few years ago and these are the results of that accident. I need something for the plantar fasciitis and that supports my ankles since they tend to turn under while I walk/workout. Would this be the support that I am looking for?
The AirHeel will help with the plantar fascitis and if you get the brace with the stabilizer it will give you some ankle support
Buffy Weiss at 4/8/2014 12:48 PM
What is the difference between the Aircast Airheel Ankle Brace with stabilizer and the one without the stabilizer? Do I need one with a stabilizer for Planter Fasciitis?
Thank you for your question. The Aircast Airheel Ankle Brace with stabilizer will contain 2 small plastic stays in the sides of the ankle to provide an additional support to the ankle joint. This is not a necessary feature for plantar Fasciitis.
JON at 3/16/2014 11:40 AM
Over the last 2 years I've badly strained both my achilles tendons without any tearing playing softball. Is the Aircast Airheel Ankle Cast the right product for me to wear while playing for prevention of future strains of my achilles tendons? If I wear one on each foot, will this restrict my speed while running the bases?
Jon
The aircast Airheel will support the achillies tendon by compression over the area, it is indicated for decreasing some of the pain associated with strain but will not prevent further injury. Only a strengthen program ans stretching regime will help to prevent injury. You can play sports while wearing the braces
Janelle at 1/24/2014 10:46 AM
I was diagnosed with PTT a couple years ago and my foot has never fully healed. It has started acting up really bad again. I have a very high arch (def not flat footed!!!). I am not sure which brace to go with. What would you recommend? Thank you!
Thank you for your question. We offer a brace designed for PTTD called Aircast Airlift PTTD Brace.
The AirLift PTTD Brace is designed for the treatment of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD), or for early signs and symptoms of the adult acquired flat foot. Since it can be use for either PTTD or Flat foot, this is the brace that would be recommended for you.
Al at 1/1/2014 1:53 AM
Hi, I have flat feet and suffer from plantar fasciitis . I play beach volleyball twice a week and my fascia contracts if I'm not constantly stretching it during game. I was wondering if the airheel could be worn during the game? also is the fit loose or tight on the foot?

Thank you for contacting DJo. The Airheel can be worn while playing a sport and the fit is pretty snug. If you have any other questions please let us know

I ruptured my Achilles tendon about 18 months ago. I exercise, but still have some soreness during and after workouts. Will this product help support and soreness while working out?
Joe
Thank you for contacting product support. The Airheel will help with soreness during a workout because it is a air cushion over the back of you heel area where the Achilles attaches. It does not however offer any ankle support.
Doug at 12/3/2013 7:40 AM
I'm eight weeks into recovery from a Plantar fasciotomy with Heel spur removal. Will the Airheel Aircast help with some of the left over pain that I feel when I walk. Every time I take a step there is still some pain as I'm putting wait on the incision scar.
Doug,
The aircell may add some cushion and shift some of the weight from your heel. There will still be some pressure on your incision as this brace will not keep the area free of "weight bearing". Thank you for your question.
Antwon at 11/24/2013 10:22 AM
I have insertional achilles tendinosis and experience pain in the back of the heel when i push off of or land on the ball of my foot during running and jumping. Will the AirHeel relieve pain for this particular type of achilles tendinopathy?
Antwon
Thank you for contacting product support. The Aircast Airheel should help ease some of your pain. The airbladders are located on the arch and on the back of the brace over the Achillies tendon. When you step down the air in the arch pushes into the back aircell to hit your heel and achillies.

Do you recommend this product for people with diabetes?
The brace should be fine for someone with diabetes. Just make sure to get the correct size and always check your feet when taking off the brace to make sure there are not abrasions or cuts
John at 4/24/2013 10:05 AM
I will be returning to work after <a href="/ankle-injuries/achilles-tendonitis">Achilles' tendon</a> surgical repair, will this air cast provide support for my achilles, I spend a lot of time on my feet.?
The Airheel gives some relief for the Achilles Tendon, but is not recommended post Achilles surgery. I would ask your physician what he would like you wearing.
Curtis at 4/3/2013 4:16 PM
What kind of warranty does the Air Cast have?
I had bought a pair for both feet and the A-C lost it inflation after one month.
Hello, Curtis -
The AirCast has a 6 month warranty.
If you have further questions, please feel free to contact our product specialists at 888-405-3251.
Thank you and have a wonderful day!
Jo at 4/3/2013 10:06 AM
Can I wear aircast ankle brace without shoes? Will it get damaged? What about wearing them with sandals?
Hello, Jo -
The aircast ankle brace is not recommended to be worn without shoes. It is recommended to be worn inside of a shoe.
Thank you and have a wonderful day!
Nick at 2/3/2013 9:19 PM
Can I run with the air cast on?
Hello, Nick -
Yes you can run with the Aircast Airheel Ankle Brace on. We recommend that you speak with your doctor first to make sure that he/she has cleared you for running-type of activities.
Thank you and have a wonderful day!
Mica at 1/27/2013 7:34 AM
My foot pain is gotten so bad that I can barely walk. I have custom made inserts that aren't doing a thing and I need to know the best product to treat my PF? I am ready to pay what I need to even have them shipped overnight. In some of your splits I don't see a lot of arch support. I need something to wear all day/night. Please tell me which is the best splint/boot for extreme PF.
Hello, Mica -
The Aircast Airheel is a good product to use while walking or ambulating. However, for nighttime use, we recommend the ProCare Dorsiwedge NIght Splint.
https://www.betterbraces.com/procare-dorsiwedge-plantar-fasciitis-night-splint
If you would like to get the Aircast AirHeel/DNS Care Kit, that would include the combination of the AirHeel brace and night splint.

If you have further questions, please feel free to contact our product specialists at 888-405-3251.
Thank you and have a wonderful day!
Melissa at 7/22/2012 6:39 AM
Can the brace be worn inside <a href="/volleyball">volleyball</a> shoes as well as the volleyball ankle guards?
Melissa,
The airheel is made of neoprene, it is not very thick, but wearing it with an ankle brace for volleyball may make it too think to wear in your volleyball shoes.
Krissy at 7/15/2012 5:00 PM
Will the airheel cast alleviate arch pain?
Will it offer any arch support while walking it standing?
Krissy,
Thank you for contacting DJO Global. The Aircast AirHeel brace treats plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis, and heel pain by applying pulsating compression with every step, which helps reduce swelling and enhance circulation. The AirHeel brace is ideal for all activity levels. Constructed of lightweight breathable fabric, the AirHeel brace is simple to apply - just slip it on like a sock and adjust the fit with one strap. In therory, because it alleviates Platar Fasciitis you should have reduced arch pain.
Sherry at 7/14/2012 4:16 PM
I should order a medium based on shoe size. However, I need to know how big around the upper support strap will accommodate. People have asked already, but the answer just points to shoe length size, and that doesn't help. How big around is the upper lower leg strap? Is it the same size for all shoe sizes?
Sherry,
Thank you for your question the length of the strap is 4 inches. The top of the brace will fit the circumference of 12 inches
Teresa at 5/2/2012 9:15 AM
I have PTTD and the PTTD brace is so uncomfortable I cannot stand it. But the bottom air in the foot does give me some relief and lifts my foot up some. I just cannot take anything against my ankle. Would this aircast airheel ankle brace help me.
Thanks,
Teresa
The AirCast Air Heel does have an aircell on the arch and on the Achilles Tendon, however; it does not provide ankle stability. So depending on what you are looking for, this could be an option for you.
Elaine at 3/27/2012 5:57 PM
I am a female who wears a size 9-10 shoe depending on manufacturer. However I also have large legs. My ankle is measures around 11 inches. I want to be sure I get a size large enough to fit my ankle. Should I order a large? I went to the orthopedist and was diagnosed with either a partial calf or achilles tear. I was able to stand on tiptoes, point and flex so not a complete rupture. All the doc said after xrays was that it was a partial tear and to R.I.C.E. it. I have my own cam walker which she said was unnecessary. A day after she told me to not wear it, I felt a pain again on the back of my calf but lower this time. I believe it tore again but still not severe. I want to buy a support for the achilles area while I wear my cam boot. Would this be a good option? Thank you
The AirHeel will provide achilles support while wearing a boot or a shoe. Based on your size, you should order a medium.
Jamie at 8/10/2011 4:45 PM
I am a cashier/sales associate with plantar fasciitis. Would the Aircast Airheel Ankle brace be a good fit for me? Also, is the brace Latex Free?
The brace is latex free, and it will be a great option for your plantar fascitis. Especially cause you are up on your feet all day, this will help support and massage that area.
Janice at 7/18/2011 9:54 AM
Can you pls tell me if the Aircast Airheel Ankle Brace
Will help with a neuroma?
Thanks,
Janice Berthold
It depends on where the neuroma is. Normally the are up at the toes, and this aircell sits in the arch of your food and provides support there. So if it is at your toes, it will not probide you with the ultimate support needed.
Chelsea at 7/9/2011 12:09 PM
I am a dancer, I have been told by doctors that there is nothing they can do for my pain. They said it was probalby tendonitis. It hurts most around the achilles tendon. I am at a dead end and need help. I would say my pain is moderate to severe, will this brace help me? also, is the brace flexible enought to dance in(i have to point my toes!)? lastly, my last aircast was pre-inflated, but seemed to loose the air over time...what should i do about this?
Thank you so much for your help!
The Aircast Airheel Ankle Brace is meant to be worn with a shoe, will you be dancing with a shoe on? If so, it would work. The aircells are inflated. There is a 6 month warranty. If the aircell deflates during that time, please contact us so we can swap it out for you.
Tom M. at 5/30/2011 1:44 PM
I have a swollen achilles tendon in my right ankle. I get cramps in my right foot from alot of stop and go driving, will this brace help me. Thank you Tom M.
Yes the Aircast Airheel Ankle Brace would be recommended for someone like you with a swollen achilles tendon. The dual aircell technology will help to compression your achilles to press the swelling out of that area alleviating pressure and pain. Should you have any additional questions please contact us again.
Jodi at 4/6/2011 10:14 AM
I don't know what is wrong with my achilles tendon but I have pain there. Does the Aircast Airheel help other achilles tendon pain or just achilles tendonitis?
Hey Jodi,
The Aircast Airheel has two aircells in it, one under the foot and one on the achilles. The air pulses back and forth creating a massaging affect which loosens up the tissue. If your Achilles pain comes from chronic tightness then yes, the airheel will help. If your achilles pain comes from something else(for instance over-pronation, ankle mal-alignment, Ligament laxity, etc) then no, the Airheel will not help.
Thanks
katherine at 3/28/2011 6:02 AM
Does the aircast airheel provide arch support when sitting or lying down?
Hi Katherine,
The Aircast Airheel does not provide any arch support. The Airheel is for people who have Plantar Fasciitis and/or Achilles Tendonitis. The Aircell under the foot does not support the arch.
Thanks
john at 3/12/2011 9:23 AM
Can I wear the air heel along with orthotics?
John,
Yes you may wear the AirCast airheel with your custom orthotics.
Karen at 3/7/2011 5:43 AM
Does the width of the foot impact what size I should order? I am a womens 10 but I wear the widest shoe.
Thanks
Karen, the foot section of the AirCast Air Heel is made out of neoprene so it is forgiving and stretches out, therefore it should strech to your foot width. Based on your shoe size you would fit into a size medium which is part number 09AM. Should you have any additional questions please do not hesitate to contact www.betterbraces.com again.
Bill Mitchell at 2/6/2011 8:19 AM
I went to my podiatrist and it turns out I have Peroneal tendon tendonitis and a bit of plantar fasciitis. Will the Aircast Airheel help me to heal versus a full Aircast boot? About 6 years ago I had achillis tendonitis and plantar fasciitis and the full boot did the trick along with the night splint. I would like to avoid the full boot if possible. Is a neoprene sock helpful also?
The Airheel is great at providing comfort and massaging relief for the plantar fasciitis and the Achilles tendon areas. The Peroneals do run along the side of the Achilles tendon area so it will get some massaging relief as well. As far as the airheel healing the problem, it cannot heal it on its own, but it can provide some relief and massaging to the area while you are active during the day. I suggest you check with your podiatrist to see if the tendonitis is as severe as before, when he had you immobilize the area. If it is not as severe, then using the airheel will help in providing you relief and massage the area while it is healing. We also have a Dorsal night splint that you can combine with the airheel. When wear it at night, it will put your foot in a flexed position that will give the plantar fasciitis, Achilles and peroneals a gentle stretch, which is prove to help in relieving discomfort in these areas.
David at 12/23/2010 7:52 PM
I have severe plantar fasciitis and have tried numerous arch supports with limited success. I weigh 450 pounds. Will your product stand up to my weight?
The Airheel is tested to 1000 lbs of pressure. Walking adds 2-3x your body weight to ground forces; so, the product does have a good chance of holding up for you.
Jill at 11/18/2010 4:09 PM
If I suffer from <a href="/ankle-injuries/achilles-tendonitis">achilles tendonitis</a>, is it better to immobilize the foot completely or will the aircast air heel really work? I also wear a size women's 5, will the small be too big?
Hello Jill,
You should consult your physician to verify the brace style that they'd like you to wear.
A size small Aircast Airheel will accommodate up to an 8.5 womens.
Steve at 6/27/2010 9:05 AM
Will it fit inside a soccer boot or <a href="/running">running shoe</a>?
Yes, The Aircast Airheel has a low profile design so it fits comfortably inside athletic shoes.

Super item.

My MRI showed more than one tear in my achilles. After wearing a boot for one month, it got better but never went away. Looking on line, I bought the Aircast Arch support. After just 2 weeks, my pain is 85% gone. Thanks for this product.

After dealing with plantar fasciitis for over 2 years and trying everything from injections, acupuncture, physical therapy, night boot, orthotics, etc. nothing had worked.

I had severe pf (don't know if I can correctly spell the real name)

Lacking necessary support for Achilles Tendonitis

This brace didn't alleviate the pain in my Achilles. The level of support is not what I am needing. The cut of the brace actually rubbed an already tender tendon.

I am very happy with the Aircast Airheel
Reviewed by: Holly
My mother-in-law was told by her doctor that she needed to wear a medical boot for her heel spur. While it helped the heel spur, it made her hips hurt from walking unevenly, not to mention that her balance was thrown way off.
So I bought her the Aircast Airheel and she just sent this text message to me while she was out shopping: "I am very happy with how my foot is better using the ankle brace you sent me. All this walking and I'm still going. Thank you."
Thank you Better Braces for a great product that is cost effective and works!

Miraculous
Reviewed by: LoraC
Verified Purchase
I have tried all sorts of inserts and arch supports; none of them works like this does. I used one years ago and all of my plantar fasciitis disappeared. Lately it flared up again and I couldn't find my old brace, so I was thrilled to find they still made this. Then I found the old one, which still works, so now I have one to wear while I wash the other. If the chafing from the rear ankle pad starts to bother me, wearing socks underneath usually works. When I put it on, the pain is better instantly. Wonderful product!

As an avid racquetball player my foot takes a pounding. After a few cortizone shots over the years I ran into a dead end where the shots were not helping.

Why are online bracing products less expensive than the ones purchased in a physician office?
When you purchase your brace online, there are certain services and benefits that you won’t receive. Services that you will receive from your medical professional in the office but not from your online retailer may include:
assessing your medical condition to determine the most appropriate brace
measuring you to determine the appropriate brace size
assessing brace fit
billing your insurance company for the brace
in person brace return or exchange if necessary
Comparing the cost of a device online vs. the cost of the same device provided in a medical professional’s office is not a valid comparison. As the consumer, you have to decide what is right for you and consider the trade-offs. Sure, online products tend to be less expensive – but you also lose the important services and benefits outlined above. Please make your decision carefully and, when in doubt, consult your medical provider and insurance company.
