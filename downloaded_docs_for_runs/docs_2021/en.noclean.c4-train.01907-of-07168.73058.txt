Skimmed milk lowers blood pressure
30/11/2005
Drinking skimmed milk can reduce risk of high blood pressure by half, a new study has claimed.
Researchers from the University of Navarra followed the dairy consumption of 6,000 people over a two-year period.
They found those who drank skimmed milk and took other dairy products, but not full-fat milk, were 50 per cent less likely to suffer from high blood pressure compared to those who consumed little or no skimmed milk and dairy products.
Although previous studies have linked dairy consumption to blood pressure, Professor Álvaro Alonso's study is the first to prove that this is the case in adults.
The research team concluded that their findings, which appear in the American Journal of Nutrition, could help create a "clearer definition of dietary guidelines".
The UK Blood Pressure Association estimates that over 16 million people in Britain have high blood pressure.
High blood pressure can greatly increase risk from stroke, heart attack and heart failure.
