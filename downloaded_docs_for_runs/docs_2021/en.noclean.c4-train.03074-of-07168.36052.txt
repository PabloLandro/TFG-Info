Keranique IS Special, After All
6/13/2017
0 Comments
Let’s just stop tormenting our hair with useless and unknown hair loss treatments. Females are usually fussy about things; but when it comes to finding solution for hair loss, why do we jump at the first one that comes our way?
Moreover, how can we miss the super powerful, FDA-approved, clinically-proven Keranique hair regrowth treatment?
What is it?
First, know what it is not. It is not some casual hair loss product.
It is a serious topical treatment designed to treat diffuse shedding, which is a typical characteristic of female hair loss.
A bold treatment, you can say
Using an anti-hypertension drug in a hair product certainly makes a bold formula!
When doctors found out that this drug, called minoxidil, when administered to patients, triggered lush hair growth on them they were flabbergasted. After study and research, it was found that this compound has a property to activate follicles to grow hair.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of minoxidil in 2 per cent concentration for women and 5 per cent concentration for men in hair regrowth products. FDA is a body that regulates drugs. It does not regulate cosmetics. You can find FDA approval in Keranique’s products because its treatment uses a drug.
Keranique makers have harnessed the power of minoxidil and created their special hair regrowth formula.
Precautions to take when using minoxidil-infused formula
It is for external use only.
Make sure it does not enter your eyes.
Wash hands properly after usage or you may wear gloves
Keep away from kids and pets
Pregnant women and breastfeeding women must not use the formula
The name is not limited to hair regrowth treatment. You can find Keranique shampoo & other hair products like conditioner, hairspray, mousse, hair mask, dry shampoo, oil, and more. The entire collection, plus the treatment, is available online.

Reasons For Hair Loss In Women, And What You Can Do About It
6/1/2017
2 Comments
Here’s a shocking fact: of all Americans experiencing thinning or loss of hair, women make up 40% of the total! Can you believe it? Well, it’s true! When we think of people going bald, it always brings to mind Uncle Harry or Cousin Bill, which means a male always.
If only things were that simple! But the fact of the matter is Aunt Henrietta or Cousin Betsy are just as likely to experience hair loss problems. Here are some reasons why most women and men face hair loss problems.
Physical Stress:
When you have a really stressful event, like a car crash or a long-term health problem, it can cause your hair to fall out. In most cases, hair returns to its natural state after the trauma is over – but not always.
Emotional Stress:
The longer it goes on, the more damage it can do to your hair. Try to relax. In the meanwhile, try using an effective and reputed hair care system like Keranique which is designed to repair and restore hair.
Pregnancy:
The chemical balance changes that your body makes while going through pregnancy can cause hair loss. Fortunately, hair quickly reverts to its normal state after the baby is born.
Too Much Vitamin A:
Since when did consuming vitamins become bad? When you over do them. By reducing Vitamin A (back to the doctor recommended amount), hair should return to its normal state.
Lack of Protein:
If you’re not getting enough protein in your system, you hair will let you know! Easily remedied by consuming more protein rich foods like eggs, fish, and meat.
Heredity:
Not much you can do about that. You can turn the tables on those genes you inherited by using special hair treatment formulas (such as those made by Keranique). It helps a lot!
Anemia:
If you’re losing your hair, ask your doctor to do a blood test to check and see if you have anemia. If you do, a change of diet or a prescription may do the trick.
Dramatic Weight Loss:
Too much, too fast! Talk about upsetting your body’s chemistry and making things go haywire! Stay away from fad diets. Plan to lose weight over a healthy period of time.
There are a number of other possible causes for female hair loss including the use of antidepressants, blood thinners, birth control pills, chronic diseases, over-styling, using harsh chemicals on your hair and, of course, just simple aging. Best thing to do? Simply do what you can about the things you can manage, and not worry about the rest!

1 Comment
Millions of women suffer from thinning of manes. This snatches away the beauty of one of their most important personality assets. Hair has the power to transform your looks; but when they are damaged and fall they can mar your appearance and even make you look older than your true age.
Expert solution for hair loss: Keranique
What it is: This is a serious hair regrowth treatment. It uses 2 per cent minoxidil. The treatment is approved by the FDA.
What it is not: This is not a casual hair product. Although you need no doctor’s prescription to begin the treatment, you must take an initial consultation in case you are suffering from some serious medical condition or are under medication.
Keranique is not for women who are pregnant and breastfeeding.
Myth busted: It is believed that Keranique’s hair regrowth treatment is expensive.
It is not.
The treatment is not going to empty your wallet. It is meant for all strata of the society. There are exclusive offers available online. You can also avail yourself bonus gifts on order of the brand’s hair regrowth system.
Time of results: According to a study, it takes about 8-12 weeks to get results. There are cases when nothing happens before this time period. The treatment takes time, but is found to be a sure shot remedy to curb hair loss due to aging and genes.
In case nothing happens after 16-20 weeks of usage, stop using the treatment and consult a doctor. Your hair loss may be due to some other reason. That’s why the treatment is not working. You need to address the reason first.
Recommended dose of Keranique: Use it two times a day, one ml each time. Apply the formula directly on a clean scalp. Use a dropper for application. Please wash your hair before application so that the scalp is free of dirt, debris, and excess oil.

Keranique Hair Regrowth Treatments – Proven Solution for Hair Loss Issues

Hair is one of the most integral aspects of your looks that can effectively accentuate your appearance and take your attractiveness to new levels. For this reason, women continue to experiment with different hairstyles to look special and unique each time they step out. However, such experiments remain out of bounds for women with thinning hair. With the weak, limp, dull, and unmanageable nature of thinning hair, it can be almost impossible to keep them looking presentable. To add extra volume and fullness to thinning hair, it would be a good idea to try hair loss treatment products.
Although there are lots of oils, creams, sprays, and powders out there claiming to be hair loss treatment products and promising women thicker and fuller looking hair in no time, it is a fact that most of these products simply do not offer the expected results. This is primarily because these products do not contain active ingredients capable of supporting the regrowth of healthy hair.
Now, take a look at ﻿Keranique reviews﻿ and you will find thousands of women readily recommending the Keranique Hair Regrowth Treatment as an excellent, long-term solution for hair loss issues.
What makes Keranique Hair Regrowth Treatment different from the rest of hair loss treatment products out there is the presence of Minoxidil. This ingredient has been clinically proven to support women in their attempts to regrow fuller and thicker looking hair. This FDA-approved ingredient improves blood, oxygen, and nutrient flow to follicles to create an ideal environment for the regrowth of fuller looking hair. In clinical trials, Minoxidil has exhibited an amazing capability to rejuvenate hair follicles, thereby aiding women in putting an end to their hair loss issues.
To understand the true potential of product, simply take a look at Keranique reviews posted by real users. To share their joy of finding freedom from thinning hair.
