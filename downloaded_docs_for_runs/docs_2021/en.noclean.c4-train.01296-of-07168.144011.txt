Change Socks regularly to help prevent Athleteâ€™s Foot
By [email protected]
February 26, 2015
Category: Advice
Tags: Athleteâ€™s Foot Tinea Pedis changing your socks
Regularly changing your socks can help prevent the occurrence of fungal infections in the foot, particularly tinea pedis or Athlete’s foot. At any given time, fifteen to twenty-five percent of people have it. While one method to avoid Athlete’s foot is to wear sandals, the colder months make wearing sandals much more difficult. Changing socks will also reduce unpleasant foot odor. A statement from the U.K.’s National Health Service suggests that you should wear a clean pair of socks at least once a day to avoid smells. Bacteria are also more likely to sit on the surface of polyester and other synthetic fabric in comparison to materials such as cotton.
Having Athlete’s foot warrants a visit to your physician for proper treatment. If you have any questions regarding Athlete’s foot and how to manage the condition, speak to Dr. Greg Khaimov, DPM of Foot and Ankle Center of Fort Lee, LLC. Dr. Khaimov will attend to all of your foot and ankle needs.
Athlete’s Foot
Athlete’s foot is a very contagious form of fungus, which can infect persons usually resulting in itching, burning, dry, and flaking feet. Treatment is often difficult, because of its contagious and reoccurring nature. Tinea pedis is the fungus which causes athletes foot, and is found to survive in moist humid areas.
Common places found:
-shower floors
-public changing areas
-locker rooms
-Gyms
-bathrooms
-public swimming pools
-socks and shoes
-dormitory style houses
What is Tinea Pedi?
Is the same fungus which causes ringworm, and is known to be spread by direct contact of the infected body part. Or infection can spread by touching other objects and body parts which have been exposed to the fungus. Tinea Pedi is mostly found on the feet, because it is the ideal place for it to thrive on.
Treatment & Prevention
Because of its reoccurring nature of tinea fungus and athletes foot, the best way to treat this condition is with prevention. By taking the necessary precautions such as:
-Wear flips-flops or sandals in locker rooms and public showers.
-Use powders to keep your feet dry
-Keep your feet exposed to light and cool air
-treating athletes foot with special creams/sprays

Flip Flop Drop provides Shower Shoes to combat Athleteâ€™s foot
By [email protected]
August 13, 2014
Category: Foot Care
Tags: Athleteâ€™s Foot Tinea Pedis Fungal Infections Foot Discomfort Flip Flop Flaking Feet
Six Georgia teens have banded together to form Flip Flop Drop, a charity project that has recently been putting shower shoes onto the feet of Georgia’s homeless. The project has most recently been working with Inner City Night Shelter of Savannah, Georgia, where shower shoes are in great need. “As simple as it is, it’s just not in the budget,” says ICNS Executive Director Yvonne Pryor. “You don’t want to just go behind anyone with your bare feet—you’ll get athlete’s foot.”
“Every night, you have individuals after individuals taking a shower,” says Brian Heckmann, an ICNS resident. “Walking in there barefoot is kind of a little disgusting.”
Shower shoes can go a long way in preventing athlete’s foot. To learn more about other methods of prevention, see Dr. Greg Khaimov, DPM of Foot and Ankle Center of Fort Lee, LLC. Dr. Khaimovwill attend to all of your foot and ankle needs.
Athlete’s Foot: The Sole Story
If you suffer from itching, burning, dry, and flaking feet, this may be a sign of athlete's foot. Athlete's foot, also known as tinea pedis, can be extremely contagious, and it often infects shower floors, gyms, socks and shoes, and anywhere else feet may come in contact with. It is commonly found in public changing areas and bathrooms, dormitory style living quarters, around locker rooms and public swimming pools. This condition can also be prevalent in "commons" areas in prisons and residential care facilities.
Solutions to Combat Athlete’s Foot
- Hydrate your feet by using lotion
- Exfoliate
- Buff off nails
- Use of anti-fungal product
- Examine feet and visit your doctor if any suspicious blisters or cuts are present.
What is Tinea?
- Athlete’s foot is often caused by the same fungus that causes ringworm (tinea).
- Tinea can invade other parts of the body as well, if the proper thriving conditions for it are met.
- Tinea thrives in mostly dark, warm and moist environments.
- Although many people never experience athlete’s foot, around 70% of the population may suffer from tinea at some point.
