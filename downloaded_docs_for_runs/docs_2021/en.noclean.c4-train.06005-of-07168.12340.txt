Hoboken, NJ—A new study shows that a topical patch form of Pycnogenol, a French maritime pine bark extract, can help relieve joint inflammation and discomfort associated with osteoarthritis, according to a press release.
The study, titled “Pycnogenol®: supplementary management of symptomatic osteoarthritis with a patch. An observational registry study,” by B. Feragalli et al., published in Minerva Endocrinlogica, looked at 67 subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee: 34 were in the control group, 33 in the Pycnogenol group.
Patients in the Pycnogenol group applied a patch containing 110mg of Pycnogenol twice per day for three weeks. Results showed that the Pycnogenol patch, when compared with standard osteoarthritis management, allowed for faster improvement in symptoms and a decrease in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers. The patch also, the study revealed, significantly reduced C reactive protein and ESR.
According to the press release, at the end of the three-week treatment, subjects reported, among other improvements:
51% improvement of pain score, vs. 19% in the control group
33% improvement of knee function, vs. 16.3% in the control group
91% of participants did not need physiotherapy during the study, vs. 33% in the control group
42.4% of subjects reported no osteoarthritis symptoms, vs. 23.5% in the control group.
Fred Pescatore, M.D., natural health physician, said in the release, “Many osteoarthritis patients depend on daily use of NSAID pain relievers. These drugs can be costly and constant use can bring adverse side effects. This new study shows a viable drug-free osteoarthritis option. The results here are meaningful for those looking to manage their condition and build or maintain a more active lifestyle.”
