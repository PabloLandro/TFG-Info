Don't do the butter! The heat in the burn can cause it to 'fry'. Hold it under cold running water for ATLEAST 10 minutes. Failing that, wrap some ice/frozen peas in a clean tea-towel and hold it there for about 1/2 an hour. On a more personal note: don't burn your finger on the straighteners.

That's a burn blister. Do not pop it, put ice on it or butter of any kind. You're not supposed to ice a burn, you're supposed to run cold water on it. Butter and other greasy things can breed bacteria and cause infection. Give it a few days and it will shrink down and eventually disappear. If it's sensitive to touch cover it with something, like a band aid.

Yeah it looks really gross, and hurts too, huh? It's a burn blister. You can't really do anything about it, it goes away on its own. But if you put some ice on it, it will bring the swelling down. Hope that helps!

first of all don't pop the blister!!! it is your body's protection to infection. just run your finger under cool water for 5 minutes. DO NOT use Ice or butter you could cause damage to the skin. if it doesn't look any better after 24 hours see a doc.

Don't worry; it's just a blister. Keep ice on it. DO NOT PEEL IT OFF! This could result in a scar. Put some neo-sporin and a band-aid on it. It should be good-as-new with-in a couple of days

Do not pop it, it's there to help cover where the burn was so it canf orm new skin, in the mean time keep it bandaged over, and ice it, and take advil for the pain, it'll pop by itself once it's ready.

DO NOT POP IT! LET IT POP NATURALLY!
Keep it lightly covered and clean to prevent infection. Warm water and soap is the best to clean it with. and like i said do not pop it! Take some asprin for the pain.
Feel better and be careful next time!!!
