Tinea Pedis: What Is It & How Do You Treat It?
Tinea pedis is the medical term for a contagious fungal skin infection that affects the feet[1]. A tinea pedis infection is more commonly known as athlete’s foot.
How Tinea Pedis spreads:
The infection can commonly be spread in places such as shared swimming pools, locker rooms and communal showers. The name athlete’s foot came about due to the fact that athletes were often contracting the infection in these places. All fungi thrive in moist and warm environments,[2] that’s why areas of the body like feet and between the toes are more likely to be infected. As the infection is common and can spread easily, having a fast and effective treatment for tinea pedis is beneficial.
Common places where Tinea Pedis is spread:
How do you treat Tinea Pedis?
Tinea pedis treatments commonly contain anti-fungal agents that are either fungicidal (kills the fungus) or fungistatic (stops the growth of fungus). SolvEasy Tinea Cream and SolvEasy Tinea Spray are effective at treating tinea pedis. SolvEasy products contain the fungicidal agent terbinafine hydrochloride which kills the fungus causing the tinea pedis infection[3].
For Tinea Pedis that is inflamed and itchy, it is recommended that a treatment of Resolve Plus is the first line of treatment

If the infection is on the sole of the foot, use for 2-4 weeks. Always read the label. Use only as directed. If symptoms persist see a healthcare professional
