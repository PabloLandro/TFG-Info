Should you feed a cold and starve a fever?
Not only is it a bad idea to starve a fever, it will hinder your ability to recover from the cold according to Philip Kern, M.D., Department of Endocrinology/Metabolism at UAMS. “Drinking plenty of fluids is important since fever promotes fluid loss from the body and dehydration can result,” Dr. Kern says. While drinking or eating hot or cold foods affects the temperature of the mouth, it will have no effect on a person’s overall body temperature.
Dr. Kern adds another popular belief, that chicken soup is good for a cold, is actually true to a certain extent. This is because drinking warm liquids such as soup helps open up the nasal passages. This allows the patients to breathe easier and get the rest needed to fully recuperate.
