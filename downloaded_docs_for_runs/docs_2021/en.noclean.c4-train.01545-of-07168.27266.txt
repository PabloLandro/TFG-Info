Ankle and Pain
Why am I having ankle pain?
Having a recent injury, like rolling your ankle or falling down, can certainly leave you with ankle pain. But sometimes the reasons behind your pain aren’t as obvious. Common causes of ankle pain include:
Sprained ankle
Achilles tendinitis
Plantar fasciitis
Arthritis
Gout
What is the treatment for ankle pain?
It depends on your diagnosis. With a soft tissue injury, like a sprained ankle, you may have to go through physical therapy for several weeks to:
Help your ankle heal properly
Build strength
Prevent reinjury
If Dr. Hurst determines that you have arthritis, you might need medication or injections to reduce swelling in your joints. But for severe ankle injuries, Dr. Hurst may recommend surgery to repair torn ligaments or tendons, or broken bones. Usually this is the last resort if your ankle still seems unstable after you go through physical therapy.
Can I do anything to relieve ankle pain?
Your ankle just needs time to heal, especially right after an injury. The acronym RICE is helpful for reminding you to:
Rest your ankle
Ice it for the first 24-72 hours
Compress it for the first 24-36 hours
Elevate it above your heart 2-3 hours per day while it’s swollen
Resting doesn’t mean you have to lie in bed all the time while your ankle is healing -- just try to stay off of it as much as possible. Using crutches or a walker can take much of the pressure off your injured ankle while it’s healing.
Will I need to wear a brace?
Possibly. Right after an ankle injury, you should wrap your ankle with a bandage to provide compression. This reduces swelling, but it doesn’t do much to provide support when you put weight on your ankle. Dr. Hurst might fit you for a brace, or even a walking cast, if your ankle needs strong support to heal properly.
