Blueberries Fight Belly Fat!
Blueberries Fight Belly Fat!
Health experts have always raved about the health benefits of blueberries, but now, a new University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center study suggests that blueberries may help reduce belly fat and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic syndrome.
Blueberries are the fruits of a shrub that belong to the heath family, which includes the cranberry and bilberry as well as the azalea, mountain laurel and rhododendron.
Blueberries are the fruits of a shrub that belong to the heath family, which includes the cranberry and bilberry as well as the azalea, mountain laurel and rhododendron.
Blueberries grow in clusters and range in size from that of a small pea to a marble. They are deep in color, ranging from blue to maroon to purple-black, and feature a white-gray waxy “bloom” that covers the surface serving as a protective coat. The skin surrounds a semi-transparent flesh that encases tiny seeds.
According to a study presented at the 2009 Experimental Biology conference in New Orleans, a diet rich in blueberries lowers blood cholesterol levels while improving glucose control and insulin sensitivity, lowering the risk of subsequent heart disease and diabetes.
Just some of the benefits of blueberries include:
They have the highest antioxidant capacity of all fresh fruit: Blue Berries, being very rich in antioxidants like Anthocyanin, vitamin C, B complex, vitamin E, vitamin A, copper (a very effective immune builder and anti-bacterial), selenium, zinc, iron (promotes immunity by raising haemoglobin and oxygen concentration in blood) etc. boost up your immune system and prevent infections. Once your immunity is strong, you won’t catch colds, fever, pox and all such nasty viral and bacterial communicable diseases.
They neutralize free radicals which can affect disease and aging in the body: Blue Berries bring you the brightest […]

Mom’s Favorite Natural Remedies
Mom’s Favorite Natural Remedies
Regardless of culture, anyone who’s ever had a cold, a fever, a pain, etc., has been subjected to the rigors of their mother’s natural remedies, such as tea, honey, lemon, pepper, garlic, liquor, etc. However, there are also a few seemingly culture-specific natural remedies as well.
Healthy Mother’s Day Gifts
Why? Like most cultures, African Americans throughout history have discovered and adopted various natural remedies from their African roots, as well as those from Native Americans. Of course, these remedies passed from generation to generations, from mother to daughter, father to the son. The result? An amazingly rich list of natural therapies, healers and soothers.
Note: Most doctors agree that the most ideal solution to most conditions and diseases is, when possible, a marriage of both natural remedies and a physician’s care, since it’s sometimes very difficult to control the quality and recommended dosages of different ingredients – or to completely understand what ingredients may conflict with other medications or health conditions. Therefore, be sure to consult with your doctor before starting any treatment.
Some of mom’s favorite natural cures include:
Apple Cider Vinegar
Of all the well-touted natural health remedies that exist today, very few are followed quite as religiously as taking a tablespoon or two of apple cider vinegar every day. Apple cider vinegar has been hailed as a cure-all supplement, from allergy relief to weight loss. Anywhere you look, you can find people who believe that drinking apple cider vinegar has helped them.
Just some of ACV’s well-touted benefits may include:
• Lowers cholesterol
• Weight loss
• Appetite supression
• Diabetes Management
Coconut Oil
Coconut oil has a surprising number of health benefits, from relieving stress to bolstering your immune system. It’s rich in the lauric, capric and caprylic acids. These omega three […]

The Oil That May Cut Diabetes Risk
The Oil That May Cut Diabetes Risk
Fish oil supplements could help reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes, new research suggests.
The supplements, also known as omega-3 fatty acids, increase levels of a hormone called adiponectin that’s linked to insulin sensitivity, Harvard researchers found. Higher levels of this hormone in the bloodstream have also been linked to a lower risk for heart disease.
While prior animal studies found fish oil increased circulating adiponectin, whether similar effects apply in humans is not established,” the study’s lead author, Jason Wu, from the Harvard School of Public Health, said in a news release from the Endocrine Society.
For their study, the researchers conducted a “meta-analysis” of 14 clinical trials. A meta-analysis reviews existing research and attempts to find a consistent pattern. In this case, the studies that were reviewed were all randomized, placebo-controlled trials, which is considered the gold standard in research.
“By reviewing evidence from existing randomized clinical trials, we found that fish oil supplementation caused modest increases in adiponectin in the blood of humans,” Wu explained.
Overall, the new study looked at 682 people who took fish oil supplements, and 641 who were given placebos such as sunflower or olive oil.
Among the people treated with fish oil, adiponectin levels increased by 0.37 micrograms per milliliter of blood. This hormone plays a beneficial role in processes that affect metabolism, such as blood sugar regulation and inflammation.
Because the effects of fish oil varied significantly in the studies analyzed, the researchers suggested that omega-3 fatty acids could have a stronger effect in certain groups of people. The investigators concluded that more research is needed to determine which people would benefit most from fish oil supplements.
“Although higher levels of adiponectin in the bloodstream have been linked to lower risk of […]

Can Fruit Really Prevent Fibroids?
Can Fruit Really Prevent Fibroids?
According to a new study, women who ate two or more servings of fresh fruit per day were less likely to develop uterine fibroids than those who didn’t.
“Our study suggests that uterine fibroids can now be added to the list of potential health outcomes for which increased fruit and vegetable intake might be beneficial,” lead researcher Lauren Wise, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health, told Reuters.
About 70 percent of women develop fibroids at some point in their lives, but African-American women are up to three times more likely to get them. The non-cancerous growths often have no symptoms, but they can be painful, affect menstrual periods, and, in some cases, cause fertility problems or make it difficult for women to carry a pregnancy to full term.
The study, which was published in the December 2011 edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, analyzed data from more than 22,500 African-American women gathered by the Black Women’s Health Study.
The data, which tracked the habits and medical diagnoses of those women for 12 years, showed that women who ate four or more servings of fruits and vegetables every day were 10 percent less likely to get fibroids than women who ate less than one helping of fruits and vegetables each day. But after taking a closer look at the data, researchers discovered that the biggest benefit came from eating fresh fruit: Women who ate two or more servings per day were 11 percent less likely to be diagnosed with fibroids than women who ate less than two servings a week.
The amount of vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, and fiber that the women ate didn’t affect their risk of getting fibroids, […]

Can Vitamin D Help Treat Asthma?
Can Vitamin D Help Treat Asthma?
An increasing number of studies are linking Vitamin D deficiency to a host of medical conditions. This includes heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
Now, the case for vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of asthma is being made.
The findings, which appear in the September issue of the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, are based on a review of nearly 60 years’ worth of literature on vitamin D status and asthma.
They found that vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased airway reactivity, lower lung functions, and worse asthma control. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include obesity, being African-American, and living in Westernized countries, the researchers report. These are also populations known to be at higher risk for developing asthma.
Vitamin D supplementation may improve asthma control by blocking the cascade of inflammation-causing proteins in the lung, as well as increasing production of the protein interleukin-10, which has anti-inflammatory effects, the study authors suggest.
Vitamin D is often called “the sunshine vitamin” because our bodies make it when we are exposed to sunlight. Food sources include fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is also added to multivitamins and milk.
“The biggest issue is whether or not vitamin deficiency can be related to a worsening of asthma, and all the studies have been single-point in time studies, and the concern is that depending on where you live, you can be vitamin D-deficient in the winter, but not in the summer,” says Thomas B. Casale, MD, a professor of medicine and the chair of allergy and immunology at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb. “We know that asthma gets worse in winter, when vitamin D is down,” he says.
“If we give supplemental vitamin D and measure asthma outcomes over a […]
