What are Warts?
Most people will get skin warts at some point in their life. Warts are infections that occur on the surface of the skin due to contact with a virus from the HPV (Human Papillomavirus) family. There are many different types of warts. Some occur only on certain surface areas of the body, such as the face or neck, and they can have different appearances. Usually, warts look like small bumps or lumps in the surface of the skin and are rough in texture. They are not dangerous or life-threatening. However, they can become uncomfortable (painful or itchy). This article will examine warts on the neck and how to get rid of warts on the neck.
What Causes Warts on the neck?
Warts are caused by direct contact with a virus. They are contagious, making it is very easy for it to spread by contact. In addition, warts on the neck form more easily when the skin is broken (e.g. cuts or scrapes). Viruses can spread by direct contact, meaning direct skin-to-skin contact with another person. For example, shaking someone’s hand and then touching your neck. Viruses can also spread by indirect contact, meaning you touch an object that has come into contact with someone that has a wart. The virus enters the skin, most frequently through broken skin (small scratches, cuts, etc.). Once the virus enters the skin, a wart is formed due on the outer layer of the skin due to the fast growth of cells. While warts often go away on their own, it normally takes a significant amount of time and they can get uncomfortable.

How to Remove Warts on the Neck
When you first spot any warts on the neck, you should act quickly because any one wart can spread and thus result in even more warts. It is recommended by doctors and dermatologists to use treatments available at the drugstore or home remedies. Most warts are easily treatable. There is a plethora of over the counter drugstore treatments and home remedy options available. All of the home treatments involve applying some sort of topical ointment or freezing off the wart. The topical treatments fight the virus which has entered the skin. You will find remedies on how to get rid of warts on the neck outlined below.
Freezing Treatments (Dr. Scholl’s Freeze Away Wart Remover)
Freezing treatments work especially well for small warts on the neck. The Dr. Schools Freeze Away Wart Remover works by freezing and breaking down the wart.

Tea Tree Oil
Tea tree oil is an essential oil made from Australian tea tree leaves. It is great for warts on the neck removal because of its antimicrobial and healing properties. Tea tree oil has long been used to treat small wounds, infection, and acne. The great thing about tea tree oil is that it has many beneficial uses. So, if you purchase tea tree oil, you can apply it topically to other areas of the body to treat other things. Due to the antiviral properties of tea tree oil, it is great for fighting common pathogens. Tea tree oil is also an immune booster and can help the body and immune system fight infection which is what warts on the neck are, infections to the outer layer of skin on the neck.
Wart Stick
Wart sticks are solid, painless, and odorless. They are convenient and work fast. They go on dry making them great for applying to more visible areas of the body. This product is good for warts on the neck removal because it also contains 40% salicylic acid. The salicylic acid is beneficial in treating fungal infections and drying up those infected areas.

Natural Home Remedies to Get Rid of Warts on the Neck
Home remedies are a great way to go for treating warts on the neck, as well as warts in other regions of the body. It is a topical form of treatment which is practically painless. The ingredients and/or materials used for home remedies are inexpensive as well which is a bonus. In many cases, warts are unpleasant in appearance and since they are benign, people sometimes find it embarrassing to get it treated professionally. Natural home remedies are an relatively fast and easy way to treat warts on the neck. Below, we will go through the home remedies of green tea, duct tape, garlic and apple cider vinegar.
Green Tea
Green tea is a powerful, natural antioxidant. The best way to use green tea for warts on the neck removal is to drink about 2-3 cups of green tea a day and also directly apply a green tea bag to the affected area. Just steep the tea bag for a few minutes, allow to cool and apply it for about 10-15 minutes. Repeating this process 3 times a day will help the wart dry up and fall off. There are other green tea home remedy options such as green tea oil. Green tea oil is great because not only does it have the same benefits, it also has benefits from the oils which may contain healthy vitamins such as A and B. This combination of powerful antioxidants, free radicals and vitamins can help nourish the skin, reduce the pain from the broken skin of the warts, and prevent skin damage.
Duct tape
Another way to remove warts on the neck, is to place a small piece of duct tape over the wart and leave it on for six days. Then, after removing the duct tape, rubbing the wart with a pumice stone can help the wart disappear. Soaking the affected area in water and washing it with soapy water also helps by softening the rough skin and maintaining hygiene. This method of taping the wart accelerates the body’s natural tissue reformation process by helping skin cells replicate.
Garlic
Garlic is a great natural remedy because not only is it inexpensive, it can be quite effective because it is a potent antiviral. Garlic contains anti-viral compounds that can fight viruses by helping to stop the growth of virus cells. Applying chloroform garlic extracts topically has been proven to help remove warts. To use garlic to treat small warts on the neck, simply take raw garlic, that is peeled and sliced, and gently rub it on the wart. Since garlic is also anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory, it is great for fighting fungal infections. Garlic contains an active ingredient called allicin. This active ingredient can cause the area being treated to become hot. Allicin also gives garlic the strong smell that garlic is known for. When using garlic as a natural home remedy to remove warts, make sure to use fresh garlic (or freshly sliced garlic) on every application in order to assure the most effectiveness.
Apple Cider Vinegar
This method is perhaps one of the most effective home remedies. Vinegar has been used for a long time and for many ailments throughout history. The reason why this home remedy is so effective for warts on the neck is that vinegar is an acetic acid. This means that vinegar is a good bacteria killer. In addition, it works very similarly to salicylic acid. Apple cider vinegar will burn through the infected skin which helps make the wart fall off. The apple cider vinegar will also irritate your skin cells and boost your immune system to attack and fight off the wart.
One way to use this apple cider vinegar method to treat warts on the neck, make a solution that is one-part water, 2 parts apple cider vinegar. Use a saturated cotton ball to apply the solution onto the wart. Next, cover the apple cider vinegar-soaked cotton ball with a bandage or duct tape. Leaving it on overnight would be ideal. Do this nightly until the wart comes off.
Should I get a Surgery to Remove Warts from Neck?
Warts normally do not require surgical removal and most people try to avoid surgery in general. In the case of warts on the neck, you should only get a surgery if the wart/warts do not respond to any over-the-counter treatments or home remedies, and the symptoms of the warts worsen. A surgery for warts on the neck removal would entail the surgeon either removing the wart with a scalpel or by burning it using electricity. The downside to surgeries are: painful anesthesia shots and scarring.
If surgery is warranted, there are a few minimally invasive options. The first is to shave off the wart using a surgical razor. You would still need to be under local anesthesia for this. The second option is to use a laser to remove the wart which is a little more painful but overall nothing too terrible.
What are the Different Types of Warts?
Warts are benign raised bumps in the skin due to infection. They can be grouped into distinctive categories based on the region of the body they appear, their appearance, and other factors. The five main types of warts include: common warts, plantar warts, flat warts, filiform warts, and periungual warts. Each type of warts looks different and appears on a certain area of the body.
Common Warts
This type of warts normally appears on fingers and toes, but can also show up on other body parts. The look like a small, raised and round bump with a rough appearance. They also look grayer than the skin around it. Common warts have the appearance of cauliflower. Warts on the neck are often common warts as well.
Plantar Warts
This type of warts develops on the bottom of the feet, on the soles, heels, and toes. While most types of warts grown out of the skin, plantar warts grown into it. Plantar warts are surrounded by rougher, harder skin. Because of the pressure and friction constantly being applied to the feet, plantar warts are usually much thicker. They usually appear in small clusters and can look like small callouses. They are more commonly caused by contact with infected surfaces and are contracted by people who frequently do barefoot activities such as yoga or gymnastics. It can also be contracted by walking barefoot in a public space such as a pool changeroom or locker room.
Flat Warts
These warts appear on the arms, face, or thighs. They are small, smooth and have a flat top. They can range from pink, brown, to a little yellow. They more frequently appear on areas of the body that are exposed to light. They commonly appear in the beard area for men and on the legs for women. Warts on the neck are also usually flat warts.
Filiform Warts
Filiform warts can grow near the mouth, nose, neck, or chin. They are pretty small and look like a small flap or skin tag. They would be a similar color to your skin. Since filiform warts occur around the face, they can cause a lot of discomfort and itchiness.
Periungual Warts
This type of warts appears around or under fingernails and toenails. They can be painful because they can affect the growth of your nails and the ability to touch or hold things.
Are Warts on the Neck Contagious?
Warts on the neck are contagious and can spread to other people or other areas of the body through direct skin-to-skin contact. Warts on the neck are highly contagious and their contagion factor has a lot to do with how susceptible one’s immune system is to infection. Many people have very strong immune systems that are able to fight off warts, bacteria, and viral infections. At the same time, there are many people that are more susceptible because of a weaker immune system. To reduce the possibility of developing warts, there are several precautions you can take. Just be careful when sharing any personal items which can spread the HPV virus. Razors, socks, towels, and shoes are a few examples. It is also recommended to wear footwear in places like locker rooms, and pool decks which can reduce the possibility to exposure to the wart virus.
What Happens if You Cut off a Wart
You should avoid cutting off a wart because there are several negative consequences. Cutting a wart can cause pain and bleeding. Warts contain many nerve endings which are extremely sensitive, so cutting a wart off can do more damage and cause excessive bleeding. Another consequence is scarring. Home remedies are mostly topical and encourages the outer layer of the skill to regenerate after the wart tissue has been frozen and falls off. It is also painless and doesn’t typically leave behind a scar. The last major consequence to note is infection. Cutting off a wart can result in a new, open wound in your skin. This makes it easy for bacteria to enter the skin and could have worse effects. Flat warts on the neck are very common and are very small bumps which makes it difficult to cut off. Therefore, to spare yourself the trouble and the possibility of worsening the condition of the warts, do not cut off warts on the neck.
Do Removed Warts Grow Back?
Removed warts do not necessarily grow back, in the same spot. However, they may still recur in the same area, or different areas of the body if the virus spread elsewhere. Some types of warts are particularly stubborn, so they may keep coming back. To prevent removed warts from growing back, make sure that once the warts on the neck are removed, that the treated area remains clean from bacteria. In addition, limited or avoiding contact with other possibly infected objects or people will go a long way in preventing removed warts from growing back.
Warts Removed? Aftercare Help & Advice
Once one of these home remedies is consistently applied to the wart and the wart tissue breaks, dries up, and falls off, the spots where the warts on the neck were may look lighter in color. It may take months for the treated spots to slowly return to a normal color.
The best way to prevent future warts on the neck is to do your best to make sure viruses do not enter your skin. Keeping your skin healthy and free of cuts and scrapes can really help in forming a barrier between your skin and any harmful viruses. Moisturize and try not to share any personal items that would normally come into contact with your skin. Maintaining adequate hygiene is also very important in order to prevent warts from developing. Other helpful tips are to cover any cuts, no matter what the size, with a bandage to provide a barrier between the skin and any HPV virus. You should also wash your hands frequently
Warts vs. Skin Tags
Skin tags are very small flaps of skin that develop due to friction. The most common areas would be around the neck due to clothing rubbing on your skin (e.g. the collar of a shirt). The skin tag begins as a small bump and continues to ball up into a tiny flap of skin. Skin tags can cause a lot of irritation because they get in the way. They can get caught, bleed, and thus end up hurting or stinging. They normally fall off on their own, or you can get a dermatologist to remove them.
Meanwhile, warts are infections in the outer layer of the skin that are normally associated with the HPV virus. Appearance-wise, they are more like bumps in the skin while skin tags look like small and smooth bumps/balls of skin hanging from a thinner piece of skin. Treatment-wise, warts can easily be treated with topical ointments that are sold over the counter. Left untreated, warts can disappear on their own, but the HPV virus which causes the wart may not leave your system for two years, making it possible for warts to develop again.
Where Else Can Warts Show Up?
Well, warts can appear almost everywhere on the human body. The most common areas are the face, neck, hands, and feet which experience the most direct skin-to-skin contact.
