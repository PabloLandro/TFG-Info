​How to Choose a Scar Removal Cream
​When choosing a scar removal cream, it is important to choose one that is one hundred percent silicone. This ingredient will help with the removal of old and new scars and give you dramatic effects on the scar removal. It might also help to look for a product that removes all types of scars for the best scar removal results.
​When many people think of scars, they only think of a thin line that goes along the skin. Some scars are also raised above the skin, stand out and can be easily noticed. Some scars also can become bruises and become discolored over time. If you choose a scar removal cream for removal of all scar types, this can lessen the chance that your scars will become like this.
What are the Advantages/Benefits of This Type of Produce?
​If you can find an effective cream, it can have noticeable results and make you less self-conscious about your scarring. These creams can provide you with scar removal with no invasive surgery.
Many of them can be used without the risk of any side effects. Other options include laser scar therapy, surgical scar revision, and dermabrasion. These options are considered surgery and can have painful side effects.
​Things to Look for/Attributes that Differentiate these Products
Using the right scar removal cream or gel should include one that is affordable, easy to use and that gives great results. Scars appear when the outer skin layer, also known as the epidermis, is damaged.
The collagen fibers try to repair themselves, but they do not do it correctly. Some ingredients can help flatten the scars. Mederama contains cepalin which is onion extract and is an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial product that helps reduce redness and swelling. It also stops the over production of collagen that makes scars develop.​
Another great ingredient is vitamin E. This ingredient is great for healing burns. It can be applied in a gel or in gel caps two to three times daily to reduce swelling and inflammation.​
Silicone is great for healing scars because it helps align the collagen fibers that develop with scars. If they are not aligned, they will form a criss-cross pattern and harden the skin. This is used for scars that raise above the skin and keloids.​
What is the Best Way to Use this Product?​
The best way to use these products is to apply them to the skin directly. Some products can come in a cream or gel form. It is best to follow the directions on the bottle or the instructions from your doctor.
Many products may require that they remain on the skin for some time and then be rinsed off with water. Others may be applied directly to the skin several times a day. Depending on the severity of the scar, you might have to apply the cream and eat a special diet or take it with some form of a pill. Make sure to follow the instructions exactly as prescribed to prevent further problems.​
Address the Controversy
​There is some controversy about the use of vitamin E on a scar. While many laud the use of vitamin E caplets on a scar after a burn, some experts claim that using vitamin E on scars after surgery have little to no effect and can even worsen the cosmetic appearance of scars. Many people experience dermatitis from topical contact with vitamin E. It has worked with scar removal for some patients, but has produced dermatitis, or skin inflammation in others.
​Prerequisites to Using the Product
Before using any products, you should try it on a small part of the skin first to see if your skin has any reactions to it. There is not one product that will work for every scar situation. If you have just had surgery, it is best to follow the recommendations of your doctor.
If you have a different type of scar, it is probably best to talk with a dermatologist to make sure that you are using the best product for your scar removal needs. Scar removal may also require a change in what is in contact with your skin.​
