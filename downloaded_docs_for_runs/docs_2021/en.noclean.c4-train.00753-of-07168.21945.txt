Dealing With Athlete's Foot
By Mid-Michigan Foot & Ankle Center
January 15, 2019
Category: Foot Conditions
Tags: Athlete's Foot
Athlete's foot is one of the most common fungal infections of the skin and is frequently seen in our office. Whether you've had it or not, it's important to understand how you can avoid and treat this highly contagious infection if you do contract it.
The fungus that causes athlete's foot thrives in damp, moist environments and often grows in warm, humid climates, such as locker rooms, showers and public pools; hence the name "athlete's foot. " This infection can itch and burn causing the skin on your feet and between your toes to crack and peel.
Tips For avoiding Athlete's Foot:
Keep your feet dry, allowing them to air out as much as possible
Wear socks that draw moisture away from your feet and change them frequently if you perspire heavily
Wear light, well-ventilated shoes
Alternate pairs of shoes, allowing time for your shoes to dry each day
Always wear waterproof shoes in public areas, such as pools, locker rooms, or communal showers
Never borrow shoes due to the risk of spreading a fungal infection
Treatment
A mild case of athlete's foot will generally clear up on its own with over-the-counter antifungal creams and sprays. But since re-infection is common due to its contagious nature, many people require prescribed anti-fungal medication to effectively treat the infection. Generally, it's always best to consult with your podiatrist before choosing a treatment.
Mild cases of athlete's foot can turn severe and even cause a serious bacterial infection. If you notice your rash has become increasingly red, swollen and painful or you develop blisters and sores, call our office right away. Athlete's foot left untreated could eventually spread to other body parts and infect other people around you.
With the right treatment, you'll be cured of your athlete's foot in no time, which means the sooner you can enjoy the activities you love without pain and irritation!

Treating Athlete's Foot

Tags: Athlete's Foot fungus tineas pedis problem
A week ago, you visited your podiatrist because of itchy, burning, cracked feet. No matter how much lotion and Vaseline you used, the dryness just wouldn’t go away. After a quick exam and a series of questions, your podiatrist determined that you were suffering from athlete’s foot. You sighed in relief, happy to know the condition wasn’t life-threatening and then waited to hear how to treat the problem.
Treating Athlete's Foot
A podiatrist can diagnose tineas pedis by simply examining the affected foot or feet. Sometimes it is necessary for the podiatrist to take a small scraping of the skin and examine it under a microscope. Other times it is sent to a laboratory for testing. The culture is examined to see if the fungus that causes athlete’s foot is present.
Once the results are in, the podiatrist will recommend a series of treatment options depending on the length and severity of an individual’s case.
Often times, over the counter antifungal creams and spray can stop athlete’s feet in its tracks. Many cases even clear up in about two weeks. Unfortunately, athletes and others who constantly suffer from wet and damp feet know that it is very easy to have their case of athlete’s foot reoccur. Because of this, many sufferers use medicated powders and sprays as a defense to help keep the condition away.
Over the Counter Options
Usually, athlete’s foot responds well to over the counter medications due to the nature of the fungus. One commonly prescribed over the counter medication is called Lamisil-AT. It is an effective over the counter fungal cream that is typically effective after one week of treatment. Other creams that also work are Desenex, Lotrimin, Monistat-Derm, and Tinactin. The later four usually require four full weeks of treatment before seeing results.
If athlete’s foot appears on the entire sole or top of the foot, then it requires a special antifungal treatment. Usually, a lotion or spray will be ineffective. If this occurs, or your infection lasts more than two weeks, it is important to see a podiatrist right away. Call Dr. Andrew H. Cohen of Mid-Michigan Foot & Ankle Center, located in Saginaw and Bay City, Michigan. Call 989-790-8009 or make an appointment online today. Don’t suffer more than you have to.

7 Tips to Prevent Foot Problems

Tags: Athlete's Foot Ingrown Toenails warts
A podiatrist sees hundreds of patients every year. They treat a range of issues from fungus to diabetic feet. Podiatrists are highly trained individuals who focus solely on the feet and the best way to treat them. They are the experts regarding preventative measures for your feet. Here are 7 tips recommended by podiatrists to help you prevent some foot problems.
Look at your feet – Examine your feet every day. If you notice any small change that doesn’t seem right, keep track of it. Swelling, redness, tingling, burning, sores, warts and other symptoms can lead to much larger problems later on. A call to the podiatrist can save you from a severe disorder or treat a mild one.
Wear the right shoes – Podiatrists see so many people wearing the wrong shoes for their feet. Some of these shoes simply don’t fit. Other shoes are not designed with your foot in mind and can cause a lot more harm than good. A good rule of thumb is, if the shoe doesn’t feel good immediately when you try it on, then it isn’t the right shoe for you. Avoid shoes that are too loose, too restrictive, have a heel, or have no stability and arch support. If you still have questions regarding your footwear, call Dr. Andrew H. Cohen at 989-790-8009 or make an appointment online to talk about long term shoe options.
Pay attention to your children’s feet too! – Your kid’s feet are extremely important. Not only does a foot problem affect them negatively due to pain, it can also prevent them from properly walking or partaking in other activities later on in life. Kids are more likely to get warts, athletes foot, and have nail issues. If you see any signs of these, contact Mid-Michigan Foot & Ankle Center located in Saginaw and Bay City, Michigan.
Get your kids shoes right – Your kid’s shoes need to fit correctly. Shoes that are too tight or too loose can impact them negatively. Also, kid’s feet grow very fast! You should check their shoe size regularly so that they are wearing the shoe that is correctly sized for their feet.
Be sure to cut toenails straight across in order to prevent ingrown toenails.
Do not use over the counter medicine without consulting a doctor.
Be sure to warm up before exercising so that your muscles do not strain.
If you have any foot or ankle injuries call our office so that we can lead you to a healthie

Athlete’s Foot Isn’t Just for Athlete’s

Tags: Athlete's Foot toe web infection Moccasin infection Vesicular infection
Athlete’s foot is a rash on your foot’s skin that is the most common fungal skin infection. It is caused by a fungus that grows on the top layer of your skin and thrives in wet, warm places like in between your toes. It spreads easily and is very tagious. You are likely to contract it by walking barefoot on a contaminated floor near swimming pools or locker rooms.
There are three variations of athlete’s foot, if you believe you may have one of these types call Mid – Michigan Foot & Ankle Center in Saginaw MI & Bay City MI and consult Dr. Andrew H. Cohen.
Here are the 3 types of athlete’s foot and their symptoms;
Toe web infection – occurs between the fourth and fifth toes. The skin will typically peel and crack, ultimately breaking down.
Moccasin infection – will start with soreness on the foot and the skin on the bottom of the foot will become thick and crack. Some cases the toenail can get infected and perhaps fall off. This will need a different treatment.
Vesicular infection – arises with an abrupt outbreak of pus filled blisters under the skin and can appear anywhere on the foot. A bacterial infection can also be contracted with this type.
How can I avoid athlete’s foot?
Dry the areas between your toes after showering or swimming
Wear cotton socks that absorb perspiration
Keep your feet dry and clean always
Don’t go barefoot especially in public spaces
Use talcum or antifungal powder on your feet to help with moisture
Let your shoes air out for 24 hours before you use them again
Wear shoes that allow your feet to breathe
How can I make my feet stop itching?
Use baking soda and water paste between your toes or on your feet – rinse thoroughly and dry your feet
Dust cornstarch or powder in itchy areas
Steep five tea bags in a liter of boiling water, let cool to a warm temperature, soak your feet for 30 minutes
Apply an antifungal over the counter medication
Athlete’s foot isn’t a serious condition but can be hard to cure. More importantly If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system and believe that you have athlete’s foot you should call Mid – Michigan Foot & Ankle Center to schedule an appointment at 989-790-8009. Get rid of the itch and get back in the game!
