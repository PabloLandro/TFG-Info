Folic Acid and Dementia: Supplementation…

Elderly people with mild cognitive impairment saw significant improvements in both cognitive performance and reduced inflammation when supplementing with 400 mcg of Folic Acid daily for a period of 12 months.
Over 150 seniors with mild cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received daily Folic Acid supplementation (400 mcg) and the other group was a conventional-treatment group.
Significant improvements in cognitive function were seen in the group supplementing with Folic Acid. Additionally a significant reduction in levels of inflammatory cytokines was seen. Peripheral inflammatory cytokines appear to be biomarkers for identifying individuals who may be at a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Researchers believe looking at the role of inflammatory markers at the onset of dementia, before full clinical dementia syndrome has developed, is essential. Researchers concluded that folic acid has significant memory enhancing and anti-inflammatory properties.
