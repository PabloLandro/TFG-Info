NIACINAMIDE IS A MUST FOR ANTI-AGING
In multiple clinical studies, topical application of niacinamide improved fine lines and wrinkles, skin sallowness (yellowing), hyperpigmentation, and red blotchiness, as well as elasticity.
– Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16029679
It has been shown to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production, as well as even out skin tone by slowing down the transfer of melanin to your skin’s epidermis.
– Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12100180
Recent studies have suggested that niacinamide may increase the effectiveness of sunscreens in protecting the skin from UV damage.
– Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349012
Research conducted by Proctor and Gamble showed that after 12 weeks a product with 5% niacinamide was able to improve the appearance of various signs of skin aging, including skin elasticity, pigmentation, lines and wrinkles, and redness.
Another study, on acne, showed an improvement in just over 80% of the participants, after 8 weeks. Use your niacinamide regularly, and know that it might take 2 or 3 months to see noticeable improvement.
NIACINAMIDE FOR ROSACEA
Niacinamide has been cited in two different studies as being useful in the treatment of rosacea.
Wake Forest University scientists tested 50 people with rosacea. The study found that applying a Niacinamide based moisturizer twice daily for 4 weeks eased symptoms of this condition. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16209160
The University of Pittsburgh’s Nicomide Improvement in Clinical Outcomes Study (NICOS) showed promising results. Most subjects reported an improvement halfway through the 8 week study. 79% said their appearance was either moderately or much better and 55% reported a moderate to substantial reduction in rosacea lesions. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16871775
CAUTION
Niacinamide should not be used by people with liver disease, people with active ulcers or a history of ulcers, or anyone with gout.
If you drink excessive amounts of alcohol, you should not use niacinamide cream as it can react with increased levels of alcohol in your body.
If you are wanting to use niacinamide cream for the treatment of your acne, start out slow, with small amounts to make sure there are no negative reactions. If you notice redness or peeling, discontinue use.
Benefits Of Other Active Ingredients
Vegan Hyaluronic ACID (HA) - Gives skin volume by holding onto 1,000 x its weight in water & as levels decline with age, skin loses its youthful fullness.
(HA) is a polysaccharide & a compound that occurs naturally in every tissue of the body, with the highest concentrations occurring in tissues such as skin, cartilage & eyes. Providing protection to cell structures.
Feeding new HA to skin may help hydrate skin's intercellular reservoir, raising skin's moisture level, & smoothing down age lines.
Topically, it helps to preserve the characteristics of youthful & healthy skin: suppleness, elasticity & tone.
Organic Rosehip Oil
Full of vitamins E, B-carotene (a form of vitamin A), antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.
Vitamin A improves the skin’s moisture levels and reduces wrinkles and fine lines.
Combats free radicals that cause damage, & helps improve skin tone, texture and pigmentation.
Deeply moisturizing and aids in removing redness and irritation. These properties also make rose hip oil a possible treatment for facial rosacea.
Vitamin A is known to fight acne due to its properties such as helping to prevent dead skin cells clogging pores.
Is a nourishing skin toner that helps minimize the appearance of pores due to the essential fatty acids and vitamin A.
Has anti-inflammatory properties to help revive and nourish dull skin.
Unlike other oils for mature skin, rosehip seed oil is astringent and considered a “dry oil,” which means it sinks into skin quickly. This allows its essential fatty acids to really penetrate and soothe dry skin.
Rosehip seed oil actually encourages skin to form its own collagen due to its naturally occurring vitamin A.
Vitamin E (d Alpha)
An antioxidant that protects & repairs your skin, eases dryness & bolsters skin’s UV defense. (Antioxidants are agents that neutralize the oxidant effect of free radicals, which are molecules that damage collagen & cause skin dryness, fine lines & wrinkles.)
May decrease skin roughness, length of facial lines, & wrinkle depth.
