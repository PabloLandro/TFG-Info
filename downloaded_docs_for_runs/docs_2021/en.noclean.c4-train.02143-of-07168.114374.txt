Ovarian Cysts are sacs that are filled with fluids within or on the surface of an ovary. Every woman has two ovaries of an almond size that are located on each side of the uterus. The eggs develop and mature in the ovaries and are released by the process of menstruation cycle.
Many of the women suffer from the problem of ovarian cysts at some time during their lives. The presence of vagina cysts causes no problem for many women as they are harmless and most of the time they disappear on their own within a few months. But the cysts which have ruptured may lead to some serious problem.
A bigger ovarian cyst causes abdominal discomfort and it also lays pressure on your bladder that increases the frequency to urinate as the capacity of the urinary bladder reduces with the development of ovarian cysts. Some of the common symptoms of ovarian cysts are menstrual irregularities, pelvic pain before or after the period ends and during intercourse and nausea, vomiting and tenderness in the breasts and heaviness in the abdomen is also felt.

Wait for a Period of at least a Month
In most of the cases the cyst goes away on its own within a few months so before starting any treatment wait for at least a month and get yourself re-examined for the cyst. If you are not facing any symptom of ovarian cyst but an ultrasound show that you have a small and fluid filled cyst then you should wait and get the pelvic ultrasounds done at regular intervals to check if the cyst is getting big in size.
Birth Control Pills
The intake of birth control pills will reduce the chances of development of new cysts in the future. The risk of ovarian cancer also reduces with the consumption of birth control pills. The risk decreases for the period for which you take birth control pills.
Surgeries
Usually the larger cysts are removed with the help of a surgery. The pain causing cysts and the cyst that persists for a period of two or three menstrual cycles have to be removed with the help of surgery. The different types of surgeries that are used for the removal of cysts are given here:

A small incision is used in laparoscopy. The incision is done using an instrument which is small and has a tiny lighted telescope which is inserted into the abdomen to remove the cysts. This procedure is adopted only for smaller cysts.

Cystectomy
The process known as cystectomy is adopted to remove the cyst without removing the ovary. Another process known as oophorectomy is implemented when the ovary is affected with cyst is removed and another ovary remains intact.
Hysterectomy
The process of hysterectomy is implemented when the cystic mass is cancerous. In this process both the ovaries are removed. This is usually recommended when the cystic mass develops on the ovaries after the period of menopause.
Chemotherapy
In the process of chemotherapy some drugs are given through a vein (IV), by mouth, or directly into the abdomen to kill all the cells that lead to cysts. As all the cells are killed so these medicines lead to some side effects like nausea, vomiting, loss of hair, damage to kidney and increased chances of other infection in the body. But all these side effects go away when the treatment is over.
