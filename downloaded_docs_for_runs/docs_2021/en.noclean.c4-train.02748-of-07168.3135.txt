Adult Conditions
When used as directed, TYLENOL® is an appropriate pain relief choice for many patients.
NSAIDS may interfere with a variety of treatment therapies
54%* of your patients may be at risk for adverse events if you’re not considering their comorbidities when recommending an analgesic.1
NSAIDs may interfere with some medications used for cardiovascular disease.2-4 NSAIDs also may not be suitable for certain osteoarthritis (OA) patients who have certain comorbidities.5
Recommend TYLENOL® with confidence
An established safety profile and proven analgesic efficacy make TYLENOL® an appropriate choice for many patients.
Updated NSAID warnings: help your patients understand risks
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required an update to the Drug Facts labeling of all adult and pediatric non-aspirin OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for example Motrin®, Advil®, and Aleve® products. These strengthen and expand existing warnings relating to the risk of heart attack and stroke associated with NSAIDs.6
TYLENOL® does not have a cardiovascular risk warning on its label
