relief from the itching and pain of the lesions

For those of you that have been keeping track of my Lupus, I'm using an incredible cream that was developed for a horse that had been the only survivor of a barn fire. I had tried EVERYTHING for relief from the itching and pain of the lesions besides the prescription steroid cream. I got some Equisoft thinking, "Well, it certainly can't hurt" and I've had incredible results from it! My scars are healing beautifully, they don't itch anymore and it looks like the scarring is going to turn into smooth skin. I'm very blessed to know the owner and to have been given the opportunity to use this cream, it's really amazing. But seriously, if you or your pet or horse have a fresh scar, wound, burn, whatever, get this! The medical grade Vitamin E goes INTO the skin so the skin heals from the inside out. Here's the website to get it: http://www.equisoftcream.com/ Triana Élan, October 3, 2014
