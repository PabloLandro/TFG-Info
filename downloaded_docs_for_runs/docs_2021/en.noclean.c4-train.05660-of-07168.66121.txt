Warts
Bella-Sana Med Spa Contents Conditions Warts
Warts
Common skin warts are raised skin lesions, usually round or oval shaped, that are either lighter or darker than the surrounding skin. Some warts have tiny black dots contained within them, which are collections of clotted blood vessels. A wart may spring up by itself or be part of a larger patch of warts.
While touching a toad will not give you warts, touching someone with warts may. That is because warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be transmitted through direct physical contact.
In most cases, warts will go away on their own within two years; however, during that time, warts can increase in size and spread. In addition, you may have to live with unsightly warts for up to two years waiting for them to possibly go away. A much simpler, faster, and more satisfying approach is wart removal.
At home wart removal treatments
Salicylic acid, which is available over-the-counter in liquid or patch form, can be applied directly to the skin lesions to soften and destroy the warts. Salicylic acid wart treatment is not immediate; it usually requires weeks of daily treatment to fully get rid of warts with over-the-counter preparations. Nevertheless, if you have the patience, salicylic acid can be effective.
Another at home wart removal treatment that may or may not be helpful is duct tape. Anecdotal reports suggest putting duct tape over warts for one week can soften the wart to the point they can be scraped off with a pumice stone. Again, this type of at home wart removal treatment is not immediately effective, and you have to wear a piece of duct tape for a week while you are waiting for it to work.
Medical wart removal treatments
Warts can be “cut,” “frozen,” or “burned off,” with shaved excision, liquid nitrogen, or acids, respectively. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these approaches. An increasingly popular wart removal option is pulsed dye laser therapy. The Bella Sana Medical Spa uses the Cutera XEO laser platform for pulsed dye laser therapy. Our experience with the laser system has been very positive and our clients have been pleased with the results.
If you have skin warts and you are interested in medical wart removal treatments, contact the wart removal experts at Bella Sana for consultation.
Bella Sana Medical Spa is located in Des Plaines, IL, which is a 15-minute drive from downtown Chicago and only 5 minutes from Mt Prospect, Park Ridge, Niles, Elk Grove Village and Glenview.
