Although symptomatic Achilles tendinopathy can be managed nonoperatively, 1, 2 histologic analysis of tissue obtained at the time of surgery demonstrates degenerative fibrous tissue, no inflammatory cells, and no healing response. 3, 4 Surgical management of noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy is indicated when nonoperative management fails. Surgical options for noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy include the following:
1.
Percutaneous tenotomy
2.
Tenosynovectomy
3.
Open Achilles debridement with repair of the residual Achilles tendon
4.
Open Achilles debridement with reconstruction of the residual Achilles tendon
Percutaneous tenotomy can be applied to any case of Achilles tendinopathy, but is perhaps best reserved for mild-to-moderate Achilles tendinopathy. 5, 6, 7Open debridement affords a comprehensive evaluation and debridement of the diseased Achilles tendon, with the option for augmentation of the repair or reconstruction, and includes tenosynovectomy in virtually all...
