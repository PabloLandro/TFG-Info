HAVE A MIGRAINE HEADACHE? JUST PLACE A BANANA PEEL ON YOUR FOREHEAD!
High percentage of Americans suffer from severe headaches which are usually accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light, tension in the neck and back, and as well as throbbing pain.
The most common used medicines for treating this condition are Aspirin, Aleve or Excedrin which do not fulfill their main goal and that is to effectively relieve pain since not all people experience headache relief, and if they do there are always the side effects.
Therefore, it is best to reach for the natural healthier alternatives which can be as effective as the over-the-counter medicines, in fact even better.
Here below are some of the most effective ones:
Basil Oil
This oil is a potent natural muscle relaxant, which can relieve headaches resulting from muscle pain and tension. Replace olive oil with basil when you are cooking so that you can relax the muscles and soothe migraine pain.
Buckwheat
Buckwheat is high in rutin, a flavonoid which has been confirmed to relieve inflammation being the main reason for migraine headaches. So, for sure include it in your eating regime.
Banana & Ice Compress
According to the Mayo Clinic the application of a cold compress to the head and neck soothes migraines. You can also put a banana peel on the forehead; the skin will absorb the potassium thus relieving pain.
Butterbur
In order to successfully treat a migraine, you should take 50 to 75 milligrams of butterbur (or meta sites) in a pill form, twice a day. The extract of these flowers stimulates the blood flow to the brain.
Caffeine
Caffeine has the ability to relive migraine pain, and because of that it is a common ingredient in medications. In fact, it can soothe the inflammation that triggers a migraine.
Above all, once combined with some over-the-counter headache medicine, it will alleviate headache pain much faster because it turns to be 40% more effective. Yet, you have to be aware of that fact that if you overdo it you may become addicted to it, so when you are short of it headaches may occur as a result of its shortage.
Ginger
According to a performed study in 2014, ginger root powder showed comparable benefits with other prescription migraine drugs, and moreover it does not show any adverse effects.
Feverfew
You can use feverfew as a supplement, extract, or just consume as tea and your migraines will be prevented and as well as treated.
Flaxseed
As mentioned before the inflammation can be the main culprit for the occurrence of recurring migraine headaches. It can be treated by an elevated intake of omega-3 fatty acids, and ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil are rich source of omega-3s. You can use flaxseed oil as a salad dressing base or you can just add ground flaxseed to your soups, broths or salads.
Lavender Oil
In order to treat a headache, massage the temples with a few drops of lavender oil. The other way would be to boil 6 cups of water, and then add 8 drops of lavender oil. The vapor which you will inhale will alleviate tension headaches.
Aside the use of these natural remedies, you need to make some lifestyle changes if you want to solve the problem with headaches.
One of those lifestyle changes can be trying yoga, exercise, meditation or simply taking walks in nature. You will also need to make some dietary changes. All this will help you to better manage stress, supply the body with the needed nutrients, and soothe migraine pain.
Another solution would be acupuncture or biofeedback treatments especially if you are dealing with too intense and persistent migraines.
Therefore, before you start using some of the medications packed with chemicals, first try every natural way as we believe that they will be highly efficient and even better form the over-the-counter medications.
