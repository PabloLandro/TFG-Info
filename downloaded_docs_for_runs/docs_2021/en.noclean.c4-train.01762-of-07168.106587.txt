Let us introduce you to the ingredients we love for our highly effective Tranquil Mind formula:
L-Theanine
One of the most-researched compounds responsible for the health benefits of green tea, l-theanine is an amino acid known to help regulate mood. As an extra, this can provide support for anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders.* Supporting Research 1–8
L-Tryptophan
Like 5-HTP, l-tryptophan is an amino acid precursor to serotonin, the neurotransmitter responsible for better mood and low anxiety. In plentiful amounts, it boosts serotonin to help stress and sleep problems.* Supporting Research 9–19
Griffonia Simplicifolia
Ever tried 5-HTP supplements for sleep and stress relief? This African shrub is the most common natural source for this amino acid, proven to help produce more serotonin, and thus boost mood, balanced sleep, and lower stress.* Supporting Research 20–28
Reishi Spores (Ganoderma lucidum)
Is one of the most studied medicinal mushrooms that has been shown to be an important ally in supporting stress, sleep-promoting properties and the overall calming of the mind.* Supporting Research 29–31
Passion Flower (Passiflora incarnata)
The blooming vine known for producing deliciously sweet passion fruit is also thoroughly researched for its sedative, sleep-improving, and digestion-enhancing effects. Traditional herbalists used it as an anti-depressant.* Supporting Research 29–37
Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)
One of the modern era’s most famed adaptogens hailing from India. Studies show its antioxidant capabilities are so potent that it gives robust protection against stress, therefore holistically reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.* Supporting Research 38–51
Schisandra (Schisandra chinensis)
Similar to ashwagandha Schisandra is a strong and protective adaptogen supported by both centuries of traditional use and scientific research. Known to fortify the body against stress, depression, and anxiety.* Supporting Research 52–68
Tranquil Mind also includes piperine, the active alkaloid chemical found in the rinds of black pepper fruits (or corns). This compound immediately increases the bioavailability of all other powerful plant compounds added to this blend – so you can really feel the difference!*

Excellent sleep aid
Posted by Craftergalore
Verified Buyer
I love this as a sleep aid. It doesn’t cause the strange dreams I get with Valerian Root nor the next-day drowsiness I often get from doxylamine (Nyquil, Unisom) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It smells like a billy goat, but I mix it with a cup of warm milk, a tablespoon of honey and a few drops of lemon extract, which makes a very tasty concoction.

THE VERY BEST HERBAL INGREDIENTS FOR MOOD AND SLEEP SUPPORT
Are there natural alternatives and support for health of the mind?
There is, and they can all be found together, working side-by-side in our multi-dimensional stress-fighting, relaxation-promoting supplement blend.*
Mental health—including anxiety, depression, stress, and even grief and trauma—is one of the more overlooked aspects of wellness. For this reason, we don’t overlook any potential or possibilities in every single botanical ingredient we include in our formula.
More importantly: each ingredient we select for inclusion must be supported not only by solid research and scientific evidence but also a strong body and background of evidence-based traditional use dating back thousands of years.
In the realm of stress relief, anxiety support, and even depression support, many herbs have been explored, both scientifically and experimentally. Many may work, but we only include the very best.
This includes botanicals selected not only for how they are shown to possibly support symptom relief, but also for how they help strengthen the body to better handle and adapt to stress, which further reduces anxiety, stress, and sleep problems twofold.
None of these herbal ingredients are proven or approved to replace doctor-approved or mainstream therapies for mood disorders.
Instead, think of these ingredients as an extra shield or even additional nutrient support to help one’s flexibility, durability, and stamina when facing challenges to mental wellness and mood.
These include:
ASHWAGANDHA
Nothing effective in the world of stress relief and hormone balance could ever skip out on ashwagandha. A powerful root that is surprisingly closely related to tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers, it was an important part of the ancient healing practices in Ayurveda from India.
A nourishing tonic and adaptogen in one, ashwagandha is widely known for benefits to reproductive, endocrine, and thyroid health.* But, over the long term, this boost also reaps amazing results for stress and mental health, since these states of wellness can often be governed by the wild world of hormones and neurotransmitters.*
GRIFFONIA SIMPLICIFOLIA
One of nature’s richest sources of natural 5-HTP, this plant from Africa contains phytochemicals that closely mimic a very important neurotransmitter in our bodies that eventually gets transformed into serotonin. In fact, most 5-HTP supplements contain extracts directly from this plant.
Serotonin is vital for regulated mood, good sleep, and normal low anxiety levels. As such, Griffonia has been used extensively in traditional medicine—and studied closely by scientific researchers—for its ability to promote better sleep and reduce anxiety naturally.*
REISHI SPORES
This medicinal mushroom provides an array of beneficial support. Reishi can support Anxiety and Depression; Breast cancer patients reported reduced anxiety and depression, as well as increased quality of life when they received reishi along with their cancer treatment. The group not receiving reishi did not report these effects.
Chinese and Japanese herbalists traditionally recommend it for insomnia due to its sleep-promoting ability *
L-THEANINE
The world favorite tea plant is known for many health benefits that can be found in green, white, black, and oolong teas, which all originate from the same plant. Beyond boosting energy and metabolism, tea contains l-theanine, an amino acid known to help with anxiety and stress.*
Though it doesn’t work quite like 5-HTP, l-theanine as an amino acid and neurotransmitter can work similar to it. On the one hand, it blocks certain receptors that may feed into or fuel stress and anxiety; and on yet another hand, it stimulates the production of stress-relieving neurotransmitters in the brain, such as GABA.*
L-TRYPTOPHAN
Another amino acid in our lineup ensures that the depression, anxiety, or stress-addled brain gets the optimum natural neurotransmitter support it could possibly get.* In the case of l-tryptophan, this chemical is found in good amounts in certain foods and promotes mild stress relief.
In higher supplement amounts, however, l-tryptophan could have even more marked effects on mood and stress.* Our body needs this amino acid, but it can’t produce it on its own and might be especially scarce in those facing mood disorders. Along with 5-HTP and l-theanine, this is an herbal ingredient we include because we don’t feel it should be overlooked.
PASSIONFLOWER
A beautiful and evocative flower could be one of the best natural remedies for depression discovered in the herbal world thus far. Though it’s nowhere near being considered a replacement for antidepressants, studies nevertheless show that this blooming vine could have great promise one day.
What’s more, passionflower is supported by both evidence-based traditional use as well as research for benefits to insomnia and anxiety, too.* As an added plus, it may have perks for digestion, especially digestion problems related to nervousness and anxiety.*
SCHISANDRA
This bright red berry from Asia is wrapped in legends and folklore about its miraculous health benefits. Though it doesn’t come close to the stories about its powers, this adaptogen herb holds its own well in the realm of research—especially for protection against stress and anxiety.*
Studies also show that it could have very useful properties for relieving depression.* The berry tonic appears to have an impact on GABA, serotonin, and dopamine in beneficial ways that help balance mental health and function. And not only that—the botanical may improve sleep over the long term, as well as reduce the chances of neurological disorders.*

Excellent sleep aid
Posted by Craftergalore
Verified Buyer
I love this as a sleep aid. It doesn’t cause the strange dreams I get with Valerian Root nor the next-day drowsiness I often get from doxylamine (Nyquil, Unisom) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It smells like a billy goat, but I mix it with a cup of warm milk, a tablespoon of honey and a few drops of lemon extract, which makes a very tasty concoction.

Wow, it works!

With three little kids 2 and under, I’m always looking for healthy ways to keep my cool. I’m a pretty wound up person, and most “calming” supplements have little to no effect on me, but Tranquil Mind is an exception. A little bit will take the edge of stress off, and a full serving makes me want to curl up and take a nap (which is wonderful, if I save the big dose for the end of the day). This is a great supplement for easing tension, and it’s very potent, so based on my experience I would say start with a small dose and see where you get before taking anything heaping or you may just want to nap. At first, I thought this seemed a pretty pricey, but now I see that a little bit goes quite a long way; with that in mind, it’s a much better value than you might initially think. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The calm I get from this makes it worth the splurge, and I will likely purchase this again at full price. If this has been in any way helpful to you, I would greatly appreciate a helpful vote below; thanks for reading.
