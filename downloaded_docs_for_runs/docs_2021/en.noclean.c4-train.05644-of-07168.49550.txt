Health Benefits of Yogurt
Yogurt is most commonly created using cow’s milk; however, it can also be created using water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks. Yogurt (also spelt yoghurt), is one of the most popular fermented dairy products in the world, made by adding live bacteria to milk. Eaters will get a dose of animal protein (about 9 grams per 6-ounce serving), plus several other nutrients found in dairy foods, like calcium, vitamin B-2, vitamin B-12, potassium, and magnesium. Here on this page, we will see some of the useful health benefits of Yogurt.
Health Benefits of Yogurt
Lowers Risk of High Blood Pressure
Consuming fat-free and low-fat yoghurt may help lower your risk of developing high blood pressure. Special proteins in dairy regulate BP, and high levels of calcium, magnesium, and potassium contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effect.
Rich in Minerals and Vitamins
Yogurt is also very healthy as a part of daily diet. It is a good source of calcium, phosphorus, riboflavin-vitamin B2, iodine, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid-vitamin B5, zinc, potassium, protein and molybdenum.
Boost Immune System
Yogurt is also high in probiotics that can help a person live longer. The bacteria can also help boost the immune system.
As an Ingredient
It can be eaten as a snack, used when preparing dips, as an ingredient in soups, sauces and desserts.
Relieves in Stomach Ailments
A yogurt is also a good option for people who suffer from stomach ailments, such as diarrhoea.
Useful for Weight Loss
Consumption of low-fat yoghurt can also aid in weight loss and may help to prevent osteoporosis. Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin-D.
Discourage Vaginal Infections
Yogurt With Active Cultures May Discourage Vaginal Infections. Even though most of the women had poor blood sugar control throughout the study, the vaginal pH (a measure of acidity or basicity) of the group eating yoghurt with active cultures dropped from 6.0 to 4.0 (normal pH is 4.0-4.5). These women also reported a decrease in candida infections. The women eating the yoghurt without active cultures remained at pH 6.0.
