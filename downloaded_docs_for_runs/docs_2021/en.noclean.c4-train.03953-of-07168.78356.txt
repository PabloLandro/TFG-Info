Now, back to Minoxidil and why you’re on the right track in your quest to dealing with the problem of hair loss?
What Is Minoxidil?
Minoxidil is a chemical compound that has proven to be very effective in dealing with hair loss in men and women both. It is not only useful against generic hair loss but also pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia).
Minoxidil was first developed for an entirely different purpose in the 1950s. It was intended to treat ulcers but it proved ineffective in that regard. On the other hand, trials showed Minoxidil to be extremely effective at treating high blood pressure.
By 1963, studies proved minoxidil’s potency against hypertension resulting in approval from the Food and Drug Association (FDA). Minoxidil’s trade name at that time was Loniten and it was sold in the form of tablets.
Soon enough, reports of Minoxidil being able to counter hair loss started filtering through as well. In fact, Minoxidil became such a popular hair loss solution that doctors started prescribing it to balding individuals, off-label i.e. without proper approvals from the authorities.
Still, it nearly took a decade for Minoxidil to receive FDA’s approval as a viable hair loss treatment.
What Are the Benefits of Minoxidil?
The fact that Minoxidil received the FDA’s approval for hair loss treatment proves its efficacy. Further, studies have unequivocally shown the efficacy of Minoxidil as a counter to hair loss. There are mainly two ways through which Minoxidil helps people dealing with hair loss.
The first is that it slows down and even stops ongoing hair loss. It does so by strengthening and supporting existing hair follicles. Simultaneously, Minoxidil also works on dormant or nearly dead hair follicles to a point that they begin reviving. This leads directly to hair regrowth.
Studies have shown that Minoxidil is successful at countering hair loss in 80 percent of its users. Moreover, if it is used over an extended period (around 2 years), then it has about 85% potential to facilitate hair regrowth.
It should also be noted that Minoxidil is an Over-The-Counter (OTC) drug. This means that it can be obtained without a prescription. OTC drugs turn out to be cheaper in the long run because doctors’ fees become unnecessary.
How Does Minoxidil Counter Hair Loss?
It is a well-established fact that Minoxidil can help people with the problem of hair loss. However, what is the process through which Minoxidil helps prevent hair loss and even promote hair regrowth? There are two.
The first is its vasodilation action. Minoxidil became an approved solution to high blood pressure because it could open up blood vessels in the body. This property of Minoxidil works on vessels supplying blood to hair follicles as well. As these vessels become dilated, more blood and, hence more nutrients start reaching hair follicles. This facilitates the repair and revival of hair follicles.
Minoxidil’s ability to open up potassium channels at the cellular level also makes it effective against the problem of hair loss. When it opens up potassium channels to the cells of the hair follicles, it causes more nutrients to enter those cells through a complex domino effect.
Therefore, while minoxidil’s vasodilation properties ensure enough nutrients reach your hair follicles, its potassium channel opening properties ensure that those nutrients enter individual cells in the region. This allows hair follicles to grow bigger and stronger. The direct outcome of stronger hair follicles is thicker hair strands and a thicker mop of hair.
It is also possible that Minoxidil can prolong the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, although it isn’t scientifically proven yet. The anagen phase is where actual hair growth occurs while other phases involve maintenance (the catagen phase) and rest (the telogen phase).
The effectiveness of a particular Minoxidil hair loss product will depend on the formulation as well as the severity of the problem. There are basically two ways in which you can segregate Minoxidil hair loss products. The first is on the basis of concentration and the other is its form.
What is better? 2% Minoxidil or 5% Minoxidil Hair Loss Products
In terms of concentration, you’ll find Minoxidil hair loss products with either 2% concentration or 5% concentration. Generally speaking, because 5% concentration products boast of extra strength, they’re recommended to men while women are advised to use only 2% concentration.
In fact, women using 5% concentration Minoxidil hair loss products have reported unwanted hair growth in other parts of their bodies such as face and arms. Even so, these days, there are hair loss products with 5% Minoxidil concentration specifically designed for the fairer sex.
The severity of your hair loss condition will determine which concentration you should go for. Still, we recommend starting with 2% concentration before trying the extra strength products for the women.
In contrast, men can begin with 5% Minoxidil hair loss products with confidence. They should only roll back to 2% concentration if they experience some side effects.
Should You Choose On The Basis Of Minoxidil Foam Or Liquid Solution?
You’ll find Minoxidil products mainly in liquid and foam states. There may be some pills and tablets out there but they’re not advised for hair loss because they end up affecting blood pressure too. Topical solutions and foam both are safe from that perspective.
There’s a great debate between users of foam and liquid solution in terms of which is better. Minoxidil solutions contain propylene glycol which doesn’t suit a lot of users, causing multiple side effects.
In fact, these side effects were the main reason why Minoxidil foam was first introduced. Nowadays, both liquid Minoxidil hair loss products and foams are equally effective and safe for use.
The ladies might want to be extra safe and choose foam Minoxidil hair loss products because it doesn’t flow so freely. However, beware that this will reduce your options drastically. There are far more solution based Minoxidil products out there than foam.
Why Do Some People Use “Rogaine” In Place Of “Minoxidil”?
There was a time when Minoxidil was a patented ingredient. At that time, there was just one company that could sell products containing Minoxidil. This company’s name was Upjohn Corporation. The brand under which Upjohn marketed their Minoxidil formulations in the US was Rogaine while it was Regaine in the rest of the world.
In fact, Upjohn had a monopoly on Minoxidil till 1996 when the patent expired and other companies could enter the market with competing products. The point here is that Upjohn and their brand Rogaine became the yardstick against which all Minoxidil products are measured.
Further, the brand “Rogaine” became nearly synonymous with “Minoxidil”. It isn’t all that different from “Google” becoming synonymous with an internet search and “Googling” being used as a verb.
How Often Should You Use Minoxidil Hair Loss Products And When Will You See Results?
Studies show that it takes anything between four to six months for Minoxidil to have an impact in terms of hair regrowth. However, there are a lot of reports of noticeable improvement within two months of regular and consistent application.
These are more relevant because they mark the stopping or slowing down of hair loss. Even dermatologists prescribing Minoxidil tend to expect results in two months. Still, you shouldn’t expect quick results from Minoxidil hair loss products. It doesn’t even matter how strong a product you choose.
In terms of frequency of use, product instructions will ask you to apply Minoxidil twice every day. While that is the recommendation, it isn’t mandatory. Even applying Minoxidil once every day can be enough. What you’ll have to make sure is that you’re regular with these applications.
You should also remember that applying too much Minoxidil or applying it more than twice a day will have no impact on how quickly you get results. Only regular and constant use is critical here.
Are There Any Side Effects Of Minoxidil Hair Loss Products?
The biggest limitation of Minoxidil hair loss products has to do with their application. To be effective, you’ll need to be very regular and consistent. Not only that, but you’ll also have to ensure that you give Minoxidil enough time to absorb into your scalp. This extended exposure can sometimes result in side effects for people with over sensitive skin and scalp.
The side effects range from an irritated scalp to some minor inflammation. In even rarer cases, redness, itchiness, flaking, and even dandruff have been noticed.
While Minoxidil can cause these side effects too, in the majority of cases, they’re caused by propylene glycol. Overuse of Minoxidil may result in an adverse impact on your blood pressure too.
Apart from this, you may see some shedding when you start using Minoxidil hair loss products. This happens because Minoxidil is coaxing hair follicles to get into the right stage for hair growth. It is part of how Minoxidil works but some people see it as a side effect.
An increase in facial hair growth can also be a side effect of using Minoxidil products.

Top 3 Premium Minoxidil Hair Loss Products for Men: Detailed Reviews
1. Men’s Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Foam for Hair Loss and Hair Regrowth
Editor’s Rating: 4.5/5.0
View on Amazon
Men’s Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Foam is the flagship product of this highly trusted brand. More than that, though, it is the leading product in the entire industry. It is incredibly successful in countering hair loss too.
According to the company, clinical testing has shown Rogaine to have a 90% success rate when it comes to hair regrowth! Similar tests have even proven that Rogaine has the ability to regrow up to 25% hair on users’ scalps.
The main active ingredient in this product is 5% Minoxidil, which is the maximum that most formulations can contain. Additionally, this Rogaine formula also contains various “botanical extracts” along with Alpha-Hydroxy Acid (AHA). AHA’s function is to exfoliate your scalp and remove obstructions around your hair follicles.
Minoxidil, in general, takes anything between 4 to 6 months to start showing results but it depends on the formulation. Claims from the company, which are backed by individual reports from users, suggest that this formula starts showing results by 12 weeks at most.
Another way that this product differs from other Minoxidil hair loss products is that it smells good. This Rogaine product is very easy to apply, particularly since it comes in the foam format. Further, you can also use it if you have color treated or chemically treated hair without worry.
On the box of this product, you’ll see instructions about its use. The instructions state that this product should only be used by people who’re losing hair on the vertex of their scalps. This is the topmost part on your scalp.
Even though Rogaine has categorically stated that its products should only be used on vertex-based hair loss, people have tried it in other places such as the face, frontal hairline, temples, and even eyebrows.
The results have been mixed with some seeing significant results while others seeing no new developments. Some people even say that this product doesn’t work on vertex hair loss conditions. However, such concerns exist for all Minoxidil products.
This product is also competitively priced so you won’t take much of a financial hit if it doesn’t work for you. Moreover, Rogaine offers a safety net by way of a 120 days satisfaction guarantee.
You should also note that you may see some shedding in the first two weeks of using this product. However, it will stop after a while and new growth should become visible by the third month. Apart from this, there may be some other side effects if your scalp is especially sensitive.
Who’s it for: If you’re trying Minoxidil for the first time in your life, you shouldn’t consider any product other than this one. Starting with Rogaine is the safest and most reliable option beginners.

2. Hair Regrowth Treatment By Bosley
Editor’s Rating: 3.5/5.0
View on Amazon
Bosley is one of the newer entrants in the Minoxidil market. They were only established in 2009 and primarily manufacture products with hair styling in mind. This is why Hair Regrowth Treatment is suitable for color and chemically treated hair.
This is also the reason why this product is completely unscented. The lack of scent allows it to be combined with other styling products without worries about blended scents.
This formulation is based around 5% Minoxidil, which is presented in an alcohol solution. This means that it contains propylene glycol which is known to be at the source of all side effects associated with Minoxidil solutions. As a result, some people may experience itchiness, irritation, and inflammation, especially if their scalps are sensitive.
Like most Minoxidil hair loss products, this one also categorically says that it is only meant for people with hair loss in the vertex. In practice, people have tried it in other places. Some say it works while others say it doesn’t. So, if your intention is to use this product for your receding hairline or anything other than the vertex, you’ll have to try it to see if it works.
The product comes with a child-resistant dropper but it still runs all over the place when applied. Not only that, its consistency is very greasy, which puts off a lot of people. It is also priced at the higher end but that can be explained away by its “salon-like” quality.
Who’s it for: If you style your hair a lot and insist only on “salon quality” products, this is the one you should go for.

3. Equate Hair Regrowth Treatment for Men with Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength
Editor’s Rating: 4.0/5.0
View on Amazon
Equate is a Walmart brand now and that gives it a lot more credibility than what it had before the grand acquisition. Equate Hair Regrowth Treatment is supposed to be a direct competitor to Rogaine Minoxidil hair loss products.
Its formula is very similar to that of Rogaine 5% Minoxidil. However, this product delivers quicker results than most other Minoxidil hair loss products out there. Users claim that this product will give you results within 6 to 8 weeks but then there are others who say that it doesn’t work at all.
The product is also useful for all types of hair loss problems. This means that you can try it for male pattern baldness, thinning hair, receding hairline, receding temples, and even sparse beards.
Its users even include some women but they find this product too effective with some complaining of unwanted facial hair growth. Incidentally, Equate also has a 2% Minoxidil product just for the ladies.
The product is alcohol based and contains propylene alcohol. This base is an irritant and can result in side effects of various types such as itchiness and irritation.
Its solution form also means that a lot of wastage takes place during application as the product has a tendency to flow and drip down freely. This shouldn’t peg you back financially, though. The product is competitively priced.
Who’s it for: Equate itself markets this product as a replacement for Rogaine. Therefore, if Rogaine didn’t work for you or if you want something cheaper, you can try this out.

4. Kirkland Signature Minoxidil 5 Percent Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men
Editor’s Rating: 4.0/5.0
View on Amazon
Minoxidil hair loss products used to be exorbitant for the longest of time up until the patents expired. While the prices have come down since then, they’re still quite high. Kirkland Signature Minoxidil for Men bucks that trend handsomely.
When it comes to 5% Minoxidil hair loss products, this product is probably the most affordable in both, the short and the long term. It is also available in a wide array of quantities ranging from a single bottle to a pack of 12 bottles. However, the 6 bottle set is the most popular.
Kirkland markets this product for vertex hair loss but it is very accomplished on an overall basis. For example, a lot of people are successfully using this to make their beards thicker and some are even using it for their receding hairlines.
There are even women users but they also complain of unwanted facial hair growth. The product is alcohol based. It contains propylene alcohol which means that there is always the risk of side effects like itching, inflammation, flaking, and dandruff.
Since it is a solution, it comes with a child-resistant dropper for application. The dropper isn’t all that helpful, though. The product flows freely which is why so many users are using separately purchased spray bottles.
Of course, there is always the minority that says that this product doesn’t work. It is also worth pointing out that some people will experience excessively dry scalp and skin because of this product.
Who’s it for: Kirkland is an ideal option if Rogaine didn’t work for you. More importantly, if you’re looking for bulk solutions, nothing beats Kirkland.

5. GoodSense Minoxidil Topical Aerosol Foam Hair Regrowth Treatment
Editor’s Rating: 4.5/5.0
View on Amazon
GoodSense Minoxidil Topical Aerosol Foam Hair Regrowth Treatment is another excellent alternative to Rogaine especially if expense is a major concern for you. It is available at a decent price that won’t burn a hole in your bank account in the long term.
This product is also foam based which means that it doesn’t contain alcohol. Chances of Minoxidil side effects go down when the formulation isn’t based on propylene alcohol. It isn’t completely free of side effects, however. Some of you may see some redness, flaking, and irritation.
Since there aren’t as many foam Minoxidil products out there, products like GoodSense stand out. Being foam based also means that this product won’t dry your scalp and skin the way that Minoxidil solutions do. Further, it means that it will dry quickly after application and won’t even flow to your neck, forehead, and ears.
The formulation is completely free of scent so you’ll be able to use it in conjunction with other hair products. You should expect results in the usual 2 to 4 months and not before, though.
Who’s it for: This product is a good alternative to Rogain, Kirkland, and Equate. If none of them worked, this one’s definitely worth a shot.

6. Basic Care Minoxidil Topical Solution USP
Editor’s Rating: 3.5/5.0
View on Amazon
The manufacturing company behind the Basic Care brand is the same as the one behind the Kirkland brand – Perrigo. In fact, some users even say that this product is virtually identical to Kirkland’s flagship formulation with one difference – cost.
This product is incredibly cheap and that is its Unique Selling Point (USP) too. It is cheaper for a reason and that reason is that it has some flaws. For example, it comes with a child-resistant dropper that is quite prone to leaking. The formulation is quite greasy too. Despite being greasy, the formulation can leave your scalp quite dry if you apply too much of it.
Further, this product is alcohol based which means that it is prone to flowing down your scalp onto your face, ears, and neck. It also means that it contains propylene alcohol. Propylene alcohol can cause scabbing, dandruff, and itching to some people.
Even considering all these flaws, when this product works, it works well. Although, it takes the same amount of time as most Minoxidil products to show results. You should expect to see results before 2 to 4 months.
Still, while this product works for most people, there are always those on whom it has no effect.
Who’s it for: If finances are a major concern, then Basic Care is worth a shot. It is also a good option if Rogaine, Kirkland, and GoodSense all fail you.

7. Women’s Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Foam for Hair Thinning and Loss
Editor’s Rating: /5.0
View on Amazon
Rogaine will forever be the gold standard in the Minoxidil market. It is where most people begin their recovery from hair loss. Women’s Rogaine 5% Minoxidil foam is designed specifically for ladies who’ve been unfortunate enough to suffer some hair loss.
Women are usually told not to use 5% Minoxidil concentrations but when conditions are serious, serious actions are needed. This product is the safest if you want to take a “serious” step in dealing with your hair loss.
The main risk with 5% Minoxidil for women is unwanted hair growth when the product flows and touches other body parts. This product comes in the foam form which negates the threat of flowing Minoxidil before it even becomes pertinent.
The foam itself is quick drying and easy to apply which further prevents undue contact on the face or the neck. In fact, if you apply this product to wet hair, it becomes even easier to massage it into your scalp without worrying about overflows.
Typically, new hair will manifest in about 12 weeks but there is some variation. Some of you may see quicker results while others may have to wait longer. It is also safe to use for women with color or chemically treated hair.
Rogaine also has a blanket 120 day satisfaction guarantee for all its products which can be availed if the product doesn’t work for you. However, compared to the men’s 5% Minoxidil Rogaine, this one is on the expensive side.
Who’s it for: Ladies who are willing to dare 5% Minoxidil will not find any option better than Rogaine’s 5% Minoxidil foam.

8. Keranique Hair Regrowth Treatment Extended Nozzle Sprayer
Editor’s Rating: 3.5/5.0
View on Amazon
Keranique is a brand owned by Ulta Beauty – the largest beauty retailer in the US. The company has a number of salons spread across the country, which explains the salon quality Keranique Hair Regrowth Treatment.
This product contains 2% Minoxidil – the recommended amount for ladies suffering from mild hair loss. In fact, most women will do well to try a 2% Minoxidil product like Keranique before even daring to move on up to 5% Minoxidil concentrations. It is just safer.
Being a salon-style product manufactured by salon specialists, this product is not greasy at all. On the flipside, the lack of grease means that this product will leave your hair and scalp dry after use. It is also easy to apply as it comes with extended nozzle sprayers.
Even though it comes as a spray, it is based on alcohol which means propylene glycol. As it contains propylene glycol, you will have to risk side effects like irritation, dandruff, flakiness, itching, and redness.
Another downside of this product from Keranique is its cost. It is very expensive, especially if you compare it to its competitors. The expense starts looking even more unattractive when you consider that no Minoxidil product can offer 100% guarantee.
Who’s it for: Keranique is a good alternative to try when Women’s Rogaine doesn’t work especially if you’re only willing to entertain salon quality products.

9. Nioxin Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women
Editor’s Rating: 4.0/5.0
View on Amazon
Nioxin is a salon-style brand that has been around for quite some time. In fact, it has been offering products designed to counter hair thinning for more than 25 years. It even has formal support from The Institute of Trichologists.
The Nioxin product we’re reviewing today is a 2% Minoxidil solution created specifically for ladies. There is also a 5% Minoxidil solution from the same company. If the 2% solution doesn’t work for you, you can also try it but beware that it is designed for severe hair loss problems in men.
Nioxin’s salon focused history means that this product is designed for people who like to style their hair. It is compatible to color and chemical treated hair. It is even unscented to make it more compatible with hair care regimes that involve multiple products.
In a market that is seeing new Minoxidil products being launched every few months, the Nioxin Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women stands out because it leaves a tingling sensation in the scalp.
The product is a solution which means that it is based on alcohol. This alcohol is propylene glycol that has a history of causing irritation, itching, and inflammation in some people.
It also means that it has a tendency to run onto the forehead, ears, and the neck. However, that won’t happen if you use the provided dropper. The dropper has a very convenient mark to show you how much to apply and prevent overuse.
While most users have appreciated the dropper greatly, they have also categorically criticized the bottle design. This is because a lot of them have found it difficult to open the bottle. This can be very annoying especially since you don’t expect such issues with expensive products.
Who’s it for: If you use multiple hair products and style your hair a lot, Nioxin should make you very happy.
