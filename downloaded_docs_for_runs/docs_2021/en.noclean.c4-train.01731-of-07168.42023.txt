Hazards Including Second Degree Burns Lead to Recall Tassimo Coffee Makers
By Larry Kramer
A 10 year old girl sufferred a second degree burn to her face and neck and needed to be hospitalized as a result of a defective coffee maker. The consumer Product Safety Comission (CPSC) reported that there have been 140 reports of problems with the Tassimo single-cup brewers dousing people, including 37 cases involving second degree burns. CPSC reported that the plastic disc that holds the coffee or tea in the coffee maker’s (T-disc) can burst while brewing and spray hot liquid and coffee grounds or tea leaves onto consumers .
About 835,000 coffee makers are on recall in the United States and another 900,000 in Canada. The agency also announced the recall of 4 million packages of Tassimo espresso T-discs after 21 reports of problems.
Contact with hot liquids is one of the causes of a second degree burn. Clinical features of a second degree burn may include the following;
Blisters.
Deep redness.
Swelling.
Pain (they are the most painful because nerve endings are intact).
Peeling of the skin.
Shock because of the loss of fluid.
Burned area may appear wet and shiny or white.
Treatment:
Second degree burns can be treated at home if they are minor. Moderate and critical burns require treatment in a hospital. You need to seek medical treatment immediately if the burn is greater than 2-3 inches in diameter, if it is on the face, hands, feet, or genitals; or if the burn is caused by an electrical source.
The goal of treatment for second degree burns is to ease the pain and prevent infection.
Remove any jewelry or clothes from the burned area.
Hold the burn under cool running water for 10-15 minutes or apply cold water compresses like a wet towel.
Don’t break blisters because it will increase the risk of infection.
You can apply an antibiotic cream or an aloe based cream then cover the burn with a dry sterile gauze pad.
Use pain reducing medications like Tylenol or Motrin.
If the burn is on the arms or legs, keep them raised to reduce swelling.
Avoid the following things:
Don’t use ice or ice water. (may cause more injury).
Don’t remove clothing if it is stuck to the burn (it will remove burned tissue with it).
Don’t put grease, ointments, petroleum jelly or home remedies, these substances can hold the heat in and make the burn worse.
Don’t use bandages with adhesive material (it will stick to the wound).
Don’t give aspirin to a child under the age of 18 years.
If there is any change or worsening of the burned area you should see your doctor. These changes include: puss drainage from the burned area, increased redness, excessive swelling, blister filled with greenish or brownish fluid, fever, swollen lymph nodes, numbness or coolness of the skin beyond the burned area. (See wound infection)
A second degree burn heals between 10 days to 3 weeks, deep second degree burns may take more than 3 weeks to heal.
