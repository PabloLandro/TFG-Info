Vitamin B Doesn't Reduce Cognitive Risk in Healthy Elderly
What does homocysteine really tell us?

Lowering plasma homocysteine levels with oral vitamin B12 and folic acid does not appear to be an effective strategy for reducing memory loss and Alzheimer's risk, according to findings from a randomized, clinical trial of elderly people in the Netherlands with elevated homocysteine.
Close to 3,000 people over the age of 65 with baseline homocysteine (Hcy) levels of between 12 and 50 mcmol/L received treatment with either a single daily tablet containing 400 mcg folic acid and 500 mcg of vitamin B12 or a daily placebo tablet for 2 years.
Even though the B-vitamin group showed much larger declines in Hcy levels than the placebo group, cognitive domain scores did not differ over the 2-year study between the two groups, lead researcher Nikita van der Zwaluw, PhD, of Wageningen University, Wageningen, the Netherlands, and colleagues wrote in the Nov. 12 online issue of the journal Neurology.
High Homocysteine Linked to Cognitive Decline
Elevated plasma homocysteine has been linked to a greater risk for age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, and it has been suggested that lowering homocysteine levels with folic acid and vitamin B12 may be protective.
"Serum folate and vitamin B12 are involved in the Hcy pathway, acting on the conversion of Hcy into methionine," the researchers wrote. "Deficiencies of these vitamins may result in elevated Hcy levels, impaired DNA synthesis and methylation, and accumulation of abnormal fatty acids in membranes of neural tissue. This may negatively influence cognitive performance."
Several observational studies have shown associations between poor vitamin B12 and folate status and cognitive performance, but the randomized, controlled trials examining the issue have been mixed.
A meta-analysis of 13 trials in healthy elderly people did not show a protective effect for supplementation with B12, B6, folic acid, or a combination of these vitamins against cognitive decline, but the studies had a great deal of heterogeneity in dosages used and participants, and only four of the 13 had a follow-up of a year or longer, the researcher noted.
B-Vitamin Group Had Bigger Hcy Declines
Their multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial followed 2,919 elderly people for 2 years, during which time they took the B12, folic acid oral tablets or placebo tablets. Both B12 and placebo tablets also contained 15 mcg of vitamin D3.
The original goal of the Dutch study was to assess the efficacy of vitamin B and folic acid for preventing osteoporosis.
The mean age of the study participants was 74 years (SD 6.5 years) and over the 2-year period Hcy concentrations deceased by an average of 5.0 mcmol/L (95% CI minus 5.3-minus 4.7) in the B-vitamin group, from a median of 13.9 mcmol/L (interquartile range 12.9-16.2) to 9.3 mcmol/L (IQR 8.2-11.2).
Hcy levels in the placebo group dropped by an average of 1.3 mcmol/L (95% CI minus 1.6-minus 0.9), from 14.4 to 13.3 mcmol/L (IQR 11.5-16.0).
But Cognitive Performance Was Similar
Mean baseline cognitive test scores did not differ between the two groups. Both groups improved performance on episodic memory and executive functioning testing over 2 years, but no effect of B-vitamin treatment was observed.
Performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) measured in the total population, decreased slightly less in the B-vitamin group (-0.1, 95% CI minus 0.2-0.00) compared with the placebo group (-0.3, 95% CI minus 0.4-minus 0.2; P=0.05).
A battery of validated tests were used to measure cognitive domains, episodic memory, attention and working memory, information processing speed, and executive function.
None of the other single cognitive tests performed at 2 years was significantly different between the treatment groups. The per-protocol analyses revealed slightly larger differences between groups, but no significant effects were observed.
Subgroup analysis of participants younger than age 80 and 80 and older also failed to show a treatment effect.
Study strengths included the large sample size, the longer length than most previous trials, and the use of validated neuropsychological testing, which enabled the researchers to examine the effect of supplementation on a broad range of cognitive functions that decline with age.
Older People With Cognitive Deficits May Benefit
A potential limitation, cited by the researchers, was the inclusion of vitamin D, which has also been associated with better cognitive performance and lower dementia risk, in both the B-vitamin and placebo tablets.
"Although vitamin D supplementation is recommended for elderly people in the Netherlands, still 44% of the total population was vitamin D deficient at baseline (<50 nmol/L)," the researchers wrote. "It is possible that vitamin D supplementation diluted potential effects of vitamin B12 and folic acid on cognitive performance, although these nutrients may have different mechanisms that account for a possible effect."
Nevertheless, based on their study and findings from previous randomized, controlled trials, the researchers concluded that supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 does not appear to positively effect cognitive performance in healthy elderly people.
They noted that cross-sectional and prospective MRI studies and one previous randomized, controlled trial did suggest a beneficial effect for B-vitamin supplementation on brain atrophy in patients with mild cognitive decline (MCI), and they wrote that the results from their trial involving cognitively healthy older adults cannot be extrapolated to this population.
Principal funding sources for B-Proof were The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development, the Dutch Dairy Association, and the Netherlands Consortium on Healthy Aging.
The researchers disclosed no relevant relationships with industry.
