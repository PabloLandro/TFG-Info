Minoxidil Desc:
Minoxidil is an antihypertensive vasodilator medication. It also slows or stops hair loss and promotes hair regrowth. Now off-patent, it is available over-the-counter for the treatment of androgenic alopecia.Widely used for the treatment of hair loss, it has been proven clinically effective in both the prevention of loss and in establishing varying degrees of hair re-growth in males and females suffering pattern baldness. Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth.
Product Application of Minoxidil:
Minoxidil was the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (hair loss). Before that, minoxidil had been used as vasodilator drug prescribed as oral tablet to treat high blood pressure, with side effects that included hair growth and reversal of male baldness. In the 1980s, UpJohn Corporation came out with a topical solution of 2% minoxidil, called Rogaine, for the specific treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Since the 1990s, numerous generic forms of minoxidil have become available to treat hair loss while the oral form is still used to treat high blood pressure.
The popularity hair loss treatment is due to the general preference in the overall population for the cosmetic appearance of a full head of hair. Minoxidil is used to stimulate hair growth in areas of the scalp that have stopped growing hair. As of early 2001, the exact mechanism of action of minoxidil is not known.

High Quality Anabolic Steroids Methyl Drostanolone For Male Muscle Building 3381-88-2
Methyl Drostanolone Basic Info.
Product Name: Methyl Drostanolone (Steroids)
Synonyms: 2,17-Dimethyldihydrotestosterone; 17-hydroxy-2,17-dimethylandrostan-3-one
CAS: 3381-88-2
Molecular Formula: C19H30O2

Packing: foil bag or tin.
Delivery: Express courier.
Character: White crystalline powder.
Usage: pharmaceutical material, Steroid hormone, Anabolin. As a male hormone and anabolic hormones.
Methyl Drostanolone Description:
Methasterone (Superdrol, methasteron, and methyldrostanolone) is an oral anabolic steroid. Superdrol or Methasterone is an anabolic steroid. For bodybuilding/athletic purposes Superdrol increases testosterone levels which induce substantial increases in bodily shape and size, largely due to its ability to increase your number of muscle fibers.
These benefits alone make Superdrol a formidable androgen, but it also encompasses other traditional steroid properties like: increased red blood cell (RBC) production; improved endurance during exercise via better lactic acid clearing; enhanced oxygen and nutrient delivery to working muscles for greater stamina; better muscle glycogen restoration after exercise for faster recovery and; the inhibition of catabolism (muscle destruction).
Methyl Drostanolone Applications:
Superdrol is that it does not turn into estrogen. Many prohormones available start out as a testosterone-like substance in the body, but then eventually turn into estrogen through a process called aromatization. Estrogen causes decreased strength, muscle loss and fat gain. Thus, it is a promoter of the exact opposite traits someone who is taking Superdrol would want. These characteristics arise after one stops taking the compound. With Superdrol, however, the aromatization process never starts. The compound does not turn into estrogen in the body, meaning much of the muscle gain and fat loss one experienced while taking it will remain after dosing concludes.
When someone tries to build muscle by going to the gym and working out without anything else, they usually just end up quite frustrated. If you do not give your body what it needs to recover from tearing up your muscle fibers, you are really just destroying your muscles if you do not allow for them to heal.

Usage: amino acid, nutrient, Labeled Raloxifene, intended for use as an internal standard for the quantification of Raloxifene by GC- or LC-mass spectrometry.A nonsteroidal, selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Antiosteoporotic.
Product Description:
Raloxifene HCL(marketed as Evista) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has estrogenic actions on bone and anti-estrogenic actions on the uterus and breast. It is used in the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.
This drug is different from hormones (including estrogens and progestins). It works by acting like estrogen (as a selective estrogen receptor modulator or SERM) in some parts of the body. Raloxifene HCL helps to preserve bone mass, but it does not affect the breast and uterus like estrogen or relieve symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes.
Raloxifene HCL is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is also used for reduction of risk and treatment of invasive breast cancer, and it also reduces breast density.For either osteoporosis treatment or prevention, supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate.
Raloxifene HCL is used to prevent and treat bone loss (osteoporosis) in women after menopause. Maintaining strong bones by slowing bone loss helps to reduce the risk of fractures.
Raloxifene HCL may also lower the chance of getting a certain type of breast cancer (invasive) in women after menopause.

Estradiol Enanthate Description:
Estradiol enanthate (INN, USAN), or estradiol enantate, is a synthetic ester, specifically the 17-heptanoyl ester, of the natural estrogen, estradiol. It is marketed under the brand names Anafertin, Deladroxate, Perlutan, and Topasel, which are combination formulations of estradiol enanthate and dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide, as a once-monthly injectable hormonal contraceptive in Spain and Latin America, and has been used as such since at least the mid-1960s.
Estradiol, or more precisely, 17β-estradiol, is a human sex hormone and steroid, and the primary female sex hormone. It is named for and is important in the regulation of the estrous and menstrual female reproductive cycles. Estradiol is essential for the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues but it also has important effects in many other tissues including bone. While estrogen levels in men are lower compared to women, estrogens have essential functions in men as well. Estradiol is found in most vertebrates as well as many crustaceans, insects, fish, and other animal species.
Estradiol or oestradiol (American or British English usages), derives from estra-, Gk. οστρο? (oistros, literally meaning "verve or inspiration") and -diol, a chemical name and suffix indicating that this form of steroid and sex hormone is a type of alcohol bearing two hydroxyl groups.
Estradiol is produced especially within the follicles of female ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and non-endocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from progesterone (arrived at in two steps from cholesterol, via intermediate pregnenolone). One principle pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy-derivative, and then to androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations.Action of aromatase on this dione generates estrone, and action of a dehydrogenase on this gives the title compound, 17β-estradiol.
Estradiol Enanthate Function:
Hormones and Regulation of Endocrine Function of Drug, Nutritional Therapeutics, Antibiotic and Antimicrobial Agents, Antiparasitic, Original Drug Resistant Microbes, Immune System Drugs, Specialist Drugs, Drug Detoxification, Diagnostic Agents, Blood System Agents, Visceral System Medication, Central Nervous System Agents, Cardiovascular Agents, Urinary System Agents, Respiratory System Agents.
A chemical derivative of estradiol, ethinyl estradiol with maximum dosage 200 µg, is a major component of hormonal contraceptive devices. Combined forms of hormonal contraception contain ethinyl estradiol and a progestin, which both contribute to the inhibition of GnRH, LH, and FSH, which accounts for the ability of these birth control methods to prevent ovulation and thus prevent pregnancy. Other types of hormonal birth control contain only progestins and no ethinyl estradiol.
