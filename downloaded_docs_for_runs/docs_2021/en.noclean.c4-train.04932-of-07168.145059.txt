evening primrose
Evening primrose is a wildflower that grows throughout the United States. Native Americans used the seeds for food and made poultices from the whole plant to heal bruises. European settlers took the root back to England and Germany where it was eaten as food.
EPO is found in the plant's seeds, and is high in the essential fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Essential fatty acids, such as omega-6s found in EPO and omega-3s found in fish oil, are used as building blocks for a number of molecules in the body. Your body needs a balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids for good health. Today, EPO has ben found effective in treating eczema.
Evening primrose oil can be found in the following Landia products:
