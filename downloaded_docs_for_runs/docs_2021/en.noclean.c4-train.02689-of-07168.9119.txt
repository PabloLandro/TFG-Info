Migrane Pain is The Worst Migraine Symptom....
Migrane Pain and Nausea are Two Symptoms To Avoid..
Migrane pain is intense, throbbing, and pounding.
Does that about sum it up? What migrainures want is short term and long term pain relief. Better explained, short term is when a migrainure trips up and has an attack. Then something to take the intense pain away is a must. Long term migraine pain relief can be obtained by simply learning about migraines, what they are, and what can give, cause, or trigger one.
Each migraine sufferer that consumes Over the Counter, and even doctor prescribed pain relievers without knowing what can trigger their migraine may unknowable end up suffering with the same thing that 85% of migrainures end up with. That's daily headaches called rebounds. At the very best migraines have to be manage if possible. We know that ten to fifteen percent have a hard time of gaining relief from their pain.
What is prescribed for short term migraine pain relief.
Triptans are probably the most prescribed medicine for aborting a migraine attack. They are:
Almotriptan (Axert)
Rizatriptan (Maxalt)
Zolmitriptan (Zomig)
Naratriptan (Amerge)
Sumatriptan 6 mg self injection and works the fastest.
Sumatriptan nasal spray faster than tablets. (Wife took this sometimes)
Sumatriptan (Imitrex) is the original and comes in 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg.
Frovatriptan (Frova) is helpful for menstrual.
Some doctors may prescribe Opioids such as:
Codeine
Oxycodone
Nausea and vomiting are also two migraine symptoms that have to be treated. Migraine headache medications for that are:
Reglan
Phenergan
Compazine
These can be taken orally or rectally.
It's said that over two migraines a month treated with these quick pain relievers can quite possibility cause rebound headaches. If the attacks become more frequent pain relievers have to be considered as the cause.
Long term migrane pain relief.
Migrainures should look at how to gain long term migraine pain relief. Taking pain medicine during an attack is a must, but effort has to be made to find what causes the pain. Here's an example of what can trigger migraines. Each sufferer eats, drinks, or comes in contact each day with something that may be adding to the migrane pain level.
Reading our food triggers page will give an idea of how many foods and beverages can be a potential migraine trigger to some migrainures. Once you add everything else that are well known causes or triggers in there, and the thinking cap has to be used. Such things as:
Caffeine found in some foods and about all drinks and coffee.
Alcohol found in beer and wines.
Diary products such as aged cheese.
MSG found in most processed foods, especially canned soups.
All processed meats such as ham, hot dogs, bacon, and sausage.
Breads, cookies, cakes, and donuts.
Anger
Stress
Poor sleeping habits.
Consuming alcohol.
Large amounts of caffeine each day.
Two triggers for most women is menstrual, and taking birth control pills.

Skullcap helps to ease tension headaches. Migrainures tend to also have these overlap with their migraines.
SAMe can help with the prevention of migraines but has to be taken for about six weeks to give the full benefit.
Any of these can be found in Amazon. Herbs have been used many years before conventional medicines came about.
Short term migraine pain relief is from taking preventive medicine, and pain relievers such as one of the triptans.
For long term migraine pain relief, education about migraines, keeping a diary and paying close attention to your attacks and what you came in contact with, and also taking the tested, tried, and doctor approved supplements above will in the long run help. It will not make the pain worst. Migrainures account for about 50% of their own relief.
