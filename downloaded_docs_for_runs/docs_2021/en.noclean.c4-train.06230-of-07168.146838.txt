Description Ingredients
Lewis Family Calm & Relax is a topical cream containing a synergistic combination of the health promoting nutrients GABA and L-Theanine. Individually, both ingredients have a wide array of beneficial effects. Together, GABA & L-Theanine work together to help you combat stress and maintain a calm resiliency in today’s fast-paced world.
Calming GABA
GABA (Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid) is an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and nervous system. Its chief role is to inhibit the transmission of signals in the nerves, thereby calming nervous system activity.
As an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA’s effects include reducing anxiety, relieving pain, and producing a calm, even-keeled and balanced state.
As a nutritional supplement, GABA has been utilized to calm anxiousness and to elevate mood. Insomnia has shown to be responsive to GABA, whether the problem includes the inability to fall asleep or with difficulty waking in the middle of the night. In effect, GABA is kind of like the “anti-coffee”... it helps you relax and unwind from the day!
Relaxing L-Theanine
L-Theanine is an amino acid found in tea, and is in large part what makes Green Tea so special. It has relaxing effects and can also improve cognitive functioning. Other studies have shown that L-Theanine can have a positive effect upon lowering high blood pressure, further demonstrating its relaxing influence upon our bodies.
Similar to GABA, L-Theanine can be fantastic for calming an over-excited nervous system. Research has demonstrated that stress-relieving effects are noticed within 30 minutes and can last up to 8-10 hours. Day or night, who wouldn't want that?
Additionally, L-Theanine has shined in research studies looking at cognitive functionality. Improvements are seen across the board in alertness and cognitive function, all while people experience a pleasant state of calmness and contentedness.
The Ultimate Stress Relieving Supplement!
With benefits such as stress reduction, better sleep, cognitive improvement, and improving your overall sense of well being, you can easily see why we recommend to “Keep Calm & Relax On!”
