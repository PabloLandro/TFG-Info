Helps Cubital Tunnel Syndrome
I struggle with Cubital Tunnel Syndrome and a chronically dislocating cuboid bone... these help with both of those situations. I just hiked countless mountain peaks, to numerous waterfalls, 2 geothermal areas and 3 lava tube caves, and tons of walking elsewhere while visiting Iceland for 2 weeks... I didn’t have a single day of pain! :)
Jenn, thank you for the great review on our product. We are happy to hear that it helped you out so much while you were on your adventures! Thank you for being a Vive Health Customer! -Rebecca, Vive Health CS-

Will this fit my wide feet?

Is this for one brace?
Yes, it is a single brace that can be worn on the left or right foot as needed.
How do I put the brace on correctly?
