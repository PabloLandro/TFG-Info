Treximet for Migraines...Cost and Side Effects..
Let's Tear into Treximet to See if It's Right For You!!!
Treximet is an anti-migraine drug with two pain relieving agents.
All migraine sufferers have to have relief from their pain once a migraine attack begins. For several years now the triptan drugs have been the top ones for getting the job done. Different ones are available. They even have one that works for women's menstrual's called Frovatriptan. In this page we'll cover one that has two pain fighters, Naproxen a pain reliever combined with Sumatriptan.
Individual side effects of Imitrex and Naproxen.
These side effects will be the combination of these two medications. We'll give you the most common side effects of both since the side effects could vary between each individual. These are the most important, but any unusual side effects should be immediately reported to your physician. Side effects of naproxen can be:
Bleeding ulcers
Interfere with blood clotting and blood thinner at high doses.
May increase blood pressure, and stroke risk.
While these are the most serious, one could have:
Nausea, vomiting, and stomach upset taking this anti-inflammatory medication.
Sumatriptan is a class of migraine medications called triptans. While they're one of the best for aborting migraines, and also cluster headaches, they also come with side effects. The side effects are usually mild to moderate, but if you have high blood pressure, liver problems or heart disease, the doctor should be keep up to date with all the health problems. The chances may be slim on this, but if you're going to have heart surgery, don't take treximet.
Other side effects of sumatriptan are:
Tiredness
Tingling in the hands or feet.
Dry mouth
Weakness
Chest tightness
Flushing
Be very careful about taking other drugs while taking treximet.
Treximet side effects.
When taking this drug with the two combined medicines and experience:
Flu-like symptoms.
Stomach pain or a sudden and severe abdominal pain.
Vomit blood or black tarry stool.
Blisters, itching or skin rash.
Swelling in the arms or legs, hands feet, face, lips or tongue.
Unusual weight gain or feeling tired or weaker than usual.
Whites of the eyes or skin beginning to yellow.
If any of the above occur while taking Treximet contact the doctor at once.
Treximet dosage.
This drug isn't recommenced for children or seniors. For adults, one tablet contains 85 Mg of Sumatriptan and 500 Mg or Naproxen, and no more than two a day for migraine attacks should be consumed.
Don't treat more than four migraines a month. Don't split, crush or chew these tablets. The reason for no more than four a month is because this drug as well as most pain medicines can cause migraines to become more severe and frequent.
The cost may be somewhere between twenty to thirty dollars a pill. It's best to price this drug. Many variables come to mind. If someone has insurance the copay may take the sting off of this pill. There is no generic for this drug. It pays to check around. If someone is on disability for migraines then medicare will pay a big chunk of it.
Studies have found that triptans work well to abort migraines, and by adding naproxen it does better at getting rid of the pain. And that's what's needed after a migraine attacks, the fastest method for reducing pain, period. This drug targets nerves and blood vessels that are thought to trigger migraines and also helps to relieve inflammation that also causes migraine pain.
