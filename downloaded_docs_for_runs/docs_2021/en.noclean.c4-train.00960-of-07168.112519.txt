When refering to evidence in academic writing, you should always try to reference the primary (original) source. That is usually the journal article where the information was first stated. In most cases Physiopedia articles are a secondary source and so should not be used as references. Physiopedia articles are best used to find the original sources of information (see the references list at the bottom of the article).
If you believe that this Physiopedia article is the primary source for the information you are refering to, you can use the button below to access a related citation statement.

Achilles Tendinopathy Toolkit: Summary of Interventions
Jump to:navigation, search
Purpose, Scope and Disclaimer: The purpose of this document is to provide physical therapists with a summary of the evidence for interventions commonly used to manage mid‐substance Achilles tendinopathy. This decision‐making tool is evidence‐informed and where there is insufficient evidence, expert‐informed. It is not intended to replace the clinician’s clinical reasoning skills and inter‐professional collaboration. ‘Acute’ refers primarily to the stage with the cardinal signs of heat, redness, pain, swelling and loss of function and a very recent onset of symptoms.

There is no clinical evidence but there is expert level consensus to support the use of joint mobilizations in the acute stage if assessment reveals joint restriction. There is a small amount of clinical evidence and more substantial expert level consensus to support the use of joint mobilizations in the chronic stage if assessment reveals joint restriction.

The clinical evidence neither supports nor refutes the use of frictions in the acute stage. There is a small amount of clinical evidence to support the use of soft tissue techniques, such as frictions, in the chronic stage.
Clinical implication
May consider using manual therapy in the acute stage after undertaking a comprehensive biomechanical evaluation of the ‐ Joint mobs hip, knee, foot and ankle. May consider a trial of soft tissue techniques, such as
frictions, in the chronic stage. Combining with an eccentric exercise regime may produce superior results.

There is a small amount of expert opinion to support the use of stretches in the acute stage. There is a large amount of clinical evidence to support the use of exercise in the chronic stage but the precise parameters to ensure effectiveness are not clear. Eccentric exercise in particular is supported although some protocols use both concentric and eccentric exercise. One RCT showed heavy slow resistance training is equally as effective as eccentric training.
Clinical implication
May consider using stretching exercises in acute stage. No prescription parameters are provided. ACSM recommends 10-30 sec hold, 2‐4 repetitions. Strongly consider using eccentric exercise in the chronic stage.
See Appendix A for further details on exercise prescription.

There is no clinical evidence, but there is a physiological rationale, to support the use of LLLT in the acute stage.
There is conflicting clinical evidence and conflicting expert opinion to support the use of LLLT in the chronic stage.
Clinical implication
May consider a trial of LLLT in the acute stage at the doses recommended by the World Association for Laser Therapy (www.walt.nu) i.e., 2‐4 J/point (not per cm2)*, minimum 2‐3 points.
*See 'Appendix B 'for further details on calculation of dosage.
Consider a trial of LLLT in the chronic stage at the following parameters: 0.9 J/point (not per cm2)*; 6 points on tendon.

There is expert opinion which suggests that ESWT be reserved for chronic stage. There is conflicting evidence to support the use of ESWT in the chronic stage. There is evidence suggesting that the outcomes are dependent upon the dosage of the shock wave energy (EFD ‐ energy flux density = mJ/mm²), rather than the type of shock wave generation (focused vs. radial ESWT). There is also evidence that the use of anaesthetic required in high energy protocols decreases the effectiveness of ESWT. Therefore, using low energy ESWT protocols without the need for anaesthetic are recommended as more practical, more tolerable, and less expensive with equivalent results. Low energy ESWT protocols can apply to both focused and radial ESWT.
Clinical implication
Consider NOT using Extracorporeal Shock Wave for the acute stage.
Consider a trial of ESWT in the chronic stage, especially if other interventions have failed, at the following parameters:
Low energy SWT: EFD = 0.18 – 0.3 mJ/mm² (2‐4 Bars)
2000‐3000 shocks
15‐30 Hz
3‐5 sessions, weekly intervals.
ESWT may enhance outcomes compared to exercise alone, therefore patients should be instructed to continue with a well‐designed exercise program.

There is a small amount of evidence to support the application of iontophoresis using dexamethasone in the acute stage. The role of iontophoresis is still investigational.
There is no evidence that anti‐inflammatory intervention with iontophoresis using dexamethasone has a useful role in the chronic stage.
Clinical implication
May consider, in the acute stage, a trial of iontophoresis, 0.4% dexamethasone (aqueous), 80 mA‐min; 6 sessions over 3 weeks.
A program of concentric‐eccentric exercises should be continued in combination with iontophoresis, if exercise loading is tolerated.

For any intervention selected by the clinician, it is strongly recommended that the clinician use one or more of the following outcome measures.
A. Patient reported outcome measure
Such as:
A global measure of lower extremity function: e.g., The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) ‐ not specific to Achilles tendinopathy
Available here
Detailed questionnaire, specific to Achilles tendinopathy e.g. the VISA‐A questionnaire
Available here (Click on ‘view questionnaire’)
B. Patient specific functional outcome measure
Such as:
How much weight can be applied to the plantar flexed foot on a weighing scale before the onset of pain
The number of heel raises before the onset of pain
The number of heel drops before the onset of pain
The number of heel drops with a specific weight in a backpack before the onset of pain
