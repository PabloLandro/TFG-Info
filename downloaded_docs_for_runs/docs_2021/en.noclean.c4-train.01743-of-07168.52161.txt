Fish for breakfast?
Posted on August 11, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
“Jesus said to them, ‘Come and eat breakfast.’ . . . .Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.” John 21:12a, 13
Jesus and His disciples started the day with a power breakfast to sustain their busy ministry. Fresh fish is a healthy source of protein, potassium, vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 essential fatty acids. Whole-grain bread provides energy and fiber.
People who eat lots of fish seem to have thinner blood. Norwegian scientists discovered that eating three ounces of mackerel daily could thin the blood within six weeks and reduce the risk of clogged arteries, heart attacks, and strokes. Mackerel has high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help lower blood pressure.
One study in Great Britain, involving hundreds of participants, showed that those who ate a diet heavy in fish developed higher levels of the good HDL cholesterol, even higher than those of vegetarians.
A study in The Netherlands compared those who ate one ounce of fish a week to those who ate none. The risk of heart disease was 50% less among those who ate just one ounce of fish weekly!
Fish oils also seem to help reduce the risk of many cancers, including breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and colon.
A study at the University of Cincinnati of people with chronic migraines reported that 60% of those who took fish oil capsules had a reduction in both severity and frequency of headaches over a six-week period. The average number of migraines dropped from two a week to two every two weeks.
Fish is often called ‘brain food’ for good reason!
Fish and its oils contain tyrosine, an amino acid that stimulates the brain to produce neurotransmitters that help us feel more alert.
DHA is a type of omega-3 fat that helps enhance brain health, including learning and memory. It helps keep the lining of the brain cells flexible so memory messages can pass easily between cells. The brain and retina of the eye contain the highest amounts of DHA of any tissues in the body.
Studies also indicate that taking fish oils can have positive anti-inflammatory benefits for skin and respiratory conditions, kidney disease, and menstrual cramps.
Tips for consuming fish and fish oil:
Choose wild-caught over farm-raised fish.
Mercury levels can be higher in larger fish like orange roughy (sea perch), blue fin tuna, yellow fin tuna, albacore tuna, bigeye tuna, ahi tuna, swordfish, shark, marlin, king mackerel, grouper, and catfish.
Lower levels of mercury are found in salmon, flounder, freshwater trout, mackerel, haddock, herring, mahi mahi, tilapia, whitefish, whiting, sole, pollock, and sardines. Canned chunk light and skipjack have lower levels of mercury than other tunas.
Eat cilantro with your fish to help remove mercury.
Choose fish oils that are certified mercury free.
Eat fish with fins and scales, as they protect the fish from mercury, worms, parasites, and disease.
Cilantro Pesto
Process in blender until smooth:
1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (preferably organic)
1/2 cup raw almonds
3 large garlic cloves (peeled)
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon mineral-rich salt (more or less to taste)
1/4 cup organic parmesan cheese (optional)
To make it spicy and add a circulatory boost, add a few dashes of cayenne pepper.
Serve with fish, pasta, or fresh veggies.

Two Brazil nuts a day may help keep the doctor away!
Posted on July 21, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Brazil nuts contain selenium, a trace mineral essential to health. Some of selenium’s impressive benefits include:
*Acts as an antioxidant to protect cells from damage.
*Helps maintain elasticity of the skin and other tissues.
*Aids function of the pancreas.
*Helps prevent hardening of the arteries and has anti-clotting effects in the blood.
*Helps convert thyroid hormone T4 to T3 (important for energy and metabolism).
*Reduces heavy metal toxicity.
*Enhances the immune system by increasing the production of white blood cells.
*Helps improve male fertility, and important for the normal development of a baby during pregnancy.
*Helps prevent cataracts.
*Helps with dandruff and seborrhea.
Consider the following research:
Studies have shown that low levels of selenium are associated with heart disease, skin problems, cataracts, muscular dystrophy, various infections, growth retardation, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, eczema, and psoriasis.
There is a strong link between low levels of selenium and cancer, especially of the colon, prostate, ovary, breast, skin, bladder, and lungs, as well as leukemia.
Studies have shown reduced fertility due to selenium deficiency.
In Australia, studies show that there may be a relationship between crib death (SIDS) and selenium deficiency.
Research in the 1970s demonstrated the following benefits of selenium:
*Helps protect against radiation.
*Helps detoxify heavy metals such as mercury by preventing their absorption and aiding in excretion.
*In animal studies, selenium detoxified the cancer-fighting drug Adriamycin without interfering with its actions.
Selenium is best obtained from whole foods like Brazil nuts (by far, the top source), 100% whole grains, fish, onions, broccoli, tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, sesame seeds, and butter and beef from grass-fed animals. Brazil nuts are also a good source of vitamin E, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and iron. Eat them whole or add them to your salads or smoothies.
The amount of selenium found in foods depends upon several factors:
*The condition of the soil–higher levels of selenium are generally found in western parts of The United States. In areas where selenium levels are high, males show significantly lower overall cancer death rates.
*Fertilizers that contain sulfur can prevent the absorption of selenium from the soil by the plant.
*The benefits of selenium are reduced by heat, processing, and cooking. Refining grains (enriched wheat, white rice, quick oats, etc.) can reduce selenium content up to 75%. Selenium is in the bran of wheat and the polishings of rice. Steel-cut oats are more nutritious than quick oats.
Supplementing with selenium can be tricky. The safest and best absorbed forms are selenium yeast and selenomethionine. The inorganic forms that are not well absorbed are sodium selenite and sodium selenate. Sodium selenite may also inhibit absorption of vitamin C. If you are taking a multi-vitamin/mineral or another supplement that contains selenium, check the label to find out which form it is. The inorganic forms of selenium are often added to processed foods.
Have a cup of hibiscus or milk thistle tea for some added selenium!

Blueberries–also known as “brain berries” and “youth berries”
Posted on June 30, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach

It’s blueberry season, so stock up! One study in the Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who ate 1 cup of blueberries a day had increased blood levels of antioxidants that may play an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, senility, cancer, cataracts, and macular degeneration. Other studies have shown that high blood levels of antioxidants have played a role in the prevention of breast cancer. (Check out 7 Proven Reasons to Eat more Blueberries.)
Historically, blueberries were pounded into dried meat to reduce its rate of spoilage. The berries and leaves were also used to make tea as a remedy for diarrhea.
Blueberries are rich in tannins that can help reduce inflammation in the digestive tract, and they also contain pectin, a soluble fiber that helps to relieve both constipation and diarrhea.
Like cranberries, blueberries are beneficial for the urinary tract by reducing the ability of E. coli bacteria to adhere to the lining of the urethra and bladder.
Anthocyanins give blueberries their deep blue color and contain powerful antioxidants that help protect cells from damage that can lead to degenerative diseases. They also contain the flavonoid quercetin, which has significant anti-inflammatory abilities.
Research done on rats by the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, at Tufts University, directed by Dr. James Joseph, showed better brain performance and improvement in coordination and balance in the rats that were fed the human equivalent of 1 cup of blueberries a day. The study also showed that their brains seemed to communicate better, had less damage, and they even developed new brain cells!
Blueberries seem to have a positive effect on the areas of the brain that control movement and have shown positive effects on those with multiple sclerosis. Some early studies on people who consumed a cup of blueberries a day showed improved performance on tests of motor skills.
Blueberries contain ellagic acid, an antioxidant that has been shown in studies to reduce cancer rates in people who consumed the most dietary ellagic acid. They were 3 times less likely to develop cancer.
Other fruits with similar health properties: raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, cherries, purple grapes, cranberries, and boysenberries.
Eat a variety for all of their various health benefits. Keep fresh, frozen, and dried fruits on hand. Buy them unsweetened and without added preservatives or flavorings. Remove any moldy berries before storing in the refrigerator.
Check the EWG’s 2016 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce to see which ones are on the Clean 15 and Dirty 12 Lists. The good news is that blueberries are not on the Dirty 12, but strawberries are number 1 this year for being highly contaminated with pesticides. Grapes come in at number 6 and cherries at number 7. I recommend that you buy these two fruits organic.
Red and blue berries are perfect for adding a patriotic touch to your fourth of July celebration!
Happy Independence Day!

What are you feeding your skin?
Posted on March 16, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Whenever you use those skin care products, fragrances, and cosmetics, you are feeding your skin. The question is what?
I hope that you’re making it a habit to read the ingredients on food and beverage labels to reduce your intake of unhealthy ingredients. Are you reading the ingredients on your personal care products? When you put product on your skin, it gets absorbed into your bloodstream!
So many personal care products use parabens as preservatives. These are known endocrine disruptors, can affect hormonal balance, and parabens have been found in human breast tumors! There are many types of parabens (ethylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, methylparaben, propylparaben, etc.), and you can find them in shampoos, conditioners, lotions, body washes, and face cleansers. Look for paraben-free or preservative-free products.
Triclosan is another endocrine disruptor often used in soaps, hand sanitizer, and toothpaste.
Some preservatives actually release formaldehyde when applied to the skin, and formaldehyde has been linked to cancer! These formaldehyde-releasing preservatives are used in many personal care products, including shampoos, liquid baby soaps, nail polish, eyelash and nail glues, hair gel, hair-smoothing products, body soap and wash, and cosmetics. Some of these ingredients: diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, DMDM gea
Avoid the UV filters octinoxate and oxybenzone, commonly found in sunscreens, liquid foundations, and some shampoos. These are endocrine disruptors.
How about that seemingly innocuous ingredient “fragrance”? It’s sort of like the word “natural flavors” on your food labels. What does it really mean? Fragrance could be any number of synthetic chemicals found in any number of personal care products, especially perfumes, colognes, body splashes, and air fresheners. Buy fragrance-free products, and use essential oils instead of synthetic fragrances.
Some other ingredients to be wary of: petrolatum, petroleum jelly, paraffin oil, and mineral oil. Petroleum is used to fuel automobiles, and if not fully refined, it may be contaminated with toxic chemicals. Mineral oil used on babies has been found to make it more difficult for them to absorb minerals, because it coats the lining of the digestive tract.
Lip balms and lipsticks may contain petroleum, mineral oil, and even lead! That kiss could be leaving more than just a lipstick print!
Watch out for coal tar, which is a known carcinogen and may cause neurological damage. It’s often found in shampoos, soaps, hair dyes, and lotions.
Remember, it’s the accumulation of toxins over time that can weaken your health, especially if you’re already dealing with a health issue. Think about where you are applying those personal care products: on your scalp (brain), on your face (sinuses), on your neck (thyroid), wrists (veins), abdomen (digestive tract, liver), chest (lungs), back (kidneys), knees (joints), etc.!

Aluminum additives in food and personal care products can accumulate in the body, including the bones!
Posted on February 24, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Aluminum toxicity accumulates over time and can be difficult for the body to eliminate. Beware of your exposure from various sources!
Aluminum hydroxide is used in many antacid medications.
Aluminum phosphate and sodium aluminum sulfate are used as stabilizers in many processed foods.
Aluminum salts are found in many antiperspirants (aluminum chlorhydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum hydroxybromide, aluminum zirconium) and can be absorbed through the skin.
In one study published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology, researchers found that women with breast cancer had a higher accumulation of aluminum in their breast tissue. Aluminum salts can also mimic estrogen, which has been shown to increase the risk for breast cancer.
There is growing evidence that chronic aluminum exposure can be a factor in many neurological diseases, including dementia, autism, ADHD, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s.
A study from Keele University in the UK shows high levels of aluminum in the brain of an individual exposed to aluminum at work, who later died from Alzheimer’s disease. In 2004 high levels of aluminum were found in the tissues of a British woman who died from early-onset Alzheimer’s.
Cooking with aluminum foil and/or aluminum cookware increases absorption of aluminum into food and beverages. This includes making coffee in an aluminum espresso maker.
Aluminum can be inhaled through cigarette smoke.
Read labels and avoid ingredients containing forms of aluminum.
Some foods that may contain aluminum: baking powder, self-rising flour, salt, baby formula, coffee creamers, processed foods
Foods and drinks in aluminum laminated pouches or aluminum cans
Toothpaste containing aluminum oxyhydroxides
Deodorants, antiperspirants, cosmetics, lotions, sunscreens, shampoos, bath salts, and other personal care products
Over-the-counter medications and/or dietary supplements containing aluminum, including the additive magnesium stearate
A healthy digestive tract will help move most of ingested aluminum out of your system before it gets absorbed. This means that you need to eat in a way that doesn’t leave you reaching for antacids or make you constipated for days.
Eat foods rich in fiber, especially vegetables, and avoid processed carbohydrates that are high in sugar and low in fiber.
To help restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria, eat some fermented foods like sauerkraut and apple cider vinegar. Add foods that contain live probiotic cultures like unsweetened yogurt and cottage cheese. Choose products from grass-fed cows and those not raised with antibiotics or growth hormones. If you don’t consume dairy products, consider taking a probiotic supplement.
Consume bone broth to help repair the gut and to supply collagen, shown to reduce the loss of bone mass and the likelihood of hip fractures. There’s a basic recipe on my website.
Eat foods high in sulfur like garlic, onions, kale, cabbage, cauliflower, asparagus, mustard greens, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, broccoli, avocados, bok choy, sweet potatoes, nuts, turnips, and watermelon. Sulfur helps the body to produce the antioxidant glutathione, which is essential for protecting the body from damage caused by chemicals like aluminum.
Drink enough pure water (tap water can also be contaminated with aluminum).
Get enough daily exercise and practice deep breathing to help remove toxins through perspiration and respiration.

Research shows that eating these fall foods can help fight cancer!
Posted on October 13, 2015 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Since most cancers are due to an unhealthy lifestyle, diet is a major key in prevention. Eating a variety of these seasonal foods may offer extra protection against cancer.
Cranberries contain elegiac acid which, in laboratory tests, has been shown to help prevent mutations in DNA, disarm cancer-causing agents, and help prevent the growth of tumors! Buy them without added sugar.
Oranges, lemons, and limes contain limonene, found in laboratory studies to help block lung and breast cancers and to get cancer cells to self-destruct!
Tangerines (also known as mandarin oranges) contain tangeretin and nobilitin, which research has shown to be extremely potent against certain types of breast cancer. Japanese researchers found that tangeretin could also inhibit the growth of leukemia cells!
Pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and winter squashes contain beta-carotene, which gives them their orange color and helps protect them from diseases. Research has shown that a diet rich in beta-carotene can help protect against a variety of cancers, including stomach, esophagus, lungs, and colon. Pumpkin also contains phenolic acids, chemicals that bind to potential carcinogens and help prevent them from being absorbed!
Stock up on these anti-cancer foods, and eat a variety of them often. Buy them organic when possible to help reduce cancer-causing toxins.
