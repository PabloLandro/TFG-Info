The Dos and Don'ts of Fighting a Fever
The Dos and Don'ts of Fighting a Fever
When your child's temperature rises, you worry. But a fever is a sign that the body is battling germs. In fact it can be beneficial, by kicking the immune system into high gear and creating a less-than-ideal environment for illness to thrive. Read on to learn how to handle the heat.

DON&apos;T Starve a Fever.
Ignore the old saying ("Feed a cold, starve a fever"), says pediatrician David L. Hill, M.D., author of Dad to Dad: Parenting Like a Pro. Children with a fever may be less hungry than normal, but when they do want to eat, offer a generally healthy, well-balanced diet. Nourished kids may be better able to fight infections.

DO Keep Him Hydrated.
Fever sweats can dehydrate a child, so offer lots of water (or, for vomiting and diarrhea, an electrolyte drink).
DON&apos;T Underdress (or Overdress) Your Child.
It&apos;s natural for a kid developing a fever to want to be dressed more warmly than others in the room, and a child breaking a fever will want to cool down, but Dr. Hill recommends not to overdo it either way.
DO Consider Using a Lukewarm Compress.
If your child is vomiting and unable to keep medicine down, fill your tub with an inch or two of tepid water and use a washcloth to dribble it over your child&apos;s trunk, arms, and legs to help lower her core temperature.
3 Things To Consider Before Calling the Doctor
1. How Old is Your Child?
Generally, the younger she is, the more worrisome a fever is. Call the doctor if your baby is newborn up to 3 months and has a fever of 100.4°F or higher; your 3- to 6-month-old has a temperature of 102°F or higher; or your child older than 6 months has a fever of 103°F or higher.
2. How Long Has He Had the Fever?
For a baby 3 to 12 months, call for any fever 100.4°F or higher that lasts more than 24 hours. Call if the fever lasts two or more days with no improvement in a child between 1 and 2 years, and for kids older than 2 if it hasn&apos;t improved after three days.

3. Are There Other Symptoms?
Call if you spot certain signs that suggest an illness requiring more treatment, like strep throat, an ear infection, or a urinary-tract infection. These include: repeated vomiting and/or diarrhea; severe ear pain, headache, and/or sore throat; stiff neck, listlessness, trouble breathing, unexplained rash, signs of dehydration (fewer wet diapers, decreased or no tears).
