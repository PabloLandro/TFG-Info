Studies suggest healthy diet, supplements may help maintain cognitive function

Like every other part of your body, your brain needs good nutrition to perform at its best. In the brain, nutrients facilitate essential functions that enable you to think, remember, sense, act and react – in a word, to live.
1. Nutrients help brain cells burn glucose – their primary fuel – more efficiently.
2. Nutrients help protect brain cells from oxidative damage.
3. Nutrients help brain cells make important neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers these cells use to communicate with each other and the rest of the body.
Researchers have accelerated their efforts to find nutritional ways to support brain health, in order to help our society meet the coming challenge of an aging population. These efforts are paying off. Today, accumulating evidence suggests that not only better overall nutrition, but also supplementation with several key nutrients may help stave off the reduced efficiency of brain cells that occurs with aging. These nutrients include:
• B vitamins – Especially those needed for metabolism (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin) and those needed to regulate homocysteine levels (folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6)
• Antioxidant vitamins E and C
o Other antioxidants, such as alpha-lipoic acid and plant extracts
• Essential fatty acids -- the “good fats” found in fish, nuts and vegetables
• Supplements and other precursor neurotransmitters
Studies suggest that a healthy diet plus supplements may help maintain cognitive function. The typical “Mediterranean” dietary pattern that includes higher levels of fish, olive oil, fruits and vegetables, cereals and wine has been found to be protective against age-related cognitive decline.1 This type of diet delivers higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (from fish), monounsaturated fatty acids (from olive oil and other vegetables), antioxidants (from fruits, vegetables and wine), and B vitamins (from cereal) than the typical Western diet. All of these are beneficial to both heart health and brain health, especially when they replace saturated fat and sugars.
B Vitamins
The B vitamins, especially thiamin, niacin, folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 are all implicated in brain health. Adequate levels of thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 are needed for the efficient metabolism of glucose, the brain’s primary fuel, and dementia is a well-documented symptom of deficiency of these vitamins.2
Folate, vitamins B6 and vitamin B12 are involved in the metabolic cycle that regulates homocysteine, an amino acid formed during the breakdown of protein. Elevated homocysteine has been shown to be a risk factor for impaired cognitive abilities in the elderly,3,4,5 as well as for a decline in memory,6 and the dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease.7 Elevated homocysteine has been associated with inadequate intake of vitamin B12, vitamin B6 or folate.
Antioxidants
Oxidative damage to brain cells is strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of cognitive decline.8,9 Oxidative damage occurs as a result of metabolic reactions that release unstable molecules called “free radicals,” which in turn attack the fats in cell membranes and other critical cell structures. The brain is very rich in fats that are vulnerable to oxidation.
Certain nutrients, such as vitamins E and C, are antioxidants with the ability to neutralize free radicals, thereby protecting cells and tissues against oxidative damage. For this reason, scientists have been studying a possible protective role for these vitamins in the brain and nervous system. Low levels of vitamin E have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer patients, making this tissue vulnerable to oxidation. In laboratory studies, vitamins E and C were shown to protect the cells in this fluid against oxidation.10
Other antioxidants and plant compounds such as alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, Ginkgo biloba, curcumin and fruit polyphenols are also being studied for potential benefits in brain health.
The “Good Fats”
Unsaturated fats – the “good fats” that promote heart health – also promote brain health. These include polyunsaturated fatty acids from vegetable sources (corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, peanuts) and from marine sources (fish oil; fatty fish such as tuna, salmon, herring) and monounsaturated fats from plant foods (olive oil, tree nuts).
Unsaturated fatty acids are critical components of neural cell membranes and are needed for the production and proper functioning of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers these cells use to communicate. The polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), often called “omega-3,” comprises up to 50% of total fatty acids in the gray matter and is believed to exert a major influence on neural composition and function. Higher dietary intakes of fish and/or DHA have been associated with reduced cognitive decline in a number of population studies.11
Supplements
It’s sometimes hard to get the nutrients needed to keep the brain operating at optimal levels. In those cases, it may be necessary to complement vitamin intake and diet with supplements, including:
• Citicoline – Supplementation with citicoline raises brain levels of acetylcholine and supports memory and mental performance in healthy individuals. Some studies have shown that citicoline is also able to reverse age-related changes in people with mild memory problems. In addition to its role in raising neurotransmitter levels, citicoline increases the amount of phospholipids (specialized fats) in brain cell membranes and helps protect them against oxidative damage. This protection means that vast numbers of brain cells will not be lost to the ravages of time.12,13,14
• CoQ10 – Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a substance that's found naturally in the body and helps convert food into energy. CoQ10 is found in almost every cell in the body, and is a powerful antioxidant. Some researchers believe that CoQ10 may help with heart-related conditions, because it can improve energy production in cells, prevent blood clot formation, and act as an antioxidant.15
• Ginkgo Biloba – Ginkgo leaf extracts have been shown to protect neurons from oxidative damage potentially preventing the progression of tissue degeneration in patients with dementia.16
• Magnesium – Various regions in the brain associated with learning and memory experienced significant improvements in synaptic function as a result of magnesium dietary supplementation.17

Brain Health Product
Submitted by James Krachinski on April 30, 2014 - 7:32pm
I wanted to share a new brain health product with a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee called Brain Fuel Plus. Just about everyone depends on their brain to carry them through every day of their work and family life. Though they may not realize it, many people will need to boost their nutrition if they want to keep their brains active throughout the day. There are a few different choices that people have available to them, but there is one choice that will stand above all the rest. People can use Brain Fuel Plus from Brain Abundance to provide them with the support that they need for these projects. They may be impressed when they find out just how much mental clarity they can get by taking this one supplement.
To understand how Brain Fuel Plus works, it will first be important to identify some of the issues that can affect a brain. People may feel tired or sluggish throughout the day, which will tend to create a mental fog over the way that they think. This can prevent people from having the energy to concentrate on some different types of tasks. This can also have a cumulative effect, which will prevent people from being able to think through any sort of issue that they are facing. If they want to break free from this, they will need to get a supplement that has been designed to prevent just this type of occurrence.
There are some key ingredients incorporated in to Brain Fuel Plus that will help set it apart from other substances out there. It includes all natural ingredients, including grape seed extract and ginseng. These are natural ingredients that have been noted to improve the amount of mental focus that people can exert. This will also help people to get the natural support that they need to maintain this focus over the long term. Most people are trying to avoid ingesting harmful chemicals these days, so it will be a relief for them to see that these ingredients have been included.
The supplement will also include a whole host of different vitamins, including B-12 and B-6. These have been provided to help people get the right balance that they need for their bodies. Phenylalanine has been included to help boost the natural production of key amino acids within the body. Folic acid is another key ingredient, which has been included to provide people with a vitamin that has been clinically proven to improve cognition. This supplement has been tested and proven to help people improve their thought processes, which will help them improve their focus as well. If people take this pill, they will be able to quickly feel rejuvenated to take on a few different types of tasks.
Ultimately, this pill will also provide a whole host of different types of benefits to people who decide to take it. It will actually improve energy levels and mood for anyone who decides to take it for themselves. It can also be used to improve mood and help support improved emotional state as well. Anyone who takes the pill will be impressed by the sheer amount of relief that they get from the stress they feel. Given all of these benefits, many people will want to just give this pill a chance for themselves.
