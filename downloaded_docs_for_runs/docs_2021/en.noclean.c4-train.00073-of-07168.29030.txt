Milk protein lowers blood pressure and cholesterol
by Agartha on Sat Oct 29, 2016 1:36 pm
A recent study (October 2016) has shown milk protein can help reduce the risk factors of heart disease and stroke by significantly lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. The University of Reading and University of Milan have found that the risk is reduced by 8% and that those ingesting large amounts of whey protein had healthier blood vessels.
Participants in the study drank 56g of whey protein daily, whilst the control group drank maltodrextin. The results showed a positive effect on markers of cardiovascular health:
- A reduction in blood pressure (average 3.9mmHg lower)
- A reduction in cholesterol (5% less)
- And a 12% reduction of triaclyglycerol (blood fat that increases risk of cardiovascular disease).
The participants drank a 90% whey protein shake twice a day (very popular with bodybuilders) which gave them 56g of milk protein daily.
I think this is great news for dairy lovers; previous studies have already shown that people who drink more milk are usually healthier, but now we have a study that shows milk proteins specifically reduce blood pressure.
More research is needed to further understand the positive impact of milk in our diets, especially as the sample size was small (38 people in the protein group).
The study has been published freely to the public and can be found here:

I knew that! That's why I look like Mr. Universe (in my dreams!).
I drink a lot of milk.

So, my body knew it needed more milk to balance out against my health issues, less milk(just a bowl of cereal), and things got wilder. Back to milk intake.

Yeah, guys, milk is good! If you want to ingest lots of whey protein I recommend eating ricotta cheese, it's got the highest amount of protein of all dairy products.
Of course the sample size is small, but the fact that all 38 participants had lower BP and lower cholesterol shows there really is something to it.
Tim and Len: I share your love for milk! lol

Apparently we milk lovers are all closely related via a small group of 6 people in northwest Iran 4000 years ago. All the rest of adult humans were incapable of digesting milk at the time. They lacked an important enzyme needed to digest the milk solids.
Eventually the ability to do so spread throughout Europe and further into the world. So you see; we are extra special!

I also calm down easier from ingestion of the calcium casseinate in milk

That's very interesting, Tim! I remember reading that even now only 35% of the world can tolerate milk.
We are extra special indeed! lol
Len, I also find that milk has a nice soothing effect.... especially if warm and with a tiny drop of honey.

Thank you, girl. So many people demonize milk when it has actually helped people survive when food was scarce. So, as a big fan of the white stuff, I had to share. lol

Ricotta cheese is actually the best dairy with the highest milk protein content.
I don't know how old your auntie is but it's very common to become hypertensive when you are 65, even if you are fit and healthy.

She is 71 and was hospitalized a couple of weeks ago due to this(her condition was unknown prior) but good to know this is common at her age and she is getting it under control now, but this info will certainly help too.

A small amount of nutmeg in hot milk is great for relaxing one's mind.
Not too much nutmeg but-- that has the opposite effect! I once tried a desert spoon full in hot milk and I saw things that no human should ever see!
Glad to hear that your aunt is better Solace.
