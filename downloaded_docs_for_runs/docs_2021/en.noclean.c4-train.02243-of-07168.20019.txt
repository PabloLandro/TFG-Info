A note about Natural Remedies for Migraines
In natural health and healing, we believe in holistic health and healing, as we realize that different parts of the human body are highly interlinked, often beyond Man's understanding. We also believe that the body has the ability to heal itself of any disease, even supposedly incurable diseases.
In order to do so, the body needs the support of some basic dietary and lifestyle good health habits, such as a full body detox and a proper understanding and application of nutrition. No matter how remote or unrelated a health condition may seem, these fundamental health steps will greatly magnify the effects and benefits of any of our health-promoting efforts, including the use of specific natural health remedies.
Elements in one's diet which should be avoided include alcohol, caffeine, as well as foods which contain refined sugars. Excess salt, dairy products (including milk), and aspartame are known to cause migraines in some people, while tyramine, a compound which can be found in numerous foods, is also linked to migraine incidence in some persons. In seeking natural remedies for migraines, it would be a good idea to exclude these elements from one's diet.
As migraines are often associated with food allergies, frequent sufferers of this ailment may want to work toward identifying and avoiding food items which may be giving them problems. One could work with one's health care practitioner to achieve these aims.
Dietary Supplements
Research has found that migraine sufferers have lower levels of magnesium in their blood and brains. And studies conducted along these lines have found that magnesium supplementation could indeed help to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. Dosages used in the said studies ranged from 360mg to 600mg per day.
In other studies, vitamin B2 (400mg each day) was found to reduce the intensity and frequency of migraine attacks, while 5-HTP (ranging from 200mg to 600mg each day) lowered the frequency and intensity of attacks as well.
As specific nutrients and supplements taken in large doses could cause imbalances in the body, it is usually recommended that you obtain your needed nutrition from whole foods.
One whole food supplement which may prove helpful in your quest for natural remedies for migraines is fish oil. Research suggests that 1g of fish for every 10 pounds of body weight may help in alleviating migraine symptoms.
Herbs and Herbal Remedies
In terms of herbs which may be useful in dealing with migraines, the best known is perhaps feverfew. Besides traditional wisdom, separate double-blind studies have also found the herb to be effective in lowering the frequency, duration as well as intensity of migraine attacks.
Other potentially helpful herbal remedies for migraine attacks include butterbur, cayenne, ginger and ginkgo biloba.
Alternative Treatments
Acupuncture, which forms part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is a type of alternative therapy which has been found to be useful in alleviating migraine headaches. This has been validated in numerous studies, including placebo-controlled trials. Research also suggests the benefits are long-lasting.
Another type of treatment which could be useful as alternative remedies for migraine relief is manipulation. As certain headaches are linked to neck and spinal cord issues, manipulation would be able to help at least some migraine sufferers. Indeed, separate controlled studies found this therapy to be effective in dealing with migraines, helping to reduce intensity, frequency as well as duration.
Conclusion
Migraine headaches are potentially debilitating episodes. Thankfully for sufferers, there are numerous remedies for migraine relief under different realms of alternative medicine which can help initiate healing.
