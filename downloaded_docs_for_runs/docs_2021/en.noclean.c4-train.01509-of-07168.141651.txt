Buy derma Roller / dermaroller for sale in Malaysia
Do you want to solve your hair lost / pimples scars / wrinkles / Stretch mark problem? You can solves them all by using derma roller!!
How it works?
All skin treatment are using the same concept > If you skin has permanent scars, you need to damage or destroy your skin by using laser or chemical peel or dermamembran or derma roller. Then regrow the new layer of prettier and healthier skin.
The same happen if you use derma roller, there are many needles on the roller, you roll your face by using derma roller, all the needles puke into your face to damage your skin. Furthermore, the needle will puke into your skin to stimulate the collagen under your skin, the collagen responsible to regrow and repair your skin effectively and beautifully. Please eat more vitamin E or drink more collagen or apply collagen masks on your face to regrow the new perfect beautiful skin. Water is the key for healing the injury, so please make sure your face is moisturized after rolling. You can apply moisturizer cream or hydrating facial masks to give water to your face after rolling.
Comparison between Laser Treatment and Derma Roller Treatment
Normal laser treatment price is rm500 per session, rm3000 for 6 sessions. Normal laser can't fix the deep scars. You need Advance Laser Resurface Tech which will be more expensive.
Derma roller treatment is rm100 for 30 sessions. Actually you can use the roller for more than 30 times if the head of needles are still sharp. You can use derma roller anytime and anywhere and you can do it by yourself.
More info about Derma Roller at : http://dermaroller-malaysia.com.
Icepick acne scars : These are small, narrow pits that can sometimes be quite deep, as if a Smurf took a tiny icepick to your complexion. They are the most common type of acne holes.
Boxcar acne scars : These scars often look like large pores or small, walled boxes.
You can use dermaroller to remove the boxcar scars and icepick scar that shown at above.
Before and after using Derma Roller pictures :
Video below shows the before and after photos after 20th treatments of a user :
How to use Derma Roller?
The needles of roller are already been sterilized, but you still need to wash the needles for disinfection. Everytime before using the dermaroller, wash it with soap, then sink it in the salt water or sink it in 75% alcohol, just to make sure the dermaroller is 100% clean.
To use derma roller, you can refer to the video below :
She don't have scars on her face, she roll her face just because want to improve her skin textures :
Video below shows his 24th treatment, he his deep scars, so he need to roll his face until a little bit bleeding :
You can view all his video from his treatment 1 to the last from his you-tube page : http://www.youtube.com/user/raysdermaroller.
Video below shows doctor using numbing cream during dermarolling on his patients, they bleed a lot :
Bleeding = effective. You need to roll until bleeding to maximize the effectiveness. If you cannot bear the pain, you can apply numbling cream. If u can bear the pain, you don't need numbling cream. If you roll, you will feel very pain, when u feel pain, u won't put pressure. If you don't put pressure, it won't cause bleeding and thus it is not effective. Bleeding = effective. If you want bleeding without so much pain, you can do stamp-chopping instead of rolling. Stmp-chopping = press 2 seconds then release, press 2 seconds then release, press 2 seconds then release (no rolling at all), u won't feel pain if without rolling, so u can put lot of pressure, so it will cause bleeding, so it will be more effective. Below are some of my personal derma-rolling progress pictures, I roll less and stamp-chopping a lot to cause bleeding :
If u want faster remove the scars, then put max pressure when rolling, it will be bleeding a lot and painful if without numbing cream / lidocaine / anesthetic. (5 to 10 sessions can complete remove the scars already).
If you don't dare to put pressure when rolling, or if you don't dare to bleed, it will takes longer time to remove the scars. (40 - 70 sessions only can complete remove the scars).
Before you use dermaroller, please do the 3 steps :
1) Check the needles heads of the dermaroller, if there is a needle bended / twisted / broken, please don't use the dermaroller anymore because it will create more new scars, you have to throw it to dustbin and go buy a new dermaroller. If you feel 1 or 2 needles pulling your skin when you are dermarolling your skin, you MUST stop using it, because there is 1 or 2 bent needles. You will find out the bent needles if you check all the needles carefully. Look at the picture below for example of a bent needle :
2) Wash the dermaroller with soap + water (me and most of my customers also do it, but some other perfectionise people want perfect clean, they use salt water and 75% alcohol to clean it).
3) Wash your face with facial cleanser before you start dermarolling your face.
Step to use dermaroller (if you don't want to bleed) :
1) Apply cream on your skin. Click here for the info of cream.
2) Use dermaroller to roll on your skin vertically for 10 times, horizontally for 10 times to form + shape. Then roll another 20 times with different directions to form x shape, like the above picture.
3) Apply cream on the skin again.
Step to use dermaroller (if you want to roll harder with long needles roller until bleed a lot) :
1) Apply lidocain 10% spray for 30 seconds to numb your skin to prevent the pain later. Click here for the info of lidocain 10% spray.
2) Use dermaroller to roll on your skin for 10 times per direction to form + shape and x shape, like the above picture.
3) Wash away the lidocain from your face with water.
4) Apply cream on your skin. Click here for the info of cream.
Can I dermarolling on pimples / acnes areas?
Some people even a doctors say dermarolling on pimples area can cure and remove all pimples, but I suggest you don't dermarolling on pimples / acne areas. If you still have acnes / pimples breakout on your skin, I suggest you use Caroline Skin Care to cure pimples and prevent pimple breakout.
Can I use dermaroller without apply any cream?
Yes, you can use dermaroller without apply cream. Actually the purpose of applying cream is just to faster the scars removal progress.
I suggest don't dermarolling on pimples / acne areas. If you still have acnes / pimples breakout on your skin, I suggest you use Caroline products to cure pimples and prevent pimple breakout. You just need to use Caroline cleanser foam (rm111), Caroline skin astringent (rm96), Caroline refining cream (rm111). Total is RM318 for 3 month usages. So RM106 / month only. If they are too expensive for u, you can just buy the Refining cream. The refining cream is a MUST. You can see obvious result within a week, pimples are fate away and your skin become smooth like babe within a week. You can buy Caroline products from http://dermaroller-malaysia.com/caroline-acne.php.
forum about how to use derma roller : http://www.realself.com/question/what-good-aftercare-program-laser-treatment and http://www.essentialdayspa.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=34315&postdays=0&postorder=asc&&start=0
Derma Roller is really effective?
Some people did laser treatment for 5 sessions but still cannot see the result, they blame laser treatment is useless. Some people did derma rolling treatment for 5 sessions but still cannot see the result, they blame derma roller is useless too. It is not easy to remove the scars. You need to derma rolling your skin for at least 30 sessions. You can roll 4 sessions per month, so you need more than 7 month to remove the scars. So please be patient and consistent. You can't afford to do laser treatment for 30 sessions because it will cost rm600 x 30 sessions = rm18000. You can save a lot of cost if you do derma rolling treatment, it cost you just rm100 per roller, and you can use the roller for 30 sessions. In case your roller needles are no longer sharp or spoiled, you can just pay another rm100 to buy a new roller.
You can enhance the effectiveness of using dermaroller by using several products below :
1) Collagen masks (Click here to see the info of collagen masks). As collagen is the key to heal and regrow new prettier and smoother skin, we can use collagen masks to give more collagen to the skin.
2) Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate cream. This cream has vitamin A and vitamin E to help recovery the injured skin. Click here for more info.
3) Revitol Scar Removal Cream. It can help erase those unwanted scars for good with a unique formula that is completely natural and totally safe. Click here for more info.
4) Scar Serum. I saw a company from United Kingdom sell their dermaroller package with this Scar Serum, info at Click here.
5) Hydrating masks or Moisturizer Serum to provide water to your skin after rolling, because water is the key to heal the injury.
6) Minoxidil or Rogaine. It is for hair fall and baldness problem. Apply it on your head scalp where has baldness or hair fall problem. You can eat Biotin for faster the hair grow process.
7) Numbing Cream. The name of numbing cream used for dermarolling is Lidocaine. Click here for more info. You can buy Lidocaine from any pharmacy or click here. Dermarolling become more effective if you can roll hardly until your skin get bleeding, unfortunately most of people can't bear the pain. Numbing Cream can reduce the pain during dermarolling process. Look how effective if roll hard until bleeding from picture below :
I have listed out 7 of products above that can enhance the effectiveness of using dermaroller. You don't need to use all the 7 products, you can simply pick any 1 product to try. I'm not sure which product is the best for your skin. You have to try them out by yourself. If you want to buy the product, you can go to http://ebay.com.my or http://lelong.com.my to search for the product.

Just to confirm the quotation of price.
Dainty All In One Collagen Facial Mask x30 + 1mm Roller + postage to West Malaysia
So total payable is RM45 + RM95 + RM10 = RM150?
Posted on 4:48 PM, March 18, 2013
Zac Ang Said,
masks are heavy, postage is rm15. total is 155. thanks.

imHuman Said,
One more before I proceed with payment.
Which is better?
Dermajuv Acne Scar Fading Cream or Revitol Scar Removal Cream?
Since both seems to have the same effect.
Posted on 5:09 PM, March 18, 2013
Zac Ang Said,
dermagist scars fading cream is better.
Posted on 5:16 PM, March 18, 2013
imHuman Said,
Dermagist a tad more expensive.
Guess I'll try with the Revitol Scar Removal Cream first
So Revitol Scar Removal Cream + the products previously = RM150 + RM155 = Final total RM305?
Posted on 5:24 PM, March 18, 2013
Zac Ang Said,
yes rm305. Thanks.
