L-Theanine (gamma-ethylamino-L-glutamic acid) is a non protein forming amino acid found in trace amounts in green tea. It converts in the brain into GABA, the neurotransmitter involved in inhibiting over active mental activities, such as stress, anxiety, worrying, and nervousness. Unlike sedating herbs theanine protects & enhances cognition, without causing sleepy or drowsiness. Also unlike other GABA compounds like Phenibut there is no withdrawal effect.

After having rather unimpressive results with SSRIs for anxiety reduction, I was skeptical of the effectiveness a non-prescription drug would have. However, after two weeks, L-Theanine gets my stamp of approval. Noticeable increases in motivation and mood, anxiety seems to have reduced as well. Nothing euphoric or mind blowing, but it gets the job done, and is a nice alternative to costly prescription medication.

Pretty good stuff. I take 1 gram before I go to sleep and I find that I sleep very relaxed, i have some vivid dreams alot of times, and I wake up feeling good. Not bad for the price.
