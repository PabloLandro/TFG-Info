Are you researching nootropics for sleep?
A good night’s sleep is one of the most sought after commodities people are looking for these days. We have all experienced the feeling of not being able to fall asleep on some occasion, but what if this is happening to you on a regular basis?
Not only can sleep deprivation cause you to be less energetic and productive the following day, over time this can actually negatively affect your brain function and cognitive health.
Sleep is incredibly important for maintaining proper health of your body, neurons and especially your memory systems. If you are like most people who have difficulty getting the recommended amount of sleep on their busy schedules, ensuring that you experience high-quality restful sleep is also important to make the most of the time you have.
There are a number of nootropics that can help you fall asleep and make you feel more rested when you awake the next day.

Are Nootropics Legal?
Nootropics are a class of supplements that are used to improve cognitive abilities like better learning, memory, attention span and reasoning.
But, there are also specific Nootropic supplements that can dramatically improve your sleep. This includes helping you to fall asleep more quickly, stay asleep, and even induce more restful sleep.
Many different factors can interfere with your sleep patterns and it is important to figure out which one is affecting you in order to address your particular situation.
Some people have high stress levels and find it difficult to shut their mind off at the end of the day. Others are able to fall asleep but do not spend enough time in a deep sleep state like REM.
Below are some of the most common problems related to poor sleep as well as nootropic supplements that can help in each case.
Falling Asleep Quickly:
Many people simply find that they cannot fall asleep quickly at night. If you are one of those who seems to spend half the night tossing and turning you might be suffering from cognitive over-excitement.
In this case, using a nootropic that boost inhibitory neurotransmitters can turn off some of the excessive stimulation. Two of the best Nootropics to help you mentally relax are Phenibut and Picamilon.
Phenibut is one of the strongest Nootropics to take for boosting relaxation and tranquility. The best way to use this would be taking a small amount right before bed.
It works by crossing the blood-brain barrier and then modulating a number of brain chemicals that cause the mind to be less active. These include GABA and Dopamine. Both of these are powerful neurotransmitters that have been shown to reduce levels of stress and anxiety.
Phenibut is also interesting in the fact that it is surprisingly effective at inducing sleep in the night. This can be very helpful for restoring normal circadian rhythms.
Picamilon is another excellent Nootropic supplement that helps to induce relaxation, leading to the ability to fall asleep faster. Picamilon is made from Niacin and GABA which is actually the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter within the human body. This simply means that it prevents your neurons from being overly excited. You can think of your neurons as always either switch off or switched on and firing.
One of the main problems with people who have difficulty relaxing and falling asleep quickly is that their neurons are continuously firing in a state of excitation.
GABA is capable of turning them off, leading to an overall feeling of calm, well-being, and relaxation. (This is exactly how alcohol works by activating certain GABA receptors). Taking Picamilon will boost your GABA levels and help you get to sleep.
Staying Asleep:
Another major sleep problem is that once it is achieved, it can be difficult for individuals to remain asleep. Frequently waking up in the night can be highly problematic because it disrupts the normal cycle and does not allow the brain or the body to get the full amount of rest it needs.
Once again, Phenibut is capable of helping in this regard. This is due to the fact that it is actually a GABA agonist. The relaxing effect is not short-lived, so taking this supplement right before bed also has the effect of improving one’s ability to stay asleep and wake less during the night.
Aniracetam is another Nootropic which can be very helpful in dealing with sleep issues. This supplement is an analog of Piracetam that works by speeding up the utilization of both Dopamine and Serotonin. These are neurochemicals used to help regulate mood, movement, sleep, and relaxation levels.
Aniracetam is known for anti-anxiety effects and can be used to combat problems with stress and depression. Many Aniracetam reviews say that this supplement increases their ability to sleep throughout the night. Some people also experience more dream activity when taking Aniracetam, including the possibility of lucid dreams.
More Restful Sleep:
Even if you manage to stay asleep all the way through the night, some people wake up feeling as if they just went to sleep minutes ago. You may wake up feeling like you are in a fog and unable to focus clearly.
This can sometimes happen when you are awoken during the middle of one of your REM cycles which is why an alarm clock is never ideal to use. However, this is also often connected with a lack of deep sleep during the night.
There are a few nootropics which can promote deeper sleep and help you achieve more time in an REM state.
L-Theanine is one of the active ingredients found in green tea leaves. It has been shown to smooth out alpha brain waves which are thought to be responsible for inducing a deep level of relaxation. This ultimately results in the mind being calmed and the body relaxed.
Another interesting fact about this amino acid is that it neutralizes the stimulant effects of caffeine without changing the mind energizing and fat burning benefits. Taking this in the evening before bed will help most people to sleep more restfully and wake up refreshed.
Huperzine A has also been shown to increase the levels of REM (deep or dream-state sleep) by as much as 30 percent. This should also be taken about 30 minutes or so before bed. Since there have been some research that shows tolerance can built for this supplement the best idea to use this no more than a few times a week.

Melatonin and L-theanine are two popular dietary supplements taken to relieve sleeplessness and to promote relaxation.
They both have a calming effect on the mind, but work by different mechanisms of action. Melatonin is the body’s main sleep regulating hormone, produced endogenously from the neurotransmitter serotonin.
Melatonin supplements are primarily used to alleviate interrupted sleep patterns, jet lag and insomnia. However, there is growing research suggesting that it has mood-related benefits as well.
L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly used to alleviate stress and anxiety. It is frequently taken in combination with caffeine in a nootropic stack to support cognitive abilities, focus and attentional control.
L-Theanine works by increasing levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It has been shown to influence brain EEG patterns to produce more alpha waves, which are indicative of lower stress levels and improved attention and alertness.
There are some instances in which combining these products may have additive benefits. Depending on your supplementation goals, Melatonin or L-Theanine can be taken separately or as a combined supplement in capsule or tablet forms.

Produced by a small, pine-cone shaped organ located in the middle of the brain known as the pineal gland, melatonin is an indole hormone regulating wakefulness and sleep in humans and other animals.
Specifically, melatonin helps keep circadian rhythms synchronized to ensure sleep-waking timing in humans remains in harmony with daylight and nighttime.
Secretions of this neurohormone are low during the daytime and increase at night based on detection of light in the ambient environment. Increasing levels of this hormone through supplementation has been shown to improve sleep latency, quality and duration in multiple research studies.
In addition to exerting sleep-awake effects by activating melatonin receptors in the brain, melatonin may improve overall health by serving as an antioxidant and protecting nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. [1, 2]
Oral melatonin is used to relieve symptoms of insomnia, jet lag, shift-work disorder and other sleep-wake problems preventing people from sleeping normally.
This hormone also affects a number of other bodily functions and is being researched for high blood pressure, anxiety, anti-cancer effects, mood disorder, cognitive function, digestive health and more.
Blind people suffering circadian rhythm disorders due to their inability to perceive the difference between night and day take melatonin to help restore normal levels of melatonin in the brain.
Supplements containing this ingredient may also be useful in re-establishing natural circadian rhythms in people diagnosed with:
Dementia/Alzheimer’s
Chronic fatigue syndrome
Insomnia caused by taking beta-blockers
Seasonal affective disorder
Depression
Fibromyalgia
Sleep problems attributed to menopause
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Melatonin as a topical agent is used to protect skin against sunburn and damage caused by ultraviolet light. [3]

L-Theanine vs. Suntheanine
What is Suntheanine?
Extracted from green tea leaves belonging to the Theaceaefamily of trees and shrubs, L-theanine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid. This means that although it has the chemical structure of an amino acid (a building block of proteins), it is not used in the body to make proteins.
Research shows that supplementing with L-Theanine (Gamma-ethylamino-L-glutamic acid) promotes subjective feelings of tranquility and reduces mental and physical stress.
As a dietary supplement, it has been used for anxiety, to promote feelings of relaxation, support cognitive function and for mood enhancement.
L-Theanine has been described as exerting calming effects without acting as a sedative. Users report taking it to provide relief from anxious thoughts and inability to quiet the mind before sleep.
One study evaluated the effectiveness of L-theanine on people with schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia. Results of the study found that augmenting antipsychotic therapy with L-theanine significantly reduces anxiety and agitation commonly affecting patients diagnosed with schizophrenic disorders. [6]
Clinically, L-Theanine has also been studied for hypertension and some symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. It may also enhance the effects of chemotherapy medications. [4] However, it has not been approved by the FDA as a drug for the treatment of any medical conditions.
Combining caffeine and theanine boosts mood, expedites reaction times and has beneficial effects on numeric working memory. Consequently, L-theanine is a popular nootropic supplement for students studying for exams and older adults experiencing thinking and memory problems. [5]
L-theanine also exhibits neuroprotective properties and has been shown in animal research to prevent certain forms of neuronal damage. It has also been shown to increase the synthesis of nerve growth factor, which is involved in neuroplasticity.
L-Theanine and Melatonin for Sleep
Taking L-theanine and melatonin together may help support sleep quality and ability to fall asleep at night. They may work in conjunction to relax the mind and body and regulate sleep cycles simultaneously.
While L-theanine reduces feelings of physical and mental stress, melatonin works to help induce sleep by increasing levels of this natural sleep-regulating hormone in the brain.
There are no research studies available to evaluate clinical efficacy. However, based on anecdotal user reviews, there are reports of this combination being more effective than using either supplement individually.
Melatonin is well-established as being effective for addressing sleep problems. The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database reports that it can improve the time it takes to fall asleep and improve symptoms of insomnia in certain circumstances.
They report “Taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 4 weeks seems to increase the percentage of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in adults with reduced REM sleep. Also, taking melatonin 6 mg daily for 10 days seems to reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and the number of transitions from sleep to being awake in elderly individuals with sleep-wake cycle disturbance and dementia.”
It also appears to promote a modest improvement in subjective feelings of sleep quality. However, it does not appear to significantly improve sleep efficiency, which is a measure of the total time spent sleeping at night compared to the total amount of time spent in bed.
Interestingly, in one study on the effects of l-theanine for sleep disorders in children with ADHD, this supplement was shown to improve sleep efficiency.
One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on a proprietary brand of L-Theanine called Suntheanine® looked at the effects of this supplement on objective measures of sleep quality.
The study involved 98 male children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants consumed 400 mg of l-theanine or a placebo daily at breakfast and after school for six weeks.
Over the treatment period, boys who were taking Suntheanine® experienced significantly higher sleep percentage and sleep efficiency scores compared to those on the placebo. Though sleep latency (time it took to fall asleep) was unchanged, sleep quality was higher with no significant adverse events reported.
There are several dietary supplements available today that contain L-theanine mixed with melatonin. The reviews on these supplements are generally positive and suggest that some people may experience added benefits compared to taking melatonin on its own.
L-Theanine and Melatonin Dosage
What is the recommended dosage for stacking L-theanine with melatonin for sleep? Combination supplements come in capsule form containing 200 mg of L-theanine and three mg of melatonin.
It may not necessary to take these supplements at the same time in order to experience positive effects on sleep cycles. Melatonin is typically taken before bedtime to promote restful sleep.
L-Theanine is typically used during the daytime. In one research study, split dosages of 400 mg per day administered at breakfast and in the afternoon were also shown to improve sleep quality. Therefore, you may not need to take this supplement at bedtime to observed benefits.
Crossing the blood-brain barrier in about 30 minutes, L-theanine remains in the bloodstream for around five hours following administration. Studies report that giving subjects dosages of L-theanine between 200 and 250 mg provide adequate anxiolytic effects. [8]
However, individual differences regarding metabolism, current health and body chemistry may require some users take more or less of L-theanine to achieve desired effects. Dosages as high as 1200 mg of L-theanine have been taken without harmful side effects. [9]
A typical adult dosage of melatonin for sleep is between two-tenths and five milligrams one hour before going to bed. Doctors recommend starting with a small dose and slowly increasing the dose if needed.
Children can take melatonin for sleep but in smaller doses. Taking too much melatonin at one time can cause nausea, headache, mild anxiety, dizziness and also interfere with sleep. [11]
Nature Made Melatonin Plus L-Theanine 200mg
Nature Made Melatonin Plus L-Theanine 200mg is a popular brand of combination sleep supplement containing both of these ingredients.
Containing no preservatives or artificial flavors, Nature Made Melatonin Plus L-Theanine 200 mg comes in easy-to-swallow soft gels.
Users should take one soft gel about one hour before bedtime. The only difference between Nature Made Melatonin plus L-theanine and Nature Made Sleep is the cost of these supplements.
User reviews of this product are highly positive with 70% of reviewers providing a 5-star review. User testimonials say that it helps to alleviate excessive mental chatter at night, making it easier to relax, fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.
Before taking L-theanine and melatonin together, ask your doctor if any of the medications you are taking will interact negatively with this supplement.
L-Theanine and Melatonin Side Effects
Both L-theanine and melatonin are well-tolerated as dietary supplements. When combined, they may promote a synergistic effect causing greater sleepiness than if taken separately.
In addition to daytime drowsiness and dizziness, melatonin may cause:
Headaches
Nausea
Hypotension
Temporary disorientation/confusion
Mild shakiness
Short-lasting moodiness (depression, anxiety)
Certain medications may interact adversely with melatonin. These include anti-platelets, anticoagulants, anticonvulsant and diabetic medications.
Headaches, stomach discomfort and dizziness are the most commonly reported side effects of L-theanine. Other less common side effects include:
Lowering blood pressure: People taking drugs for hypotension should be aware of this potential side effect and discuss it with their doctor
Reduced energy: With its ability to induce relaxation, L-theanine may also reduce overall physical and mental energy as well
Altering serotonin levels: Both an increase and decrease in serotonin has been reported in people taking L-theanine. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in mood, appetite, sleep and libido
Vomiting: A rare side effect of L-theanine use, vomiting after taking a normal dose may mean the supplement brand is of low quality or it may have interacted adversely in your stomach with a certain substance
Weight loss: A few studies with rodents found that L-theanine may have an antiobesogenic effect that could cause a small but measurable weight loss in certain individuals [13]
Common side effects reported by users of L-theanine/melatonin supplements include dizziness, mild headache/head pain and feeling slightly hungover. Less common side effects involve low blood pressure, irritability, stomach pain and anxiety. [7]
While subacute and acute toxicity tests have not shown L-theanine is actually toxic in high amounts, studies are needed to determine if long-term, high-dosage use of L-theanine may cause organ disease, organ failure or other harmful side effects. [10]
This amino acid may also interfere with the ability of immunosuppressant drugs to suppress the immune system and reduce symptoms of autoimmune diseases. Always check with your doctor before taking L-theanine and melatonin together if you take any kind of over-the-counter or prescription medication daily. [12]
L-Theanine, Caffeine and Melatonin
As a dietary supplement, L-Theanine is commonly stacked with caffeine. Many users are interested in understanding the effects of combining melatonin with L-Theanine and Caffeine supplements.
L-Theanine is derived naturally from green tea leaves, where it exists in combination with caffeine. Use of these supplements together has been shown to enhance cognitive skills such as reaction time and memory.
This nootropic stack may support mental accuracy and boost the ability to evaluate and process visual information. Studies also show that people susceptible to anxiety benefit from the calming effects of L-theanine and caffeine without experiencing sedation or impaired mental faculties. [14]
Although it would seem counterintuitive, taking melatonin and caffeine together can sometimes help users experience a deeper, almost hypnotic-like sleep that relieves fatigue for a short period of time. This is because caffeine increases the bioavailability of melatonin.
However, mixing caffeine with melatonin and l-theanine does not appear to cause the same effects in all users. Response to this stack largely depends on sensitivity to caffeine.
If you are regularly able to consume caffeinated products late in the evening without experiencing insomnia, this stack could work for you. If drinking caffeine makes it difficult for you to fall asleep, do not consume it before bedtime.
Caffeine may also cause unwanted side effects like:
Dizziness
Burning, prickling sensations on the skin
Palpitations
Restlessness
Weakness [15]
Foods containing small amounts of caffeine like chocolate or soda will not interfere with melatonin inducing sleepiness, unless large amounts are consumed.
In general, if you are interested in using L-Theanine supplements to promote sleep, you should look for versions of this supplement are caffeine-free. You can either buy a pre-made product like Nature Made Sleep or purchase bulk L-theanine and melatonin supplements individually to combine on your own.

SIDE EFFECTS
L-Theanine and GABA are both compounds associated with reduced stress and increased relaxation. Due to these effects, they are sometimes used as supplements for those who want to manage anxiety and stress.
L-Theanine is an amino acid that is found in green tea. This amino acid has structural properties that are similar to Glutamate, an amino acid found in the body that is the precursor to GABA.
L-Theanine has effects on cognition and helps modulate brain waves. It may work by increasing GABA activity in the brain. It can be acquired by drinking green tea or by taking it as a supplement.
GABA, also known as gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a neurotransmitter made by the brain. It helps produce a calming effect on the central nervous system, according to the University of Michigan Health System. [1]
GABA is not found in fresh foods, but it can be acquired by eating yogurt, sauerkraut and other fermented foods. It is also available as a supplement.

L-Theanine vs. Suntheanine
What is Suntheanine?
L-Theanine helps produce feelings of relaxation and calm by modulating alpha brain waves, according to a 2008 study published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition. [2]
It also affects GABA receptors in the brain. The effects of L-Theanine on GABA include upregulation, which means that this amino acid helps increase activity at GABA receptors.
GABA activity in the brain leads to reduced anxiety and increased relaxation by blocking signals in the central nervous system.
Using L-Theanine for anxiety might be effective, although more research is needed, and L-Theanine has not been approved by the FDA as a drug to prevent or treat any conditions. These supplements have shown some effectiveness when used by people who have lower levels of stress rather than those who struggle with a diagnosed anxiety disorder.
L-theanine supplements are also used for managing high blood pressure or lowering the risk of dementia. Their effectiveness for these uses requires more research.
Benefits of GABA Supplements
GABA supplements are commonly used for anxiety, tension, stress, elevating mood, and managing blood pressure.
These supplements have also been used for attention deficit-hyperactive disorder (ADHD), pain relief, and to promote fat burning for weight loss.
GABA supplements might be ineffective at reducing anxious thoughts and stress levels. The GABA in supplements enters the blood, but it usually cannot enter the brain. This makes GABA supplements an unreliable form of anxiety reduction, since they have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier.
In fact, the main difference between L-Theanine and GABA supplements is that Theanine has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, while GABA from supplements typically does not.
However, there are many people who say GABA supplements do work for them, and while it may be due to placebo effect, there are also alternative theories on why supplemental GABA may work for some people.
Some people may have personal differences in blood-brain barrier permeability which allows GABA into their brains. Alternatively, some research suggests that GABA receptors located in the gut may play a role in mood regulation. Both of these theories could reconcile the current scientific understanding of GABA and the many positive reviews. These would both be good areas for future studies.
The debate about mental effects aside, the Natural Medicines database has rated GABA supplements as Possibly Effective for lowering high blood pressure and decreasing motion sickness, although more research is still needed to fully understand these effects.
GABA is available as a dietary supplement only, and the FDA has not approved GABA as a drug to prevent or treat any conditions.
How to Take L-Theanine
L-Theanine is available in supplement form by itself or combined with GABA and other compounds that promote calmness and reduce stress.
For example, GABA L-Theanine Stress B lozenges are available online and at health and wellness stores. A large number of consumers who have used them report that they are effective at reducing stress and increasing calmness.
Dosages for L-Theanine supplements can vary from person to person depending on age, medical conditions and other factors. In general, dosages of 200 mg are considered safe for most people to take, according to the University of California, Santa Cruz. [3]
It is always recommended that you speak with your doctor before beginning any new supplements.
How to Take GABA
GABA supplements are available in tablet form, capsule form and other forms for oral use. The dosages for these products can vary widely based on age, health, and several other factors.
It is important to see a doctor before taking these supplements in order to determine a safe dosage.
GABA can usually be taken in amounts of 250 to 500 mg. Doses that are more than 750 mg are considered unsafe, since these higher amounts of GABA may lead to more anxiety or cause insomnia.
In general, doctors typically recommend 200 mg of GABA per day in four divided doses, according to the University of Michigan Health System. [4]
Side Effects of L-Theanine and GABA
In some individuals, L-Theanine supplements might have a negative effect on mental status or lead to lower blood pressure, although these effects are rare. Otherwise, these supplements are considered safe to use for a short period of time.
Those who take drugs for blood pressure should consult their doctor before using L-Theanine supplements. These supplements can interact with blood pressure medications. L-Theanine supplements can also interfere with the effects of caffeine and other stimulants.
GABA supplements are generally safe to take in smaller amounts and for a short period of time. Using these supplements for an extended period of time, such as 12 weeks or more, is not recommended due to the lack of research on long-term effects.
GABA supplements can cause tingling when taken in smaller doses. Doses of 10 grams or higher can cause more serious side effects, such as wheezing or a rapid heart rate. Large amounts of GABA taken at a time can also cause anxiety to increase.
Those who take medications for blood pressure should see their doctor before using GABA supplements. These supplements can have interactions with blood pressure medications.
L-Theanine and GABA supplements can be used together safely by most individuals. It is important to remember that GABA should only be used for a period of up to 12 weeks and L-Theanine should also be used for a short period of time.

Melatonin supplements mimic the effects of the natural melatonin hormone produced by the brain’s pineal gland. This hormone is in charge of controlling your body’s cycle of falling asleep and waking up according to the day and night.
The main use for melatonin pills is to facilitate sleep, especially when the person has some type of sleep disorder or disruption. But this supplement is also used for a number of additional health benefits, and it is increasingly being linked to weight loss.
Research shows a clear link between sleep deprivation and weight gain. Many health professionals recommend getting at least 8 hours of sleep at night if you want to lose weight. Melatonin may promote weight loss results when used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise.

Melatonin is partly responsible for setting the body’s circadian rhythm. This refers to the regulation of the physiological processes that align with the sleep-wake cycle.
The process starts with the eye sending information to the brain about the level of light in the person’s environment. The suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain then communicates with other parts of the brain, encouraging hormone release and other actions that control alertness and arousal.
When melatonin levels are high during the dark hours of the night, it sends a signal throughout the body that it is time for sleep processes to take over.
In addition to readying the body for sleep, this hormone seems to play a role in sleep quality or depth, as well as increasing REM dream states.
Many important bodily functions occur at night while we are sleeping, helping to maintain health, reset neurotransmitter levels and detoxifying the body.
If these functions are disrupted, the body can be put into an increased state of stress, which may have wide-ranging negative effects, from increased water retention, weight gain and muscle protein breakdown.
Conversely, getting a good night’s sleep can support weight loss goals and prevent excess levels of hormones like cortisol, which can interfere with fat loss.
What role does melatonin play in weight loss? If you take a melatonin supplement, can it help you lose weight or improve results from following a healthy diet and exercise program?
Studies on Melatonin for Weight Loss
Some studies support the idea of using Melatonin sleep aids for weight loss. However, these studies do not cover the entire population so more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
One clinical study found that Melatonin supplements lead to reduced body weight in postmenopausal women. The researchers were not confident about the actions of Melatonin that lead to the results. [1]
An animal study discovered that Melatonin cut down on obesity in diabetic fatty rats without changes in diet and exercise. The study found evidence of brown fat in white adipose tissue, which is a pattern connected with reduced obesity. [2]
Further, a clinical study found a slight reduction of the waist circumference in people with metabolic syndrome who took Melatonin. This health condition is associated with too much fat in the belly area in addition to high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. [3]
In addition to Melatonin’s direct effects on fat and weight, it might also work indirectly by helping people get more sleep. An increase in sleep can help control weight, as too little or two much sleep is connected to weight gain.
However, it is important to note the limitations of these results. There is no evidence that using melatonin on its own – without adopting a healthy diet or lifestyle changes – will result in sustained weight loss.
Melatonin for Weight Loss Reviews
There are very few reviews of melatonin for weight loss shared by users online. The reviews posted on the internet overwhelmingly talk about the most common use of Melatonin, which is for sleep.
Customer reviews of Melatonin on Amazon.com are mostly positive, although a portion of the reviews include negative comments.
Reviews mentioned that the Melatonin supplement helped customers fall asleep and stay asleep. Some mentioned that these supplements do not give the daytime drowsiness various sleep pills can cause.
The negative comments tended to say the pills were not effective for the users.
Melatonin for Weight Loss Dosage
There is no well-established dosage of melatonin for fat loss and the Natural Medicines Database has not rated its efficacy as a weight loss aid.
The dosage of Melatonin as a sleep aid ranged from between 2 – 12mg at bedtime, taken for as long as a month. According to one study by MIT, this supplement is more effective when taken at a smaller dose of 0.3mg. [4]
When taking this supplement for metabolic syndrome, which would be similar to its use for weight loss, the typical dosage is 5mg a night for up to two months.
Safety of Melatonin for Diet
When using Melatonin for weight loss or fat reduction, this supplement is considered to be well-tolerated with a low incidence of side effects.
Some users experience minor side effects, such as headaches and drowsiness when awake. Some people have also reported more serious side effects such as anxiety, mild tremors and cramps in the abdominal area.
Melatonin is not recommended for pregnant and lactating women, or for long-term use in children. In addition, it might interact with a variety of drugs, supplements and herbs. Consumers should check with a doctor or pharmacist before combining it with another substance.
Dietary supplements like melatonin should not be considered a first-line intervention for losing weight. Before taking supplements for weight loss, it is important to consider lifestyle changes that include a healthy diet and exercise. A better lifestyle encourages long-term weight management and improved overall health.

FLOUROPHENIBUT
Phenibut HCL is a nootropic that people use to reduce anxiety, improve sleep patterns, and support cognitive performance.
Phenibut is sometimes sold under the brand name Noofen, Fenibut, Citrocard or Phenybut. It’s chemical name is Beta-phenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid, and it is a derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA.
Phenibut is a common component of nootropic stacks designed to reduce stress and enhance the mood. It is sometimes used as an anxiolytic by individuals who suffer from social anxiety or even as an anti-depressant.
There are several different beneficial mechanisms of action for Phenibut if it is used properly and at low doses. At higher doses, there is an increased risk of serous side effects.
If it is overused, tolerance and dependence have been reported and withdrawal symptoms can occur when you stop taking it. In this guide, we will take a closer look at Phenibut effects and side effects and how to use it properly.

SNS Phenibut XT Review
Phenibut is a modified version of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is one of the inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain.
It exhibits a relaxing effect and is also describe as producing a euphoriant, dis-inhibiting and calming state of mind.
GABA is naturally released in the brain to promote feelings of calm and relaxation. Supplementing with GABA itself is not effective because this compound cannot penetrate what is known as the “blood-brain barrier.”
The blood-brain barrier is a protective filtration membrane that surrounds the brain and separates it from the bloodstream.
Phenibut is chemically very similar to GABA, however it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier because of the addition of a phenyl group molecule to GABA’s chemical structure. It is hypothesized that using a supplement like Phenibut hydrochloride can replicate some of GABA’s effects within the brain.
This makes it a Gabapentinoid drug, which is a class of medication used for the treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and restless legs syndrome. Other Gabapentinoids include Gabapentin, GABOB, Baclofen, Pregabalin and Fluorophenibut (Fluorobut, F-Phenibut).
Once Phenibut reaches the brain, it activates GABA receptors on certain synapses between neurons. Phenibut is known as a non-selective GABA agonist because it stimulates two different types of receptors for this neurotransmitter – GABA-A and GABA-B receptors.
You might recognize this as similar to the mechanism of action for alcohol. Alcohol also stimulates GABA receptors to lessen anxiety and stress, relax muscles, reduce inhibitions, and provide a sedative-like effect.
This makes Phenibut different from other nootropic supplements which may provide stimulatory effects.

Neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects
Phenibut Effects
The user-described benefits of Phenibut fall into a few major categories: Anxiolytic, Cognitive, Ataractic, Neuroprotective, and Cardioprotective.
Anxiety is thought to result from not being able to turn off certain types of communication between neurons. If you constantly fixate on small details and cannot seem to quiet your thoughts, then Phenibut might help to reduce some of this over-thinking. When used as an anxiolytic, this supplement may help to alleviate stress and anxious thoughts caused from overactive neural processing.
Many users report that this nootropic supplement makes them feel more composed, serene, and less likely to experience worry cycles. Phenibut HCL may also work to lessen social anxiety and shyness by helping you overcome unnecessary inhibitions.
There is also some limited evidence that Phenibut may increase cognitive abilities and mental performance. According to several trials, taking Phenibut led to improved brain function especially in regards to communication between the hemispheres of the brain.
This type of transcallosal communication is associated with better problem solving skills and more creative thought. Phenibut may support better memory and learning, but research in this area is still limited.
One of the primary reasons people use Phenibut is as a sedative or ataractic agent to improve sleep quality. If you find that you have trouble sleeping at night and do not achieve enough deep sleep, Phenibut may make it easier to fall asleep at night and wake up feeling rested.
Phenibut may also have neuroprotective qualities. Evidence suggests it is able to prevent some of the neuronal cell damage that occurs when stress hormones are high. This is also related to the potential cardioprotective benefits of the drug which may lessen pressure on the ventricles of your heart.
Research on Phenibut use and effects in humans is very limited, and more research is needed. At this time, Phenibut has not been approved as a drug by the FDA to prevent or treat any conditions.

Phenibut Side Effects
While there are many positive benefits associated with Phenibut, there is also the potential for side effects if it is used improperly. For most adult users, it is safe to use at low dosages; however, exceeding the safe range can cause similar side effects to other GABA stimulators such as alcohol, Benzodiazepines, and GHB.
It is also recommended that you do not combine this supplement with other GABA agonists (also known as GABAergics) like alcohol, because the stacking of these compounds may lead to more serious risks.
Some of the most common side effects seen with Phenibut usage include: fatigue, nausea, lightheadedness, headaches, stomach discomfort, and in more serious cases unconsciousness or memory loss.
It is recommended to only take Phenibut for at most a few weeks at a time. Some users report that tolerance can begin as soon as five days after beginning Phenibut, and increasing the dosage will often only increase the chance of side effects with no increased benefits. There are also some reports of experiencing Phenibut withdrawal online which is why you should not use this product on an ongoing basis.
Phenibut Dosages
As stated above, dosage control is particularly important with a compound as strong as Phenibut. The recommended dosage range is between 250 mg to 1000 mg but you should start with a smaller Phenibut dose and allow your body time to adjust before increasing to the full amount.
This compound has a much longer half-life than other nootropics and the effects can last for a full day. For this reason, you will not want to take more than one Phenibut dosage in a day with at least 4-6 hours between any follow-up administrations.
As an ingredient, Phenibut is most commonly sold in the form of a hydrochloride (HCL) salt. Another option is the free amino acid form (FAA).
The main difference between the two is that Phenibut FAA contains 20% more of the active ingredient in a single dose and has a higher potency. Online reports claim that Phenibut FAA is converted into Phenibut HCL in the gastrointestinal tract and the physiological effects of these compounds are the same.
Some people may experience more stomach-related side effects with one form or the other, but this is subject to individual sensitivities. There are no significant differences between the effects of these two formulations of the nootropic drug.
Phenibut HCL is water soluble and the powdered form of the supplement can be easily mixed into water or juice for ingestion. However, because the powder can taste quite sour many people prefer to cap their own pills after buying the bulk powder which is both cost-effective and convenient.
Legal Status
In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia, Phenibut is an uncontrolled substance, which means it is legal to possess without a prescription or license.
However, there may be restrictions on the manufacturing, production, importing and sale of this substance. It is not an approved drug by the FDA and cannot be purchased at a pharmacy or over the counter in the USA.
In other countries, particularly Russia and Eastern Europe, it is regulated as a prescription drug and may be available through your doctor.
What is the difference between Phenibut and Flourophenibut?
F-Phenibut is structurally related to Phenibut and has a similar profile of cognitive and physiological effects. However, the onset of this drug is significantly faster than its analog, with greater potency and a shorter duration of effects.
The primary difference is that it has a fluorine-substituted phenyl group in the beta-position of the molecule, making it very similar to the chemical structure of Baclofen.
There is very limited research available on Flourophenibut at this point. According to anecdotal reports, it may produce a greater euphoric effect and may have a higher risk of abuse for recreational purposes.

REVIEW
Lemon Balm is a memory boosting, anti-anxiety nootropic also known as Melissa officinalis.
It is a plant from the mint family and considered to be a calming herb that has been used for many centuries in medicinal contexts.
It was administered as long ago as the Middle Ages to help reduce stress and anxiety, promote sleep, improve appetite, and even ease pain and discomfort. More recent studies point to using Lemon Balm as a cognitive enhancer able to improve processing speed and memory.
Although it is native to Europe, the plant is now grown all over the world for use as a natural nutritional supplement. The Lemon Balm plant grows up to two feet in height and the leaves are very deeply wrinkled, ranging in color from dark to yellowish green.

The effects of Lemon Balm are numerous and varied, driven by many different chemical compounds found within this plant and its extracts.
One of the active ingredients in Lemon Balm supplements is eugenol which has been shown calm muscles and even numb tissues.
Terpenes are additional ingredients that are thought to add to the soothing effects of the supplement.
Lemon Bam extract also contains rosmarinic acid which has been found to inhibit GABA transaminase. This enzyme works to remove GABA when it is released by your neurons at the synaptic cleft. By inhibiting the transaminase enzyme, Lemon Balm an effectively increase GABA activity in the brain.
GABA is one of the inhibitory neurotransmitters, used by your brain to prevent over-excitement and attain balance. It is responsible for ensuring that we are not overly stressed and plays a role in sleep cycles.
Increasing stimulation of GABA receptors will produce a sedative or calming effect and explains why Lemon Balm works as an anti-anxiety supplement. Other anxiolytic nootropics such as Phenibut and Picamilon also work by utilizing GABA pathways but with slightly different mechanisms of action.
Lemon Balm also exhibits activity at nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the brain which makes it a great natural supplement for brain hacking. These receptors respond to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is integral to working memory capacity, memory formation, logical analysis and basic cognition skills.
Lemon Balm is considered to have cholinergic binning properties and may have some positive effects on individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.
In a 2003 study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, individuals given Lemon Balm were recorded to have improved attention accuracy scores as well as better working memory and secondary memory performance. Individuals also experienced greater calmness and alertness when taking this supplement.
Furthermore, Lemon Balm is considered to be an adaptogens meaning that it helps the body deal with external stressors in the environment. Many of the ingredients in Lemon Balm are also thought to kill bacteria and possibly even certain viruses.
A number of tannins are believed to contribute to the antiviral effects. This also may explain why the supplement has strong anti-oxidant properties.
Lemon Balm Benefits:
The most common use of Lemon Balm as a supplement is for anti-anxiety purposes. It is used to promote relaxation and deep, restful sleep. Many user report that stress seems to melt away when using this supplement along with irritability, nervousness, and even depression.
Lemon Balm and similar preparations have also been shown to improve mental performance. Healthy users have reported increases in memory, learning capacity, and even sensory perceptions in some cases.
Lemon Balm extract is also known to be a very potent anti-oxidant. This means that it may augment immune system functioning and provide protection against inflammation, infection, and disease.
This also may relate somehow to it anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. The plants leaves were used even before the Middle Ages for wound healing, and especially treating venomous insect bites and stings.
Lemon Balm may also provide relief from conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome and digestive problems ranging from bloating, gas, vomiting, heartburn, colic, and even poor appetite. Many women find that this supplement can help them with menstrual pain and even serves to stimulate the menstrual period in cases of weak or absent cycles.
The supplement may also help to protect the heart and cardiovascular system. Many users have experienced relief from heart palpitations, allergic reactions, and rapid heartbeat.
Lemon Balm Dosage:
The generally accepted dosage range for Lemon Balm is between 300 and 500 mg per day.
Using Lemon Balm for other purposes (like as a sleep aid or anxiolytic) may require slightly higher amounts, but there is no officially determined dose for these cases. As such, deciding how much to use may require a bit of experimentation.
Lemon Balm may also be used in a number of different formulations such as in a tea or as a topical skin rub. New users are always advised to start out with the lowest effective dose and only increase from there gradually.
Lemon Balm Side Effects:
Lemon Balm is considered to be a very safe natural herb. In fact, this compound is sometimes even given in small amounts to babies who have colic. Most users will not experience any side effects when taking this nootropic.
The only known side effect of Lemon Balm is that it may cause an increase in drowsiness. It would probably not be a good idea to drive or operate machinery until you know how the supplement affects you.
There may be some people who have unique reactions to this supplement. It would not be recommended for someone using anti-anxiety drugs, anti-histamines, muscle relaxants, anti-seizure drugs, sedatives, or tranquilizers.
Lemon Balm Review:
Lemon Balm is one of the most underrated nootropic supplements. While it is regarded best for its anxiolytic properties, this herbal extract also has been proven to improve memory, attention, accuracy and reasoning skills. It works on both the acetylcholine and GABA systems in the brain, boosting your mood and leading to greater synaptic plasticity.
Lemon Balm can be taken by almost any healthy adult and can kick your immune system into overdrive. If you are currently using other medications for anxiety or depression, it would be best to speak to your doctor before you consider adding this supplement to your daily routine.
