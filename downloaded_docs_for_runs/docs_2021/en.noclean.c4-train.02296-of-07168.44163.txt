Hair Loss.
The most common cause of hair loss in men is male pattern baldness (also known as androgenic alopecia or hereditary pattern hair loss). This accounts for more than 95% of cases of hair loss in men.
This condition can be inherited from either the mother’s or father’s side of the family. This leads to a receding hairline as well as a loss of hair on top of the scalp especially the crown area. Male pattern baldness affects one in three men by the age of 30 years and one in two men by the age of 50 years.
Hereditary pattern hair loss affects both men and women. Hair loss is not a pleasant experience. Its impact on your appearance and confidence can be quite devastating. Now there is a clinically proven treatment for hair loss for men and women.
Hair A-Gain contains the active ingredient minoxidil which is clinically proven to treat hereditary hair loss.
Extensive studies on the active ingredient have proven that minoxidil can help stop or slow hereditary hair loss in 4 out of 5 people. It helps reverse the progression of hereditary hair loss and helps regrow hair. Minoxidil reactivates or revitalises shrunken hair follicles leading to an increase in the size of the follicles.
Always read the label. Follow the directions for use. If symptoms worsen or change unexpectedly, talk to your health professional.
