Hair loss is an issue that affects a significant percentage of people, particularly as they become older. This loss can not only change the way you look but may also have an impact on confidence levels. Luckily, there are treatments that help to halt this process, reversing the damaging effects and even promoting new growth.
The cause of hair loss
There are several different types of hair loss that can affect men. By far the most common is male pattern baldness, where hair both starts to thin at the crown of the head and recede from the hairline. Around twenty five per cent of men will start to experience this from the age of about 21 and by the age of 50 approximately 85% of men will have some level of noticeable hair loss. Male pattern baldness has a genetic cause and can be inherited from traits in either parent.
The technical name for this type of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, which can affect both men and women. Changing levels in testosterone result in the production of a molecule called DHT. Higher levels of DHT cause the hair follicles to shrink, resulting in existing hair falling out and preventing the re-growth of new hairs. Men have higher levels of testosterone than women which is why changing levels have a more significant impact and why men have a greater tendency to suffer from baldness.
A simple solution
This process of hair loss can be treated by using Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Topical Solution 5%. The active ingredient in this preparation is Minoxidil, which directly affects the hair follicles. Applying this to the scalp stimulates the follicles, re-starting the hair’s natural growth cycle. Minoxidil allows the hair follicles to enlarge, not only preventing hair loss in the first place but also promoting the healthy production of new hair. This revitalisation of the follicles will result in appreciable hair growth.
Great results
Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Topical Solution 5% is an extra-strength solution that is easy to use and has demonstrable results. Using the special dropper, apply the specified dosage twice a day directly to the affected area. The Minoxidil will begin to penetrate the scalp. Over the first two weeks you may experience some shedding of your old, thin hair as it makes way for the new.
Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Topical Solution 5% will then start to invigorate the follicles to stimulate production of new hair. During the first two months of use this hair will be growing and you may start to notice the beneficial effects. The new hair may initially be hard to see as it is very soft and can be very pale. After using Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Topical Solution 5% for four months, you should start to see visible results as your new, strong hair grows in.
The formula is available as both a liquid and an easy-to-apply foam. Each bottle contains one month’s supply and these are available in three, six, nine and twelve-month packs. With Kirkland Signature Minoxidil Topical Solution 5% you can limit the effects of hair loss, revitalising the scalp and promoting healthy new hair growth.
