8 Ways You're Sabotaging Your Depression Treatment
By Mary Elizabeth Dallas
Medically Reviewed by Niya Jones, MD, MPH
Major depression is a complex condition that often requires more than depression medication. Find out what you might be unknowingly doing to prevent optimal depression treatment.
Lifestyle Factors That Stand in the Way of Depression
Depression is a complex disease that doesn't have one simple recommended treatment plan. In most cases, taking depression medication alone isn't enough to stop symptoms in their tracks. A number of lifestyle changes are often essential components of managing depression. And, conversely, some lifestyle habits may worsen your depression symptoms or inhibit treatment. In fact, you may be surprised by how you could be sabotaging your depression treatment.
No. 1: Not Talking to Your Doctor or Therapist
Many forms of talk therapy, including interpersonal therapy, are helpful in depression treatment. Talk therapy helps you develop strategies to handle the issues that can trigger episodes or make your depression symptoms worse. Furthermore, research shows that people who have improvement after taking depression medication and undergoing interpersonal therapy in combination for at least two years are less likely to have recurring episodes of depression. If you haven't made this a regular part of your plan, you're missing out on a vital part of what could effectively treat your depression. Another reason to keep talking to your therapist: It often takes time for a therapist to learn your lifestyle habits and how they affect your depression or inhibit treatment. If it's not already a normal part of the discussion you have during therapy sessions, bring it up. Also, continued therapy can make you more comfortable discussing the effectiveness of treatments and behaviors.
No. 2: Drinking Alcohol
When you have major depression, drinking alcohol is like throwing fuel on a fire. "Alcohol creates a lot of mood instability, and it can interfere with sleep," explains Peter Kramer, MD, a clinical professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University in Providence, R.I. "It can also lead to bad decision-making." Drinking can also limit the effectiveness of certain antidepressants. What's more, a 2013 study in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs found that depression among alcohol abusers is often related to drinking. For these alcohol abusers, depression symptoms are likely to improve once they stop drinking, and only rarely are depression medications needed.
No. 3: Taking Certain Supplements
It's always a good idea to talk with your doctor about any herbal or dietary supplements you're taking, even if you're taking them for a health benefit unrelated to depression. St. John's wort, for instance, an herb commonly used to treat depression, can interfere with other medications, including depression medications and those for heart disease and certain forms of cancer. "Herbs that affect processing of certain neurotransmitters, like serotonin and norepinephrine, can interact with medications that your doctor might prescribe," notes Dr. Kramer. He points out that combining some supplements and depression medication can lead to negative outcomes, including possible overdosing. So even if it seems silly, ask your doctor before popping a new supplement.
No. 4: Holding On to Negative Social Connections
Having a strong support system or social network is a boon to depression treatment. By maintaining these connections, you avoid feelings of isolation, which is a risk factor for depression. Kramer cautions, however, that unhealthy relationships can be especially risky when you're managing depression. "Many people with depression are very giving, but they care at a cost to themselves," he says. "What looks on paper like a support system may actually be a drain. You want social connections that are mutually beneficial with some support also coming in." If that's not happening for you, it may be time to reevaluate your relationships.
No. 5: Being Sedentary
Being inactive has been linked to depression for numerous reasons. Though depression can make you feel like you can't get moving, many people report that physical activity eases their symptoms. Research suggests that engaging in both aerobic and weight-training exercise three to five times a week for 30 to 60 minutes can benefit your mental health, so think of it as another part of your treatment.
No. 6: Not Losing Weight
The link between obesity and depression may be a two-way street. A study published in 2013 in the journal ISRN Psychiatry involving 96 overweight or obese adults found that depression and obesity often go hand in hand and that symptoms of depression improve with weight loss. Although it remains unclear whether weight loss eases depression or improvement in symptoms prompts people to lose weight, either scenario can help, and one may even support the other. Also, being overweight or obese is a key risk factor for diabetes, a condition that could double your risk of depression.
No. 7: A Poor Diet
Your diet can also play a large role in depression, affecting the severity of your symptoms and how long they last. Kramer points out that there are many theories about the link between diet and depression. One such theory, he notes, is that low intake of omega-3 fatty acids, which are naturally found in fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, might be associated with depression. A 2007 analysis of several studies showed that increasing intake of omega-3 fatty acids may improve symptoms of depression — although the researchers did note that more large-scale trials are needed to confirm the association. Regardless, eating healthy foods that support your body can only benefit your mood, too.
No. 8: Giving Up
Though there are many lifestyle changes that can help you ease your depression symptoms, it is still true that what works for one person may not be the answer for another. This is why it's important, Kramer points out, to continue to try different approaches for treating your depression until you find the option or options that work best for you. This may include changing your medication dose, trying another medication, or adding a second one, as well as focusing on talk therapy. In the meantime, do what you can to best support yourself through depression treatment by avoiding these pitfalls.
