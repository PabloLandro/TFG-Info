Circulatory system
3-minute read
Listen
Your circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or vascular system, transports oxygen, nutrients and hormones to your body's cells to use for energy, growth and repair. Your circulatory system also removes carbon dioxide and other wastes your cells do not need.
What is the circulatory system?
These key parts of your circulatory system maintain blood flow to your body so you can survive:
blood, made up of cells and plasma
the heart, a muscular organ that pumps blood to all parts of your body
blood vessels, a network of arteries, capillaries and veins to carry blood pumped by your heart
How does the circulatory system work?
Blood that is low in oxygen collects in your heart's right atrium, one of the heart’s 4 chambers.
Illustration showing the circulatory system.
It moves into the right ventricle, which pumps this blood to your lungs where your red blood cells pick up oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. You exhale the carbon dioxide.
The oxygen-rich blood returns to your heart's left atrium, then into your left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood through your aorta, into your arteries, then to all parts of your body. Along the way, the blood gathers food nutrients from your small intestine.
As it enters the capillaries, your blood makes close contact with tissues and cells. It delivers oxygen and nutrients and removes carbon dioxide and wastes. Now low in oxygen, the blood travels through the veins to return to your heart's right atrium, where the circuit starts all over again.
Common conditions related to the circulatory system
Cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to all diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Most CVD occurs when fatty substances, called plaque or atheroma, build up in the lining of blood vessels, causing them to narrow. This process is called atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis causes coronary heart disease, also known as ischaemic heart disease. The slowing of the blood flow reduces the oxygen and nutrients available to the heart muscles. This can cause angina or a heart attack, which will require emergency medical attention. The most common symptom of heart attack or angina is chest pain.
When the supply of blood to part of the brain is interrupted because of a blocked or burst artery, a person will have a stroke. A stroke is also an emergency and will require urgent medical treatment.

High or low blood pressure
As your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the blood pushes against the artery walls. This is what determines your blood pressure. Most doctors consider a blood pressure higher than 90 over 60mm/Hg and lower than 140 over 90mm/Hg to be in a healthy range.
High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can raise your risk of cardiovascular disease. It is the most common condition of the circulatory system.
Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, is a sign of good health for some people but can be a problem for others. If you have symptoms of low blood pressure, such as dizziness or fainting, you should see a doctor.

Ganoderma lucidum mushroom (lingzhi/reishi) for treating cardiovascular risk factors | Cochrane
Cardiovascular disease is the name given to any disease, such as heart attack or stroke, that affects the heart and circulatory system (which moves blood around the body). Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases include high blood pressure, and high levels in the blood of glucose and cholesterol. People with cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than people without them.

Fixed-dose combination therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease | Cochrane
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including heart attacks and strokes, are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Drug therapy with blood pressure and cholesterol lowering medications, particularly statins, have been proven to reduce the likelihood that individuals will experience a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event. Aspirin has also been proven to prevent heart attacks, certain types of strokes, and death in people with prior cardiovascular disease. The concept of fixed-dose combination therapy is to combine mulitple medications in a single pill as this has been shown to improve adherence in patients with high blood pressure and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There have been recent randomised controlled clinical trials to evaluate the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy for CVD prevention. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CVD events, adverse events, blood pressure, lipids, discontinuation rates, quality of life, and costs for CVD prevention.

Green and black tea to prevent cardiovascular disease | Cochrane
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a worldwide healthcare burden. However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable risk factors such as diet, and this includes the intake of tea. This review assessed the effectiveness of green tea, black tea or black/green tea extracts in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD. We found 11 randomised controlled trials, four of which examined black tea interventions and seven examined green tea interventions. There were variations in the dosage and form (drink, tablets or capsules) of the black and green tea interventions, and the duration of the interventions ranged from three months to six months. Adverse events were reported in five of the included trials. These included a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalisation for influenza, appendicitis and retinal detachment; these are unlikely to be associated with the intervention. The results showed black and green tea to have a beneficial effect on lipid levels and blood pressure, but these results were based on only a small number of trials that were at risk of bias. Analysis conducted over both tea types showed beneficial effects of tea on LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure but again this was based on only a few trials that were at risk of bias. To date the small number of studies included suggest some benefits of green and black tea on blood pressure and lipid levels but more longer-term trials at low risk of bias are needed to confirm this.

Fermented milk for hypertension | Cochrane
High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure.

Dietary fibre to prevent cardiovascular disease | Cochrane
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. CVD is a global burden and varies between regions, and this variation has been linked in part to dietary factors. Such factors are important because they can be modified to help with CVD prevention and management.This review assessed the effectiveness of increased fibre intake as a supplement or in food stuffs in reducing cardiovascular death, all-cause death, non-fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD.

Homocysteine-lowering interventions (B-complex vitamintherapy) for preventing cardiovascular events | Cochrane
Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death worldwide. The most common causes of cardiovascular disease leading to both morbidity and mortality are ischaemic heart disease, stroke and congestive heart failure. Many people with cardiovascular diseases may be asymptomatic, but may have a high risk of developing myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic or both). 'Emergent' or new risk factors for cardiovascular disease have recently been added to the established risk factors (which are diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, active smoking and an adverse blood lipid profile). One of these risk factors is elevated circulating total homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is an amino acid and its levels in the blood are influenced by blood levels of B-complex vitamins: cyanocobalamin (B12), folic acid (B9) and pyridoxine (B6). High plasma total homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic diseases (where there is a build-up of plaque in the arteries).

Co-enzyme Q10 supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease | Cochrane
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the result of complications of the heart and blood vessels and is a worldwide healthcare burden. However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable risk factors, such as diet. Dietary supplements have received a great deal of attention for the prevention of CVD. One such supplement is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is an antioxidant. Deficiencies in CoQ10 have been associated with CVD. This review therefore assessed the effectiveness of CoQ10 supplementation for CVD prevention. We included trials administering CoQ10 as a single supplement in healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD (but without a diagnosis of CVD) and measuring cardiovascular events or major CVD risk factors, such as blood pressure and lipid levels. We found six completed randomised controlled trials with a total of 218 participants randomised. All were conducted in participants at high risk of CVD. Two examined CoQ10 supplementation alone and four examined CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy. The trials were small and short-term, none measured cardiovascular events or adverse events, and we regarded two of the six trials as being at high risk of bias. Very few small trials contributed to the analyses and no conclusions can be drawn at this time. We also identified five ongoing trials and the results from these will add to the evidence base in due course. More longer-term trials are needed to determine the effect of CoQ10 on cardiovascular events.
