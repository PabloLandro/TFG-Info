Ovarian Cysts Q & A
What is an ovarian cyst?
An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that forms in or on one of your ovaries. Ovarian cysts are common during ovulation — the release of an egg each month. Cysts are typically harmless, without symptoms, and usually resolve on their own.
There are several types of cysts, including:
Follicle cysts that grow inside a follicle that fails to release an egg
Corpus luteum cysts that grow in the follicle after it releases an egg
Dermoids develop from cells present from birth
Endometrioma cysts that result from endometriosis
Cystadenomas that are fluid-filled and may be quite large
In some cases, your ovaries may make many small cysts at once, which is known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can lead to problems with your ovaries or make it difficult for you to become pregnant.
What are the symptoms of ovarian cysts?
Since most cysts resolve on their own, you may not notice any symptoms. But, if you have a large ovarian cyst or one that ruptures, you may experience severe pelvic pain or a dull ache on one side of your lower abdomen. Bloating and a full feeling in your abdomen are also indications of an ovarian cyst.
Painful bowel movements, painful intercourse, and breast tenderness may also be signs of an ovarian cyst. If you have sudden, severe abdominal pain, or pain with a fever or vomiting, seek immediate medical attention.
How are ovarian cysts treated?
Many ovarian cysts require only monitoring and disappear on their own within a cycle or two. If you do require treatment for ovarian cysts, Dr. De Leon or Dr. Nguyen-Luu will suggest effective treatments. For example, for multiple cysts caused by PCOS, the doctor may recommend therapies to shrink the cysts. Birth control pills may be effective at preventing new cysts from forming each month.
If you have a small cyst that needs to be removed, the doctors can perform laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive procedure.
If you have large ovarian cysts, you may need to have a laparotomy or abdominal surgery to remove them. Large cysts may be biopsied to determine if they’re cancerous. If needed, a hysterectomy is a last resort.
If you suspect you have an ovarian cyst or polycystic ovary syndrome, don’t panic. Most cysts are not cancerous and do go away on their own. Dr. De Leon and Dr. Nguyen-Luu can use diagnostic ultrasound imaging to monitor the cyst and take action if needed.
