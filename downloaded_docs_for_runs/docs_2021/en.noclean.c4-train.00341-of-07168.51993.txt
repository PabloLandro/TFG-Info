Has your hair seemed thinner in back, and you want to take care of that? Minoxidil may be a possible solution but with several, potentially severe side effects. Rogaine is one of the brand names for the drug minoxidil, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with several post launch warnings to regrow hair in men with hereditary male pattern baldness and to help hair growth in women with thinning hair with certain health warnings.[1] Application is quick and easy, and we'll show you what's involved. Read on!
Steps
Method 1
Applying Minoxidil
1
Wash your hair and scalp thoroughly. Towel or blow-dry your hair as desired. You can apply Minoxidil to damp hair.
2
Rinse your hands in cold water and dry well.
3
Prepare the solution. Minoxidil comes in two forms: liquid (for men and women) and foam (for men).
Liquid: Load the applicator. Fill the applicator with 1 milliliter (0.034 fl oz). minoxidil solution, or use 20 drops.
Foam: Invert the can and dispense about 1/2 a cap full of foam onto your fingers.
4
Apply minoxidil to your scalp. Part your hair where it's thinning, and evenly apply the minoxidil to the affected area, rubbing it in with your fingers. Wash any residue off your hands.
5
Let it dry. Allow the applied minoxidil to dry completely—about 20 to 25 minutes—before adding other hair-styling products such as gels, mousses. Apply it about 2 hours before going to bed.
6
Repeat this process as recommended. Generally, this is twice a day—in the morning, and in the evening—or as often as your doctor recommends.
Method 2
Using Minoxidil Effectively
1
Understand the effect is temporary. Minoxidil is not a permanent cure for baldness, and will only be effective as long as you use it at least twice a day, every day.
Use your phone to set a twice-a-day reminder, until it becomes an automatic habit.
2
Use the recommended amount of minoxidil. Additional amounts or more frequent applications will not improve your results; you'll only waste product.
3
Don't make up missed applications. If you skip an application, don't double up the next day. Simply pick back up where you left off.
Method 3
What to Expect
1
Expect shedding hair. While it seems counter-intuitive, shedding hair means that new growth has begun. This may last a few weeks, but it is just temporary: the shedding hair is older hair that would have fallen out, making room for the newer, healthier hair.[2]
2
Be patient. New hair growth usually takes about four months, though some have results earlier than that. New hair growth may be soft and downy, like peach fuzz.
Eventually, new hairs growing in will be the same color and thickness as your normal hair. To maintain this growth, you will need to continue using minoxidil.

Question
What are the side effects of Minoxidil?
Community Answer
From what I've read, an unhealthy-looking face and high blood pressure can be side effects. I asked my pharmacist about this, and was told that the blood pressure issue is an uncommon problem, and often happens because of really high over-application. He had no experience with the face issue. I've been using the 5% foam for 3 months and haven't seen any issues.
Thanks!

Tips
If you do not see results after four months, consult with your doctor. Minoxidil may not be effective for you.
Minoxidil can treat hair loss due to heredity, but not temporary hair loss due to pregnancy or medical treatments. Minoxidil also only treats hair loss on the top of the scalp, not a receding hairline.
Avoid swimming or getting your hair wet for about a half an hour after applying minoxidil.
Minoxidil is safe to use on color-treated hair, but you might want to skip your evening application of minoxidil on the day that the color is applied to avoid causing minor irritation of the scalp.
Warnings
Never apply minoxidil more than twice a day, even if you miss an application. Using minoxidil more often won't cause your hair to regrow sooner.
Don't use minoxidil on any part of the body other than the scalp.
If you stop using minoxidil, any new hair growth will fall out after several months. You must continue to use minoxidil indefinitely to prevent hair loss.
Stop using minoxidil if your scalp becomes irritated, you develop unwanted hair growth on the face or other bothersome side effects.
Edema, salt and water retention, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, tamponade, tachycardia, and angina have been reported with minoxidil. Patients with underlying heart disease may be at increased risk for these or other cardiovascular adverse effects.
Children should not use minoxidil, and women should not use the products for men.
Rogaine isn't guaranteed to work for everyone and has several potential side effects[3].
