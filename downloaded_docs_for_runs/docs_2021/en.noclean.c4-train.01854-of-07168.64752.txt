Stress Or Depression - Discharging The Negative Energy
Dallas Munkholm

Anxiety, Depression, Wellness Advice
Pain is not suffering. Suffering is the pain we hold onto. Deepak Chopra We rely on what our body tells us to determine pain, anxiety, stress or depression. Then our bodies follow the habits they have made to deal with those feelings.
What we need to understand is that each feeling has an energy associated with it and it is that energy we are experiencing. The suffering part of “I suffer from stress or depression” and so on is our interpretation of feeling that energy.
We need to strip away the interpretation and deal with the energy, discharge the negative energy. Each of these feelings has a physical component that we can let go of. So instead of feeling stressed, lets deal with the energy of being stressed or sad or depressed or anxious. In his book The Book of Secrets, Deepak Chopra says, “all energies are discharged the same way.”
He list 5 things to do. 1) Take a deep breath, sit quietly and feel the sensation in your body. 2) Feel that sensation without judgment, don’t fight it, push against it. Be with it quietly. 3) Let the feelings, thoughts, energies come up as they want to—often we will have to listen to ourselves be anxious, depressed, angry, sad or whatever. Let the voices say what they want to say, listen, understand what is happening, often we can ask what do I have to learn from this… 4) Sit and let those things just fade away into the nothingness, with no holding on. 5) Repeat the process the next day, as often as is needed.
The whole process should take no more than 5 minutes. Being aware of the “I” is our natural state and the other feelings of stress and so forth are unnatural, learned through our lives from watching and listening to others.
To be stressed, depressed, anxious, sad, angry, hurt and suffering all waste our valuable energy. These are all complex emotional states and can really wear us out. We need to simplify our lives. We need to find our true and real self and embrace that self. The “I am” not the “I am sick, stressed, anxious,” well you know what I mean.
We are not what we do; we are not our emotions and our illness or issues. We are special, unique individuals, with perfect, unlimited potential. We get to choose who we are and what we will be. when we are distressed, in pain, anxious or depressed we often lose that choice. We are stuck in our pain, we haven't discharged that negative energy.
We need to be willing to face ourselves in the mirror and say, “Who are you really? Who do you wish to be?” When you can answer that question honestly, truthfully and openly there is another question to ask, “why aren’t I that now?” The answers to that question often lead us to our blocks, where negative energy is being stored. Again, the secret is to sit and just let those blocks and that energy be discharged into quiet peaceful acceptance of "I am."
So, in summary, we are who we are, not what we do or what others say we are. We need to understand the energy we spend “suffering” from our problems and issues is wasted energy. Deal with those issues, discharge all this negative energy through this non-invasive approach that accepts and allows them to be. These types of issues are like a little child tugging on his mommy’s pant leg and saying, “Mommy. Mommy, mommy?” They are just looking to be noticed and acknowledged.
Find your I am and really live from there.
It’s an emotional circus, but you can’t get out the push brooms until the elephant dances. Nora Roberts

Faulty Thinking = Cognitive Distortions
Susan Derry

Anxiety, Depression
Faulty thinking can take the joy out of living. People’s minds can play tricks on them, leading them to view the world as if through dark sunglasses. Aaron Beck and David Burns referred to these warped thought patterns as cognitive distortions. They suggested that cognitive distortions might contribute to and perpetuate anxiety and depression. Cognitive distortions color a person's perception of reality, leading them to experience the world in a negative way. Through their faulty thinking, people become convinced that the way they see the world is true, when it is not. The impact of distorted thinking is usually magnified by the negative emotions that accompany these thoughts.
Cognitive Distortions
1. Jumping to conclusions
A person makes assumptions that they know what someone is thinking or how something will turn out. These assumptions are usually negative and rarely give others the benefit of the doubt. The person sees their assumptions as facts and rarely checks with or believes the other person.
2. Personalizing
This distortion occurs when a person takes what others do or say, to mean something personal about themselves. They blame themselves or feel guilt for things that are outside of their control.
3. Blaming
This distortion occurs when people refuse to accept responsibility for their own feelings, thoughts or behavior. They throw the blame at others, saying things like, “If you had not made me mad, I would not have lost my temper.”
4. Filtering
This distortion allows only the negative information to reach a person's attention. The positive information is deflected or ignored. A person may be so affected by a single negative detail, that they completely miss any positives.
5. Black and white thinking
Things are either all good or all bad. With this type of distortion if a person is not perfect, they feel like a failure. There is no allowance for the complexity of situations or individuals.
6. Horriblizing
This distortion magnifies problems to epic proportion, while at the same time minimizing coping abilities and resilience. People scare themselves by thinking of and dwelling on all the “what ifs." A small mistake is obsessed upon until it seems overwhelming.
7. Shoulding
This distortion manifests as an inflexible list of rules for the person and others. Anger and guilt result when the person feels the rules have been broken. Harsh criticism of self and others is the outcome.
8. Right fighting
A person must be right at all costs. They constantly feel that they must prove that their actions and opinions are correct. Being right is more important than relationships or the feelings of loved ones.
9. Overgeneralization
This distortion leads people to expect that, if something bad happens, it will continue to happen. There is a hopeless expectation of an unending pattern of defeat.
10. Emotional Reasoning
Unhealthy emotions are assumed to represent reality. If a person feels like a failure, they think they are a failure. They do not feel like getting out of bed, so they stay in bed.
11. Myth of Change
People expect that others will change to suit them, with enough convincing. They want others to change in order for them to feel comfortable or to make them happy.
12. Labeling
A person identifies with their faults or mistakes. They have thoughts such as, “I am stupid” or “I am a failure”, rather than “that was not my best performance” or “I messed that up.”
Most people experience cognitive distortions from time to time. The misery an individual is experiencing is probably proportional to the extent of their faulty thinking habits. Therapy is often focused on changing habitual thought patterns so that they run along more positive, life enhancing tracks.

Benefits of Exercise

Anxiety, Self-Esteem, Wellness Advice
The benefits of exercise extend beyond improving physical health. Exercise can help relieve anxiety and burn off stress. It can help lift depression. It can encourage a more positive outlook and boost self-esteem. Even 10 minutes of walking a day can help.
Regular exercise will help you enjoy a sense of wellbeing. Typically, regular exercise leads to both increased energy levels and better sleep. Moving your body helps you feel more alert and alive. Start where you are and find ways to gradually add more movement to your life.
Lighten your mood – Exercise releases endorphins, or feel good chemicals, in your brain. Regular exercise can moderate mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressants.
Reduce Stress – Exercise reduces stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. Moving your body can help you forget your problems and focus on the moment. Exercise improves sleep, which tends to reduce stress.
Decrease Anxiety – Exercise can create a general pattern of calm in certain parts of the brain. Research has demonstrated the regular activity reduces anxiety.
Increase Alertness – Somewhat ironically, exercise is very effective at reducing fatigue. It improves alertness and concentration and it enhances overall brain function. Activity also may help prevent age-related decline by stimulating the growth of new brain cells.
Improve Self-Esteem – Regular exercise gives you a sense of control in your life. You feel more self-confident and comfortable in your body.
Getting Started
Start gradually. Doing too much too soon will lead to discouragement. Begin with something you feel comfortable with and gradually build.
Choose activities you enjoy. It is going to be easier to continue doing things you enjoy. If you hate swimming, you will not stick with it no matter how many benefits it would bring. Walk, dance, play a sport. Do not despair if movement does not seem to appeal to you at all. Start with something simple and trust that it will grow on you.
Set realistic goals. Building muscle or losing weight are goals that can take months or more to achieve. Focusing on more easily attained goals, such as boosting your energy level, reducing stress or improving your mood, will help you see results quicker.
Make exercise a habit. One of the best things you can do for your physical and mental health is to make exercise a habit in your life. Most of what you do in your life you do by routine. Try adding small habits like taking the stairs or parking at the far end of the parking lot. Put exercise in your schedule.
Be nice to yourself. Instead of being your own worst critic, become a loving but firm coach. Do not compare yourself to others. Focus on the improvements you are making.
Do not give up. If you find that you have fallen into old ruts, do not get discouraged. Simply start again, as many times as you have to, and build up gradually.
