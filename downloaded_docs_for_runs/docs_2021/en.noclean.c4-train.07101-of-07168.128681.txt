How to Stop Male Pattern Hair Loss Without Surgery
Bill - Managing Publisher Non Surgical Hair Regrowth Treatments, Propecia (Finasteride) for Hair Loss, Rogaine (Minoxidil), Topicals	0
I am losing hair at a very fast rate and don’t know which hair loss treatment I should use to stop it. Please advise.
There are a number of possible causes of hair loss, the most common of which is androgenic alopecia (female and male pattern baldness).
The only two non-surgical treatments of any viable effect in my opinion, are Propecia and Rogaine, both FDA approved for the treatment of male pattern baldness.
Propecia comes in a pill form and contains active ingredient finasteride. Finasteride works to inhibit DHT, the hormone responsible for androgenic alopecia.
Rogaine is a topical solution containing active ingredient minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodilator originally used orally to lower blood pressure by relaxing the veins and arteries in the body. An accidental side effect of hair growth was found and then later tested topically and FDA approved to stop hair loss.
A number of other non-surgical hair loss solutions exist, but the proof of their efficacy are lacking. Be sure to research all products you are considering and speak to your physician about Propecia (which requires a prescription).
