Unique 5-in-1 Functionality of the diffuser
Vaporiser/Diffuser: Keeps essential oils in their 100% purest form and is easily absorbed and inhaled into the limbic system. The 'cool mist' technology produces no heat and no condensation and uses minimal water.
Humidifer: The ultrasonic waves create air moisture to combat the drying effects of heating and air-conditioning. The moisture releases into the environment without any condensation.
Unlike other humidifiers, these ultrasonic vaporisers use small quantities of water and will not create dampness or heat. Humidifiers are listed on Essential Baby and Kidspot websites in the Top 10 "Essential Products" for babies!
Air Purifier: The mist releases negative ions, which produce electrostatic reactions with dust and impurities floating in the air, thereby purifying the air, removing allergens, stale air and odours.
Our organic essential oil blends also have antibacterial properties, and as they are dispersed into the atmosphere, will assist to cleanse and purify the air and destroy airborne bacteria. See our range of organic oils below.
Ioniser: A UNIQUE feature in our cool mist diffusers for the home. The water vibrates at 2.4 million Hz/sec creating negative ions. They disperse into the air, and help remove dust, germs and bacteria which assists breathing, improves sleeping and enhances general well being. Most other diffusers on the Australian market DO NOT have a built in ioniser.
Night Lamp: The Aroma-Bloom has an LED light which changes in light intensity and is fully adjustable or can be completely switched off.
This wood diffuser is a stylish addition to your kitchen or living room decor + ultra safe around children, with no heat source.
We recommend using the wood diffuser 365 days and nights a year - not just in times of acute illness. The mist from the wood look diffuser will purify and safely humidify the air in your home or office. And remember, cool mist vaporisers are safe for babies, children and adults of all ages.

Please consult your health care professional for more advice on appropriate use and dosage of essential oils. Read more information on our blog.
Frequently Asked Questions:
Why are Ultrasonic Diffusers the best delivery system to diffuse essential oils?
With the flick of a button, you can instantly fill a room with the aromatic and therapeutic benefits of essential oils. Your home will smell beautiful, and your overall wellbeing will be improved by breathing the essential oils via the fine mist.
You no longer have to worry about naked flames, or if you turned off the diffuser, as it switches off automatically when the minimal water level is reached.
Is it safe to leave the diffuser unattended?
Yes, this intelligent, energy-efficient ultrasonic diffuser does not use any form of heat, candle or naked flame, so it is even safe around children, the elderly and pets. The diffuser will automatically switch off once the water level reaches a low level (up to 10/18 hours).
We encourage your child to sleep with the diffuser on for better relief from cold and flu symptoms. Most customers use the Aroma Bloom everynight, in sickness and health, to optimise a healthy sleeping environment and purify the air, naturally.
What are the benefits of the Aroma Bloom Ultrasonic Diffusers over conventional oil burners or vaporisers?
The Aroma Bloom does not use any form of heat to diffuse the mist/oil into the atmosphere. By heating essential oils you can severely alter the molecular structure and thus destroy the aromatic and therapeutic benefits of the essential oil. By using these ultrasonic diffusers, your essential oils will be kept in their purest form and the qualities of the essential oils will be enhanced by the high vibrations.
This 'cool mist' technology is recommended by health professionals, concerned that traditional 'heating' vaporisers (like the Vicks and Euky Bear units) can create condensation and potentially cause mould spores to grow in the room, which can be ingested into the lungs.
I Always Thought Warm Steam Was Best For Croup and Congestion. Is That Not the Case?
There is no doubt that warm steam has medical and therapeutic benefits for children when they are congested or display croup-like symptoms. However, the current recommendation is that warm steam in a "short burst" is best. For example, 10 minutes in a steamy bathroom, breathing in the vapours and opening the air ways, will certainly ease congestion and croup symptoms.
But warm steam from a heated vaporiser as a long term, overnight routine in the bedroom may not be the best solution, as it creates a lot of condensation, making the room warm and stuffy. The condensation can make the walls dripping wet, and the moisture can settle on soft furnishings, where mould spores can grow.
Read more about cool mist vs steam vaporisers on our blog.
Does the vaporiser make a noise?
The Aroma Bloom Vaporiser is whisper quiet, but not silent. In operating mode, there is a very faint trickling water sound and hum of the small motor.
Most customers find this sound actually enhances the relaxing nature of the unit. This sound is virtually undetectable during daytime operation, due to the outside, background noise associated with life in the daytime. However, in the quiet of night, the trickling water is just audible. There is a very faint hum of the small motor, as the unit operates.
Many customers love using our range of Homedics Sleep Sound Machines to create an ambient sound of their choice (eg, rain, ocean, white noise, lullaby), perfect for relaxation and deep sleep.

What Is an Essential Oil?
An essential oil is a substance that is extracted from the flowers, leaves, stems, roots, bark or seeds of a plant. It is the concentrated essence of the original medicinal plant, containing the molecular constructs of its therapeutic properties.
Pure Essential Oil Blends are professionally crafted with high quality oils and offer a safe, natural way to support the body through many issues of imbalance and ill-health. They can also be created to enhance natural balance and compliment many areas of daily life. The end result is a concentrate combination of essential oils that smell divine and may work wonders. Our organic essential oil blends can be purchased here for $22
What is the difference between Essential Oil Essence available for $2 from discount stores and your Organic 100% Essential Oil?
Essential Oil Essence/Fragrant Oil is available in discount stores for a few dollars - it is predominantly a chemical blend of synthetic essence, which smells like the plant, but is a synthetic compound mixed with a lot of carrier oil. Whilst the smell of these oils might last longer, there is no health benefit in diffusing/breathing this chemical mixture.
Our 100% Organic Essential Oil is a high quality, natural substance with no carrier oil or synthetic properties. As such, there can be many health benefits by diffusing/breathing this oil.
What are the safety issues relating to essential oils?
Essential oils are a natural, yet powerful substance. As a general guide, they are not recommended for use with babies under 3 months - this is not meant to alarm parents, but as their skin, respiratory and lymphatic systems are new and still adjusting to the natural world, allergies or sensitivities may not be known.
Essential oils should never be ingested or applied to the skin undiluted. If swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting and contact the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26.
Keep essential oils out of the reach of children. Store below 30 degrees and out of direct sunlight. Discontinue use if sensitivity occurs.
Health benefits are based on traditional aromatherapy and do not replace professional medical advice. Consult your health care professional for advice on appropriate use and dosage of essential oils.
Can I use just water in the vaporiser?
Yes! Plain tap water will still offer the humidifying, purifying and ionizing benefits, without essential oils. Some customers are sensitive to certain oils, so prefer just tap water in their Aroma Bloom.
Plain water is highly recommended for newborns and babies in their bedroom to create an optimised, humidified sleeping environment. Newborns are Obligate Nasal Breathers, meaning they can only breathe in through their nose for the first 4-6 months of their lives. So keeping the air safely humidified is very beneficial, as the added moisture thins the mucus in the sinuses, making it easier to breathe.
The perfect office accessory - stylish and functional
Counteract the drying effects of airconditioning and the potential for germs and allergens to be spread in a closed environment!
