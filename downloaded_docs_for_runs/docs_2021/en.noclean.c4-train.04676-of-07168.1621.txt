bangalore, iskcon, palace
A fine Sunday!!! Woke up late in the morning and we 3 of us had breakfast at Forum, Transit.
Then we went to Bangalore Palace. The Bangalore Palace was built in the year 1887 by the Wodeyar dynasty. It is built similar to medieval castles in Normandy and England. It’s interiors boasts of elegant woodcarvings and Tudor -style architecture. The building stands in grandeur on palace grounds in the heart of the city. During a trip to England the King, Chamaraja Wodeyar was inspired by Windsor Castle in London, and along similar lines he built this palace in Tudor style. The palace was earlier surrounded by beautiful gardens in the midst of a vast open area, which have reduced considerably today. The structure has fortified towers and its interiors boast of elegant woodcarvings and Tudor-style architecture, complete with Gothic windows, battlements and turrets. This palace, is largely constructed of wood, and is famous for its carving and paintings. An exquisite door panel at the entrance leads to grand settings inside. The construction of this 45,000 sq ft palace cost just over Rs 10 lakh. Reverend Garret originally owned the land, on which the palace rests today. Located between Jayamahal and Sadashivanagar areas, the palace ground has become a venue for various exhibitions, concerts and cultural programs. The palace is truly a case of an architectural splendour. The Bangalore Fort was built by Kempe Gowda and expanded by Tippu Sultan. Within its walls is the well preserved 16th century Ganapathi Temple. Inspired by the Windsor castle, this palace was built complete with Gothic windows, the foiled windows, battlements and turrets resembling the Daria Daulat Palace in Srirangapatanam.
An interesting thing to note is that there exist a present king who lives in Mysore palace and he is a memeber of Parliament and also a fashion designer. These are some of the cool snaps of Bangalore Palace that we took. From outside it looks like this. Just a note for people who are visiting this palace. They charge you extra 500 bucks for using camera and the entry fee for Indian is 100 bucks and foreigners its 200 INR.
The interior of the palace is really awesome. The celing, the wall etc are all designed with gold paintings. They are renovating some of the room though.
These 2 snaps are from the Kings Confrence room (Uti, me and Adriane)
The one below is the seating arrangements in a courtyard.
There is a great dancing room where the royal people dance with their partners during their leisure hours.
The one you see below are real dead elephant trunks that was hunted years ago and some parts of the elephants are used as stools. Check the 2nd snap for stools made of Elephant feet. In the first pic, you can see a real dead head of an elephant.
These are the snaps of the kings who have ruled before and the 1st snap in the 2nd row, is the current king who is more than 50 years old. The second snap has the clocks used by the kings.
The snap below shows the weighing machine and system for measuring heights.
Then we went to handicrafts and jewelers shop to check out Indian gold ornaments.
We then headed to Iskcon temple. This is one of the best temple Iâ€™ve ever been to.
ISKCON temples are dedicated to Lord Krishna and were built by the Hare-Rama Hare-Krishna cult followers. These complexes are elegantly built and are few of the largest temple complexes in India. There are beautiful paintings of Russian artists on the different past times of Radha Krishna, Sita, Ram, Laxman, Hanuman and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Special programmes like Kirtan, Aarti, Pravachan and Prasadam are held every Sunday.
The ISKCON Temple in Bangalore was built recently by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. As you climb the granite steps you will encounter three small shrines before the main temple. The three idols of Lord Krishna in the main shrine are made of brass.
We are not allowed to take snaps of Iskcon temple, but somehow we managed to take one snap.
We bought 3 chains with Ganesha pendants and from the temple we put on each other’s neck as a symbol of friendship and to maintain the friendship for ever.
A snap of Ganesha chains on all 3 of us.
After that we went to Forum shopping mall to see a hindi Movie, Janeman. The german girls wanted to see an Indian movie and also wants to taste Indian food. So, we had a nice time later the night with beer and Indian cusine. They tought me a game called ‘mou’. Its basically a card game.
We didnt sleep the whole night and the next day, they headed to Mysore. Not sure if we will meet anytime, but i am hoping to meet both of them at some point of time.

bangalore, temple
Though i was here in bangalore for more than 2 years, i never had a chance, or may be i should say, i never tried to go see places around. Last week when two german girls came to India, they stayed at my flat and since all 3 of us got along well, we planned to visit different places in bangalore and had lots and loads of fun. I should say, that was one of the best time ever I spent in my life. I really enjoyed their company and here are some of the snaps and details on those.
Bull Temple:
This is one of the oldest temples in Bangalore situated in basavanagudi dedicated to Nandi, the mount of Lord Shiva. Kempe Gowda built this temple in the 16th century. The magnificent Nandi, 15 feet tall and over 20 feet long has been carved out of single granite rock. Farmers offer the first groundnuts to the sacred bull.
Tipu’s Palace:
It is a two-storeyed ornate wooden structure with pillars, arches and balconies flanked by gardens on either sides leading to the palace. The entire structure is built in Teak wood. An inscription on the wooden screen describes the palace as the “Abode of Happiness”. What ever remains of the fort, reminds of the struggle by Tipu against the British. The eastern and western projecting balconies of the upper floor contained the seat of state from where Tipu conducted affairs of the state. The summer palace of Tipu Sultan was built in Bangalore. This palace is beautifully decorated with floral motifs on the walls and ceilings. After the death of Tipu, the British used this building as their secretariat till 1867. In the busy market place of the city are the remnants of this fort built by Tipu.
It is a five minute walk south-west of the Bangalore city market. Few snaps of Tipu’s palace are as follows:
Tipu palace is beautiful, but there is one thing that annoys foreigners and thats this one below:
Because of this, the foreigner girls were pissed off and didnt enter the palace. I have seen many places where they charge extra for foreigners and that really annoys these foreigners.
We then went to have some food at the Pizza hut in Brigades and these are couple of pics that we took from there:
Cubbon Park:
This is one of the best park I have ever been to. Laid out by Lieutenant General Sir Mark Cubbon this park is located near the Vidhan Soudha and has a number of neo-classical styled government buildings. Over 250 acres of this green park is a joggers and walkers delight. This wooded and be flowered park was laid out by Lord Cubbon, the then viceroy of India in the heart of the cantonment in 1864. Since then fairy fountains and an august bandstand have been added. But the most important aspect of Cubbon Park is its newer buildings that have brought it cultural wealth. No one would be surprised if one refers Bangalore as the garden city of India after have a walk at the Cubbon Park. On a grassy expanse in the centre of Bangalore is this park, planned and laid out by Sir Richard Sankey, the then Chief Engineer of Mysore. It is named after Sir Mark Cubbon, Bangalore’s longest serving Commissioner. These are acres of land dedicated to trees, flowerbeds and rolling lawns: which means Cubbon Park has got its fair share of monuments: red-faced government buildings that house the Public Library, the Government Museum and the High Court.
Adriane is going crazy over the dog
So, finally we returned back to our flat in a rickshaw.
It was a great day and three of us enjoyed the places we visited. Tomorrow we are planning to go Bangalore Palace and Iskon Temple.

Last week we had 2 guys from France, another guy from Denmark, another from Iran and 2 girls from Germany (Uti and Adriane) stay at my flat. We met online and allowed them to stay for 3 or 4 days… Its really great to meet new people across the world and get to know each other. All the people that came over were really nice and trust worthy. Thats the main thing, if trust is there, then we can get along well and have fun. I am looking forward to meet more good people around the world. We had a birthday party last week and here are few snaps of those.
Â
Later, our guys were going to a fancy dress party and we dressed up them with whatever costumes we could find around. It was lot of fun. The 1st snap below has Jamie (with mask) from Montana, herad from Iran, Tom from Montana and Martin from Denmark.

Today, saturday, I went for my classes. There wasn’t power at the center and i had to come back to my flat. Spent some time chit chating with Jamie, Tom and Tom’s parents (Jeff and Florence).
Jeff and Florence will be going to Delhi this monday and i was helping them book the tickets and finally when everything was done, I was getting bored. I wanted to do something different today from what i did everyday. Jamie is a good cook, i mean he prepares good delicious food. So, today i joined him and cooked American pan cakes and french toast. This is my first ever cooking experience and i enjoyed it really well.
We had our lunch and then in the evening around 5pm, we went to town/market and showed Jeff and Florence some cool places. Later that evening, we went to a nice Korean restaurant and had bunch of crazy foods. It was delicious and chopsticks were cool. So, basically i enjoyed the day.
Ovarian Cyst

[One of my friend is affected with Ovarian Cyst. So, i just placed this info on my blog]
What are ovaries?
The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus, which is the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a baby grows. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs and female hormones. Hormones are chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs function.
Every month, during the menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary in a process called ovulation. The egg travels from the ovary through the fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovaries are also the main source of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones influence the development of a woman’s breasts, body shape, and body hair. They also regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.
What are ovarian cysts?
A cyst is a fluid-filled sac, and can be located anywhere in the body. On the ovary, different types of cysts can form. The most common type of ovarian cyst is called a functional cyst, which often forms during the normal menstrual cycle. Each month, a woman’s ovaries grow tiny cysts that hold the eggs. When an egg is mature, the sac breaks open to release the egg, so it can travel through the fallopian tube for fertilization. Then the sac dissolves. In one type of functional cyst, called a follicular cyst, the sac doesn’t break open to release the egg and may continue to grow. This type of cyst usually disappears within one to three months. A corpus luteum cyst, another type of functional cyst, forms if the sac doesnâ€™t dissolve. Instead, the sac seals off after the egg is released. Fluid then builds up inside of it. This type of cyst usually goes away on its own after a few weeks. However, it can grow to almost four inches and may bleed or twist the ovary and cause pain. Clomid or Serophene, which are drugs used to induce ovulation, can raise the risk of getting this type of cyst. These cysts are almost never associated with cancer.
There are also other types of cysts:
Endometriomas. These cysts develop in women who have endometriosis, when tissue from the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. The tissue may attach to the ovary and form a growth. These cysts can be painful during sexual intercourse and during menstruation.
Cystadenomas. These cysts develop from cells on the outer surface of the ovary. They are often filled with a watery fluid or thick, sticky gel. They can become large and cause pain.
Dermoid cysts. The cells in the ovary are able to make hair, teeth, and other growing tissues that become part of a forming ovarian cyst. These cysts can become large and cause pain.
Polycystic ovaries. The eggs mature within the follicles, or sacs, but the sac doesn’t break open to release the egg. The cycle repeats, follicles continue to grow inside the ovary, and cysts form. For more information about polycystic ovaries, refer to our FAQ on Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
What are the symptoms of ovarian cysts?
Many women have ovarian cysts without having any symptoms. Sometimes, though, a cyst will cause these problems:
pressure, fullness, or pain in the abdomen
dull ache in the lower back and thighs
problems passing urine completely
pain during sexual intercourse
weight gain
painful menstrual periods and abnormal bleeding
nausea or vomiting
breast tenderness
If you have these symptoms, get help right away:
pain with fever and vomiting
sudden, severe abdominal pain
faintness, dizziness, or weakness
rapid breathing
How are ovarian cysts found?
Since ovarian cysts may not cause symptoms, they are usually found during a routine pelvic exam. During this exam, your doctor is able to feel the swelling of the cyst on your ovary. Once a cyst is found, the doctor may perform an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images of the body. With an ultrasound, the doctor can see how the cyst is shaped; its size and location; and whether itâ€™s fluid-filled, solid, or mixed. A pregnancy test is also done. Hormone levels (such as LH, FSH, estradiol, and testosterone) may also be checked. Your doctor may want to do other tests as well.
To find out if the cyst might be cancerous, your doctor may do a blood test to measure a substance in the blood called CA-125. The amount of this protein is higher if a woman has ovarian cancer. However, some ovarian cancers do not make enough CA-125 to be detected by the test. There are also non-cancerous diseases that increase the levels of CA-125, like uterine fibroids and endometriosis. These non-cancerous causes of increased CA-125 are more common in women under 35, while ovarian cancer is very uncommon in this age group. For this reason, the CA-125 test is recommended mostly for women over age 35, who are at high risk for the disease and have a cyst that is partially solid.
How are cysts treated?
Watchful waiting. The patient waits and gets re-examined in one to three months to see if the cyst has changed in size. This is a common treatment option for women who are in their childbearing years, have no symptoms, and have a fluid-filled cyst. It also might be an option for postmenopausal women.
Surgery. If the cyst doesnâ€™t go away after several menstrual periods, has gotten larger, looks unusual on the ultrasound, causes pain, or youâ€™re postmenopausal, the doctor may want to remove it. There are two main surgical procedures:
Laparoscopyâ€”if the cyst is small and looks benign on the ultrasound, your doctor may perform a laparoscopy. This procedure is done under general anesthesia. A very small incision is made above or below the navel, and a small instrument that acts like a telescope is inserted into the abdomen. If the cyst is small and looks benign, it can be removed.
Laparotomyâ€”if the cyst is large and looks suspicious, the doctor may perform a procedure called a laparotomy. This procedure involves making bigger incisions in the stomach to remove the cyst. While you are under general anesthesia, the doctor is able to have the cyst tested to find out if the tissue is cancerous. If it is cancerous, the doctor may need to remove the ovary and other tissues that may be affected, like the uterus or lymph nodes.
Birth control pills. If you frequently develop cysts, your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to prevent you from ovulating. This will lower the chances of forming new cysts.
Can ovarian cysts be prevented?
Ovarian cysts cannot be prevented. Fortunately, the vast majority of cysts donâ€™t cause any symptoms, are not related to cancer, and go away on their own. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes in your period, pain in the pelvic area, or any of the major symptoms listed above. A pelvic exam, possibly with an ultrasound, can help determine if a cyst is causing the problem. If a woman is not seeking pregnancy and develops functional cysts, frequently, future cysts may be prevented by taking oral contraceptives, Depo-Provera, or Norplant.
When are women most likely to have ovarian cysts?
Functional ovarian cysts usually occur during the childbearing years. Most often, cysts in women of this age group are not cancerous. Women who are past menopause (ages 50-70) with ovarian cysts have a higher risk of ovarian cancer. At any age, if you think you have a cyst, itâ€™s important to tell your doctor.

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)

[One of my close friend is affected with PCOS. So, i just placed this info on my blog]
What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)?
PCOS is a health problem that can affect a womanâ€™s menstrual cycle, fertility, hormones, insulin production, heart, blood vessels, and appearance. Women with PCOS have these characteristics:
high levels of male hormones, also called androgens
an irregular or no menstrual cycle
may or may not have many small cysts in their ovaries. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs.
PCOS is the most common hormonal reproductive problem in women of childbearing age.
How many women have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)?
An estimated five to 10 percent of women of childbearing age have PCOS.
What causes Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)?
No one knows the exact cause of PCOS. Women with PCOS frequently have a mother or sister with PCOS. But there is not yet enough evidence to say there is a genetic link to this disorder. Many women with PCOS have a weight problem. So researchers are looking at the relationship between PCOS and the bodyâ€™s ability to make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the bodyâ€™s use or for storage. Since some women with PCOS make too much insulin, itâ€™s possible that the ovaries react by making too many male hormones, called androgens. This can lead to acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and ovulation problems.
Why do women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) have trouble with their menstrual cycle?
The ovaries are two small organs, one on each side of a woman’s uterus. A woman’s ovaries have follicles, which are tiny sacs filled with liquid that hold the eggs. These sacs are also called cysts. Each month about 20 eggs start to mature, but usually only one becomes dominant. As the one egg grows, the follicle accumulates fluid in it. When that egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release the egg so it can travel through the fallopian tube for fertilization. When the single egg leaves the follicle, ovulation takes place.
In women with PCOS, the ovary doesn’t make all of the hormones it needs for any of the eggs to fully mature. They may start to grow and accumulate fluid. But no one egg becomes large enough. Instead, some may remain as cysts. Since no egg matures or is released, ovulation does not occur and the hormone progesterone is not made. Without progesterone, a womanâ€™s menstrual cycle is irregular or absent. Also, the cysts produce male hormones, which continue to prevent ovulation.
What are the symptoms of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)?
These are some of the symptoms of PCOS:
infrequent menstrual periods, no menstrual periods, and/or irregular bleeding
infertility or inability to get pregnant because of not ovulating
increased growth of hair on the face, chest, stomach, back, thumbs, or toes
acne, oily skin, or dandruff
pelvic pain
weight gain or obesity, usually carrying extra weight around the waist
type 2 diabetes
high cholesterol
high blood pressure
male-pattern baldness or thinning hair
patches of thickened and dark brown or black skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs
skin tags, or tiny excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area
sleep apneaâ€•excessive snoring and breathing stops at times while asleep
What tests are used to diagnose Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)?
There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will take a medical history, perform a physical examâ€”possibly including an ultrasound, check your hormone levels, and measure glucose, or sugar levels, in the blood. If you are producing too many male hormones, the doctor will make sure itâ€™s from PCOS. At the physical exam the doctor will want to evaluate the areas of increased hair growth, so try to allow the natural hair growth for a few days before the visit. During a pelvic exam, the ovaries may be enlarged or swollen by the increased number of small cysts. This can be seen more easily by vaginal ultrasound, or screening, to examine the ovaries for cysts and the endometrium. The endometrium is the lining of the uterus. The uterine lining may become thicker if there has not been a regular period.
How is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) treated?
Because there is no cure for PCOS, it needs to be managed to prevent problems. Treatments are based on the symptoms each patient is having and whether she wants to conceive or needs contraception. Below are descriptions of treatments used for PCOS.
Birth control pills. For women who donâ€™t want to become pregnant, birth control pills can regulate menstrual cycles, reduce male hormone levels, and help to clear acne. However, the birth control pill does not cure PCOS. The menstrual cycle will become abnormal again if the pill is stopped. Women may also think about taking a pill that only has progesterone, like Provera, to regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent endometrial problems. But progesterone alone does not help reduce acne and hair growth.
Diabetes Medications. The medicine, Metformin, also called Glucophage, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, also helps with PCOS symptoms. Metformin affects the way insulin regulates glucose and decreases the testosterone production. Abnormal hair growth will slow down and ovulation may return after a few months of use. These medications will not cause a person to become diabetic.
Fertility Medications. The main fertility problem for women with PCOS is the lack of ovulation. Even so, her husbandâ€™s sperm count should be checked and her tubes checked to make sure they are open before fertility medications are used. Clomiphene (pills) and Gonadotropins (shots) can be used to stimulate the ovary to ovulate. PCOS patients are at increased risk for multiple births when using these medications. In vitro Fertilization (IVF) is sometimes recommended to control the chance of having triplets or more. Metformin can be taken with fertility medications and helps to make PCOS women ovulate on lower doses of medication.
Medicine for increased hair growth or extra male hormones. If a woman is not trying to get pregnant there are some other medicines that may reduce hair growth. Spironolactone is a blood pressure medicine that has been shown to decrease the male hormoneâ€™s effect on hair. Propecia, a medicine taken by men for hair loss, is another medication that blocks this effect. Both of these medicines can affect the development of a male fetus and should not be taken if pregnancy is possible. Other non-medical treatments such as electrolysis or laser hair removal are effective at getting rid of hair. A woman with PCOS can also take hormonal treatment to keep new hair from growing.
Surgery. Although it is not recommended as the first course of treatment, surgery called ovarian drilling is available to induce ovulation. The doctor makes a very small incision above or below the navel, and inserts a small instrument that acts like a telescope into the abdomen. This is called laparoscopy. The doctor then punctures the ovary with a small needle carrying an electric current to destroy a small portion of the ovary. This procedure carries a risk of developing scar tissue on the ovary. This surgery can lower male hormone levels and help with ovulation. But these effects may only last a few months. This treatment doesn’t help with increased hair growth and loss of scalp hair.
A healthy weight. Maintaining a healthy weight is another way women can help manage PCOS. Since obesity is common with PCOS, a healthy diet and physical activity help maintain a healthy weight, which will help the body lower glucose levels, use insulin more efficiently, and may help restore a normal period. Even loss of 10% of her body weight can help make a woman’s cycle more regular.
How does Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) affect a woman while pregnant?
There appears to be a higher rate of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, and premature delivery in women with PCOS. Researchers are studying how the medicine, metformin, prevents or reduces the chances of having these problems while pregnant, in addition to looking at how the drug lowers male hormone levels and limits weight gain in women who are obese when they get pregnant.
No one yet knows if metformin is safe for pregnant women. Because the drug crosses the placenta, doctors are concerned that the baby could be affected by the drug. Research is ongoing.
Does Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) put women at risk for other conditions?
Women with PCOS can be at an increased risk for developing several other conditions. Irregular menstrual periods and the absence of ovulation cause women to produce the hormone estrogen, but not the hormone progesterone. Without progesterone, which causes the endometrium to shed each month as a menstrual period, the endometrium becomes thick, which can cause heavy bleeding or irregular bleeding. Eventually, this can lead to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Women with PCOS are also at higher risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Getting the symptoms under control at an earlier age may help to reduce this risk.
Does Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) change at menopause?
Researchers are looking at how male hormone levels change as women with PCOS grow older. They think that as women reach menopause, ovarian function changes and the menstrual cycle may become more normal. But even with falling male hormone levels, excessive hair growth continues, and male pattern baldness or thinning hair gets worse after menopause.

My likes & dislikes about Bangalore
10 Tuesday Oct 2006
Posted by controllingurges in General
≈ 1 Comment
I went to a post office in Bangalore today and i was really shocked that people sitting there were not able to understand English. They were asking me in their local language “Kannada” and i didnt understand a single word they said. Its really difficult in almost all government offices in Bangalore (may be its the same in other south Indian states to talk to others if you dont know the local language and moreover they take advantage of us not knowing the local language. I have faced the same problem when i went to Police station to get a foreigner friend register and also when i went to a government office to apply for VAT. Though Bangalore is known as the IT Capital of India, its funny that government guys hardly know to speak English. So, i always take my office boy whenever I go to any government office so that he can translate all what i say. Otherwise, i’ll have to learn the local language which i think is really hard.
Couple of the things i like about Bangalore is the climate, variety of restaurants. You get European, Koran, Chinese etc. You name it, you have it and yeah! its expensive though, atleast for Indians. Other good things about bangalore is that you can hang out in night clubs, shopping malls etc and I really love window shopping. The night life is not that interesting since the clubs closes by 11:30 or 12 am. Thats all due to political violence and also so much of theft going around.
What I hate about Bangalore is the roads and traffic. I can understand that with the city traffic and population growing exponentially it is difficult for the traffic department to keep pace with it, but the city has been growing for the last ten years and there doesn’t seem to be a concerted effort to ease the congestion in a systematic and a long-term plan for this is non-existent. I feel that the problem is due to two main reasons: bad road design & infrastructure and poor implementation of traffic rules. The traffic is excruciatingly slow-moving in the morning office hours and also in the evening. We call bangalore the IT capital of India and the road to ITPL at the mouth of the railway station is crazy. Add to it the U-turn provided right at that point. Had the road been a tad straighter, the life of the road users would have been a lot better. General public do not have any respect or fear of the cops and thus flout rules blatantly. The fault lies with the Police being very prone to taking bribes instead of imposing heavy fines on the defaulters, thereby losing respect and credibility.
Your Dream Begins Today by Les Brown

What will your life be like when you’ve achieved your most deeply held dreams? Let’s take a look at how you can start living your dreams this very day.
Do you have a dream, a vision of the life you wish to live?
How specific is that dream?
How clear is that vision?
How do you intend to reach it?
What obstacles stand in your way?
Are your fears holding you back or are you using them to move you forward?
Your fears can actually lead you to success. Fear is an intense emotion. But that doesn’t mean it has to control you, or even stop you. Fear can prepare you and push you forward just as strongly as it can hold you back. Fear heightens your awareness and increases your physical strength. Fear brings your mind to sharp focus. With all that going for you, does it make sense to just run and hide? Of course not. Fear gets you in shape to take action!
Are you waiting for things to get better before moving ahead? If you’re serious about success; you need to start taking action today. If you’re waiting for things to be perfect, you’ll wait forever and nothing will ever get done. The way to achieve is to bloom where you’re planted, to do what you can, where you are, with what you have. It’s easy to think up excuses for not taking action. “If only I had more hours in the day. If only I had a better job. If only I could meet the right person.” But excuses won’t bring you anything of value. You’ve got to change your “if only” into an “I will.” “I will make better use of my time. I will work on improving my career. I will create and nurture my relationships.” Take a chance. Have faith in yourself. Your circumstances will improve when you make the effort to improve them. Start where you are right now. You have everything it takes to reach for whatever you desire. Stop wishing. Use your time, your energy, your thoughts and efforts to make it happen! You’ll be glad you did!
"Sentenced to Success" by Chris Widener

I once heard a speaker use the statement, “I have been sentenced to success!” I heard that almost twenty years ago, yet it still sticks in my head.
Imagine that. What if we had been given a life sentence to serve, say 75 years, and the sentence was to do time in a place called “Success”? The truth is that we have.
Let me back up. We have been given a life sentence. But, unlike a sentencing in a real life courtroom, we get to actually choose where we will “do our time.”
Here are some of the choices people make:
The prison of poverty.
Poor people are no better or kinder or anything else than people with money. People are people regardless of how much money they have. Frankly, I have had little and I have had a lot, and yes, I will choose having a lot! When you choose to live in poverty you are in a prison that does not allow you the freedoms we were intended to experience. We are unable to help others as we desire. My advice? Don’t choose a sentence to the prison of poverty.
The prison of depression.
Depression is like a blanket that overwhelms you and eventually smothers you. Now before you go accusing me with, “Chris. You just don’t understand.” Yes I do. I have had a history of depression. Depression is rampant in my family of origin. I know firsthand what a prison depression is. When you are locked up in depression you cannot live life as it was intended. But you can get out! My advice? Don’t choose a sentence to the prison of depression.
The prison of the lack of health.
Lacking health is a real pain! The freedom we lose when we choose to live in a state of a lack of health is terrible – and unnecessary! We don’t have to live in that prison. We can choose a different sentence! We can choose health! My advice? Don’t choose a sentence to the prison of the lack of health.
The prison of doubt, worry, and fear.
This is a dark, dark prison. It is one that haunts you the whole time you reside there. It makes you believe that the surroundings are worse than the really are. It keeps you from enjoying life and becoming the kind of person you were intended to become! My advice? Don’t choose a sentence to the prison of poverty. My advice? Don’t choose a sentence to the prison of doubt, worry and fear.
There is another option. You can choose to be sentenced to success! You can choose to actually be set free! You can choose to walk out of that courtroom and live the life that you choose!
What can you experience when you are sentenced to success? How about these:
Good health
Financial abundance
Emotional freedom
Positive relationships
A career you love
Spiritual liberty
And how will you experience these? By choice. Your choice. You choose exactly what kind of life you will live. You choose the sentence you will serve here on earth and the experience that you have.
Will you languish in a dark prison or in the open freedom that comes from the sentence of success? That depends on the choices you make.
I challenge you to choose this day to:
Pursue financial independence
Develop yourself spiritually
Make a change so you are in a career you love
Re-commit yourself to loving relationships
Achieve emotional health
Make a choice TODAY. Do not spend another day in a prison where you do not belong!
Where will you serve your sentence? You get to decide.
As for me?
I have been sentenced to success!
I am going crazy!!!

Today is saturday. Slept till 9am and woke up with a bad headache. May be coz i slept late last night and was with my laptop the whole time. Today I had my first Router labs till 12 noon. Just finished watching a movie “The Family Stone” (A good comedy one). Coke after coke!!! I think i am addicted to coke now. Have to fill my stomach now! May be a pizza might help. Oh! btw, today i walked on the railings of a 5 storeyed building. I think I was bored. May be i’ll hit the bed again and sleep for the rest of the day. Not feeling like doing anything. Or, may be I’ll just try to walk upside down on my hand. Or if I want to go more crazier, I’ll watch the cartoon “SouthPark”. That’s the best cartoon I have ever seen.
