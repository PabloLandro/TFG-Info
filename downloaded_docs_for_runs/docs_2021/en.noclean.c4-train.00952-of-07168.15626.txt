Tumeric: If you have Inflammation, don't forget the Tumeric
I love some on and off routine with NSAIDs, 5 days on and 2 days off, or 10 days on 4 days off. During the off days, many of my patients have been doubling up on the icing and adding Tumeric. Some are just switching to tumeric for all their anti-inflammatory needs. Make sure you read about it, especially side-effects or contra-indications before taking. Rich

You have a very useful blog. Few people really discuss this problem in detail. Thanks that are not afraid to tell and show all that is connected with diseases of feet and fingernails and describe the decision of a problem.
