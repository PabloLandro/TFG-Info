BEST MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTS FOR MIGRAINES
Migraines are severe headaches that are often accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomitingand sensitivity to light or sound, and vision disturbances.
Unfortunately, there's absolutely no definitive treatment for migraines (although many have had success with food sensitivity testing), so therapy is usually focused on reducing the number of strikes and managing symptoms.
Medications, like over-the-counter painkillers and prescription medications, are frequently utilised to cure and prevent migraines, but herbal treatments are becoming more popular.
One promising option for those seeking natural migraine relief is always to try magnesium supplements. The most common complication from magnesium supplementation is moderate nausea that will get worse with high doses (2). This is because unabsorbed magnesium serves as an osmotic laxative, pulling extra water in your digestive tract and cutting your feces (69). But, diarrhea seems to be the sole possible adverse impact from taking more than that amount. No evidence has shown any negative effects from magnesium supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding, therefore the UL is the same for elderly women (2). There's a higher risk of toxicity for people with impaired kidney function, therefore it is important to ask your doctor before deciding to take supplements (2). Overall, taking calcium supplements carries a very low risk for most people. For people who suffer with migraines, magnesium supplements might be a safe and inexpensive alternative to drugs. Magnesium oxide is the most widely used magnesium for migraine prevention, but it is not well-absorbed and induces diarrhea in many individuals. Undesirable side effects like nausea can be prevented by taking a few, smaller doses (200-300 mg per day ) through the day. But supplements aren't the sole response. If you're willing to make adjustments to your diet, obtaining your calcium through food can also be effective. It's important to not forget that magnesium is only one possible treatment for migraines. Normally, migraines have over only one cause, therefore it is unlikely that a single treatment will completely remove your symptoms.
