Researchers might have found a new way to help manage asthma.
A recent double-blind study took a look at whether vitamin D could help those suffering from asthma. The results showed that vitamin D reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbation for those with mild or moderate asthma.
Asthma is a chronic disease that inflames the airways, according to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology . The disease can be triggered by various things to further swollen the airways making it difficult to breath.
Vitamin D is produced when the sun hits the skin and promotes calcium absorption, according to the National Institutes of Health . The vitamin also helps build bones among other perks. Vitamin D is in very few foods but can be taken as a dietary supplement.
The research published by the Cochran Database of Systematic Reviews concludes that vitamin D likely offers protection against severe asthma attacks. The study tested 435 children and 658 adults and the study compared vitamin D to a placebo.
The study ranged from four to 12 months.
