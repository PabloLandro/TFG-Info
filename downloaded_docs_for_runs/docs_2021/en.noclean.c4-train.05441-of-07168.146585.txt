Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Pro Ankle
Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Pro Ankle Pro is the new viscoelastic ankle brace by Bauerfeind. The Viscoelastic insert is provided with soft, proprioceptive stimulating nodules on the inside as well as longitudinal grooves.
The upper third tendon and the muscle-tendon transition with the related operating "nerve endings" (place receptors) are stimulated by 2 wing-like inserts. The short knit section in the foot area prevents pressure points on the fifth metatarsal bones.
Knitted with integrated stretch zone in the ventral tibia area
Makes it easier for the patient to apply and remove the support
If needed, a heel lift with a shock absorbing heel cushion is recommended
Active support is anatomically knitted to provide an excellent fit & is very comfortable to wear
Viscoelastic insert incorporated for relief of Achilles Tendonitis
Provides peak shock load reduction to joints & vertebral column with both heel cushions in place
Lightweight, breathable knit will not retain heat and is completely machine washable
Indications
Painful irritations to the Achilles (tendonitis, paratendonitis, bursitis)
Postoperative, for example following chronic diseases of the achilles tendon/ligaments
Haglund's Deformity
Post Achilles rupture
Goals
Increase activity
Provide ankle compression
Delay surgery
Decrease anti-inflammatory medications
Decrease ankle pain symptoms
Reduce ankle swelling
Improve quality of life
