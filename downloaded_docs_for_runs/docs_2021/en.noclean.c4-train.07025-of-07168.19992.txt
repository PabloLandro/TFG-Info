2000 CIT grafts after 28 months - Results
Hair Transplant
mwinston 2007-12-13 15:07:20 UTC #1
5 years ago, this Norwood 4 had a strip hair transplant procedure performed at a well known clinic before choosing CIT (Cole Isolation Technique) to improve naturalness on the front and fill balding areas. The area on the top of the scalp initially had hair growing in it from the strip procedure, but later became completely bald. The loss of hair in this area was correlated with the application of topical combination of Minoxidil and Retin A. The patient noted that the area gradually became irritated and red with the development of a crust. Scarring alopecias can produce skin changes and hair loss similar to this, but one often is not able to get additional grafts to grow in the area of scared skin. These combinations of Minoxidil and Retin A can be quite irritating to the skin. There is no strong evidence that Retin A adds any additional benefit to the Minoxidil. This patient later discontinued using the combinantion of Minoxidil with Retin A and later peeled the scab off. The area was left without hair and the skin had the appearance of scar tissue. Another contributing factor for this patient’s need of CIT hair transplant method was the lower donor density due to strip surgery from the past. Beginning in 2005, the IHTI surgical staff successfully transplanted 2000 CIT grafts to treat this patients’ hair loss. The treatment plan consisted of three smaller CIT sessions to achieve ideal coverage on the receded areas. This patient noted growth within just two months after his first procedure which in not uncommon as all hairs do not grow at the same rate. The results after 28 months can be seen below as well as images of a satisfied patient.

OMG, RetinA can do that to your scalp??? It looked like his scalped was burnt.

yeah. I hear that it isn’t FDA approved for helping scalp conditions or scalp hair. Luckily this guy was able to restore the bald spot! Who told him it was good with Minoxidil?
Anyway, Outstanding results…

Very nice growth on the scar! Further confirmation that transplanted hair grows on scar tissue.
Thanks for sharing it CIT

Carrot,
You are welcome anytime. I wish all patients’ results could be public information. It is very liberating for viewers and patients to see positive information release into the community. I hope that we are making a difference in people’s lives.

I am 99.99% convinced that his hair loss was due to Retin-A and had NOTHING to do with application of minoxidil. I had a similar (but not as drastic) experience with Remox. I applied it for nearly a month. My scalp became beet red and highly irritated. My scalp oozed a clear liquid. I lost a dramatic amount of hair some of which grew back. I am certain it was the Retin-A because I have been using minoxidil for over a decade with no problems whatsoever.
This should serve as a warning to those thinking about using Remox. At the very FIRST sign of irritation - STOP USING IT or you WILL regret it. Some people are unaffected by Retin-A and claim that it really helped.

Yeah. It needs to be more clear in the cautions that discontinuing the application is recommended if you experience redness with irritation. Otherwise, you will ruin a hair transplant.

Thanks Jimmy,
I have included this patient’s pre-op and follow-up photos along with other pre-op images of the frontal scalp. You may see that the strip surgery completed prior to his CIT treatment was noticeably apparent. Several patients come from clinics that make them prime candidates for CIT. The concern of patients prior to treatment is compromising their donor supply. This patient is happy and can return to us in the future if necessary.

That is scary. You mean using Remox can lead to scars.

Arun,
This patient used Retin-A which caused the irritation. This patient seemed to have been chemically burned then scarred and loss the previously transplanted hair occurred as well.

I used retinA for scarring on my skin if memory serves. That stuff irritated the hec outta my skin. I can only image what prolonged contact with it might do to a scalp. All things considered, He is really looking good. Even better if the previous strip wasn’t so noticeable. Sucks!
