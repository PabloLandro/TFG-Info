Ankle Injury
posterior tibial tendon dysfunction
The posterior tibial tendon (PTTD) runs behind the inside bump on the ankle (the medial malleolus), across the instep, and attaches to the bottom of the foot. This is a common tendonitis injury and is caused by poor biomechanics and tight muscles groups. Read more->
peroneal tendonitis
One of the main injuries that affects the outside of the ankle. Pain is similar to that of PTTD and is felt when going on to tip-toe. The peroneal tendon becomes swollen and inflamed and painful to the touch. Read more->
Ankle sprains
The most common ankle injury. Most often caused by an inversion injury (where foot rolls inwards). Worn footwear, uneven terrain and poor biomechanics are the leading reasons for ankle during sport. Read more->
Chronic ankle pain
When an athlete sustains repeated injuries to the ankle usually in the form of repetitive sprains, Scar tissue and weakness develops, causing pain and instability. It is treatable but usually extra ankle support is required when running. Read more->
Anterior ankle impingement
Ankle impingement is caused by the joint capsule around the ankle being ‘pinched’ during sporting activity, usually between the bones of the lower leg and the foot. It is an uncommon ankle injury but when it does occur it is extremely painful. Read more->
Retro calcaneal bursitis
Retro calcaneal bursitis is a swelling of the fluid filled sac that sits at the back of the calcaneus (heel bone), deep to the Achilles. The Achilles. tendon itself isn’t painful but if the deeper structures are squeezed the it can be particularly tender. Read more->
os trigonum
Is an anatomical protrusion of bone that grows on the back of the heel bone. This can irritate the soft tissue structures at the back of the ankle causing pain. It is one of the less common injuries of the ankle and is diagnosed by x-ray. Read more->
Achilles tendinopathy
This is the most common of the injuries affecting the back of the ankle. The Achilles tendon becomes swollen and inflamed and if left untreated is at increased risk of rupture. Worn foot wear and poor biomechanics are the major cause of this problem. Read more->
