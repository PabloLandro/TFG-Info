Foods high in magnesium
3-minute read
Listen
Magnesium is essential for healthy muscles, nerves, bones and blood sugar levels. Many foods contain the mineral, but the main sources of magnesium in Australia are cereals and non-alcoholic drinks like coffee and water.
Why is magnesium important for your health?
Magnesium is important for many processes in the body. It is needed for your muscles and nerves to work properly, to keep your blood sugar and blood pressure at the right level, and to make protein, bone, and DNA.
People who have more magnesium in their diets have a lower risk of a heart attack or stroke and of developing type 2 diabetes. They are also likely to have a higher bone mineral density, meaning they are at lower risk of developing osteoporosis.
If you don’t have enough magnesium in your body, you might have symptoms such as headaches, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. Very severe magnesium deficiency can cause numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, and an abnormal heart rhythm.
How much magnesium do I need?
Men need 420 milligrams (mg) of magnesium per day and women need 320mg each day. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, however, need more than that.
The recommended daily intake for children, in mg is:
1-3 years: 80mg
4-8 years: 130mg
9-13 years: 240mg
boys 14-18 years: 410mg
girls 14-18 years: 360mg
What are the best sources of magnesium?
Many foods and drinks contain magnesium. As a general rule, foods that are high in fibre provide magnesium. Some good sources of the mineral include leafy green vegetables – such as spinach – legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains.
Tap, mineral, and bottled waters can also be sources of magnesium, but how much magnesium they contain depends on the brand.
You can get magnesium from the following foods:
almonds, 30g (80mg of magnesium)
spinach, boiled, ½ cup (78mg)
cashews, 30g (74mg)
peanuts, ¼ (63mg)
soymilk, 1 cup (61mg)
oatmeal, 1 cup cooked (6 mg)
bread, whole wheat, 2 slices (46mg)
avocado, cubed, 1 cup (44mg)
rice, brown, cooked, ½ cup (42mg)
milk, 1 cup (24mg)
Should I take magnesium supplements?
Most young children in Australia get enough magnesium, but more than 6 in 10 men and 7 in 10 women don’t get enough magnesium every day.
People who are especially at risk of not getting enough magnesium are people with diseases like Crohn’s disease and coeliac disease, people with type 2 diabetes, older people and people who have alcoholism.
If you have a magnesium deficiency or certain health problems, your doctor may recommend you take a magnesium supplement. Health problems that can be helped by taking a magnesium supplement include constipation, indigestion, high blood pressure during pregnancy, irregular heartbeat, asthma, cerebral palsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, headaches and osteoporosis.
You can’t get too much magnesium from your food, but it is important not to take more than the recommended dose of a magnesium supplement. Having too much magnesium from a supplement can cause diarrhoea, nausea, and stomach cramps.
Magnesium supplements can interfere with other medicines you may be taking, including antibiotics, diuretics and medicines for acid reflux or stomach ulcers. It’s always important to tell your doctor or pharmacist about any supplements or over the counter medicines you are taking.

Magnesium for muscle cramps | Cochrane
Muscle cramps are common and can occur in a wide range of settings. Older adults and pregnant women commonly complain of leg cramps while they are resting, athletes can cramp when they are pushing the limits of their endurance, and some people develop muscle cramps as a symptom of other medical conditions. One potential treatment that is already being marketed to prevent muscle cramps is magnesium supplementation. Magnesium is a common mineral in our diets and extra oral supplements of this mineral are available either over the Internet or in health food stores and pharmacies (usually in the form of tablets or powders to be dissolved in water). We searched for all high quality published studies evaluating the effectiveness of magnesium to prevent muscle cramps and found four studies in older adults and three studies in pregnant women. There were no studies of people who cramp while exercising and no studies on people who cramp because of underlying medical problems. The four studies in older adults (a total of 322 participants including controls in cross-over studies) collectively suggest that magnesium is unlikely to provide a meaningful benefit in reducing the frequency or severity of cramps in that population. We consider this evidence to be of moderate quality. In contrast, the three studies in pregnant women (202 participants) are collectively inconclusive since one study found benefit in reducing both cramp frequency and cramp pain while the other two found no benefit. More research on magnesium in pregnant women is needed; however, older adult cramp sufferers appear unlikely to benefit from this therapy. While we could not determine the rate of unwanted side effects, the study withdrawal rates and adverse event discussions suggest the treatment is well tolerated.

Oral magnesium supplementation for high blood pressure in adults | Cochrane
This review examined whether taking magnesium supplements could be recommended for treating adults with high blood pressure from no known cause. It reviewed 12 trials enrolling 545 people, which compared magnesium supplementation with a dummy drug (placebo) or no treatment, and measured blood pressure 8 weeks to 6 months later. The results of trials varied a lot: some trials found magnesium lowered blood pressure much more than placebo, while others found little difference between magnesium and placebo. On average, people receiving extra magnesium achieved slightly lower diastolic blood pressure at the end of trials. None of the studies reported any serious side effects of taking magnesium supplements.

Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression | Cochrane
Postnatal depression is a common condition that affects women and may impact on their babies. Common symptoms of postnatal depression include fluctuations in mood, mood changes, suicidal ideation and preoccupation with infant well-being ranging from over-concern to frank delusions. There is currently not much evidence regarding interventions that might prevent or treat postnatal depression. A diet lacking in certain vitamins, minerals or other nutrients may cause postnatal depression in some women. Correcting this deficiency with dietary supplements might therefore prevent postnatal depression. Examples of possible dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include omega-3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s-adenosyl-L-methionine, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), B6 (pyridoxine), B2 (riboflavin), vitamin D and calcium.

Vitamin B6 and magnesium in combination for children with autism spectrum disorder | Cochrane
Studies investigating the effect of vitamin B6 in improving the behaviour of children with autism spectrum disorder have been reported for over three decades. The purpose of this review was to summarize those studies and analyse the effectiveness of vitamin B6 as an intervention. Only three studies met the inclusion criteria of this review and of these only one study reported adequate data for analysis. Results were inconclusive and sample sizes were small. Therefore the use of vitamin B6 for improving the behaviour of individuals with autism cannot currently be supported. Further research using larger, well-designed trials is needed.

Probiotics for preventing preterm labour | Cochrane
Being born early (before 37 weeks) or very early (before 34 weeks) can cause severe health problems for babies, and worry and anxiety for parents. Women who go into labour too soon often have an infection and it is thought that this is what stimulates labour. Normally the vagina has a layer of friendly micro-organisms, which prevent harmful organisms from growing. Sometimes the balance is upset and harmful organisms can start to grow. Probiotics are friendly live micro-organisms which are used to displace the harmful ones, and can be found in Lactobacillus preparations and yogurts containing live cultures. They can be taken by mouth or put into the vagina. The review of trials looked at the use of probiotics to try to prevent early labour and birth. The review found three trials involving 344 women; two trial used probiotics given by mouth and the other looked at using probiotics in the vagina. The studies were too small to look at effectiveness for preventing early labour and birth, but probiotics given vaginally reduced the number of harmful bacteria. Further research is needed.

Fermented milk for hypertension | Cochrane
High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure.
