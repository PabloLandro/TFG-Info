One Super Important Fact:
If you want to get rid of the pain and heal your Achilles Tendonitis, you can't simply rely on a support brace. You need to use cold compression for the pain and stimulate blood flow to heal the damaged tissue. A basic support brace can't do this.
How to Heal Your Achilles Tendonitis
Achilles Tendonitis is caused by overuse of the Achilles Tendon. If the stress on your Achilles Tendon continues, you could cause it to tear or rupture. Stop doing the activity that caused your Achilles Tendonitis to develop.
It's important to understand that you need to rest your Achilles in order to heal. You may want to consider using crutches to help keep the weight off your injured ankle. While rest will definitely help you avoid re-injury, you will also need to treat the condition itself. We have the products you need to stop the pain and speed the healing of your Achilles Tendonitis. These products are the BFST® and ColdCure® Achilles Wraps.
Surgery for Achilles Tendonitis should only be considered as a last resort. If you have a complete Achilles Tendon tear, you may need surgery to repair it. If you do undergo surgery, use our ColdCure® and BFST® Achilles Wraps to accelerate the healing process post-surgery.
The Ultimate Healing Solution:
If you really want to get better, here's exactly what you need to do
Wear a ColdCure® Wrap as much as possible to relieve your pain and swelling and protect your Achilles Tendon from further damage.
Do a BFST® treatment first thing every morning. Do 2 or 3 more BFST® treatments throughout the day. This will help you heal quickly.
Avoid re-straining the injury as much as possible. Using KB Support Tape can help with this. Giving your ankle a rest is hard, but it is very important in the early stages of healing your Achilles Tendon.
Do this and your Achilles Tendon can truly heal - Finally.
The Treatment Process
If you want to heal your Achilles Tendonitis as quickly as possible and return to your regular activities, use the ColdCure® and BFST® Achilles Wraps. Start with the ColdCure® Achilles Wrap first. ColdCure® treatments will relieve the pain and swelling in your Achilles. This will take 2 to 10 days depending on the severity of your injury.
Once your pain and swelling has subsided, start using the BFST® Wrap. BFST® treatments will work to heal your damaged Achilles Tendon by promoting blood flow to the area of your injury. Treatments are simple and easy: plug the device in, turn it on, and rest. Each treatment is 20 minutes and the effects last for up to 4 hours, so even when your treatment is over, your injury is still receiving the benefits afterwards. That's why it's best to spread your treatments out over the course of your day. This way you'll be receiving optimal blood flow all day long.
To avoid re-injury between ColdCure® and BFST® treatments, apply KB Support Tape to your Achilles. It provides extra support, protection and compression whenever you need it, to keep you moving and active throughout your daily activities.
Blood Flow is Essential for Healing
We have the treatment you need to heal your Achilles Tendonitis. Many treatments out there only address the pain and not the underlying condition causing that pain. Blood Flow Stimulation Therapy (BFST®) stimulates blood flow in the area of injury to actively heal your damaged tissue. Stop wasting your time and money on treatments that don't give you any lasting results. You can heal your Achilles Tendonitis with BFST®.
Blood flow is the most critical element in rapid recovery. Unfortunately, when your Achilles Tendon is injured, blood flow to the area is greatly reduced. When you're not getting adequate blood flow to the injured area, the healing process slows down. In order to get blood flowing in the body, we would normally do some kind of physical activity. When we're injured, however, physical activity can cause further damage. The BFST® Wrap solves this problem by allowing you to rest your injury while receiving the blood flow you need to heal quickly and completely.
BFST® Devices are Electrical Medical Appliances that
actively stimulate blood flow in injured tissue.
BFST® devices are designed to promote rapid healing.
Achilles BFST® Wrap
The BFST® Wrap is not just another support brace - it's designed to heal soft tissue injuries by promoting blood flow to the injured area. The BFST® Achilles Wrap stimulates blood flow throughout the entire back of your ankle to create an ideal environment for healing. The high-quality, healthy blood flow the BFST® Wrap promotes is what works to speed up the healing process, so regular BFST® treatments are required if you want to heal as quickly as possible.
BFST® treatments are very pleasant and relaxing. People often notice a slight tingling sensation and warmth deep in their Achilles as the BFST® Wrap starts increasing their blood flow. Since we recommend that you spread out your treatments, an ideal treatment regimen would be: one treatment first thing in the morning, another treatment in the afternoon, a treatment in the evening, and the last treatment of the day right before you go to bed.
Avoiding re-injury is fundamental to rapid recovery, which is why the reminder of the injury is so important. Without the reminder of your injury, you put yourself at risk of feeling a false sense of ability and making your condition worse by overdoing it. Wear your BFST® Wrap between treatments to act as a reminder of your injury. This will also help to protect and support your Achilles while you're not doing treatments. Avoiding re-injury goes a long way towards shortening your recovery time.
Dealing with Pain
Achilles Tendonitis can be extremely painful and debilitating that it causes us to rely heavily on painkillers. It's important to understand that while painkillers can be helpful, they can be dangerous to take when you're being active. Painkillers completely block the pain signal, making you unaware of any further damage you could be doing to your ankle. Painkillers (anti-inflammatories) should be restricted to times of rest. Typical pain medications actually interfere with the healing process. Cortisone injections are used in extreme cases to mask the pain, but these too are intended to only address the pain. They do not promote healing of the injury and they only put you at a very high risk of further injury.
When it comes to painkillers, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) are much more effective than analgesics (like acetaminophen), because ibuprofen works to relieve the pain as well as the inflammation, while analgesics will only address the pain. To maximize healing and minimize pain and swelling, do a BFST® treatment right before bed, then take an ibuprofen-based NSAID. The BFST® treatment will work to aid healing while you sleep, and the ibuprofen will work to relieve the pain and inflammation, so you experience a more restful sleep.
During the day, ColdCure® treatments will continue to reduce your inflammation and relieve your pain while you're active. Use the ColdCure® Wrap any time you are experiencing visible swelling and/or significant pain. This could be immediately upon injury or during a flare-up of swelling and/or pain. You should also do a ColdCure® treatment immediately after any physical activity that involves heavy use of your feet (ex. exercising, or even just walking).
ColdCure® Devices Reduce Pain and Swelling
ColdCure® Devices are NOT typical ice or cold packs.
Achilles ColdCure® Wrap
Cold and compression together provide the ultimate treatment of pain, swelling and inflammation. Nothing is more effective. ColdCure® Wraps provide firm, even cold compression for superior treatment of Achilles Tendonitis. In order for it to work as quickly as possible, the cold and compression needs to be uniform and complete, and ColdCure® Wraps provide exactly that.
The ColdCure® Wrap can be applied to your Achilles for much longer durations than other cold products because, when stored in the fridge, our gel packs pose no risk of freezing your skin and underlying tissue. ColdCure® is a safer, more effective alternative to other cold products. Since the ColdCure® Wrap can be worn for extended periods, you get faster relief of pain and swelling.
The ColdCure® Achilles Wrap and gel packs are specially designed for the shape of the back of the ankle. This is to ensure you get complete coverage of the entire painful area. The gel packs are inserted inside a soft, stretchy neoprene wrap that conforms comfortably to your Achilles. The Achilles Wrap comes with three swappable cold packs that contain our unique gel formula that stays in place to treat your injury, even under heavy pressure. The gel is soft and flexible but won't move away from your injury. Use the gel packs one at a time, keeping the other two in the freezer so you can swap them out to keep your therapy going. Three gel packs means you can keep doing treatments for as long as you need.
Protect Your Achilles Between Treatments
When you're not doing treatments with your BFST® or ColdCure® Wrap, your injured tissue is vulnerable to further damage. You don't want to re-injure your fragile tissue and make your Achilles Tendonitis worse. Apply KB Support Tape between your BFST® and ColdCure® treatments to provide your Achilles with support and protection.
Our skin is soft and elastic and can stretch much more than the tissue underneath. When you apply KB Support Tape to your skin, it becomes a much more rigid surface than before, serving to limit how much the skin can stretch. The Tape makes your skin a source of outside support to hold your tissue in place, helping you avoid re-injury. That's why we call it Armor For Your Injury.
KB Support Tape - Use All Day During Work & Play
KB Tape
KB Support Tape provides your Achilles with ongoing compression to relieve your swelling throughout the day. It also prevents re-injury by providing support and protection for your injured tissue. You can wear it during all of your daily activities and it won't get in the way.
KB Support Tape comes in 2 styles: Pre-Cut Strips and a Continuous Roll. These styles also come in 4 different colors: Pink, Blue, Black & Beige. There's no functional difference between the colors, they just allow you to express your personal style.
The Pre-Cut Strips of KB Support Tape are ideal for people who want to use their tape on-the-go. Since they're already cut into ready-to-use strips, you can apply and go! Each roll of Pre-Cut KB Support Tape contains 20 individual strips. Each Pre-Cut Strip is 2 inches wide and 10 inches long.
The Continuous Rolls of KB Support Tape are designed for people who want to get creative and customize their tape by cutting it into a variety of different shapes and sizes. Each box contains 1 Continuous Roll of KB Support Tape that is 2 inches wide and 16 feet long.
We used 2 different colors of KB Support Tape in the above image to better illustrate how the Tape is applied for Achilles Tendonitis. You do not need 2 different colors of KB Support Tape in order to achieve this application.
While we found the above application to be effective for Achilles Tendonitis, it's only a suggestion. We encourage you to experiment with different applications for Achilles Tendonitis to find the one that works best for you. Listen to what your ankle is telling you. If you feel pain in a specific area of your Achilles, apply the tape there.

Combination Therapy BFST® + ColdCure® + KB Tape
BFST® for Rapid Healing
ColdCure® for Pain & Swelling
KB Tape to Prevent Re-Injury
Combination Therapy means using ColdCure® and BFST® in combination by alternating treatments, as well as using KB Support Tape throughout your treatments. Combination Therapy is much more effective than using just one product or the other. This is because you're getting the pain and swelling relief of ColdCure®, the healing benefits of BFST®, and the protection and re-injury prevention of KB Support Tape, resulting in the absolute best treatment for your Achilles Tendonitis.
Step 1
Use the ColdCure® Wrap several times a day to help reduce not only the visible swelling you may see on the surface, but also the inflammation you may have and cannot see, deep down in the soft tissue.
Step 2
Avoid using the BFST® Wrap until your inflammation and swelling has subsided. Start your BFST® treatments on Level 1. For maximum benefit, please take into consideration that each 20 minute treatment optimizes your blood circulation for an average of 4 hours. We recommend 3-4 treatments daily, spread throughout the day. During the day, do a BFST® treatment every 4 hours or before any type of physical activity. This can include anything that puts a strain on the injured area (walking, standing for extended periods, etc). This can also be used for preventative measures after a full recovery to optimize your blood flow.
Step 3
Do a ColdCure® treatment any time you experience a pain flare-up or after any physical activity to prevent further injury and reduce swelling and inflammation. Wait 30-45 minutes after your ColdCure® treatment to use BFST® again. This time will allow the blood flow and body temperature to regulate again. Refrain from using ColdCure® within the 4 hours following your 20 minute BFST® treatment. This will counteract the treatment. If necessary, use the ColdCure® Wrap for pain control, then follow up with another BFST® treatment.
Step 4
Any time you're not doing a ColdCure® or BFST® treatment, wear KB Support Tape on your Achilles. If you're taping and doing multiple BFST® treatments throughout the day, do your first BFST® treatment before the Tape is applied and your last treatment after the Tape has been removed at the end of the day.

Medical Function - BFST® Wrap - Accelerated Healing
BFST® devices are manufactured to meet very high standards of quality, safety and performance. Since they are FDA Registered Class II medical devices, they must comply with several different regulations and standards that are in place to keep you safe and ensure effective treatments. Even though the BFST® Wraps are medical devices and not consumer goods, they're still available to the public to buy and use at home.
The Blood Flow Stimulation Therapy® (BFST®) device uses our proprietary Energy Web® to bring specially controlled and incredibly safe amounts of EMR energy to your injured tissue. This energy envelops your Achilles and stimulates blood flow in the soft tissue deep beneath the skin. The resulting blood flow works to actively heal your damaged tissue by creating an ideal environment for healing. Use a BFST® Achilles Wrap to speed up the recovery of your Achilles Tendonitis and get back to your regular activities.
BFST® Wraps come with a 3 level power controller. Everyone should start their treatments at Level 1 and work their way through the levels gradually as they heal. Proceeding immediately to Level 2 or 3 will not speed up your healing time. You need to condition the body first.
When you first start your treatments on Level 1, your blood flow will be poor, so you may feel a slight warming sensation. This is just a side effect of the increase in blood flow. As you do more treatments, the warming sensation starts to decrease. This means your circulation is improving. Better circulation means blood flow all the time, not just during treatments. This is the goal. When you feel almost no warmth during a treatment, it is time to move up to the next power level. Don't rush through the levels though. More heat doesn't mean better treatment. In fact, less heat means better treatment, so take your time moving up in levels.
BFST® Wraps are superior to heating pads. Heating pads are only consumer grade products, not high quality medical devices like BFST® Wraps. They also don't have the ability to heal your soft tissue injuries like BFST® Wraps can. Heating pads only heat the surface of the skin, making it hot to the touch. BFST® devices actually stimulate blood flow deep below your skin to actively heal soft tissue damage. Heating the surface of the skin does nothing to heal the damaged tissue deep below the dermal (fat and skin) layer. BFST® treatments promote healthy blood flow to the area of your injury to create an ideal environment for healing. Heating pads can't do this.
Achilles BFST® Wrap
The Energy Web® and neoprene wrap of the BFST® Achilles device are specially designed to conform to the back of your ankle. This ensures that your entire Achilles Tendon receives an even distribution of energy during every treatment. The wrap molds the Energy Web® around the entire back and lower sides of your ankle, from the top of your Achilles to the bottom of your heel. The Achilles is a very difficult area to target, but the BFST® Achilles Wrap covers the entire area perfectly. The long, wide Velcro® straps attached to the wrap allow you to easily adjust the fit to suit your needs. The wrap can even be worn between treatments to provide your injured Achilles with support and protection.
Complete the Healing Process
Even when your Achilles "feels healed", you may actually only be 20% or 30% healed. The healing process takes much longer than most people realize. You need to continue doing BFST® treatments for several months after your Achilles "feels healed" to ensure complete healing. Do a BFST® treatment prior to any physical activity to prevent re-injury. You should also continue using KB Support Tape on your Achilles to prevent against re-injury.
Medical Function - ColdCure® Wrap - Extreme Pain Relief
Achilles ColdCure® Wrap
As an FDA Registered Class I medical device, the ColdCure® Wrap exceeds all government and health agency regulatory requirements for cold therapy used to treat soft tissue injuries. When applied to your Achilles, the ColdCure® Wrap reduces the risk of tissue damage that can come with excessive swelling. Doctors and Therapists agree that keeping swelling under control contributes to the reduction of long term, permanent damage from soft tissue injuries.
Many people follow the RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression & Elevation) method when treating a soft tissue injury, but most aren't aware of the dangers that ice pose, especially to the Achilles. Your Achilles doesn't have a lot of skin or fat to protect it, making it much more vulnerable to cold burns caused by temperatures below freezing. Ice (and other freezer-based substitutes such as the blue ice pack) can actually freeze your skin and numb your nerves, causing permanent damage to your underlying tissue. The proper solution when treating a soft tissue injury is RCCE® - Rest, Cold, Compression & Elevation. We don't want to apply ice - we want to apply cold that is just above freezing. Yes, you want cold - and lots of it - but not so cold that it is below the freezing point of water.
Our XC Gel® packs provide maximum coverage and cooling power, for an overall superior cold therapy. They contain 3x more gel per lb than other packs to ensure complete coverage of your Achilles. When stored in the freezer, XC Gel® packs have 10x more cooling power per lb than standard gel packs. More cold power means faster and more effective relief of pain and swelling. It also means you won't have to swap the gel packs out as often, so you can keep resting your Achilles.
ColdCure® Achilles gel packs are custom designed for the exact shape of the Achilles. The wrap molds the gel pack all the way up the back and down the sides of your Achilles to ensure your entire injury receives an even distribution of cooling power. All of our gel packs are specifically designed for the body part they're treating. We don't just use 1 generic gel pack shape, because every part of the body is shaped differently and every part of the body needs a custom gel pack shape if it's going to work the best. This product has 100% been designed as an Achilles Tendonitis treatment device.
XC Gel® Means No Hot Spots!
Only ColdCure® gel packs contain our unique XC RigiGel® formula. XC Gel® eliminates hot spots by moving the cold energy within the pack to where it's needed. While other cold packs will have hot and cold spots, our gel packs always have a balanced cold temperature. This is because the cold energy in our gel packs is transferred from the cold spots to the warm spots much more effectively. This means you always get an even, consistent treatment with ColdCure®. Your Achilles will always receive the cooling power of the entire gel pack.
XC Gel® packs have 2 different colored sides: a white side and a gold side. Both sides will give you all the same benefits that our amazing XC RigiGel® formula has to offer. The gel packs can be inserted inside the wrap with the white side facing towards your Achilles or away from your Achilles since the gel packs are not side specific.

The King Brand® products shown are FDA Registered medical devices. That is not all. They are also registered with Health Canada which means they get twice as much review.
FDA and Health Canada Registration does not mean that we fill out a form to become Registered. Our claims are quite significant, and because of these claims the government agencies visit for week-long inspections to ensure that the end user is always receiving the safest effective medical devices we can offer. With two different countries of regulators this means our products get twice the oversight, ensuring exceptional quality and performance.
It is not required but we are also ISO-13485 compliant and registered. This enforces standards are established by the International Standards Organization for global manufacturers of medical devices. This means more on-site week long audits every year ensuring our quality and products meet strict international standards.
It is not required by any regulator, but we use only the safest materials in our products. ISO-10993 regulation ensures that our products are made from higher quality materials than most baby products, including diapers. This is the highest bio-compatibility safety standard in the world. This is the highest hospital grade - think Intensive Care and Operating Rooms. Our materials go through ISO-10993 testing to ensure they are safe for you. No consumer products are produced to this high standard.
King Brand products are, in fact, hospital grade through and through. ISO-60601 is the International Standard for Medical Device safety from an electrical standpoint. In spite of the BFST® being an electrical device, BFST® can be used in hospital emergency rooms and operating rooms without affecting other equipment. You can use any medical device with a BFST® and neither device will know the other one is there. This is a very tough standard to meet, but we do it and you benefit.
King Brand products meet over 20 different safety and quality standards that are not required even for medical devices and FDA registration. If we think there is anything that can be done to make our products safer and more effective, we have done it. That is the approach to everything we do and that is why our company and products are so highly regarded.
