1. Non-nutritional interventions
Based on our comprehensive review (Gülmezoglu et al, 1997), only 2 out of 24 non-nutritional interventions - smoking cessation and antimalarial chemoprophylaxis in primigravidae - are likely to be beneficial. Strategies to reduce smoking during pregnancy have been collectively analyzed in one systematic review, including 5 trials, for medical outcomes as well as separately for smoking rates (Lumley, 1995). In general, behavioral strategies have been found to be more effective in reducing smoking than advice and feedback. They are associated with increased birth weight and lower rate of term-LBW (typical odds ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65-0.98). No effect was detected on perinatal deaths. These effects have been greater in more compliant groups, and those groups who were more successful in stopping smoking showed the highest mean birth weight gains.
The systematic review on the use of antimalarial drug chemoprophylaxis in endemic areas includes 11 trials with data from more than 3,000 women on perinatal outcomes (Garner and Gülmezoglu, 1996). These studies had variable designs with different dosages and some using additional iron and folic acid supplements. Overall, malaria chemoprophylaxis was associated with higher maternal hemoglobin levels and birth weights. These effects were also more prominent in primigravidae, who are known to be more susceptible, showing an increase in mean birth weight of 112 g (95% CI: 41-183 g) in the treated group. However, the results for primigravidae alone are based only on 4 trials of small sample size (Garner and Gülmezoglu, 1996).
2. Nutritional interventions
There are 12 nutritional interventions during pregnancy aimed at preventing impaired fetal growth, including nutritional advice, nutritional supplementation (protein/energy, vitamin/minerals, and fish oil), and nutritional interventions for the prevention of hypertensive disorders (routine calcium and low versus high salt intake). Table 1 presents, for 11 interventions, the number of trials included in the systematic review, the type of intervention, characteristics of participants, and setting of the trials. Table 2 presents similar information for balanced protein/energy supplementation. Table 3 presents the results of the systematic reviews categorized as interventions likely to be beneficial, interventions of unknown effectiveness which merit further research, and interventions unlikely to be beneficial.
2.1. Nutritional interventions likely to be beneficial
Only one of the 12 nutritional interventions-balanced protein/energy supplementation in pregnancy-shows a reduction of borderline statistical significance in the incidence of SGA. The trials on balanced protein/energy supplementation (i.e., a supplement in which protein accounts for < 25% of the total energy content), generally performed in underprivileged populations, assessed the effects of providing pregnant women with nutritional supplements of energy (usually plus protein) on maternal weight gain, fetal growth, gestation duration and fetal/infant morbidity and mortality. Data on SGA are available from 7 of 13 trials included in this systematic review. These are those from Taiwan (Blackwell et al, 1973), Wales (Elwood et al, 1981), India (Girija et al, 1984), East Java (Kardjati et al, 1988), Bogota (More et al, 1978, 1979), Harlem (Rush et al, 1980a,b), and Thailand (Tontisirin et al, 1986) (Table 2). The overall methodological quality of the trials is variable, the major weakness being the failure to provide details of the randomization procedure and the exclusion after randomization of women who were unable or unwilling to take their allocated supplements. The degree of compliance and substitution of the normal diet may also have been quite variable across the trials (Kramer, 1997).
Supplementation was associated with increases in maternal weight gain and mean birth weight, and a decrease in the number of SGA babies of borderline statistical significance (Table 3 and Figure 1). However, there were certain inconsistencies, such as the improvement in fetal growth being smaller in the more under-nourished women, which is attributed to poor compliance or additional dietary supplements these women may have received. Another possibility is that under-nourished women are chronically adapted and do not respond to acute increases in intake. Statistically non-significant reductions in stillbirths and neonatal death are based on only two trials, but may be important if real (Kramer, 1997). A new community-based trial in rural Gambia, recently made available and thus not included in the calculations of the typical odds ratio, shows that supplementation significantly increased birthweight: which merit further research hungry season +201 g (p< 0.001), all year +136 g (p < 0.001). The odds ratio for LBW babies in supplemented women was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47-0.79), supporting the results of the systematic review (Ceesay et al, 1997). Supplementation also significantly reduced perinatal mortality.
2.2. Nutritional interventions of unknown effectiveness which merit further research
A number of systematic reviews have examined vitamin/mineral supplementation (Table 1). The systematic review on routine zinc supplementation (between 20-25 mg per day) includes 4 trials (Goldenberg et al, 1995; Simmer et al, 1991; Mahomed et al, 1989; Hunt et al, 1984) but the effect on fetal growth is dominated by the results Of the large Alabama trial (Goldenberg et al, 1995). The overall methodological quality of the double blinded trials included in the review is high and the typical odds ratio shows a 23% statistically non-significant reduction in incidence of term-LBW (Table 3). There are, however, inconsistencies of results across trials. For example, a highly significant reduction in IUGR with supplementation (odds ratio 0.21; 95% CI: 0.05-0.96) was shown by the London trial (Simmer et al, 1991), while in Bristol (Mahomed et al, 1989) results failed to demonstrate any, significant difference in mean birthweights between the two groups. These conflicting results could be explained by the trials being performed in populations with varied zinc nutritional status and at variable risk for pregnancy out-comes. A most recent RCT, not included in the systematic review, conducted in a normal healthy population, did not demonstrate any effect on the incidence of SGA. Unfortunately, the methodology of this trial is questionable as the authors excluded from the analysis 794 women of the 2000 enrolled "because they forgot to take the tablets regularly" (Jønsson et al, 1996).

Olsen et al, 1992: Women in week 30 of pregnancy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2/1/1 to fish oil (four 1 g Pikasol capsules [containing 2.7g n-3 fatty acids] per day), olive oil (four 1 g capsules per day), or no supplement
533 healthy pregnant women attending the main midwife clinic in the city of Aarhus, Denmark
Well designed trial but there is some evidence that women allocated to olive oil were less likely to increase their fish consumption than women allocated to no oil; olive oil may also have effects so far not reported

Figure 1. Effect of balanced protein/energy supplementation in pregnancy on small-for-gestational-age outcome (from Kramer, 1997).
Concerning antianemic supplements, Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 5 trials included in the systematic review on routine folate supplementation (Fleming et al, 1968; Baumslag et al, 1970; Giles et al, the 1971; Iyengar, 1971; Rolschau et al, 1979). Although the typical odds ratio shows a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of term-LBW ('Table 3), most of the trials, conducted in the 1960s, defined their populations poorly and did not give details of randomization procedures. All of these trials were performed in populations where iron supplementation was routine.
Routine magnesium supplementation (15 mmol/day) seems to decrease the incidence of term-LBW (Table 3) but this evidence is based solely on two trials, both conducted in developed countries (Kovacs et al, 1988; Spatling and Spatling, 1988). The trials have either weaknesses in randomization procedures (such as allocation of subjects based on the women's even or odd birthdates) or have high number of exclusions after randomization which make the results inconclusive. There is one other trial conducted in USA by Sibai et al (1989) among 400 young normotensive primigravid women between 13 and 24 weeks' gestation that has not been included in the systematic review. The results of this trial showed no significant differences between the two groups regarding fetal growth retardation.
2.3. Nutritional interventions unlikely to be beneficial
Of the 4 trials included in the systematic review on nutritional advice in pregnancy, data concerning effects on pregnancy outcome are available only from the trial by Kafatos et al (1989). The results of this trial indicate that nutrition counseling during pregnancy improved dietary intake, but did not show an effect in reducing the rate of SGA births (Table 3). The overall methodological quality of the trial is, however, not high. Although random, unbiased allocation is documented, women randomized to receive advice had considerably higher energy intakes prior to randomization than did control women. Similarly, the analysis is based on individual women despite the fact that randomization was done by clinic. There are also discrepancies in sample sizes of related outcomes (e.g., birth weight versus LBW rate), and inconsistent results such as higher head and chest circumferences but no difference in birth weight.
Isocaloric balanced protein supplementation indicates a supplement in which the protein content is "balanced" (i.e., provides < 25% of its total energy content, and replaces an equivalent amount of energy in the diet). The trials performed so far have not compared such a replacement diet with the usual diet, but rather compared the effects of energetically equivalent supplements that differed only in protein content. This systematic review includes three trials, but the meta-analysis principally reflects the data from the large Mardones trial (Mardones-Santander et al, 1988). This trial, however, suffered from large, but apparently unbiased, losses to follow-up and, more importantly, the normal-protein control supplement contained much higher quantities of vitamins, iron, and several other micronutrients than the higher-protein supplement. To date there is, nevertheless, lack of evidence that these micronutrients affect the outcomes examined. Overall, the results suggest an increased risk of SGA births (Table 3); data are insufficient to exclude effects on fetal or neonatal mortality.
The high protein supplementation systematic review includes two trials (Rush et al, 1980b; Iyengar, 1967) but the perinatal outcomes are dominated by the results of the larger Harlem trial (Rush et al, 1980a,b). This is a high quality trial, which unexpectedly suggest the possibility of an increase in the rate of SGA (Table 3). At one-year follow-up, high-protein supplementation was not associated with a detectable difference in weight, length, head circumference, or Bayley mental score. The Harlem trial also reported a non-significant increased risk of neonatal death.
Only one of the 2 trials included in the Vitamin D supplementation systematic review reporting clinical outcomes, the London trial (Brooke et al, 1980), provides data on the effects of supplementation on fetal growth. The London trial targeted pregnant women from the Indian subcontinent living in Britain on the assumption that Vitamin D deficiency is more likely to occur in persons whose diet is relatively low in vitamin D (such as vegetarians) and those who have little exposure to sunlight. The result of the trial showed a decrease in the incidence of neonatal hypocalcemia in these vulnerable population and a non-statistically significant effect on fetal growth, but the sample size of the trial was small (Table 3).
The systematic review on routine iron supplementation in pregnancy includes 2 trials, conducted in well nourished women from developed countries to evaluate the effect of routine versus selective supplementation (Dawson and McGanity, 1987; Hemminki and Rimpelä, 1991). Routine iron supplementation improved maternal iron stores, as reflected by increased serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels, but there were no differences on any substantive clinical outcomes (Table 3). The only possible benefit from routine supplementation, suggested by the larger multicenter trial in Finland (Hemminki and Rimpelä, 1991), was a lower caesarean section rate and postpartum blood transfusion. However, these unexpected findings may be explained by the nonblinding of the trial that may have led to closer observation, possibly bias in measurements, and obstetricians' and midwives' overreactions when faced with low hematocrit and hemoglobin values in the unsupplemented group.
There have been two trials conducted to assess the effects of fish oil supplementation during pregnancy reporting fetal growth outcomes (Olsen et al, 1992; Onwude et al 1995). The larger trial, conducted in Denmark by Olsen et al (1992), is a well designed trial in which the control group received either olive oil, or no oil. Results are presented in Table 3 for the two groups separately. There is some evidence in this trial that the women allocated to olive oil were less likely to increase their fish consumption that women allocated to no oil, and it is also possible that olive oil may have effects that have so far been unreported. The study by Onwude et al is a smaller trial conducted in the UK to determine whether n-3 fatty acid prophylaxis is beneficial in high-risk pregnancies. The data for this trial included in the comprehensive overview (Gülmezoglu et al 1997) referred to an earlier report of the trial in an abstract form (Onwude et al, 1992); the results presented in this paper (Table 3) correspond to those reported in the final publication of the trial (Onwude et al, 1995). Based on the limited information provided by these two trials there is currently insufficient evidence for any conclusions to be drawn about the effects of fish oil supplementation during pregnancy in IUGR.
Because of its association with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders are important contributors to maternal and fetal morbidity There have been two approaches tested in RCTs to prevent hypertensive disorders during pregnancy that involve nutritional interventions: routine calcium supplementation and low versus high salt intake. The result of the 5 calcium supplementation trials included in this systematic review (Villar et al, 1987; Villar and Repke, 1990b; Belizan et al 1991; Cong et al, 1993; Sanchez-Ramos et al, 1994) did no show any significant effect on preventing term-LBW or SGA (Table 3). There has been only one follow-up into childhood of those babies whose mothers were supplemented with calcium and the results show no long-term effect on physical growth (Belizan et al, 1997). The only trial included in the systematic review of low versus high salt intake in pregnancy is small and, in addition, 14% of the women who were randomized were excluded from the analysis (Steegers et al, 1991). This single trial is to small to provide any trustworthy estimates of the effect of low salt compared to high salt intake during pregnancy on fetal growth (Table 3).
