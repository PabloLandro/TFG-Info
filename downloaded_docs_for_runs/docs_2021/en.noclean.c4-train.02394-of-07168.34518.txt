Effects & Benefits of Harp Therapy
The harp has been revered and utilized as a healing instrument for thousands of years. The heavenly vibrations of the harp have been shown to have restorative benefits that promote physical, emotional, & mental homeostasis.
"Studies show that harp therapy can equalize and slow down brain waves; affect respiration, heartbeat, and pulse; reduce muscle tension; and improve body movement. Premature babies who have received harp therapy are able to drink more of their motherâ€™s milk and gain weight more rapidly, resulting in earlier departure times from the hospital. Harp therapy increases endorphin levels, regulates stress-related hormones, boosts the immune system, and stimulates digestion and the overall feeling of well-being. Therapeutic musicians help to create a relaxed, healing environment through live music, which studies find to be even more effective than recorded music." --Marcie Swift, Psychologist & Certified Music Practitioner
Documented clinical research has revealed an array of positive effects of live therapeutic music which include:

*Relief of Stress, Anxiety, Agitation, & Depression of Both Patients, Family Members, and Facility Staff
Negative stress takes an enormous toll on the body, emotions, mind, and spirit. The negative effects of stress, especially chronic and prolonged stress which is commonly experienced when facing challenging health issues, include tension headaches, decreased immune system functioning, gastrointestinal disturbances, appetite imbalances, increased likelihood of stroke and heart attack, high blood pressure, increased susceptibility to infections, heart disease, sleep disturbances or excessive slumber, social withdrawal, memory problems, inability to concentrate, pessimism, excessive worrying, racing thoughts, rapid heartbeat, frequent illness, body aches and pains, feeing overwhelmed, nervous, agitated, anxious, and/or depressed, loneliness, lack of perceived meaning in life, low self-esteem, panic attacks, and fear. And often in response to stressful situations, people may become anxious, agitated, or depressed. Symptoms of anxiety include feelings of terror and panic, apprehension or dread, extreme worry and fear, feeling tense or jumpy, pounding heart, sweating, dizziness, fatigue, twitching, shortness of breath, and insomnia. Also, patients who are in the dying process can experience terminal agitation or restlessness where they become extremely irritable, show signs of physical distress such as tossing and turning in bed, exhibits mood swings, appear "out of control," or feel confused. Depression can also be common where they may feel hopeless, helpless, guilt, worthlessness, sad, empty, low energy, and suicidal.
The harp is known to elicit a powerful stress-relieving influence for a multitude of listeners. For centuries, the harp and voice have been used to soothe newborns to sleep, ease the pain of the dying, and to nurture sorrowful emotional states. Studies show that therapeutic harp music can significantly reduce anxiety, stress, agitation, and depression levels for a wide array of conditions pertaining to hospital and hospice settings. Music (in this case, my harp & voice) achieves this aim by decreasing the levels of stress hormones, cortisol & adrenaline, and by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. Research has shown that after healthy individuals listen to music, they experienced a decrease in cortisol levels which in turn increases immune system functioning (Crowe, p.182). Music counteracts stress' long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and thus slowing down the physiological processes associated with it such as heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure (Crowe, p.218). The PNS allows the body to heal, regenerate, and recharge. Music can influence the body to sedate itself and the mind to relax itself. The slow and relaxing rhythmic effects and beautiful overtones in harp music may produce marked shifts in tension, stress, and anxiety--thereby promoting slower brainwave patterns, feelings of relaxation, peace, and comfort. Harp and voice can also be powerfully uplifting tools to influence positive emotions like joy, happiness, and laughter for someone suffering from depression or anger. For those suffering from anxiety, who often do not feel safe, grounded, or comforted, music may promote an avenue for optimism, emotional balance, and loving comfort.
Research Studies:
*Music statistically significantly reduces state anxiety levels in patients with preoperative anxiety for day surgery.
*Live Therapeutic Harp music has significant effect of lowering anxiety of mothers with babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit

*Vocal music lullabies reduced stress behaviors, initial weight-loss, increased caloric and formula intake, and decreased length of hospital stay of premature and low birth weight neonates in a newborn intensive care unit.
*Live Therapeutic Harp and voice decreased levels of agitation and wakefulness and increased slow & deep breathing in palliative care for dying patients.
*Promotes Emotional Catharsis by Gently Releasing Repressed Emotions
Many people understandably use the repression of emotions as a psychological defense mechanism to deal with the aftereffects of traumatic or overwhelming emotional experiences. It is a type of regulation strategy that is supposed to make uncomfortable (or fear-based) feelings easier to manage. Our emotions are a variation of two basic emotions--love & fear. Fear-based emotions are expressed as anxiety, anger, control, sadness, depression, inadequacy, confusion, hurt, loneliness, guilt, and shame. Emotions such as joy, happiness, caring, trust, compassion, truth, contentment, and satisfaction are love-based emotions. Fear-based emotions release biochemical reactions in your body (like cortisol & adrenaline) that are vastly different from the love-based emotions (such as dopamine & oxytocin). Holding onto, or repressing, fear-based emotions can have potentially devastating psychological and physical effects such as mental rigidity, low self-confidence, depression, emotional numbness, fatigue, and headaches. It is even said that long-term repressed emotions are stored in one's physical and energetic bodies that can eventually manifest as illnesses like kidney stones or cancer. Sometimes talking about, or intellectualizing, our repressed emotions are ineffective methods of resolution because our thoughts cannot reach those deeply buried regions of our psyche--because emotions are subconscious processes. That is why many people turn to music for emotional catharsis and relief.
When I play Therapeutic Harp music and sing, it is not uncommon for me to see people who are touched profoundly and become teary-eyed or begin to cry. Others become intensely joyful and express heart-felt laughter or smiling. That is because music can uniquely touch one's inner-most being on a very deep level. Music has the ability to access the limbic system of the brain, which is the physical center of emotional processing, and as a result bypass cognitive interpretation and analysis. Our response to music occurs at a subconscious level--beyond our intellectual interpretation and conscious awareness. Interestingly, our emotions also occur at the subconscious level. We do not stop and think about getting angry or happy--this just happens beyond our cognitive awareness. In this way, music can speak the language of emotion at the subconscious level. This means that music can transcend the logical mind and access our deepest emotional states, such as joy, grief, love, sorrow, anger, and bliss in immensely cathartic ways. Music has a way of bringing to surface our emotional depths for healing and renewal. This is evident in the popular behavior of listening to music to either express our current emotional states or when we listen to music to soothe agitated states or calm anxious ones. Sad songs can make us cry and happy songs can trigger laughter. At an instinctual level, beyond conscious processing, the majority of people use music to non-verbally express repressed emotions and to promote catharsis. Music is a commonly used, safe, and natural medicine.
Research Studies:
*Music intervention showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and relationships in psychiatric patients.
*Research shows that music has the power to produce significant emotional responses.
*Music supports teenager's identification, catharsis, and expression of emotions while increasing social support.
*Music Psychologists believe music on a prescription can help treat emotional and physical pain.
*Musical group sessions in psychiatric patients significantly reduces anxiety and depression while improving relationships.
*Helps To Induce Sleep
It is not uncommon for individuals with health challenges to face sleep disturbances or insomnia that negatively impacts their physical, emotional, and mental well-being throughout the day. Sleep is an incredibly important and crucial part of our healing, recovery, and optimal functioning. Even with minimal sleep disturbances, our mood, energy levels, and physical health can be negatively affected. Studies have shown that individuals with sleep deprivation display symptoms such as impaired memory, difficulty concentrating, lower tolerance to stress, increased emotional sensitivity, mood swings, feelings of hopelessness & helplessness, increased rate of accidents, relational stress, physical weakness & fatigue, decreased optimism and sociability, weakened immune system, high blood pressure, depression, and even increased risk of heart attack. The reason this happens is because our brain needs sleep to regenerate neurons, form memories, generate new synaptic connections & repair our body at a cellular level.
The harp is known to be an instrument of peace, relaxation, and delicate beauty as revealed through its heavenly sounding glissandos and abundant overtones. The music of the harp can promote a deep state of relaxation that is necessary for the onset of sleep, the deepening of the sleep, and to promote the elongation of the sleep process. Music has been shown in research studies to increase melatonin--a hormone produced in our bodies to regulate sleep. The harp's ethereal & calming melodies are amplified by the soothing qualities of the human voice and are catalysts for creating a deep level of peace, sedation, and contentment. Therapeutic harp music and voice can be especially beneficial for NICU infants experiencing sleep disturbances and for elderly hospice patients with terminal agitation or sleep deprivation due to a distressing medical condition. In such cases, I may play and sing gentle lullabies, classical music, and/or improvise in the dreamy Mixolydian mode or in the soothing Ionian mode. In total, therapeutic harp music can create a tranquil and quiet atmosphere that is beneficial for slumber. When we get sufficient sleep, we can again experience the love of life, optimism, and healthy vitality that enables us to function at the best of our abilities. Benefits of sufficient sleep include strengthened immune function, improved mood, increased ability to cope with stress, improved cognition & memory, cardiovascular health, increased creativity, better ability to handle life's challenges, as well as higher brain functioning.
Research Studies:
*Live Music Therapy reduces heart-rate and deepens sleep in prenatal infants in neonatal intensive care unit.
*10 studies across cultures find music listening helps induce sleep in those with sleep disorders.
*Classical music statistically significantly improves sleep quality in students in research study.
*Music helps the elderly and infant babies to sleep longer and more deeply.
*Lullabies, classical, and New Age music help relieve stress, induce relaxation, and enhance quality of sleep.
*Improves Memory & Attention Span
"Music, especially playing music, engages more of the brain than any other single activity" (Crowe, 107). The simple acts of listening and playing music initiates a total brain workout. Memory is often triggered through emotionally charged memories--and music tends to evoke an array of subconscious emotional responses, vivid imagery of past memories, and improves one's capacity to bring attention to the present moment. Musical stimuli simultaneously activates both hemispheres of our brain, engages one's attention, and affects the neurological firing patterns of the hypothalamus. Given that there are three times as many nerve connections between the ear and the brain than between the eye and the brain, music's influence on the brain regions of emotional processing and memory are immense. Through activation of complex systems in the brain, a common experience of music occurs through hearing a song from one's childhood, wedding, or another significant time in life and suddenly becoming flooded with past feelings, sensations, smells, thoughts, conversations, and/or pictures. Familiar music tends to act as food for the brain by nourishing and strengthening our synapses--thereby providing "brain cell exercise" so that we can keep our brains activated and in optimal function. For decades, evidence of music's ability to affect one's cognition, intelligence, learning capacity, creativity, speech, and memory have surfaced and continue to support this powerful tool for therapeutic use.
Understandably, a variety of psychologists, neuroscientists, doctors, and music therapists have extensively explored and utilized the powerful effects that music has on the brain. Music is known to benefit NICU infants, autistic children, and elderly dementia patients with heightened cognition. "In the first two years of life, 30,000 new synapses are formed every second under every square centimeter of the brain's surface" (Rose, 1998a). Music can be a great asset to these infants and toddlers to help create and maintain deep networks of neural connections which subsequently assists the brain to strengthen memory function and support learning ability. It is the complexity of the music, especially classical music, that offers brain-building benefits. Engaging with and listening to music may support the emerging neural structure of the brain with increased presence, intelligence, vocabulary, creativity, and learning capacity by strengthening the newly-formed synapses present in children. In addition, musical activity can also support dementia patients by stimulating dormant memories, retaining new information, improving alertness, attention, mental clarity, and learning. Musical activity also helps to bring them out of the isolation and sadness that many feel by increasing socialization, friendliness, and joy.
Research Studies:
*Music helps brain development in infants say doctors and neuroscientists.
*Music listening enhances cognitive recovery and mood after middle cerebral artery stroke.
*Music boosts memory in Alzheimer's patients and helps them to remember daily tasks.
*Research finds music-memory connection in pre-frontal cortex in brain.
*Music training helps learning and memory says Psychology Today's William R. Klemm, D.V.M, Ph.D.
*Normalizes Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate, Heart Rate & Brain Wave Patterns
Often before surgery, during stressful times, and while other intense health conditions present themselves, it is not uncommon for one's blood pressure to raise, respiration to increase, the heart begins to pound rapidly, and the brain engages in an anxious beta brain wave pattern. Prolonged stress that many individuals encounter during various health problems can result in physiological changes that produce shallow and short breaths, rapid pulse, high blood pressure, and erratic beta brain waves associated with worry, anxiety, irritability, and weakened immune system. This in turn can create unsuitable physical and psychological conditions for the aimed goals of health and emotional wellbeing. Prolonged high blood pressure damages the heart, kidneys, and brain. When the heart rate increases, the body may experience weakness, release of stress hormones, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweaty palms, and anxiety. The elderly tend to be less resilient to these conditions and the stress produced by unbalanced bodily functions may exacerbate preexisting health challenges.
The music of the harp has been shown to produce the homeostatic effects of balancing these bodily processes. Harp music is the epitome of balance--in one's mind, body, and emotions. The soothing effects of therapeutic harp music have been shown to work with the body's natural intelligence--gently lowering or raising the blood pressure to healthy and balanced levels. Therapeutic harp promotes equanimity and balance of many physiological functions. With the potent stress-relieving properties of harp music, people often breathe more evenly and their heart rates level. The harp is attributed with the unique ability to simultaneously calm and uplift all facets of our being. With the benefits of harp music, the high stress levels associated with promoting high blood pressure can be tamed, shortness of breath and rapid heart rate that often accompanies anxiety can be soothed, brainwave patterns can return to Alpha where we can once again experience relaxed attention and calm alertness. Since high levels of Beta brainwaves are found in those with anxiety and high-intensity stress situations, the harp is a wonderful tool for calming brainwave patterns to Alpha or even deeper into a serene Theta state. I have often seen the effect of therapeutic harp music calming people to such an extend that they experience a deep sleep characterized by Delta brainwave patterns--especially when I sing classical music. In total, the harp and voice together are wonderful tools that work to complete balance.
Research Studies:
*Harp music stabilizes blood pressure and relieves pain in ICU patients
*Use of music intervention with cardiac surgery patients during the first postoperative day decreased noise annoyance, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure in cardiac surgery patients.
*Music significantly reduces inconsolable crying in premature infants and produced improved physiological measures including heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and mean arterial pressure.
*Lullabies positively influence cardiac & respiratory function in premature infants while improving feeding behavior and parental stress
*Classical music listening may improve cardiovascular recovery from stress by lowering blood pressure.
*Improves Oxygenation of Blood & Deepens Breath
Our state of mind and physical condition can either work to deepen our breath or shorten each breath. When we are stressed, anxious, nervous, upset, and angry, our body prepares for perceived danger by activating the "fight or flight" response which results in shallow and short breaths (among many other characteristics). It is a survival technique aimed at preserving our energy in order to meet the challenges that are presenting themselves. Shortness of breath is the result of side effects caused by prescription medications, challenging health conditions, and/or heightened emotional states. Shallow breathing is often triggered by stress and anxiety. Prolonged stress has harsh implications for our ability to take relaxed, deep, long breaths and restore our energy and vitality. When our breaths are not deep, our intake of oxygen is deprived--resulting in fatigue, weakness, and stress. Low oxygen levels decrease cognitive functions which result in confusion, memory loss, and lack of concentration. The habit of consistently breathing in shallow and shortened ways perpetuates the cycle of bodily tension, stress, lack of cognitive capabilities, and fatigue--which then leads to more shallow breathing.
Our brains works best with high levels of oxygen and deep, elongated breathing. When we are relaxed, comfortable, and soothed, our breathing deepens and our stress melts away. Our muscles loosen and our mood is elevated with deep breathing. The therapeutic harp and voice have been shown in research studies to deepen the breath due to the entrainment principle. Our breathing patterns tend to match the music, so therapeutic music played in a slow tempo in a certain time signature can influence and deepen the breath. Benefits of deep breathing include increased energy levels, positive mood, tension release, cleansing of toxins, mental clarity, pain relief, strengthened immune system, improves cellular regeneration, nourishes the nervous system, strengthens the lungs and heart, and even improves digestion! With all of these benefits of deep breathing, it is essential that we find time in our busy lives to change our breathing habits from shallow breaths to deep, long, comfortable breaths. Listening to music such as therapeutic harp and classical music is one way to relax into deepening the breath, but there are others ways as well such as yoga and meditation. Brainwave entrainment music has also been shown to deepen the breath and has potent anti-anxiety benefits that can calm the mind, body, and emotions.
Research Studies:
*Music Therapy improves oxygen saturation in premature infants receiving endotracheal suctioning.
*Harp Therapy and voice deepened and slowed breath for relaxation and palliative care in actively dying.
*Singing and playing Harp music is found increase levels of oxygen saturation and decrease heart rate and stress for premature infant in neonatal unit.
*The use of vocal lullaby music in the NICU for premature infants increases oxygen levels and decreases stress, agitation, and heart rate.
*Therapeutic music improved anxiety, body movement, facial expression, mood, pain, shortness of breath, and verbalizations in palliative care patients.
*Relieves Physical Pain
One of the most distressing challenges our bodies present ourselves with is physical pain--especially long-standing, chronic pain. Physical pain occurs as the result of a range of health related conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis, PTSD, drug withdrawal, surgical procedures, giving birth, depression, terminal illnesses, along with many other conditions. Consequently, it is not uncommon for people who undergo intense physical pain to also suffer from emotional pain like depression, anxiety, anger, agitation, irritation, and stress. Physical pain, even to the extent of the common cold, is enough to make anyone feel emotionally uneasy. Yet with severe physical impairment and pain, the common cold or flu seems mild in comparison and those who suffer from chronic pain are more susceptible to emotional pain. Physical pain may be accompanied by feelings of limitation, isolation, and helplessness--making depression a strong possibility. Likewise, research has confirmed that our brains process emotional and physical pain in extremely similar ways--making little distinction between the two. In other words, fMRI scans revealed patterns that appear so similar between physical and emotional pain that it is difficult, based on the results alone, to identify which is which. What's even more interesting is that emotional pain can even cause physical pain--potentially leading to severe illnesses if not properly processed in healthy ways. The effects of traumatic experiences, anxiety attacks, suicidal depressions, the death of a loved one, etc., can actually produce physical pain in the body. Processing intense experiences requires catharsis of the body as well as the emotions and mind.
There are many ways to process these experiences that promote healing on all levels such as E.F.T., natural herbal medicine from a high-quality company, organic foods and proper diet tailored to your unique needs, and therapeutic music. Of course since this website is focused on the uses of therapeutic sound, that is what I will discuss. Studies have proven that listening to music has analgesic effects and has helped many individuals going through surgery, dentist visits, chemotherapy, and even exercise routines. Therapeutic harp music works by redirecting the patient's thoughts or distracting them from the pain by providing alternative messages to the brain. This happens because the many of the same brain pathways used to process pain are also used to process music, and the act of listening to music may release natural pain-relieving endorphins. "An article published earlier this year in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews stressed the importance of the brain's opioid system and other neuro-chemical factors in understanding music's role in alleviating pain. Because the experience of pain is partially subjective, altering a person's perception of their pain can change their experience of that pain. Music may disrupt the brain's "pain - stress - pain" feedback loop and in doing so alter an individual's sensitivity to pain. How might this work? We know that music effects evolutionarily old subcortical areas of the brain, thereby influencing many different psychological and physiological states. Music modulates the brain's limbic system, triggering numerous accompanying neurochemical effects. The result of these changes in the brain may be to help distract listeners from negative feelings and modify the influence of past memories associated with pain. As a further result, music may promote relaxation by inhibiting the release of stress hormones and weakening arousal of the pituitary-adrenal stress axis. The brain's opioid system may also play a role. Music that listeners find emotionally engaging seems to affect the brain's opioid system, and opioids control both physical pain and the pain of social loss." --Jeanette Bicknell, Ph.D

*Enhances Feelings of Peace, Comfort, Safety, Relaxation, & Euphoria
One of the most astonishing aspects of music is its ability to affect our biochemistry. Clinical research studies have revealed that dopamine is released upon anticipation of and within the "peak" moments of music listening. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter responsible for our sense of pleasure and reward. It is also released during sex, drug use, infatuation, exercise, and eating. Music can therefore be a potent medicine in response to drug addiction and withdrawal. Not only does therapeutic music provide pleasurable stimulation from dopamine release, but it has also been found to increase serotonin levels in the brain--most often occurring with classical & folk music. Serotonin regulates mood, sleep, and appetite. Music has been found to boost serotonin levels and thus elevate mood, calm the mind, and relax the body. Harp music in particular has a reputation for raising feel-good chemicals as it is known to be an instrument that evokes feelings of peace and comfort. The use of music for treatment of anxiety, depression, and bipolar symptoms is backed with evidence of physiological changes within our biochemistry. In addition, music has also been found to curb our pain response and even produce exalted feelings of euphoria in people with the release of endorphins. Endorphins are hormones that act as natural opiates which provide feelings of being "high" or emotionally elated, as well as to manage pain. The mood-enhancing effects of music can actually result in a completely euphoric experience that is both balancing and peaceful. Music is a process of complex vibratory stimulators that act on the intricate regions of brain activity. Even our stress hormones are affected. Cortisol, norepinephrine and adrenaline are our three main stress hormones produced in the adrenal glans in response to fear--mainly the "fight or flight" reaction. A short burst of stress hormones is beneficial for coping with challenging life situations. However, when these hormones are consistently activated, the stress response disrupts and harms our emotional, mental, and physical wellbeing in devastating ways. Music has been shown to decrease the levels of stress hormones. Therapeutic harp music and voice can establish powerful stress-relieving and calming properties which can soothe all facets of our being. Music's form and structure can provide a sense of security and order to the mind and emotions. Yet, even sad songs can bring comfort and safety. Research studies have discovered that sad songs and/or love songs trigger oxytocin and prolactin release within our bodies. Oxytocin is often referred to as the "cuddle hormone" that is released while bonding and results in feelings of joy, affection, and comfort. Music, especially when people sing or play together, is found to increase oxytocin levels. Prolactin is commonly associated with lactation in women, but also has the effect of alleviating emotions like grief and sadness. Music that is sad can increase prolactin and therefore increase self-soothing feelings of comfort and happiness. Also, melatonin has been found in heightened levels following therapeutic music sessions in Alzheimer's patients. Melatonin is the hormone that helps to control sleep cycles. The implication of these effects suggests that music has the ability to alter our biochemistry in ways that bring balance, peace, comfort, and joy to our lives.
Scientists have conducted an array of research studies to uncover the mystery of why music affects us, given that it is not presently known to be essential to survival. However, music has been used since the beginning of mankind for some reason. Why is it used? Why does it appear in virtually every culture? In my opinion, it is a medicine that people have used for thousands of years to promote balance, wellbeing, and optimal health for themselves and others--not only on an emotional level, but on the behavioral, social, mental, physical, and spiritual levels. Music seems to be the universal language--a key to understanding life and a tool to uncover our human depths.
