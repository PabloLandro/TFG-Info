Ten things you should know about Acetaminophen
December 16, 2013
1. Acetaminophen is also known as Tylenol(brand name) and sometimes by its abbreviated name APAP. It is probably the most common fever and pain reducer on the market today.
2. Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many single and multi-ingredient products. Before taking any prescription or non prescription product it is a good idea to know if and how much acetaminophen is in that product.
3.It is recommended that no more than 4 grams of acetaminophen be ingested in a 24 hour period. The ceiling effect of acetaminophen is 3 grams-- meaning that anything over 3 grams does not really contribute to its analgesic effect. Make sure to include all the acetaminophen being ingested from all the products you are taking so you don't go over the 4 gram limit.
4. Tylenol overdose can cause liver damage, and even death if the limits are exceed.
5. Tylenol is useful for pain relief and also fever reduction. The mechanism of action is unclear.
6. Acetaminophen has no anti-inflammatory properties, so it will not reduce swelling .
7. Combination(multi-ingredient) products for adult use contain either 325 mg or 500 mg of acetaminophen. The FDA recently set the maximum allowable dosage at 325 mg for these types of products; some 500 mg products are still available as of this writing.
8. Tylenol dosing for infants is based on their age and weight. Consult your pediatrician or pharmacist before administering acetaminophen to pediatric patients if you are uncertain of the dosage.
9. Tylenol is available for oral and rectal use. It can be given intravenously in the health care setting.
10. Some common prescription and non prescription products that contain acetaminophen are: Tylenol, Excedrin, Tylenol Cold and Flu, Percocet, Vicodin, Ultracet, and Tylenol with Codeine.

Living with Chronic pain hits the big screen!
February 13, 2015
Been to the movies lately? Jennifer Aniston is on the big screen in a recent release titled "Cake."
Her character, Claire is a victim of chronic pain...she belongs to a support group, where all of the members are coming to terms with the suicide of one of their members. Of course, she also takes pain medication and addiction is another of her problems...and of course there's more!
I guess I am writing this post just to bring readers' attention to the fact that Hollywood has become aware of the crisis that is chronic pain. This movie is a testament to that. People that don't have to live with this kind of pain don't fully understand the whole story. Maybe this movie will shed some light on the issues.
Here is the official trailer for the movie:

Herpes As A Helper?
April 14, 2017
If you've ever had shingles, or known anyone that has experienced it, you probably know that chronic pain can persist following the initial attack (post herpetic neuralgia). This is because the herpes virus seems to have an affinity for nerve cells. And while it's not fun to have shingles or post herpetic neuralgia, the herpes virus may be a key in future development of delivery systems for pain management treatments.
Here's the deal--since Herpes simplex has an affinity for nerve cells, researchers are looking a genetically modified, safer version of the virus to deliver genetic material to damaged nerves. In simple terms, once the genetic material reaches these nerve cells, it will hopefully encode these nerves to ultimately inhibit pain signals. Animal studies and clinical trials in cancer patients have been encouraging thus far.
This is one of those developments that makes me believe that there is hope for those in chronic pain. Along with so many other exciting d…

The Knee Bone's Connected To The Leg Bone....
September 30, 2016
Two recent studies have brought a not-so-novel concept into the limelight-the concept being that people who present with knee pain often develop pain in other parts of their bodies. These studies, known as the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) and the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), were assessed by a Clinical Epidemiology Team as Boston University School of Medicine in an effort to find preventive strategies to combat this trend.
The authors suggest that knee pain may cause individuals to alter their gait in an effort to compensate for their discomfort. In doing so, the alignment of other body joints is altered, and this may be the cause of secondary joint pain, especially hips and ankles. The authors go on to say that the pain in these secondary sites is not necessarily osteoarthritis--perhaps bursitis or some other injury.
Osteoarthritis is a result of wear and tear in the joints. We may not be able to completely eliminate osteoarthritis from occurring, but some common se…
