When Should I Take Imitrex (Sumatriptan) Tablets?

When Should I Take Imitrex (Sumatriptan) Tablets?
When should I take Imitrex (sumatriptan) tablets? When I get the aura, or when I begin to feel the pain? Also, can the 100 mg caplets be split in two or does it affect the delivery of the medicine into the body? I've been taking it when I get the aura, but I can get the aura with or without pain. (I don't take this for other types of headaches, which I don't get often anyway; I only take it when the pain is definitely one-sided, and usually follows the aura.) Thanks!!!

Welcome to MyMigraineConnection!
Studies have shown that medications such as Imitrex work best when taken as early in the Migraine attack as possible, so the best time to take it is when you recognize that you have a Migraine. For some people, taking it during the aura can stop the Migraine before it progresses to the headache phase.
Imitrex tablets should not be split because it does affect the delivery.
Welcome again,
Teri
