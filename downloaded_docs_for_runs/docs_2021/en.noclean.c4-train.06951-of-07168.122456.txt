How do you perform a Primary Survey?
October 12, 2017 jason
The phrase “Primary Survey” can be a little hard to decipher if you have never taken a First Aid Course before, not only that but it is always hard to remember specific steps in any Emergency Setting for those who are not dedicated Emergency Medical Professionals.
The best way to think of the “Primary Survey” is to think about the bodies Primary Need. As humans we use many fuels to support our life, however there is one in specific that all our bodies hinge on. “Oxygen“. Oxygen is the key to any emergency, if the victim is breathing but unconscious roll them into the recovery position, if the victim is “Not” breathing “Start CPR“. That means your “Primary Survey” is simplified to this… The victim is breathing… Or … The victim is “not” breathing.
To perform the Primary Survey look for the Primary Need by performing these 3 steps.
Check the Scene for Safety, then check the victim “They are breathing, They are “Not” breathing”
Call 911
Care For the Victim.
These steps are designed to help you in any emergency. The difference may be someones life.

Should you move a casualty before providing care?
September 18, 2017 jason
Moving a victim before you provide care has been a question that almost every class brings up. Its a great question with a simple answer There are some reason’s when moving a person may be the only option to save their life or even prevent them from further injury. You may want to move a casualty if there are dangerous environments which could also do further harm to the patient, dangerous animals, toxins / poisons, or even machinery. One thing to remember “before” you move a patient is “Will this make things better or worse?” You do have to weigh the situation vs desirable outcome, often the phrase used is “Life over Limb”. If the Casualties life is in immediate threat due to their surroundings “Move them away from the danger”, however, if moving them makes the situation worse and their surroundings are “not” an issue “Keep them in the position found or in a position of comfort.
“REMEMBER” You may not have to move a patient, if their “Spine” is in danger always refer to your 911 dispatcher for further advice before attempting First Aid techniques.
How to move a Patient from a dangerous environment:
Collar Drag – At the head of the patient – Roll the person’s clothing “Collar” behind their neck in a ball in your hand bunching their clothing under the armpits, bend with your knees and lift with your legs, drag the victim to safety.
One Arm Drag – Kneeling at the head of the victim slide the persons torso into your lap, lay one of the victims arms across their chest and reach through their opposite arm pit to grip their folded arms wrist, slip your other hand under the other arm pit and grip the folded arms forearm, bend with your knees, lift with your legs and drag to safety.
2 Person Collar Drag – Combine the one arm drag technique with adding a partner, each rescuer should grab the collar on opposite sides of the victim and facing in the direction you wish to go bend with your knees and lift with your legs dragging them to safety.
2 Person Carry – Combine the one arm drag technique to lift the victim’s torso and add a partner to lift the legs by folding them across each other gripping by the lower leg under the calf, face in the direction you wish to go, bend with your knees, lift with your legs and carry the victim to safety.

Should you Drive an ill or Injured Person to the Hospital?
September 15, 2017 jason
This question gets asked by students taking our first aid courses all the time, and we do see the conundrum that many face in an Emergency as Liability, distance, Time or even a persons life may be at stake. For these very reasons we have come up with the simplest way to look at it.
Try not to…..., but if you do decide to take a person to the hospital we have included some steps to keep you and the victim safe. Lets call this “Stay & Play VS Load & Go”
Stay & Play “Wait for an Ambulance“
Never drive an ill or injured person to the hospital if their condition is “Life Threatening” or spine related. The movement of being in a vehicle may adversely affect their injuries. You may not have to move the patient, your 911 Dispatcher will advise you on options you may have to secure the best medical aid given.
Load & Go “Take them to a hospital“
For “Non-Life Threatening” injuries or illness.
Step #1 – “911 on Speaker Phone” – Have 911 on speaker phone so everyone knows what the dispatcher needs you to do. This will also let the hospital know you are coming.
Step #2 – “Take a Partner” – Have a calm person drive while you continue care. Having a partner to help in an emergency setting can make all the difference.
Step #3 – “You Can NOT Speed” – as your vehicle is not a designated emergency vehicle its lack of visibility and sirens will put you and others into danger if you attempt to break the rules of the road. Just remember, if you get there safely, the victim will too, Better safe than sorry.

Whooping Cough “Pertussis”
September 8, 2017 jason
Whooping cough can be a life threatening infection that affects Babies, toddlers and young children adversely. In babies whooping cough can lead to a life threatening symptom known as “Apnea” causing pauses in normal breathing, pneumonia, feeding problems, weight loss, seizures, brain damage and in some cases “Death“. Older children and adults can catch Whooping Cough and pass it on to babies and young children as carriers, continuing the spread.
Who is at risk? Anyone can get whooping cough unfortunately, people living in the same household with someone who has contracted whooping cough are especially at risk. Immunization “does” reduce the risk of infection, but immunity does fade over time and boosters should be utilized to hep prevent the spread.
Symptoms:
Much like a cold Whooping Cough usually begins with a blocked or runny nose, tiredness, mild fever and a cough.
As symptoms progress the cough worsens and leads to severe bouts of uncontrollable coughing. These coughing bouts may be followed by vomiting, choking or taking big gasping breaths which causes a “whooping” sound. This cough can last for many weeks and can be worse at night.
Some Newborns may not cough at all but they can stop breathing and turn blue. Some babies may even have difficulties feeding and can choke or gag easily.
Older children and adults may just have a cough that lasts for many weeks. They may also not have the “whoop” sound when they cough but are still able to pass on Whooping Cough.
How is it Spread?
Whooping cough is spread when an infectious person coughs bacteria / virus into the air, that same air or particulates are inhaled by people nearby. If they are not treated early, people who are infected with whooping cough are “very” infectious in the “first three weeks” of their illness. Whooping cough also spreads easily through families, childcare centers, schools and shopping centers.
Prevention:
Whooping cough vaccines are “proven” to provide a good protection from infection, however immune responses from a vaccine do fade with time, which means that boosters are needed.
Wash your hands
If your ill, prevent the spread by staying at home and avoiding group gatherings where you can spread the disease by accident.
Vaccines:
Vaccines “DO NOT” cause Autism. Autism is not a disease.
Vaccines “DO NOT” have mercury in them. Mercury is not a preservative.
Diagnosis & Treatments
“Always consult a medical professional before treating illness on your own, home made remedies may not have the desired effect and may make the illness-symptoms worse”
If you have been in contact with someone with whooping cough early in their illness “first 3 weeks” they are infectious and you may have been exposed. Watch for symptoms and see your doctor if a new cough begins. Some babies and some pregnant women need antibiotics to prevent whooping cough infection if they have had significant contact “family member” with an infectious person.
“In Alberta Canada you can contact “811” to contact the Alberta Health Link, a Registered Nurse or Paramedic will help you with treatments and options, they may also refer to you to bring the child into a Hospital for treatment.”
In any emergency just remember to Protect Yourself!!! Call 911!!! Don’t Waste Time!!!

CROUP
August 18, 2017 jason
Croup is a very common illness that affects children and has the potential to be mild in symptoms or even dangerous to life threatening if it goes untreated. Children from the ages of 6 months to 3 years have a chance of contracting “Croup” on average once or twice and can be linked to other “respiratory illness“. It is always a good measure for Parents and Guardians to take “all” respiratory illness” as serious and seek further medical advice, “We need to breath to live”
Croup is an infection that causes swelling of the voice box “larynx” and windpipe “trachea“, making the airway just below the vocal cords inflamed, swollen and narrow. This makes breathing both noisy and difficult. There are two main types of Croup and as such must be seen as “Infectious”
Different Types of Croup
Viral Croup – This is the most common type of Croup and is the result of viral infection in the voice box or airway, Temperatures range from low fever to 39C/104F. Often Viral Croup will start with a cold that slowly turns into a “Barking Cough”. The child’s voice will become hoarse with noisy breathing “Stridor”.
“Stridor” is the coarse musical sound that comes with breathing through an inflamed-swollen airway. The danger of “Croup with Stridor sounds” is that the airway is continuing to swell. If this happens it may reach a point when your child cannot breath at all. “Stridor” should always be assessed by a physician to prevent the danger of a closed airway. Stridor is common with mild Croup and increases with activity or crying, however if Stridor persists while the child is resting, it can be a sign of severe Croup and you must seek medical aid. Stridor may also be a sign of a serous breathing problem such as Epiglottitis.
Spasmodic Croup – This form of Croup is caused by a mild upper respiratory infection or even an “Allergy” normally no fever is present. This is the scariest form of Croup as it has a “sudden” onset and often presents in the middle of the night. The child will go to bed with mild “Cold” like symptoms then wake up gasping for breath with hoarse beathing, a barking cough and “stridor”. As the child’s effort to breath increases their energy levels will decrease, they may even stop eating or drinking and eventually become “too tired to cough“, if this is the case “seek medical attention immediately“
Treatments
“Always consult a medical professional before treating illness on your own, home made remedies may not have the desired effect and may make the illness-symptoms worse”
If your child wakes up in the middle of the night with Croup, take them into the bathroom, close the door, then turn on the shower on the hottest setting “Do not put them in the shower“. The “Steam” from the shower is what you need for over 15-20 minutes, this will help ease the symptoms as you sit in the bathroom with the child. “The child will still have the barking cough though”,
For the rest of the night “and 2 to 3 nights after“, try to use a “cold” water vaporizer or humidifier in your child’s room. Your child may have another attack of Croup even within the same night, if they do repeat the shower steam treatment. Steam almost always works, if it does not, try fresh night air and open up the window of their room “wide“. If the child still persists with coarse hoarse breaths and Strider contact your local Medical Professional.
“In Alberta Canada you can contact “811” to contact the Alberta Health Link, a Registered Nurse or Paramedic will help you with treatments and options, they may also refer to you to bring the child into a Hospital for treatment.”
In any emergency just remember to Protect Yourself!!! Call 911!!! Don’t Waste Time!!!

There are many reason’s why you may hold back from helping someone in an emergency, fear of infection, fear of Liability, fear of repercussions or even fear of helping in the wrong way.
Within our First Aid programs we touch on many subjects like the “Rule of 3’s“, this rule is simple and can help you see the benefit of early CPR and Emergency Response. To sum up the “Rule of 3’s“, on average, how many weeks can a human service without food? “3 weeks” On Average, how many days can a human survive without Water “3 Days“. On Average how many minutes does your brain have without Oxygen before damage occurs? “3 Minutes” NOW – How long does it take for an Ambulance to arrive? For this reason you can see how easy it can be for Paramedics and Emergency Response personnel to arrive to late, CPR is in “YOUR” hands.
Just remember that in Alberta you are “NOT” obligated to perform any act of First Aid even if you are certified. However we do hope that you would help or at the very least Call 911.

Behavioral & Mental Emergencies
June 23, 2017 jason
As a First Aid Responder or Family member you may be faced with someone going through a psychological or behavioral crisis. This is a very traumatic event for not only the patient but the rescuer as well. This crisis may be due to a medical condition, mental illness, mind-altering substances, stress, genetic disorders and so many other causes. For this post we will discuss various kinds of behavioral emergencies. “Overdoses, Suicide attempts, violent outbursts, depression, anxiety, inability to cope or understand the actions of others” are all forms of a Behavioral Emergencies. Lets go over what First Aid measures you may be able to implement during this emergency and what care may be required in these situations.
“Never attempt to help a casualty of substance misuse & abuse with your “bare hands“, always ensure your Personal Protection Equipment is on before you help. Avoid secondary exposure as you may suffer adverse effects if you come into contact with the substance”
Myth Bust:
Everyone experiences an emotional crisis at some point in their life, some more severe than others. Perfectly healthy people may have some of the symptoms and signs of mental illness from time to time. Therefore, “you should not assume that you have a mental illness when you behave in certain ways“, for this reason “Please avoid” assumptions about a patient in any given situation. Emotional crisis’s in healthy individuals is normally short lived and can be coped with by following simple steps to overcome the situation that may seem overwhelming. Its “when an individual has repeated instances of the same pattern that leads to repeated emotional crisis situations, there may be a need to consult a medical professional“.
“The most common misconception about mental illness is that if you are feeling “bad” or “depressed” or “blue” you must be sick!” This is simply untrue, there are many perfectly justifiable reasons for feeling depressed, one part of our “Five Coping Stages” is actually “Depression”, – Denial – Anger – Bargaining – Depression – Acceptance are all natural forms of coping with emotional emergencies, each person is unique and will go through these five stages at their own pace and order.
What is a Behavioural or Mental Crisis?
The definition of a behavioral crisis or mental emergency is “any” prolonged or repeated reactions to events that interfere with “Normal Daily Living” or has behavior that is unacceptable to the patient, family, or community. For example, when someone has an interruption of their daily routine, such as washing, dressing, eating, sleeping. Conversely a “Psychiatric Emergency” includes outbursts of rage, disconnection from feelings or reality, feeling numb or anxiety and panicked over small matters that others would see as a daily chore. Behavioral emergencies that recur on a regular basis may be considered a “Mental Health crisis“, consult a medical professional for more details.
“Having a Mental Disorder does not make you “Broken”, “Defective”, “Unfit”, “Useless”, “Dangerous” or any less of a person than others around you.” Thoughts or feelings that lead you to believe you are, or if you believe that your “Overwhelmed and unable to cope” with the stresses around you “There is no point“, “ I’m all alone“ or that “nobody would care if I just disappeared” consult a professional. They may be able to help in ways that you have not considered before. Not all emotional emergencies require medications. Medications “Assist” the healing process, if you believe that the medication you are using is not working “Consult your Physician” before you stop taking your medication or adjust your dosage. You may feel good right now, but without the continued assistance of certain medical aids you may find your emotional state revert back to its previously undesirable state.
What to watch for:
People going through a “Behavioral Crisis” or even a “Psychiatric Emergency” may present in many different ways, each person is unique and will experience the emergency differently,:
Some may seem distant “in a different world”
Disconnected
Numb to the world and those around them
Depressed with no end in sight
Have extreme bouts of sadness with the inability to be consoled
Agitated or violent with or without provocation
Threaten harm to themselves or others
Extreme habit changes to their daily routine, eating, sleeping, hygiene, dressing
Altered level of consciousness
How to help with a Behavioural or Mental Crisis:
Check the area, once the area is safe, Check the person and ensure the persons ABC’s are present “Airway / Breathing / Circulation” REMEMBER – Wear gloves if available to avoid bodily fluids or powdered chemical on their clothing / skin.
Call 911 and get an AED if you are alone, you suspect a Head / Neck or Spine injury, there is a motor vehicle collision, the person is allergic or the injured persons life could be at risk. “911 will also try to help with specific questions and techniques that may help you, help the patient in this difficult situation.“
Care for the Behavioral or Mental Crisis by:
Always follow recommendations by your Emergency Response professionals and 911 Dispatch personnel. “Never endanger yourself or the victim, you may “not” need to move or roll the injured person”
If there are other life threatening injuries, treat those first as quickly as possible with as little movement to the injured person.
While you wait for an Ambulance:
a) Be prepared to spend extra time, it may take longer to assess, listen to, and prepare the patient going through the Behavioral or Mental Crisis that they may need further medical help than you can provide.
b) Have a definitive plan of action, “Never” endanger yourself, if the patient looks like they could become agitated or hostile, just stand back, give them space, and have others help you if possible “Never do this alone” if possible. You may find yourself confronted by a hostile individual that may not be able to control their actions, or they may use the time spent alone with you to “alter“ the events that took place when medical professionals arrive. “They may try to blame you, or make you the one experiencing the Behavioral or Mental Crisis” This is a defense mechanism as they do not wish to be judged or harmed.
c) Identify yourself calmly and speak in a low, calm tone. “Avoid shouting, cornering or blame for previous incidence”
d) Be Direct “State your intentions” calmly
e) Stay with them – If you fear that they may hurt themselves, politely stay close to them and let them know that you are going to be there for them should they need you.
f) Encourage purposeful movement, help the patient gather appropriate belongings to take to the hospital.
g) Express interest in their story, If they are comfortable enough to confide in you about the crisis “Just listen” Avoid judgement or offering advice from your own personal opinion “Just listen”.
h) Keep a safe distance “Everyone needs personal space” know the cues, if they pull away, act indifferent, or get agitated with your presence. Keep your distance, you might inadvertently cause more anxiety by being to close.
I) Avoid fighting with them, If you know the patient, respond with understanding to the feelings they are expressing, whether this is anger, fear, or desperation “Just listen”
j) Be honest and reassuring, if they ask whether they should go to the hospital, simply answer “yes”, its better to err on the side of caution and get help rather than let things take a turn for the worse. Your medical professionals will help you with this once they arrive.
k) Do not judge. You may see behavior that you dislike, set those feelings aside, and concentrate on providing emergency care.
Provide continual care and “Never” endanger yourself, some victims of a Behavioral or Mental crisis may also be subjected to a substance misuse & abuse emergency and may become combative and will be unaware of who you are even if they know you well.
While you wait for an Ambulance: “Ask them if they wish to sit or lay in a position of comfort”
RECOVERY Position:
Kneel Beside the victim and place the victims furthest arm from you above their head.
Place the arm closest to you across the victims chest as a protector arm.
The Key is in their Knee, bend the nearest leg up at the knee.
Carefully slip your hand under the hollow of the victims neck to support the Head Neck & Spine, at the same time use your forearm by slipping it carefully under the shoulder for leverage.
Place your free hand on the Key Knee and gently roll the victim away from you by applying steady pressure against the knee and shoulder at the same time. The victims head should rest on their raised arm.
To secure the position pull the key knee further up and bring their protector arm out to use the elbow to stabilize the position.
Check the Airway to make sure their still breathing.
In any emergency just remember to Protect Yourself!!! Call 911!!! Don’t Waste Time!!!

Basic Life Support Provider “BLS for HCP’s CPR-C & AED”
June 2, 2017 jason
As of 2015 Health Care Professionals across Canada have had new guidelines and updates released to maintain a high level of education and medical practice. One such course that “All” Health Care Providers need “at any level” is the ‘Basic Life Support Provider “BLS for HCP’s CPR-C & AED” course taught through the Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada. This program gives many additional techniques that all Health Care Providers can implement during their CPR practice to boost resuscitation rates to their peek.
Basic Life Support Provider is also known as BLS for HCP’s, or Basic Cardiac Life Support “BCLS“.
At this time Alberta Health Services “requires” all Health Care Providers to maintain a current level of Basic Life Support Provider CPR-C & AED through the Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada.
Public level CPR “VS” HCP Level CPR:
For many programs taught for the General Public CPR is provided almost identically as it would be if you were a Health Care Professional. However, the differences are slight but very important to recognize. One such alteration we find quite commonly asked about is “Do we give breaths anymore?” To answer this question think of this, “If you car ran out of gas, what would it do? it would quit right?, now can you start it again? No….. Not without adding more gas right?” Humans are almost identical in this fashion as you are a “Biological Machine” with Oxygen being your main source of fuel. If you do not give the patient any fuel how could you start their engine? We do understand however that “Barrier Devices – Pocket Masks” may not be available, so for this post we will include the “Compression’s Only CPR” guideline so that it can be better understood. Health Care Providers are “Required” to be able to give a breath to their patients with a multitude of devices.
Additional Skills for Health Care Providers include:
Jaw Thrust
Pulse Check
Bag Valve Mask
Rescue Breathing
2 Rescuer CPR
– JAW THRUST – “Requires 2 people” If you think a person might have a Head Neck or spine injury, use a “Jaw Thrust” to open the airway instead of a “Head Tilt Chin Lift“
a) At the head of the patient place the fingers of both hands on the angles of the jaw following the mandible
b) Lift the jaw forward while keeping gentle pressure on the cheeks to keep the head from moving off the ground
c) have your partner place their Pocket mask or BVM over the persons mouth and nose and give breaths while you maintain the Jaw Thrust.
– PULSE CHECK – HCP only skill, the general public is not required to know how to check the pulse, instead they will focus on breathing.
“To perform a Pulse check on an Adult / Child:”
a) Find the middle of the person’s throat “Adam’s Apple“
b) Slide your fingers into the groove at the side of the neck closest to you and slight draw up “You should feel a pulsation against your fingertips ” 5-10 seconds.
“To perform a Pulse check on an infant:”
a) Place one or two fingers on the underside of the baby’s arm halfway between the elbow and the shoulder
b) Gently push in against the upper arm bone while holding your thumb back.”You should feel a pulsation against your fingertips” 5-10 seconds.
– BAG VALVE MASK – “Requires 2 people” A “Bag-Valve-Mask” has three parts, a bag, a valve and a mask. To use the BVM:
a) at the head of the patient place the mask over the face using the bridge of the nose as a guide
b) SLIP your “thump and Index finger” against the top of the mask to the opposite side of your palm
c) Turn your palm down and GRIP the mandible with your remaining 3 fingers pinching your thumb and index finger down against the mask
d) FLIP the chin back into a “Head Tilt Chin Lift” opening the airway, wait for your cues as your partner delivers high quality CPR and give two breaths by squeezing the bag when you are ready looking for a “chest rise”
– RESCUE BREATHING – A “Rescue Breath” is given when you find a patient who is “NOT” breathing but “DOES” have a pulse. This may be due to Toxic Gas Inhalation, Impact to the chest, pulmonary edema, asthma, pneumonia and so on. To give a rescue breath:
a) With a BVM or a Pocket Mask if you do not hear normal breathing
b) Give one breath ever 6 seconds for an “Adult” or give one breath ever 3 seconds for a “Child / Infant“.
c) If there is a pulse, continue rescue breathing for two minutes, check for signs of circulation and normal breathing for no longer that 5-10 seconds, if there is circulation but no breathing continue rescue breathing until further medical help arrives.
– TWO RESCUER CPR – For the HCP Health Care Provider only, your Basic Life Support Provider program will integrate team’s of 2-5 to boost chances of resuscitation by splitting the positions into tasks. This also comes with a difference in Age groups as well, to make this simple Saving Grace Medical Academy has come up with a pair of rhymes to help you see what we are doing.
POEM OF 1 “Single Rescuer”
If your by yourself always DO thirty and TWO, if its just you what should you do? 30 & 2 for “All Age Groups“. Remember Its “30 Compression’s & 2 Breaths repeated 5 Times” or “Its 30 & 2 X 5 to keep ALL HUMANS ALIVE”
POEM OF 2 “Team Rescue”

Substance Misuse & Abuse
May 29, 2017 jason
Many substances, such as alcohol, drugs and even medications can be used improperly. When these substances are misused or abused, they poison the body. Some people may unfortunately be exposed to these chemicals while attempting to help, as many illicit substances can be absorbed through your skin. As medical technology advances so does our ability to counteract these situations, consult your local medical centers for information on “Rehabilitation, Addiction and local protocols on medications that can help counteract drugs.”
“Never attempt to help a casualty of substance misuse & abuse with your “bare hands“, always ensure your Personal Protection Equipment is on before you help. Avoid secondary exposure as you may suffer adverse effects if you come into contact with the substance”
Common illicit Substances:
Stimulants
Hallucinogens
Depressants
Designer Drugs
– STIMULANTS – Stimulants affect your brain and nervous system to speed up physical and mental activity “Speed” Many stimulants are taken as pills, but some can be absorbed or inhaled.
– HALLUCINOGENS – Hallucinogens cause changes in mood, sensation, thought, emotion, and self-awareness “Shrooms, Fentanyl” They can cause intense fear, panic, paranoid delusions, vivid hallucinations, deep depression, tension and anxiety.
– DEPRESSANTS – Depressants send signals to your brain and nerves that slow down physical and mental activity. “Alcohol, THC” They make you drowsy and impair your coordination and judgment, alcohol is the most widely used and abused depressant in Canada.
– DESIGNER DRUGS – Designer drugs do not fit into any of the categories mentioned above, they are chemically altered versions of medical drugs, such as “narcotics” and “amphetamines”. The effects can be unpredictable and dangerous. One of the more commonly used designer drugs is “Ectasy“.
– ALCOHOL POISONING – Alcohol impairs your judgment, slows down your reflexes, and makes driving unsafe. Just two drinks in less than an hour can create unsafe levels of alcohol in the blood of an average 72.5 kilo / 160 lb person. “Don’t Drink & Drive“
What to watch for:
Like other poisons, the general signs and symptoms of substance misuse and abuse are similar to those of other medical emergencies.
Moist or flushed skin, Sweating, chills or fever, nausea or vomiting, changes in breathing, seizures, changes in level of consciousness, altered mental status, hallucinations, low body temperature
Prevention:
Many people trapped within the world of substance misuse and abuse are seeking shelter within the sensation they achieve after they use. The temporary relief they get from their current situations is what drives them to continue to use, they see it often as a way to alleviate the symptoms of their “pain, anxiety, depression, past trauma” or even to blend in with the crowd “Peer pressure” is also a common reason why some may be trapped within the use of illicit substances.
Drug prevention programs are readily available in all country’s around the world and offer a wide range of help for those who may be affected. The Naloxone Project is a project sponsored by Health Canada to help stem the flow of overdoses associated with “Fentanyl“, for more information on how to help visit your local medical center or drugs and addictions counseling center.
How to help with Substance Misuse & Abuse:
Check the area, once the area is safe, Check the person and ensure the persons ABC’s are present “Airway / Breathing / Circulation” REMEMBER – Wear gloves if available to avoid bodily fluids or powdered chemical on their clothing / skin.
Call 911 and get an AED if you are alone, you suspect a Head / Neck or Spine injury, there is a motor vehicle collision, the person is allergic or the injured persons life could be at risk. “911 will link you to the Poison Control Center if you do not have the number.”
Care for the Substance Misuse & Abuse by:
Always follow recommendations by your Emergency Response professionals and 911 Dispatch personnel. “Never endanger yourself or the victim, you may “not” need to move or roll the injured person”
If there are other life threatening injuries, treat those first as quickly as possible with as little movement to the injured person.
While you wait for an Ambulance:
a) You do not need to know exactly what substance the person has taken, just keep an eye on “Breathing / Skin Color / Temperature / Sweating / Behavior.“
b) Provide continual care and “Never” endanger yourself, some victims of substance misuse & abuse may become combative and will be unaware of who you are even if they know you well.
While you wait for an Ambulance:
RECOVERY Position:
Kneel Beside the victim and place the victims furthest arm from you above their head.
Place the arm closest to you across the victims chest as a protector arm.
The Key is in their Knee, bend the nearest leg up at the knee.
Carefully slip your hand under the hollow of the victims neck to support the Head Neck & Spine, at the same time use your forearm by slipping it carefully under the shoulder for leverage.
Place your free hand on the Key Knee and gently roll the victim away from you by applying steady pressure against the knee and shoulder at the same time. The victims head should rest on their raised arm.
To secure the position pull the key knee further up and bring their protector arm out to use the elbow to stabilize the position.
Check the Airway to make sure their still breathing.
In any emergency just remember to Protect Yourself!!! Call 911!!! Don’t Waste Time!!!
