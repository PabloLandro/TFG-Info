Never Feel Threatened by Asthma Anymore with These Yoga Poses for Better Breathing
With the focus on breathing that yoga has, everyone who has had experience with it will surely say its benefits include reducing the symptoms of asthma. And indeed many kinds of research have been done to establish the connection between these two. There is the number of evidence that show some yoga poses for better breathing are quite effective.
Let us find out what these are and practice it in our lives so we will never feel worried and manage ourselves when asthma strikes again.
Yoga Poses and Its Effect on Asthma
Can yoga help with asthma? While there is no concrete answer to this question, many who practice yoga and exercise their inhalation and exhalation techniques, do find relief for their airway problems. But more specifically, this question can be answered by the results of recent studies done to find out what benefits yoga has to asthma patients.
There is moderate evidence that yoga improves the overall quality of life in people with asthma.
Unfortunately, there is not enough evidence that to prove that yoga can improve lung function and reduce the need for medication.
However, there are certain yoga poses, such as the “pranayama”, that helps release suppressed emotion, reduce anxiety and self-consciousness, and relax muscle tension. All these can help asthma patients breathe better.
Meditation is also known to help people with asthma improve their airways and respiratory muscles.
All these results somehow show how yoga affects people with asthma. While there is no significant evidence showing how yoga reduces the incidence of the condition. The need for medications, management of it can be achieved with certain yoga poses.
And how do you do yoga for asthma? Specifically, the pranayama pose?
Pranayama is the formal practice of controlling the breath. Some of the poses in this practice include the natural breath, the sahita pranayama, and the bhramari.
With the natural breath, you simply breathe in and notice thoughts as they arise. Then, you breathe out and notice thoughts as they dissipate.
The sahita pranayama lets you practice holding your breath until you settle into stillness. But not to the point of discomfort.
The bhramari, on the other hand, creates homeostasis of the mind and body by inhaling. Through the nostrils and exhaling while producing the buzzing sound of the bee.
These are just a few practices in yoga that can help you achieve better breathing.
