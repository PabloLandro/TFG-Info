Yoga for beginners
4-minute read

What is yoga?
Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing.
The main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing.
The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago, and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now common in community centres, gyms, health clubs, schools and hospitals.
What are the health benefits of yoga?
Dozens of scientific trials of varying quality have been published on yoga. While there's scope for more rigorous studies on yoga's health benefits, most studies suggest that yoga is a safe and effective way to increase physical activity, especially strength, flexibility and balance.
There's evidence that regular yoga practice is beneficial for people with high blood pressure, heart disease, aches and pains, including low back pain, depression and stress.
Reviews of clinical trials over the past 20 years show that yoga can significantly improve pain, disability and mood in people with persistent pain.
Can yoga help prevent falls?
Yoga improves balance by strengthening your lower body, in particular your ankles and knees, thereby reducing your chances of falling. However, falls may sometimes be caused by a health condition, in which case it's a good idea to see your doctor.
Can yoga help with arthritis?
Yoga is popular with people with arthritis for its gentle way of promoting flexibility and strength. Some research suggests that yoga can reduce pain and mobility problems in people with knee osteoarthritis. However, some yoga moves aren't suitable for people with arthritis. Find a teacher who understands arthritis and can adapt movements for individual needs, especially if you have replacement joints. Check with a doctor or physiotherapist to find out if there are any movements to avoid.
Am I too old for yoga?
Definitely not. People often start yoga in their 70s and often say they wish they had started sooner. There are yoga classes for every age group. Yoga is a form of exercise that can be enjoyed from childhood to your advanced years.
Do I have to be fit to do yoga?
You can join a class that's suitable for your fitness level. For example, to join a mixed ability yoga class, you need to be able to get up and down from the floor. Some yoga classes are chair-based.
Don't I need to be flexible to do yoga?
Not necessarily. Yoga will improve your flexibility and help you go beyond your normal range of movement, so that you then feel more comfortable during normal daily activity.
Can I injure myself doing yoga?
The most common yoga injuries are caused by repetitive strain or overstretching. But yoga is the same as any other exercise discipline. It is perfectly safe if taught properly by people who understand it, and have experience. Learning from a qualified yoga teacher and choosing a class appropriate to your level will ensure that you remain injury-free.
What style of yoga should I do?
There are many different styles of yoga, such as Ashtanga, Iyengar and Sivananda. Some styles are more vigorous than others. Some may have a different area of emphasis, such as posture or breathing. Many yoga teachers develop their own practice by studying more than one style. No style is necessarily better or more authentic than any other. The key is to choose a class appropriate to your fitness level.
What type of class should I look out for?
Classes can vary in duration. A longer class will give you more time for learning the breathing and relaxation, and will give the teacher time to work with your individual ability. It’s best to speak to the teacher before you attend your first class to make sure the style of yoga will be suitable for you.
Where can I find a yoga class?
Many local community centres and gyms will offer yoga, or you can look at the yoga Australia list of members at Yoga Australia to find a professional teacher in your area, or the directory FindYoga which lists over 2,000 yoga teachers, classes and courses available.
Can I use a book or a yoga DVD instead of going to a class?
It's better to start with a class to learn the poses and breathing techniques correctly. With a DVD, there will be nobody to correct your mistakes, which may lead to injury over time. With some experience of being in a class, a DVD can then be helpful for keeping up practice.

Yoga for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease | Cochrane
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of early cardiovascular-related illness and death in most developed countries. Secondary prevention is a term used to describe interventions that aim to prevent repeat cardiac events and death in people with established CHD. Individuals with CHD are at the highest risk of coronary events and death. Lifestyle modifications play an important role in secondary prevention. Yoga has been regarded as both a type of physical activity and a stress management strategy. The physical and psychological benefits of yoga are well accepted, yet inappropriate practice of yoga may lead to musculoskeletal injuries, such as muscle soreness and strain. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention in CHD in terms of cardiac events, death, and health-related quality of life. We found no randomised controlled trials which met the inclusion criteria for this review. Therefore, the effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention in CHD remains uncertain. High-quality randomised controlled trials are needed.

Yoga to prevent cardiovascular disease | Cochrane
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global health burden. Nevertheless, it is thought that the risk of CVD can be lowered by changing a number of risk factors, such as by increasing physical activity and using relaxation to reduce stress, both of which are components of yoga. This review assessed the effectiveness of any type of yoga in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD.

Yoga as an additional treatment option for people with asthma | Cochrane
Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects about 300 million people worldwide. Yoga, the popularity of which has expanded globally, has the potential to relieve some asthma-related problems. However, the effects of yoga for asthma need to be confirmed due to the inconsistent findings of existing studies.

Yoga for epilepsy | Cochrane
Epilepsy is a disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic drugs but sometimes seizures develop which are resistant to those drugs. People may also wish to try non-drug treatments such as yoga. Between 25% and 40% of people with epilepsy treated with AED have uncontrolled seizure, experience adverse effect from medication, suffer from stigmatisation and have a higher degree of psychiatric disorders as compared with people with other chronic illnesses. For those who have epilepsy and related problems it is important to develop, evaluate, and implement a complementary treatment model in the everyday treatment of epilepsy.

Yoga in addition to standard care for people with blood or lymph node cancer | Cochrane
Blood and lymph node cancers are referred to as haematological malignancies. These are types of cancer that affect the blood, bone marrow and other parts of the lymphatic system. The most common ones are lymphomas, leukaemias and myelomas. Depending on the kind of cancer and how far it has spread, there are a lot of different options to manage the disease. Usually chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of both is used to treat the disease. If the cancer is widespread, a transplantation of the patients own bone marrow cells combined with an aggressive chemotherapy can be a treatment option.

Happiness
The term happiness captures a huge variety of positive emotional responses, including such things as cheerfulness, serenity, optimism, and joy. Throughout history, philosophers, religious writers and poets have pondered on the meaning of happiness and how it might be achieved. More recently, scientists, psychologists and even politicians, have joined the pursuit.

Breathing exercises for asthma | Cochrane
Asthma is a lung disease, that comprises underlying inflammation and tightening of the small tubes in the airways (called airway obstruction), which occurs in response to asthma triggers such as animal danders or pollen (also called bronchial hyperresponsiveness). The high prevalence of asthma worldwide is a major public health problem because of the high healthcare costs associated with hospitalisation and medication. Breathing exercises are a non-pharmacological intervention that has been used routinely in the treatment of patients with asthma.Breathing exercises aim to control the hyperventilation symptoms of asthma and can be performed as the Papworth Method, the Buteyko breathing technique, yoga or any other similar intervention that manipulates the breathing pattern.

Breathing exercises for children with asthma | Cochrane
Asthma is a chronic (persistent) inflammatory disease of the lungs that can lead to airflow obstruction (blockage) causing difficulty in breathing. The worldwide high prevalence of asthma has become a public health problem due to the great healthcare costs resulting from hospitalisation and medicines. Moreover, asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. Breathing exercises are a non-drug treatment that have been routinely used in the treatment of people with asthma. Breathing exercises aim to control the hyperventilation (overbreathing) symptoms of asthma and can include the Papworth method, Buteyko breathing technique, yoga or any other similar method that focusses on changing the breathing pattern.

Exercise therapy for fatigue in multiple sclerosis | Cochrane
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting over 1.3 million people globally. MS is characterized by diffuse damage to the central nervous system, leading to a wide range of different physical and cognitive (mental processes) symptoms. One of the most prominent and disabling symptoms of MS is fatigue. Currently, there is no effective medicine to reduce fatigue in people with MS. Treatment with exercise may be a way to reduce fatigue either directly by changing how the body works, for example hormonal function, or indirectly through improved physical activity and general health.

Relaxation therapy for preventing and treating preterm labour | Cochrane
Preterm birth, before 37 completed weeks' gestation, is likely to have an effect on a baby's survival and health. Adverse outcomes for the baby include respiratory distress syndrome, infections, congenital heart defects and thermoregulation problems. Womans psychological stress during pregnancy may be a predictor of preterm labour and preterm birth. We investigated the effectiveness of relaxation or mind-body therapies such as meditation, massage, yoga, reflexology, breathing exercises, visualization, music therapy and aromatherapy, etc. for preventing or treating preterm labour or preventing preterm birth. We searched the medical literature for the information from clinical studies and found 11 randomized controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. We included 11 studies randomising a total of 833 women, although nearly all the results we report are based on single studies with small numbers of participants. We were unable to pool the findings in any meta-analyses due to each study using different forms of relaxation in different comparisons, to prevent preterm births in seven studies and to treat preterm labour in five with insufficient information. No valid conclusion can be summarized from this review. For women not in preterm labour, relaxation therapy (alone or combined with standard treatment) reduced maternal stress compared with routine prenatal care and increased birthweight with fewer cesarean deliveries in a single study. For women in preterm labour, there was no evidence of benefits or harms. More rigorous studies are required in order to assess the effects of relaxation therapies in preventing and treating preterm labour.
