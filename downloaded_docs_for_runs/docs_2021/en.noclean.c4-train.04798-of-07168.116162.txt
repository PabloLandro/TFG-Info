II. Pathophysiology
Achilles tendon forms from the union of gastrocnemius and soleus tendons, and inserts into Calcaneus
Achilles-calf complex responsible for Running push-off
Allows for airborne phase of Running gait
Mechanism of Running Injury
Incorrect Running technique
Poorly fitting shoes
Over-pronation
Running on uneven surface
Rheumatologic Conditions predisposing to Tendonitis
Spondyloarthropathy
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Exacerbating factors
Inappropriate shoes for activity or high heel shoe wear in general
Fluoroquinolone use
Aging
Poor gastrocnemius and soleus muscle flexibility
Malalignment of lower extremity (e.g. Leg Length Discrepancy, Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction)
III. Etiology: Achilles tendon inflammation
Chronic overuse of calf muscle
Common overuse injury
Occurs in 10% of runners
New athletes to sport
Dancing
Gymnasts
Tennis Players
IV. Types
Midsubstance Achilles Tendinopathy
Tendinopathy superior to the insertional region
Most common, and more therapy responsive, especially with Eccentric Exercises (see toe raises below)
Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy
Tendinopathy in the 2-3 cm region at the insertion of the achilles tendon into the calcaneous
More refractory to treatment and often requires CAM Boot immobilization
V. Symptoms
Ache or sharp Heel Pain and stiffness at the mid-achilles tendon to insertion at calcaneous
Worse with strenuous Exercise
Better with walking
Uneven gait may result
VI. Signs
Inflammation at Achilles tendon (3-5 cm above calcaneal insertion) or at calcaneal insertion itself
Pain, local tenderness, and swelling (tendon thickening)
Gradual onset
Negative Thompson Test (differentiates from Achilles Tendon Rupture)
Dry crepitus may be present on palpation
Provocative maneuvers that aggravate pain
Passive Stretching of tendon (ankle dorsiflexion)
Lightly squeezing calf
Associated: Peritendinitis
Tendon sheath inflammation (2-6 cm above insertion)
Pain and burning worse with Exercise
Pain on rubbing tendon suggests Peritendinitis
VII. Imaging
Ankle XRay
May show spurring at the achilles tendon insertion
Ankle Ultrasound
May show achilles tendon thickening
VIII. Differential Diagnosis
See Heel Pain
Achilles Tendon Rupture
Retrocalcaneal Bursitis
IX. Management
Relative rest (may require off sport completely)
Limit runnng and other activities to flat, level ground
Avoid interval training (speed work)
Cross-train with non-impact actvitis (e.g. swimming, Bicycling)
Gentle Stretching and strengthening (avoid worsening injury)
Indicated in midsubstance Achilles Tendinopathy
May also be used for insertional Achilles Tendinopathy after initial immobilization for 4-6 weeks
Calf stretches and stregthening of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles with leg straight and bent
Includes slow warm-up before Exercise
Eccentric Exercises are most effective (muscle lengthening in response to external resistance)
Heel raises or lowering
Start
Both feet on first, lowest step of stair case or other platform
Ankles and foot start maximally plantar flexed, on tip toes
Heel raises with knees straight
Allow the affected foot and ankle's heel to drop below the level of the step
Maximally dorsiflexing the foot and ankle
Return to tip-toe position (maximally plantar flexed)
Heel raises with knees bent
Repeat toe raises as above, but now with knees flexed
Local Ice Therapy
Ice massage after activity for 20 minutes
NSAIDs for 10 days at initial symptom onset
Consider Orthotics or firm heel lift (1/8 to 3/8 inches)
Obtain correct Running Shoe (e.g. over-pronators)
Weight loss if over Ideal Weight
Consider physical therapy
Local Ultrasound (consider with Iontophoresis)
Flexibility and Strength Training
Assist with correcting biomechanics of sport
Short Leg Walking Cast or CAM Boot
Consider in persistent or refractory cases
Consider in insertional Achilles Tendinopathy for 4-6 weeks followed by Eccentric Exercises (see toe raises as above)
Avoid local Corticosteroid Injections
Risk of Achilles Tendon Rupture
Severe refractory cases
Consider Nitroglycerin patches
Consider platelet plasma injections
Consider extracorporeal shock wave therapy
Surgical debridement
X. Course
May persist for months
Athletes often require 4 weeks out of all sports
