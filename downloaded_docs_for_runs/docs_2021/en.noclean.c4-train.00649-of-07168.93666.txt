Can you remove a tick with essential oils?
May 19, 2017 | By Gail
I saw some interesting videos on Facebook using peppermint essential oil to remove a tick. It looked pretty easy and simple to do. Unfortunately it is not a safe way to remove a tick.
I really like using my essential oils to treat a lot of things. But I’m not going to use them to remove a tick. Using oils can actually expose you to more tick-borne illnesses.
When using essential oils; or vaseline, or a hot match head, the tick will release. But in the process of doing so it will regurgitate. Yup, that’s right – it will throw up into your skin. That is how you can increase your exposure to a tick-borne illness.
The best way to remove a tick is with tweezers or a tick spoon.
Save your essential oils to use proactively to prevent tick bites or after you remove the tick.
I am hosting a workshop on Friday May 26th. We will be making insect repellent, anti-itch spray, and after-sun spray, all with essential oils. Comment to RSVP.
