Should I give my child a sponge bath or a drawn bath to lower her fever? (ages 5 to 8)
Jo Ann Rohyans
pediatrician
Not usually. If your child has a temperature under 103 degrees F and is eating and acting okay, you don't need to do anything to bring his fever down. In fact, because a fever can help your child fight an infection, it's a good idea to let it run its course.
Of course, as your child's temperature climbs, it can make you nervous (especially if he's had a febrile seizure before) and him uncomfortable. If your child is really uncomfortable (so that he can't sleep, for example) and his fever is 103 degrees or higher, then I'd suggest you give him the appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to bring his fever down so that he — and you — can rest.
If fever-reducing medication isn't a good option for your child — because he's allergic to the medicine or doesn't take medicine very well, or you'd rather not give him any — a lukewarm bath or sponge bath won't hurt him, and it may help reduce his temperature. (Bathing a child with a fever was a common practice before these fever reducers were available.) Just make sure that the water is lukewarm to warm, not cool, because shivering can actually raise your child's temperature rather than help bring it down.
You might also find that your child enjoys a cool washcloth on his forehead. Alcohol baths used to be popular but are no longer recommended because they can cool your child too quickly, which can cause his temperature to spike dangerously.
Keep in mind, too, that bundling your child up can raise his temperature, so if you're trying to bring down his fever, don't pile on the clothes or the covers.
