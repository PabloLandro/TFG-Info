Ten Cooking Oil Burn Home Remedies and Treatments

I am one of those cooks who always ends up either burning or cutting myself carelessly. Cooking oil burns are painful. If you have burned yourself seriously and the skin is broken, here is what you should do:
Run cool water over the burned area for at least five minutes.
Apply antibiotic ointment gently.
Apply a bandage to protect the area from bacteria.
Consult a doctor.
If your burn covers your hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or a major joint, seek emergency assistance.
A cooking oil burn on the palm (note that skin is not broken.)
If the skin is broken, only apply cool water, antibiotic ointment, and a sterile bandage.
Hold the burned area under cool water for at least five minutes.
Cool water is the best immediate remedy for the pain of a burn. The coolness also helps reduce swelling. Do not use ice, as there is a risk of adding frostbite to your already injured skin. Also, some suggest using salt and ice on a burn. This is a dangerous combination, as salt and ice together can actually burn the skin further.
Honey and Turmeric
As long as the skin is not broken, massaging a bit of honey and turmeric powder can be soothing.
Cucumbers
Just as sliced cucumbers reduce swelling for tired, puffy eyes, they will cool and reduce swelling for minor burns. Cucumbers contain antioxidants (Vitamins C and K), which help reduce inflammation. They also contain pantothenic acid, which helps the skin retain moisture. All of these qualities are soothing to a minor burn.
Olive or Lavender Oil
Olive oil applied daily for a few weeks after a minor burn will help prevent scarring. Dilute lavender essential oil in a carrier is an efficient antiseptic and also acts as pain-relief that aids in quick healing, so long as the skin is not broken.
Cold Milk or Buttermilk
Cold milk, buttermilk, or curd soothes the pain and burning sensation in the affected area in a matter of minutes but should be avoided on broken skin.
Aloe Vera
This is my favorite remedy. To treat a burn, apply a freshly cut aloe leaf. It is said to have astringent and tissue-healing properties. Aloe vera is also available in gel and cream forms and is safe to apply on unbroken skin.
Vinegar
Diluted vinegar relaxes the muscles and relieves pain. Dip a piece of cloth in a bowl of diluted vinegar and apply. Keeping repeating it until the pain subsides.
Cooking Safely With Oil
To prevent a cooking oil fire, or grease fire, follow these safety guidelines to avoid injury to yourself or someone else who comes into the kitchen.
Cooking oils smoke before they catch fire. If you see smoke coming off of the oil you are cooking with, turn down the heat or remove the pan from the burner.
Most vegetable oils begin smoking at around 450°F, while animal fats like lard or goose fat will start smoking at around 375°F. Clip a thermometer to the side of your pan so you know the temperature of the oil.
When the heat is on under a pan of oil, stay in the kitchen. Use a heavy pot or pan with a lid that covers it completely.
Point pot and pan handles inward toward the stove.
Keep oven mitts handy to handle the pan and its lid.
Grease or Cooking Oil Fires
If your oil catches on fire, here's what to do:
Turn the Heat Off—Don't try to move the pot. You might accidentally splash yourself or your kitchen with burning oil.
Cover the Pot with a Metal Lid—Fire cannot exist in the absence of oxygen. With the lid on (and the heat off), the fire should quickly consume all the oxygen and put itself out.
Never Use Water on a Grease Fire—Water could splash and spread the fire.
Pour on Baking Soda—Baking soda will extinguish small grease fires.
Use a Class B Dry Chemical Fire Extinguisher

Afrin,
The toothpaste is used with an intention to subside the burning. Use aloe vera or turmeric paste for the scar reduction.

Hi Annec,
Apply aloe vera and turmeric paste as mentioned above in the article once a day each. Within two weeks you should see the results, depending on how deep the scars are.

I got a burn mark...a year ago....how to completely reduce it appearance??plz help
AUTHOR

Hi Pem,
Am glad it helped. If it happened couple of weeks ago, there might just be a mark left now. To make it fade faster, simply keep applying turmeric paste once a day and aloe vera gel.
If it still pains slightly then continue with aloe vera for few more days and then switch to turmeric paste.
Warm Regards,
Shivani

Hi Yuki,
As per my experience, it doesn't get rid of the burn. Ice just calms the nerves and burning sensation.

Hi Anesha,
You can use turmeric-curd paste twice a day; keep it for 15 minutes. If the affected area isn't too sensitive, then rub some lemon juice once a day. Leave on aloe vera gel over night.
Hope this helps!

Shivani

Hi Melissa,
Thank you for stopping by. Honestly, I have no experience in face burns. However, safest would be aloevera gel, turmeric-honey paste and neem gel/paste.
Let me know if it works.
Love,
Shivani

Thank you all for stopping by and leaving your comments. Like Ranan mentioned these tips are for superficial burns and quick remedies. For severe burns please see a doc!

For anon: if your skin is damaged to the point you can see the underlayer or you have blisters of course DO NOT USE HOME REMEDIES AND GO SEE A DAMN DOCTOR. Those listed above are remedies for when the burn is just superficial, like the one I just got - about 10 minutes ago. And yes, I'm writing, because it doesn't hurt as much and cool water helps a lot, just like aloe vera and cucumber.
That said, I found this article pretty helpful ^^

DO NOT USE ICE. DO NOT USE BUTTER/CUCUMBER/NON-STERILE HOME TREATMENTS. An infection will be much, much worse than just a burn. This article has some very dumb ideas...

Yeah, but holding your burn under cold water for too long can cause it to swell up. Otherwise, thanks for the tips. :)
