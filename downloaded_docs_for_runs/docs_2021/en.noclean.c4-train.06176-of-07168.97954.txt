The shaman's use of animal language, or pre-literate languages, and other ritualistic methods of communication, like music and drumming, have parallels in the 'different space' created by the therapist in his or her office. In therapy, different forms of communication, the formulaic 'text' of conventional analysis, the release of drumming, or rhythmic pounding, and music play therapy for small children may be used to help the patient touch base with his or her emotions. But while the shaman channels the stories of others, as a tribal storyteller who uses different forms of communication for a collective, therapists help patients tell stories about their daily live struggles on an individual basis.
For example, sometimes patient's life stories are ineffectual, like 'I am a failure' or 'my mother never loved me.' (Hart, p.203) Although the therapist provides a kind of objective voice, and directs the person's speech, even the environment of the…… [Read More]

According to this conception, the musical meaning of our Beethoven melody would lie in its expressing the feeling of joy, with power far exceeding that of Schiller's poem and of all words. The key to understanding the process that makes the tones of this melody a melody at all, a piece of music, we found not in the relation of the tones to any particular feeling but in the relation of the tone e to the tone d (Zuckerkandl, 1956).
Music and the "life" behind it is so interpretational. The more that I read the writings of Zuckerkandl I realize the significance of something as small as a tone. To truly understand how one piece of music can be interpreted in numerous ways by different people. One piece of music or even a small melody can invoke a conglomerate of emotions, from one person to another. There are pieces of…… [Read More]

This contrast in conjunction with the singer's frequent maniacal laughter summons an astonishingly clear image of a woman trapped within herself. Her laughter is crazed with fear and she repeats the words over and over again, unable to move beyond that singular point in time. Once again, a very complex idea is expressed that as quite transparent to analysis.
The final excerpt, entitled "Oh My Child" seems to be about the singer's mother. The beginning of the song steps up and down in adjacent eleventh chords, the dissonance symbolizing her confusion and doubt regarding her mother. Approximately thirty seconds into the song, the singer becomes very emotional, and over the next minute is often either in tears or close thereto. At two minutes, the singers seems to reach a broken catharsis, purging herself of old resentments. The piano remains extremely unobtrusive throughout this time, indicative of the arduous process of…… [Read More]

However, this was when the musical elements that were so deeply rooted into my belief system, into my very soul started to appear and I began to clearly recognize that it was possible to pursue the existence of something even stronger and deeper in the world of art, more specifically in the world created by sounds.
Possessing both a keen ability to observe and a very strong aptitude to recall images from memory, I identified the two forces to support my belief that there was something more that would drive me toward the pursuit of self-satisfaction and career enhancement. As the ability of my piano students grew, I noticed that what was happening was much more than simply learning how to interpret a musical piece by Bach or a sonata by Handel. It was the expansion of their emotional and psychological expression as a whole. Something was blossoming; it was…… [Read More]

Music in the therapeutic context is, as Ansdell puts it, "neither pure feeling nor pure form," (128). Rather, music opens the door for a dialogue and communication between client and therapist that might otherwise never occur.
As with any form of creative expression, music ultimately depends on an audience. Otherwise, music cannot be used in a therapeutic setting because the medium is instrumental in helping the client "to get beyond this bubble of self," (126). Yet while the creator, or in the psychotherapeutic setting, the client, is undoubtedly using the medium of music for self-expression, the therapist should take care not to over-speculate about the "product." Music can be a symbolic "language of feeling," as Langer explains, but that language of feeling could take years to decipher (221). If the therapist infers that a drone piece created by the client denotes sadness then the therapist infers too much and does…… [Read More]

Music is sound, which enters the outer ear and passes through the middle ear into the inner ear and the brain by means of electrical energy. In the brain, it can generate motor responses, draw emotions, release hormones and trigger higher-order processes. The brain develops its response as it perceives the sound. If a loud sound creates fright, calm music can soothe.
Records on music therapy date as far back as Aristotle and Plato. Egyptian and iblical documents also bear out that music was used to lighten illness and sorrow. American and European researchers in 1800 discovered the connection between music and the states of the body and the mind. They measured the connection in terms of cardiac output, rate of breathing, pulse and blood pressure. Numerous studies on the effect of music on health have been conducted since the 80s.

Melanie's frequency of inappropriate behavior was not consistent; she experienced unpredictable increases and decreases in hair pulling, screaming, scratching, and tantrum behavior.
The study occurred in a self-contained classroom for children and youth with autism, which was housed within the special education department of a large state medical center. The classroom included four students, one certified classroom teacher, and three paraprofessionals. Students received one-on-one instruction; group instruction; speech-language, music, art, and adaptive physical education; and occupational therapy
An ABAB design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of rhythmic entrainment as a calming technique.

Pain & Therapy
The purpose of this research is to investigate whether music therapy intervention can reduce the effects of pain in subjects who have chronic pain from minor injuries. This research builds on past investigations of the potential role of music in pain therapy. There are often significant side effects to the use of pharmacological treatments for chronic pain, so it is important to evaluate properly any potential alternatives to such treatments. The null hypothesis for this study is that music therapy can reduce the pain experienced by patients. The alternative hypothesis is that music therapy is unproven as a means of pain reduction in patients suffering from chronic pain.
The literature shows that music therapy might be able to relieve pain from those who suffer from chronic pain, but there is not yet a substantial body of evidence to support this conclusion. The study will seek to add…… [Read More]

Effects of Music Therapy on Psychiatric Patients
Music therapy can be defined as such: "the controlled use of the influence of music on the human being to aid in physiological, psychological, and emotional integration of the individual during the treatment of an illness or disease" (Choi, Lee, & Lim 2008). Within music therapy there is an active and a passive form. In active music therapy, the patient is involved in playing an instrument or using the voice as an instrument. In passive music therapy the patient is at rest, envisioning peaceful images while listening to music (2008). The usual course of treatment for psychiatric patients consists of medication and psychotherapy, but in patients with severe mental illness, these types of treatment oftentimes have very limited effects. Psychotherapy requires that patients not only be intellectually able to benefit from it but also they must be motivated…… [Read More]

Music therapy involves incorporating music into therapist-patient relationship development for promoting the latter's physiological, psychological, emotional and social health. One can consider music therapy to be a part of creative arts treatment, clinical treatment, or supplementary treatment relative to the conventional medical model. It encompasses numerous techniques such as playing a musical instrument, singing a song, listening to music and improvisation (McCaffrey 42). Autism spectrum disorder represents a lasting developmental disability which evolves at different levels of severity. The condition has been marked by the following three key characteristics: challenges when it comes to forging social bonds; intense limited fanatic interests; and issues when communicating verbally and non-verbally (National Autistic Society 1)

The study of human's mental state on subjection to music has been a research subject to many with interest. Over the past decade, interconnection between human's physical and mental strength and music has been subject to research with a number of positive outcomes. These research endeavors suggest that music exhibits the healing power in certain elements, in a human's life. A sample of music with the best or strongest healing power is the Indian music. What music does is that it injects a calming effect into a human's mind. This speeds recovery-time of certain health ailments.

As per Dr. Sacks, Alzheimer patients take advantage from listening to the familiar music. The music entails them memory stimulus, restoring the accessibility to personal history. It is said to have motivated the powers of speech and the thought process. However, his entire emotional as well as intellectual configuration, his life history, his identity, is greatly influenced by the music. The study of psycho-neuroimmunology narrates the influence of neuropeptides on human emotions. The beta-endorphins appear to be released and the body is permitted to perform its own healing work on physiological level, while the person is in a relaxed condition. The music therapy attempts to bring such state which is revealed to be 'audio analgesisa'. (Music Heals: Music for Healing and Transition)

IV. Music is essential in some people's lives because they associate it with particular feelings. Patriotic music is a very important factor in most countries because it makes individuals identify with it and because it triggers sentiments related to belonging. Religious music is also important, considering that many religions accept that religious teachings can be expressed more efficiently by being sung. People often turn to music simply because they feel that it helps them as they try to relax or as they attempt to amplify their feelings.

EFFETIVENESS OF MUSI ON VOABULARY
The Effectiveness of Music on Vocabulary ompetence, Writing, Reading omprehension and Motivation in English Language Learning in High-School
Most English language learners in high schools show poor vocabulary competence. The main reason for this is the limited level of exposure to the language. It is generally understood and practically acknowledged that words form the basic unit of language structure. Therefore lack of sufficient vocabulary constrains students from effectively communicating and freely expressing their ideas.
Vocabulary competence is critical to developing reading comprehension skills. Lack of vocabulary development is detrimental to the development of metacognitive skill that is important in comprehending advanced texts. omprehension is a major component of development of vocabulary, reading to learn.

The main purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of using music on vocabulary competence, writing, reading comprehension and motivation in English Language Learning in High school students as a part of the learning process in the classroom. Many teachers of English as a second language as well as the learners consider vocabulary as a critical factor in learning the language. Therefore it is important to develop creative and interesting ways of teaching vocabulary in English class. A qualitative study was appropriate for the research for the reason that the objective was exploratory (Creswell, 1998). The significance that was recognized to the singularities of teaching was examined with hermeneutic methods (Creswell, 2002).
In order to give a reply to the answer of the three research questions, mean scores and standard deviations were computed for each of the two groups on each of the three dependent measures at the ending of study.

Music and Pain
The use of music in relation to relaxation and pain control is universal in application. Many cultures use music, tones, chanting, drums, or other forms of biofeedback to treat patients in acute pain, women in labor, recovery, and now, most recently, in pre- and post-operative care. In fact, the therapeutic value of music has been recognized as vital and powerful since Ancient Times; archaeological evidence shows flutes carved from bone in pictures of physicians healing patients, Greek physicians used music and vibration to heal, aid in digestion and induce sleep; the Early Egyptians used musical incantations to help with the healing process; and certainly, numerous native tribes use singing and chanting as part of their healing rituals (Nilsson, 2008).
Further, most postoperative patients have pain, despite the use of analgesia. Nurses are constantly trying to be more effective in delivering pain medication. One study showed that patients…… [Read More]

Music and Personal Association
What music do you associate with childhood? How did/does this music make you feel? How do your choices reflect your childhood experiences?
There is not much that I can recall about my childhood in detail. My memory tends to be unreliable at best. That is why I find it so incredible that the music of the Beatles remains a vivid and constant presence in my memories. Indeed, even before I remember knowing that red means 'stop' or green means 'go,' I knew all the words to "Yellow Submarine." It was almost as if I was born with the melody to "Hey Jude" in may head. In fact, since my parents were such devoted listeners to the Beatles, I have little doubt that this was the soundtrack to my gestation.
The constant presence of the Beatles would have an indelible impact on me. There are…… [Read More]

Music and Cognitive Theory
Music tends to have a phenomenal power over the human mind and emotions. A movie without a soundtrack would seem so dull and boring. If you try closing your eyes and picture a scene with music, it gives a completely different mood and emotion to it. Even before the music culture that exists today, human beings were still making some kind of music. They made flutes with the bones and jaw harps. Music has always had an innate appreciation for humans. Pleasant sounds lure a person to identify its source, whereas a shrill, unpleasant sound makes a person uncomfortable.
Studies show that while an orchestral concert, the pleasure centers of a human brain are activated. These are also active while a person has chocolate, engages in sexual acts or during the intake of stimulants like hash and cocaine. hen a baby is being formed inside a…… [Read More]

Song of Love
Music is a universal language shared and understood across all countries and cultures. It can help express emotions and create an array of reactions, ranging from relaxed feelings to the most motivated ones. Apart from this, music can be used therapeutically for people who face difficulties physically, emotionally, cognitively or socially (Bodner). There is some difficulty when defining the concept of music therapy because there are numerous definitions out there concerning to this practice. According to the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) "Music therapy is an established health profession in which music is used in a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of individuals" (Ronna). This includes addressing mental and physical problems such as: self-awareness, spiritual enhancement, social and interpersonal development, and motor skills (Ronna). This type of therapy is used in many settings, such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and…… [Read More]

" (Eugenia Costa-Giomi 2004, 141) Among the academic benefits associated with three years of piano lessons, the children tended to have higher math computation scores, higher language scores, and higher self-esteem than children not involved in music.
Many studies and a wide array of empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that music improves the academic performance and test scores of children, including those in Middle and High School, but certainly also including Elementary and College students. These benefits may occur because of the increased activity in the temporal and left-frontal areas of the brain that have been observed during exposure to music, or because music brings "cohesion" to already existing background noise. (Geake & Ivanov 2003) Or perhaps the link between music and academic success may trace back to the Ancient ideas of how the arts affect the essence of the soul.

Musical play was designed to elicit greater responsiveness from the child in a fun setting and also to enhance the enjoyment of the adult involved in the activity. The aim of the activity was to encourage age-appropriate physical and speech-related activities as well as accustom the child to the sound of music. Rolling over while the music played, imitating the sounds and words were initiated by the adult, and when the child mimicked the adult, the child was told 'good job.' The activity was also designed to positively sensitize the child to instrumental and sung music in a social setting.

Teaching in the Self-Contained Classroom
Music, Art and Phys. Ed. In Self-contained classroom
In 1996, the United States Department of Education mandated laws that required school districts to create inclusive programs to integrate students with various disabilities into the general school population.
However, a study conducted by the National Council on disabilities in 2000 showed that most school districts have not transitioned into full mainstream classes. Instead, an estimated 20% of children with disabilities continue to spend their schooldays in self-contained classrooms, apart from the general school population (right and right).
Proponents of the self-contained classroom, however, believe that such settings can be advantageous, particularly for students with hearing impairments, mental retardation and those with physical or learning disabilities.
This paper examines how students in total or semi-self-contained classrooms can benefit from instruction in art, music and physical education. It looks at the challenges of teaching such classes and how…… [Read More]

Music can basically serve various purposes with some of these purposes being fulfilled at the individual level while others at the level of the society. For an individual, music can be a platform for expressing emotions, promoting relaxation, offering stimulation, facilitating mood change, and being a source of comfort. In some case, music can be used to entertain, in therapy, improve the effect of the other arts, and offer aesthetic enjoyment. In the past few years, there have been increased concerns and analyses regarding the impact of music on work quality and worker productivity.

(Ibid.)
Background music is particularly annoying for hard of hearing people since it drowns out important sounds such as speech and announcements for them.

Professionals involved in therapy and counseling with members of the Creole culture of New Orleans and southern Louisiana should be aware of the history and traditions of this group that make it distinctive from all others in the United States, and indeed from the French-speaking Cajun communities in the same region. In Louisiana, Creoles are not simply the white descendants of the early French and Spanish colonists, although in the post-Civil War era of Jim Crow there was a major attempt to redefine them as 100% white. This was never the case in history since they are a mixed-race people descended from Europeans, Native Americans and African slaves during the 18th Century and occupied a special caste in pre-Civil War Louisiana. They spoke their own language known as Creole French, as do tens of thousands of their descendants today, and in appearance have often been able to 'pass' as…… [Read More]

Out of about 40 million slaves that were transported from African to the United States, only 15 million of them could survive, however they ended up in pure hell. It was expected of the African-Americans to meet the demands of two ideas, both of which met the needs of the rich white Americans. Thus, where slaves had a disguise to serve their masters and please them, they were just not being honest to themselves in the least bit, and they were living according to the wishes of their masters to escape the beating or to avoid being scrutinized any further. Having said that, just because they had no choice but to live up to the two ideals, it did not mean that there were not any rightfully revengeful and rebellious slaves that went against the books and refused to accept being a cookie cutter cut-out.

Music and his scientific work...were 'born of the same source.'"

Promoting Leadership Professional Development
One of the harsh realities of working in an organization is the inevitability of inappropriate promotions that are based on friendship, cronyism or nepotism rather than merit, or wherein employees find themselves thrust into leadership roles by virtue of luck or fate, or a combination thereof. In addition, some leaders who intentionally attempt to climb the career ladder into the executive boardroom may find their path frustrated by a lack of appropriate leadership training that can help them become more effective in the workplace. Although history has shown time and again that some people are born leaders, far more people need some help to achieve their maximum potential in these leadership roles. The objective of this essay was to review to recent peer-reviewed journal articles concerning the importance of leadership professional development and what steps can be used to facilitate the process in the modern workplace.…… [Read More]

Further evidence for the possible value of noise for children with ADHD is presented by Abikoff et al. (1996). These researchers evaluated the effect that extra-task auditory stimulation had on academic task performance of children with ADHD. This was executed by studying both children with ADHD and normal students during the performance of arithmetic tasks during three different auditory stimulus conditions: high stimulation (music), low stimulation (speech) and no stimulation (silence). The findings indicated that the normal subjects performed similarly under all three conditions, while the ADHD subjects performance was significantly better under the music condition that the silence or speech conditions. This information could prove to be valuable for teachers in the classroom environment. The presence of music in the classroom during tasks such as arithmetic might facilitate the performance of students with ADHD. Since normal students performed equally well under all auditory conditions, the presence of music would…… [Read More]

Furthermore, one of the pillars of collaborative care that will need to be firmly established is the fostering of clear dialogue and a means for strong communication within the care management planning. For instance, there needs to be a clear decision and communication of all tests ordered and when the test results will be available. One of the most important aspects of this collaborative care will be the nursing interventions which can have significant impact on the patient's health and stabilization (Allen, 2010). In fact, strategic nursing care can even minimize readmission rates of Margaret and other patients with comparable conditions (Chen et al., 2012).

¶ … Music Therapy on Depression Name Course Professor Date Part II Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective coping with psychiatric symptoms exacerbates difficulties brought by a mental health disorder. The ineffective coping strategies are evidenced in poor concentration, low self-esteem, and poor self-care. Population: The population of interest is outpatients suffering from depression. Intervention: Provide opportunities for patients to listening to music to help alleviate or deal with symptoms of this psychiatric disorder. Comparison and Contrast: Does music therapy contribute to less depressive symptoms? How effective is music therapy in helping patients develop suitable coping strategies for depression. Outcome: Improved quality of life including lessened depression levels and improved capabilities to cope with psychiatric symptoms through listening to music. Clinical Question: Is listening to music effective in lessening psychiatric symptoms in depressive patients receiving music therapy? The purpose of this assignment is to explore the effectiveness of using music as an intervention for depressive symptoms and improved quality of life based on existing evidence-based practice. Narrative Discussion In Chan et al. (2012), the objective of the study was to determine the impact of music on the levels of depression in older adults. To achieve this objective, the researchers conducted a randomized controlled study on 50 older adults who listened to their preferred music at home for 30 minutes weekly for eight weeks. The depression scores that were collected once per week demonstrated that the levels of depression reduced every week among participants in the music group as compared to a non-music group that was subjected to control during the same period. Atiwannapat et al. (2016) carried out a research to explore the impacts of, "active group music therapy and receptive group music therapy to counseling in treatment of major depressive disorder" (p.141). The researchers randomly identified and assigned 14 major depressive disorder outpatients to active music therapy, receptive group music therapy, and group counseling. After assessing participants at baseline, they found that receptive group music therapy is characterized by faster achievement of peak therapeutic effect whereas active group music therapy has higher peak impact. Discussion There were some similarities and differences in both studies that can impact how music therapy is recommended as an intervention for reducing the levels of depression. First, these studies concur that music therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention that can help in management of depression among outpatients. Based on these studies, music therapy is considered because of pharmacological treatment measures are usually associated with adverse impacts and sometimes ineffective. Secondly, the studies involve a randomized controlled trial, which is a true experiment. This research design helps in enhancing the probability that study findings are not due to chance. Given the use of randomized controlled trial for these studies, their findings relatively represent the actual impact of music on outpatient settings. Third, both researches were carried out in outpatient settings and on a weekly basis, which was suitable in determining how the intervention impacted depression patients. Fourth, both studies grouped their participants in different categories i.e. one in which the intervention was used and another control group that was not subjected to the intervention. Chan et al. (2012) conducted the trial in the participant's home where a research nurse visited on a weekly basis to gather depression scores for eight weeks as data was collected between July 2009 and June 2010. The study also utilized a one-tailed repeated measure of assessing covariance i.e. RM ANCOVA to examine effects while a medium effect was selected based on findings from the previous study. Four different categories of music i.e. Malay, Western, Chinese, and Indian were first introduced to the subjects. For data analysis, Chan et al. (2012) utilized descriptive statistics to define the characteristics of the group while chi-square test was used to test homogeneity between groups. Unlike Chan et al. (2012), Atiwannapat et al. (2016) divided their participants into three groups and conducted the study as part of group therapy for outpatients with depression. Participants in this study not only listened to music but also sang and played musical instruments. This study also involved lyric analysis, song writing, and drawing the music by the subjects, which was different from the other study. Therefore, Atiwannapat et al. (2016) explored different aspects relating to music rather than simply listening to music like in the other study. For data analysis, this research utilized statistical analyses including STATA version 13, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Fisher's exact test. While Chan et al. (2012) conducted the study on older patients aged 55 years or more, Atiwannapat et al. (2016) carried out the research on participants aged between 16 and 65 years. Therefore, the results of the study were difficult to compare because of the differences in age group and the fact that they were completed over different time periods. However, both articles provide significant evidence to demonstrate that music therapy helps in lessening the levels of depression among outpatients. Using Newhouse Level of Evidence, these studies contained weaknesses that need to be addressed as shown in the Appendix. Chan et al. (2012) received a rating of I-B good because of its fairly definitive conclusions that are consistent with an adequate number of well defined studies (Newhouse, 2006). Atiwannapat et al. (2016) obtained a Newhouse score of I-B good because of insufficient sample size but reasonably consistent results and use of reliable and valid research methodology. Part III The patient is 40- to 50-year-old married female a with essentially no psychiatric history presented to the emergency department with her husband due to significant mood lability, feeling a lot of anger towards others and having thoughts of wanting to hurt people over a couple months, but have gotten worse over the last two weeks. She reported that she has been feeling agitated, tensed, and has irritable edge. Thoughts are racing, concentration is poor, feeling more impulsive -- have been hitting wall and kicking a copier machine. She has no psychosis, but has longstanding issues with irritability and anger. Patient denied any previous episodes of depression and agitation. Her symptoms cause interpersonal, employment and familial difficulties. Patient is danger to self and others. She is too impulsive and aggressive to manage outside structured milieu. Despite having no psychiatric history, the 40- to 50-year-old patient is probably suffering from depression since she's showing symptoms of this disorder. She needs an intervention that will help her manage anger and irritation, improve concentration, and avoid tension. These factors have seemingly played a major role in her relationship, family, and employment problems. As evidenced in the two studies, listening to music will be a suitable non-pharmacological intervention to deal with the patient's condition. This is a suitable intervention because the patient has no history of depression and agitation. Music therapy will help improve the patient's condition by giving her other outlets for relieving stress and anxiety, developing safe and appropriate behaviors, and lessening depressive symptoms (Thoma et al., 2013). Final Reflection As a mental health nurse, my work has involved playing different roles that assist patients to control/manage their conditions. I have been involved in maintaining contacts with patients in relation to their health and well being and conducting assessments with regards to management of the patient's condition vis-a-vis the clinical intervention. During this process, I have been involved in ensuring the patient adheres to medication and other intervention measures to effective control and manage his/her condition. Apart from patient interaction and assessment, I have also been involved in care planning and evaluation of evidence of clinical intervention. This has entailed working with physicians to coordinate care processes and conducting research on clinical interventions that are suitable for specific conditions in order to improve care and patient outcomes. This experience has helped me realize that the role of mental health nurse entails carrying out different activities towards delivery of patient care. In this case, mental health nurses not only act as supportive staff to physicians but also carry out other tasks to help improve the health and well-being of patients. This has in turn changed my understanding of the roles and responsibilities of mental health nurses. These practitioners act as the link between the patient and the health care team and coordinating patient care strategies and processes. Moreover, I have realized that planning evidence-based care involves conducting research on evidence-based practices and using them as the benchmark for coordinating and providing care. These experiences have contributed to my growth and development as a nurse by enabling me to understand the role of a nurse and how to use evidence-based practices to plan and coordinate care. In essence, these experiences have been crucial in helping me gain real-world knowledge and skills in nursing. References Atiwannapat et al. (2016, March 26).

The study targeted older adults suffering from depression in the outpatient setting i.e. at home. 52 older adults aged 55 years or more were selected as the sample size for the research. A randomized control trial was carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, Fisher's exact test, and Shapiro-Wilk test for data analysis. The study found that listening to music helps in lessening the levels of depression in older adults.

reference lists from eligible studies were also reviewed to identify suitable studies. Finally, although the literature review was mainly focused on peer-reviewed journal articles, the author reports that she also included books and chapters of books that held specific significance for the purposes of her analysis.
Results: Based on the studies identified as described above, the author developed a useful historical background of autism and the responses by the medical community over time. A similar historical analysis that spans 5 decades is presented concerning the use of music therapy for various disorders concluding with its use for autism disorder interventions. Given the exceptional musical abilities of some autistic children it is not surprising that music therapists were interested its applicability for treating autistic children by the 1950s.
Although the author is quick to point out that music therapy has not been universally acknowledged as an effective intervention for children with autism, its use became increasingly popular during the 1960s and following a 40-year period of trial-and-error, a great deal has been learned that can help guide the use of music therapy for treating children with autism today. During the past 10-year period, Reschke-Hernandez also reports that music therapists have sought to develop evidence-based music therapy approaches that can be used for treating children with autism to help improve the method's credibility among and use by the medical community.
Conclusions: The author concludes her study with a summary of the research, important findings concerning the historical evolution of music therapy and its use as a clinical intervention for children with autism. Following her recommendations for further study, the author adds that the results of this study should serve as a useful snapshot of current thinking about music therapy and its usefulness in treating children with autism.

Alzheimer's Disease currently affects more than four million Americans. Alzheimer's is a disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of areas within the brain, resulting in cognitive and physical decline that will eventually lead to death. It is important to emphasize that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not a normal part of aging. Although AD typically appears in those over sixty-five, it is a neurodegenerative disease, quite distinct from any aging-related cognitive decline. ecause Alzheimer's is eventually fatal, and because the decline typical of an Alzheimer's patient is so devastating, much research is currently being done to investigate potential treatments. With the elderly population the fastest growing segment of North American society, Alzheimer's threatens to be an even greater health concern in the future decades.
For patients exhibiting mild cognitive impairment, research is being done on ways to slow the disease's progression. The two main thrusts of Alzheimer's research are biological, which…… [Read More]

works cited here support the need for continued and expanded research involving the different specialties in nursing and oncology to better serve patients and their families. Also, there is little nursing information that is found in the professional peer reviewed journals that speak directly to the issue of pancreatic patients and depression. There is much more literature on the subject from the physician and researcher perspectives, but there is a void in nursing literature. At this point in time, the depression of pancreatic patients as it concerns nursing, has received little attention. Both the nursing profession and pancreatic patients would benefit from further research in this area.
The conclusion from the study of the literature available is that not only is pancreatic patient depression not well understood, it is also lacking in research that would help professionals to address depression in these patients. Also, because it is directly linked to pancreatic cancer, and because the research does support the fact that patients suffering depression and pancreatic cancer do not enjoy the quality of life as those patients who do not suffer from depression, then pancreatic cancer patients and depression should be a distinct and separate therapeutic intervention from other groups of depression.

One of the studies Halm reviewed, for instance, found an immediate reduction in respiratory rate during and immediately after aromatherapy treatment, but two hours after the treatment occurred there was no discernable effect (Halm 2008). This suggests that the commercial applications of aromatherapy, which tend to be long-term environmental applications rather than time- and person-specific treatments. Because the evidence shows that the calming effects of aromatherapy are really only present during the treatment and immediately after, long-term environmental applications of aromatherapy might be best.
There are problems with such an application in a medical setting, however. Chief among these is the entirely subjective nature of the sense of smell. Certain aromas which might be very pleasant -- and therefore presumably stress reducing -- for some might be particularly unpleasant for others. For these latter people, who do not enjoy a particular given aroma, stress might actually be increased by the…… [Read More]
Reduction of stress in nurses and medical staff will have a direct and casually and consciously observable effect on the treatment of patients. Speech and action both tend to be abbreviated during periods of stress, which can and most likely will have a direct effect on the way that patients perceive the quality of care they are receiving. This in turn will have an effect on the patient's stress level; if they feel that they are receiving a less-than-adequate level of care, their stress level is likely to rise, negatively impacting their recovery. On the other hand, if the nurses and medical staff are less stressed, this will also be communicated to the patient, and might have the opposite effect of improving patient attitude and enhancing their recovery.
Stress can be communicated subconsciously, too, perhaps to an even greater degree in subtle situations than the overt and conscious communications presented by alterations in observable attitude and action. This fact can only enhance the positive effects of the above suggestions of an available environmentally pervasive aromatherapy break room. Calmer people tend to help calm other people; if the nurses and medical staff are calm and less stressed, this will be unconsciously communicated to the patients as well, reducing their stress levels. Thus, it can be seen that pervasive aromatherapy might be even more efficacious in the treatment of patient stress and anxiety when provided to nurses instead of or in addition to the patients themselves.
All of this talk of environmentally pervasive aromatherapy is not to suggest that direct and patient-specific applications of aromatherapy not be utilized. The evidence clearly shows that such applications can be remarkable efficacious in the short-term as a stress reduction technique for patients and medical staff alike, even going so far as to reduce respiratory rates (Halm 2008). The evidence that aromatherapy can actually reduce levels of pain in critically ill patients has yet to be verified, but this is another avenue of aromatherapy application the merits further research (Halm 2008). In fact, aromatherapy in general is underutilized in this country, and the reports studied herein suggest that these practices should be changes if for no other reason than it will at least partially and temporarily reduce stress levels among patients and medical staff. The increase of the use of aromatherapy will also provide more evidence for further applications.

Therefore, HM is designed to help those who would likely not succeed in traditional treatment methodologies as well as to address the indirect harms associated with the behavior targeted for intervention (Brocato & Wagner, 2003).
In that respect, existing HM-based drug treatment programs have confirmed the social benefit and individual welfare achievable through the more tolerant form of intervention. Universally, the literature documents the extent to which social problems such as petty crime and personal harm such as disease transmission and other types of intravenous infection have been substantially reduced through the HM approach to drug abuse.
In Opposition to the Harm eduction Model
Critics of the HM (especially in connection with illicit drug abuse) strongly object to that approach, largely because they believe that it is tantamount to condoning that behavior or even enabling it in the classical codependency context (O'Neill, 2002). In general, that is equally true with…… [Read More]

Nursing Implications
The preceding evidence lends itself to a number of specific nursing implications that are very likely to improve the conditions of a variety of patients affected with the miasma of symptoms that encompass dementia. The specific care for each individual patient will vary based on whether the data used to assess a particular symptom applies to that patient or not. In the case of the latter circumstance, the patient will merely forego the recommendation (which solely applies to patients suffering from that particular manifestation of dementia) in favor of one that coincides with the specific needs of that patient.
The empirical evidence of Vance and Cowen (2010) indicates that the deployment of light therapy yields positive affects for those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The administration of light therapy from a light box generating between 1500 and 2500 lux will be used for one to two hours both in…… [Read More]
During normal waking hours, music therapy in the form of clock radios that serve as alarms throughout various points in the day (and which play music of the patient's choice) will be utilized, as well as aroma therapeutic practices in which lavender scents (in the form of candles and scented oils) will be used, since the study of Lin et al. (2007) has compiled empirical data to support lavender's alleviation of agitated behaviors. Based on Vance and Cowan's 2010 research that discourages inactivity and daytime napping, residents will be offered a variety of diurnal activities revolving around the outdoors, such as hiking, walking, and other forms of exercise agreeable to the patient.
Paragraph in the Introduction
The term Sundowning Syndrome (reviewed by Bachman & Rabins, 2006) has been used to describe the increased agitation of Alzheimer's patients during the late afternoon and early evening, and has been observed for more than 60 years. Volicer et al. (2001) helped confirm this tendency by monitoring circadian rhythms in dementia patients (with a mean age of 71) through the usage of body temperatures. The studies were extremely effective in producing statistical documentation that indicated a three hour lapse in the peak core of body temperatures for Sundowning patients as opposed to controls, as well as a five hour lapse in the peak motor activity between the same two groups. The strength of these research methods can be determined by the fact that they were able to quantify such information in immediately comparable forms. The fact that these results brought forth a conclusion that circadian control mechanisms were not in optimal operations for such patients is somewhat vague, and could be strengthened by expositions to determine why this is the case. The conclusion of these studies, however, is supported by the work of Serniczuk, Dyck, LaFerla, and Antle (2010) which found frequent SCN atrophy and optic nerve damage in post mortem dementia patients.

Also stated as methods used for relaxation are: (1) physical activity; (2) doing something one enjoys and (3) body-centered relaxation. (Stress Management Health Center, 2008) ody-centered relaxation may include breathing exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, massage, aromatherapy and Yoga. Also stated to be effective is 'Magnetic Field Therapy' although there is some disagreement about the use of this type of therapy for stress-relief.
III. STRESS PREVENTION
Primary among stress-related coping skills is that of knowing how to avoid potentially stress-producing situations and knowing how to reduce the negative reactions one experiences due to stress. Time management skills are 'key' toward stress avoidance and reduction. For instance, one can save time through task delegations and by setting aside personal time for themselves. Prioritization of tasks according to their importance and management of commitments are also 'key' components of effective stress management. Lifestyle choices also affect ones' ability…… [Read More]

Alternatives to Pain Medication
Given the growing concerns over opioid addictions in recent years and the potential for tolerance, clinicians continue to search for efficacious alternatives to convention pain medications (Moore & Anderson, 2016). Fortunately, a number of alternatives to conventional pan medication are readily available, including cannabis, yoga, hypnosis, mind-body meditation, therapeutic touch, herbal remedies, acupuncture, biofeedback, massage therapy, homeopathic practices (Tan & Craine, 2007) and aromatherapy (Esposito & Bystrek, 2014). To learn more about these alternatives, this paper provides an initial reference list of ten relevant peer-reviewed and scholarly sources concerning pain medication alternatives, followed by a description of clinical guidelines and an implementation plan for these alternatives. A discussion concerning the manner in which the implementation of the intervention should be tested is followed by an assessment of potential barriers and strategies intended to gain cooperation from individuals who will be implementing the change. Finally, a timeline…… [Read More]

The student development theory is a body of the educational scholarship and psychology that demonstrates the strategy higher educational students gain knowledge. The theory also guides students in their educational affairs. College students are categories as students in the higher education especially in the formal setting such as colleges, universities, polytechnic and other institutions of higher learning. On the other hand, development is defined as a "process of increasing complex." (Patton, et al. 2016 p 5). With reference to the students' affair, the theory is a useful tool in answering the cogent question that students might encounter in their day-to-day academic affairs. Thus, student development theory focuses on student development, and method of achieving success in the institution of higher learning. In essence, the student development theory reveals how students of higher education grow academically within the campus environment.
The objective of this study is to illustrate the strategy and…… [Read More]
