In the past I have had lower abdominal pain, tight, bloating and even my ovaries hurt. I have seen my doctor for it each time and even had a ct scan and ultrasound of my abdomin. The doctor said it is probably just an ovarian cyst that has ruptured. That was a few months ago and now for the past week I have pain again. I already had my period 10 days ago. I am missing work today because I'm so uncomfortable. I dont want to pay anymore money for another ultra sound or ct scan. Please help!

Oh.. Ok. I was curious about that. I work at a doctors office. I have the day off because of this but I left a message for my doctors nurse to call me back so I can know what to do next. I will keep you posted. I appreciate your quick responses.

Thank you for the reply. I was on birth control pills for 10 years. I just stopped my birth control pills 8 days ago. Could this be the reason for possible cyst? Can stopping birth control pills cause this pain? And I am sexually active and not using protection. Thank you.

Birth Control Pills are sometimes used to treat symptoms of cysts, endometriosis, etc. Basically what they do is mask the symptoms of an underlying condition but don't treat the condition. When you come off the pills, that when the symptoms like excruciating pain and cramping may be felt and this would require a medical evaluation.
Please keep us posted-- you may not need another CT scan but definitely see your doctor. We can help look for a public health clinic in your area that you can afford.
Best Wishes,
Rosa

Hi Anon,
Thank you for your post! Ovarian Cysts occur during your menstrual cycle, this doesn't mean that it happens only during your period, your cycle is the entire month. With this being said, symptoms are usually felt either before or after your period.
The two most common symptoms are:
Pelvic pain
Menstrual bleeding
Pain is usually caused by:
Direct pressure from the cysts on the ovaries and surrounding structures
Causing chronic pelvic fullness or a dull ache
Bleeding from a cyst into and around the ovary
Causing more intense, sharp pain as the blood irritates the lining of the abdomen
Pain may come and go on a regular basis. Or, you may notice the pain more:
Just before or after your period
During sex
The main types of treatment are:
Wait and See
The doctor waits a few months to see if the cyst goes away on its own.
Medication
Birth Control Pills
If you have a functional cyst, your doctor may prescribe birth control pills . The pills may prevent other cysts from developing during the "wait and see" period. If you get cysts often, birth control pills decrease the chance of new ones forming.
Pain Medication
If your cyst is causing a lot of discomfort, your doctor may prescribe pain medication.
Laparoscopic Surgery
Pelvic laparoscopy may be recommended to remove a cyst if it:
Grows larger or reaches a size greater than two inches
Has some solid material in it, or other features
Causes persistent or worsening symptoms
Lasts longer than two or three menstrual cycles
Disrupts blood flow
If the cyst is not cancerous, often just the cyst can be removed. However, in some cases, your whole ovary may need to be removed. If the cyst is cancerous, you may have both ovaries and uterus removed. This requires an open surgical procedure .
If you are diagnosed with an ovarian cyst, follow your doctor's instructions .
