See Headache Self-Help Measures (e.g. Quiet dark room)
Eliminate Rebound Migraine Factors
Avoid Opioid agents
See Migraine Headache Management in Children
See Headache in Pregnancy
Management: Aura or mild to moderate early Migraine (<2 hours)
Advance Analgesics hourly
NSAIDS
Ibuprofen
Naproxen (Naprosyn, Anaprox DS)
Diclofenac
Indomethacin
Combination agents (do not use Aspirin in children, increased GI irritation with Aspirin)
Excedrin Migraine (Aspirin, Acetaminophen, Caffeine)
Aspirin 1000 mg with metoclopramide (see below)
Tfelt-Hansen (1995) Lancet 346:923-6 [PubMed]
Alternatives for NSAID intolerant patients
Acetaminophen 1000 mg
COX2 Inhibitors
Management: Moderate Migraine Headache (<2 to 4 hours) refractory to above
Consider administering at 1 hour for failed improvement with initial meds listed above
Abortive Medications (in combination with Anti-emetic, see below)
First-Line
Triptan agents (first-line, see below)
Consider coadministration with NSAIDs (Indomethacin is available as a suppository)
Other agents
Intranasal Dihydroergotamine or DHE (Triptans are preferred, see below)
Isometheptene (e.g. Midrin which also contains Acetaminophen and dichloralphenazone) may be effective
However, Midrin is a controlled substance (schedule IV) due to the sedative dichloralphenazone
Generally avoided and largely replaced by Serotonin Agonists (esp. Triptans)
Avoid Opioids
Avoid Butalbital (e.g. Fiorinal)
Barbiturate with poor efficacy
Potentially addictive with risk of withdrawal
Antiemetic
First-line (Dopamine antagonists, warn patients regarding Extrapyramidal Side Effects)
Metoclopramide (Reglan, enhances abortive medication absorption)
Prochlorperazine (Compazine)
Other Anti-emetics (some available as suppositories)
Dramamine
Atarax
Phenergan
Management: Severe Migraine Headache (2-6 hours) refractory to above
See Emergency Department Migraine Headache Care
Antiemetic as above
Serotonin Agonist
Triptans (first-line, preferred)
Sumatriptan (Imitrex) - subcutaneous form is more effective than oral, intranasal
Rizatriptan (Maxalt MLT) - orally disintegrating tablets
Zolmitriptan (Zomig) - orally disintegrating tablets
Naratriptan (Amerge)
Almotriptan (Axert)
Frovatriptan (Frova)
Eletriptan (Relpax)
Dihydroergotamine or DHE (e.g. Migranal Nasal Spray, second-line)
Do not use within 24 hours of a Triptan
Nausea is common, and reduce dose if Leg Cramps or Paresthesias may occur
Management: Severe Refractory Migraine Headache (6 to 72 hours)
See Emergency Department Migraine Headache Care
Management: Vasocontrictor Contraindications
Patients in whom Vasoconstrictors (e.g. Triptan, DHE) are contraindicated
Coronary Artery Disease
Hemiplegic Migraines
Basilar Migraines
Alternative agents
Excedrin Migraine (Acetaminophen, Aspirin, Caffeine)
NSAIDS
Dopamine antagonists (e.g. Metoclopramide or Prochlorperazine)
