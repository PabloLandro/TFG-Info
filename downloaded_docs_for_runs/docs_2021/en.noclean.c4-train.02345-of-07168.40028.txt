Asthma sufferers are dependent on medication prescribed by their doctors to help them achieve a better quality of life. Many asthmatics are not convinced that conventional medicine is their only line of defense against their respiratory condition and are seeking alternative therapies, such as yoga. There are yoga exercises designed to help asthmatics learn to breathe more effectively. However, if you are under a doctor's care for your asthma, check with her before beginning any new exercises or alternative therapies for your condition.
Abdominal Breathing
People who do not suffer from asthma tend to push their belly out on an inhalation and suck it back in on an exhalation. Asthmatics, due to the need to take in more air, perform the reverse by pulling their belly in on an inhale and pushing it out on the exhale. Gary Kraftsow, an advanced yoga therapist and author of "Yoga for Wellness," recommends that asthmatics retrain themselves in the practice of diaphragmatic breathing. You can practice this technique by sitting tall in a chair, with your feet flat on the floor and placing your hands on your lower belly. Push your belly out on an inhale and pull it back in on the exhalation. Repeat 12 times.
Deepening the Exhalation
Typically asthmatics tend to breathe faster than people who do not suffer from respiratory complaints. Learning how to slow down your rate of breathing is best accomplished by deepening the exhalation. This can be accomplished by practicing a yoga move that gradually lengthens your exhalations over time. You can practice this technique either kneeling or standing, by simply raising your arms into the air on the inhalation and bending your torso forward over your legs on the exhalation. Perform eight times, lengthening your exhalation each time.
Yoga Poses for Asthma
The constricted airways of people who have asthma may benefit from two types of poses; relaxing and back bends. There's a certain amount of stress connected to suffering from asthma, and learning to be still and concentrating on your belly-breathing at the same time will contribute to lowering your stress levels. Easy pose is a simple, relaxing, cross-legged pose that can be performed while sitting on the floor or propped up on a cushion. Back bending poses like Bow, Locust, Sphinx, Cobra and Upward-Facing Dog open the chest and allow for deeper inhalations and exhalations.
Contraindicated Yoga Poses for Asthma
Not every yoga pose will benefit everyone; and in case of medical conditions like asthma, some poses are contraindicated. Do not perform poses that require you to constrict your airways, such as Seated Forward Bend, Plow and Head-to-Knee, unless supervised by a qualified yoga therapist; nor should you try advanced poses like Full Boat that put a strain on the abdominal area. Also avoid the rapid breathing technique called Kapalabhati and any yogic breathing exercises that require you to hold your breath.
