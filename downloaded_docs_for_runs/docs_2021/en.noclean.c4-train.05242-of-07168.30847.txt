I had a small "Y" bone in my throat last night. My daughter found this page. I used the bread method and it worked after chewing and swallowed 2 slices of bread. It worked for me. Thanks for the tip.

I swallowed a fishbone (pageot, like small red snapper) tonight. Could feel it with my finger in my throat but unable to pull it out. Having read your site tried the balls of bread and voila! Just left with a bit of disconfort due to irritation in throat. Many thanks.

A fish bone was lodged in my throat on Sunday but felt the effect on Tuesday. I tried salty water and bread with peanut butter and it worked. Just a little irritation. much appreciated
