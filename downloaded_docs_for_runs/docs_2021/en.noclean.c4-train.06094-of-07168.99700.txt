Everyone seems to have their own trick for removing a tick. Contrary to popular belief, holding a match to the tick, suffocating it with petroleum jelly, or poisoning it with nail polish only makes it burrow in more deeply. The correct solution is also the easiest: simply pull it off your skin. Follow these easy steps for removal and the tick will soon be a distant memory.
StepsEdit
Method One of Four:
Using a Pair of TweezersEdit
{"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/6\/61\/Remove-a-Tick-Step-1-new.jpg\/v4-460px-Remove-a-Tick-Step-1-new.jpg","bigUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/6\/61\/Remove-a-Tick-Step-1-new.jpg\/v4-760px-Remove-a-Tick-Step-1-new.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":322.25274725275,"bigWidth":760,"bigHeight":532.41758241758}
1
Find the head of the tick. If you look closely, you'll see its mouth attached to the skin, with the body resting behind it.
2
Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with a pair of tweezers. Use tweezers with fine tips, rather than blunt ones, to make sure you are able to grasp the tick tightly.[1]
Don't try this with your fingers. You won't be able to get a good, tight grip on the tick.
Make sure you're gripping the tick's head. Get the tweezers as close to the mouth of the tick as possible.
Do not grasp the tick's body. This will cause it to inject saliva or blood into your skin and increase the chances of transmitting a disease.[2]
3
Pull firmly and steadily outward. The tick's mouth will release the skin. Do not twist, jerk or wiggle the tweezers as you pull, or the tick's mouth parts will remain attached to the skin. It's not uncommon for the skin to also pull up as the tick detaches, much like it does when you pluck a stray hair.
If the mouth parts remain attached, attempt to remove them with the tweezers. If they're buried in the skin, you can simply let the skin heal, checking it from time to time to make sure it doesn't become infected.[3]

4
Wash with warm water and soap. You can also use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine. Clean both the bite and your hands thoroughly.[4]

5
See a doctor if you have trouble removing the tick. Some ticks are so small that they're difficult to remove using this common method. A doctor will be able to remove the tick for you.

Method Two of Four:
Using a Piece of FlossEdit
1
Cut a length of floss. Choose a thin, unwaxed floss, or another type of thin string. This does the trick if you don't have tweezers on hand.[5]
2
Loop the string around the tick's head. The string should lie as close to the skin as possible.
3
Tighten the loop around the head. Use both hands to pull the floss taut.
4
Pull the ends of the string upward in a slow, steady motion. The tick's mouth will release the skin.

5
Wash with warm water and soap. Clean both the bite and your hands. Rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine can also be used to help prevent infection and the spreading of tick-borne disease.

Method Three of Four:
Using a Credit CardEdit
1
Cut a V-shape into the card. Using a pair of scissors, cut a small V-shape along the edge of the card. It should be large enough to grab the tick, but not so large that the tick and slip through.[6]
{"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/c\/cf\/Remove-a-Tick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Remove-a-Tick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/c\/cf\/Remove-a-Tick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\/v4-760px-Remove-a-Tick-Step-11-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":259.06593406593,"bigWidth":760,"bigHeight":428.02197802198}
2
Slide a credit card next to the tick's head. Slide the credit card between your skin and the tick, aligning the V-cut with the tick's head.[7]
3
Firmly hold the back of the tick in place.
4
Slide the credit card along your skin and under the head. After a few tries, the tick should come out whole.

1
Dispose of the tick properly. The tick will probably still be alive when you remove it. You can soak it in rubbing alcohol or flush it down the toilet to prevent it from attaching itself to you or your loved ones.[8]
{"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/d\/da\/Remove-a-Tick-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\/v4-460px-Remove-a-Tick-Step-15-Version-3.jpg","bigUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/d\/da\/Remove-a-Tick-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\/v4-760px-Remove-a-Tick-Step-15-Version-3.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":259.06593406593,"bigWidth":760,"bigHeight":428.02197802198}
2
Consider saving the tick for testing. If ticks in your area are known to frequently carry Lyme disease, you might want to save the tick in case you need to get it tested. Place it in a plastic food storage bag, seal the bag, then put it in the freezer. Find a lab that does tick testing[9] and follow instructions for properly submitting the tick.

3
Check the wound site for symptoms. In the weeks following the tick removal, check the site for signs that you may have contracted Lyme Disease or another tick-borne illness. you'll need to tell your doctor when you noticed the tick, when you removed it, and what subsequent symptoms you notice. If you notice the following symptoms developing, see a doctor immediately:[10]
A fever and/or chills. This is a common symptom of tick-borne illnesses.
Headaches and muscle aches.
The tell-tale bulls-eye rash. This is a symptom of Lyme disease as well as Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI). Red patches create a bulls-eye pattern around the site of the tick bite, so watch out for this.
Any other type of rash. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), also carried by ticks, can cause a rash that does not look like a bulls-eye to appear.

Question
Why can't I twist the tick when removing it?
Sarah Gehrke, RN
Registered Nurse
Expert Answer
More than a slight twist of the tick may cause the head of the tick to stay embedded in the skin.
Thanks! 15 8
Question
What do you do if the tick's head breaks off?
wikiHow Staff Editor
Staff Answer
Find a way to remove the head immediately, either with tweezers or another method in the article and then wash the wound with soap and water or alcohol to sterilize it. Look carefully to make sure the mouthparts have not been left behind. Leaving the head or mouthparts on you can lead to infections, but not to Lyme Disease if that is a concern.
Thanks! 1 0
Question
Can you use alcohol to remove a tick?
wikiHow Staff Editor
Staff Answer
Doing anything that can agitate or stress the tick can put you at a greater risk of infection since this can cause the tick to regurgitate into the wound. It's best practice to remove the tick as quickly as possible with tweezers or any other method described in the article.
Thanks! 1 0

Question
How do I know if I have a tick buried under my skin?
Community Answer
If it is a deer tick, there will be a red target-looking spot all around the area bitten. With a wood tick, it's hard to tell, but usually you will find them crawling around on your skin. Check places like your bottom, armpits and your groin area -- those are very warm spots and that's where ticks will tend to be.
Thanks! 45 16

TipsEdit
Take a shower after going through large areas of shady grass, in case you aren't sure if you have any. Then, examine yourself, your family, and your pets.
5 Helpful? 0
Keep your lawn trimmed short to prevent ticks. They like shaded areas.
13 Helpful? 5
Have someone help you if you can't remove it or if you are nervous.
11 Helpful? 4
If you are bitten, write down the date. It is possible to catch Lyme disease without noticing it right away. In some cases, symptoms emerge up to a year after the bite. If your write down the date, a doctor can take this into account when diagnosing you, as Lyme disease can become chronic after a period of time.
10 Helpful? 4
Check for swelling of the bite after the tick has been removed. If the area becomes inflamed, see a doctor.
11 Helpful? 6
If you have a tick on your skin, get it off as quick as you can.
8 Helpful? 4
Many outdoor apparel companies sell tick removal tools. Place the hole around the tick and press down and slowly drag it under the mouth until it releases.
5 Helpful? 2
Removing a tick shortly after being bitten greatly reduces the chance of disease transmission. It is unlikely that you will contract Lyme Disease if the tick has been attached to you for less than 36-48 hours.[11]

"Thanks for the article. We live in Spain and during June, July and August we have water lines running through our crops, so we have lots of ticks. They often get on our dogs and cats despite them being treated. At least once a day we make inspections of our pets and any ticks are removed, usually using our hands with sharp nails! When we lived in Ireland the way to remove ticks was to drip methylated spirits on them using a match stalk to drip it on them!"..." more
