Testimonials
I used to be a cook at a restaurant in Los Angeles. It took one careless cook to leave a burn scar on my hand forever. Prompting long sleeves 90% of my days, and embarrassment the other 10%. It was safe to say I was NOT comfortable in my own skin. Not only did Revitol help me with my scar, it helped me with my confidence. The ingredients in this cream did exactly what they were supposed to do. I wasn’t expecting results like this, but I’m incredibly happy I found them.

Like most of you looking at this page right now, I had a pretty big scar, the only difference is, mine was on my face and I had to look at it every day in the mirror. I had it since I was about 10, but each year it just looked worse and worse. Finally I decided to give Revitol Scar Removal a try and writing this right now, I’m in tears. I never ever, in a million years, thought it would work as well as it did. If you didn’t know me before, you’d never guess there was a scar running down my face. It’s virtually invisible and I couldn’t be happier.

I got a mole removed when I was bout 17 years old, right before I left for college. That was a mistake because the scar it left was way worse than the mole. Luckily my roommate gave me a fake story to tell the girls and it all worked out. Anyway about 5 months ago I decided it was time to do something about it and I ordered Revitol. They call it a “reducer”, I call it an “exterminator” it worked so well it makes me wish I had more scars to use it on. A+ product from an A+ company.
