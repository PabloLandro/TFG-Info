Aspirin for acne-prone skin
Aspirin has been around for a long time and its health benefits are wide and varied. Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid is a salicylate drug, often used as an analgesic to relieve minor aches and pains, as an antipyretic to reduce fever, and as an anti-inflammatory medication. Aspirin's greatest benefit is reducing cardiovascular events including heart attacks and strokes. According to the American Heart Assoc. virtually all women are at risk of heart disease and doctors should more strongly consider prescribing a daily aspirin for their female patients. There is growing evidence to suggest regular aspirin use may reduce cancer and dementia as well. Investigators from the Women's Health Study have reported important new findings demonstrating that aspirin reduces the risk of a first stroke in women. When given to someone immediately after a heart attack, aspirin decreases death by 25%.
Aspirin is remarkable for your skin. Its anti-inflammatory properties, capability of sloughing off dead skin cells thus preventing the clogging of pores makes it a terrific product in the treatment of acne and other skin inflammations.
Aspirin face-mask for oily, acne-prone skin
* Crush about 5 – 10 aspirin tablets to a powder.
* Mix to a paste with a little water, less than 1 teaspoon
* Apply this all over your cleansed face.
* Leave for twenty minutes to work its way into the skin and then rinse off with lukewarm water.
* Then apply a moisturizer.
* Try this weekly, after a face scrub.
This mask shows wonderful results on those people with open pores, acne and an extremely oily skin. It works well for other skin types also but they should restrict its usage to once or twice a month.
Aspirin mask for lightening scars and blemishes left by acne
As suggested in the above recipe, powder 4-5 aspirin tablets and mix it in yoghurt or pure Aloe Gel and apply it to your face. Let it sit for 15 minutes. Then wash it off with lukewarm water. Follow it up with a moisturizer to restores skin’s moisture. This mask helps to get rid of blackheads/whiteheads and smoothens the skin also.
Facial Toner with aspirin
Ingredients:
Distilled water – ½ cup
Vinegar – ½ cup
8-10 aspirins
Method:
Dissolve a few aspirins in water and add vinegar to it. Apply it to your face. This not only tones your face but is a good antiseptic lotion as well. Rinse your face with lukewarm water. Do not pat dry with a towel. Store excess in the refrigerator.

The best and cheapest thing you can do is to apply toothpaste directly on each zit before you go to bed. Put enough to cover it all.
At weekends or when you know you're not going to go out or have visitors, treat yourself to some toothpaste on the zits in the morning too.
They'll soon dry out.

I personally love the aspirin mask mixed with either just aloe vera gel (Fruit of the Earth) or some witch hazel/astringent toner. I would leave it on for 30 minutes tops and after rinsing (and scrubbing), I’d apply a calming mask or a sheet mask, followed by a light coating of jojoba oil after 20 minutes. It works wonders for my skin!

few suggestions of how to put aspirin to good use. The first one is a recipe for an aspirin face mask to treat oily, acne-prone skin. You'll need between 5 and 10 aspirin tablets, which you'll have to crush to a powder and then mix with a very small amount of water to get a smooth paste. For added benefits, mix the aspirin powder with a pure Aloe Vera gel instead of water. Apply the mixture all over your face, but not before cleaning it thoroughly with your usual face gel or - even better - doing a face scrub. Leave the mask on for about 20 minutes and rinse it off with warm water, then apply a moisturizer.

you need to minimize the oil to help prevent future outbreaks. You can use a gentle astringent to help clean away the oil on the surface or masques that contain ingredients such as sulfur to help draw excessive oil from the skin. It’s best to use a light skin moisturizer and all make-up worn should be oil-free. Never pick at or squeeze acne because this causes more problems and it can cause scarring.

Keeping your skin care routine as simple and as gentle as possible is also a must to maintain skin pH and oil balance. Oily skin is often a sign of incorrect diet, genetic, and over applying harsh chemicals – causing the skin to produce more oil to protect itself. Herbal ingredients have the best chance of naturally supporting skin health, without upsetting skin balance

The main culprit is your skin so all factors leading to more oil in your skin will aggravate the situation. First avoid oily food. Secondly avoid all external aggravating factors likeperfumes, nailpaint etc.

Don't scrub your face. Wash gently, using your fingertips instead of a washcloth.
If you wear sunscreen on your face, make sure it's labeled "nonacnegenic" or "noncomedogenic."
Wash your face after you've been exercising and sweating a lot.
Don't touch, squeeze, or pop pimples. The oil and dirt from your hands will just make things worse. Try some of the acne lotions and creams from your drugstore to see if they help. The ones that contain benzyl peroxide (kills bacteria) are usually the best

With up to 60 percent of topically applied ingredients absorbed by the skin, acne sufferers should be wary of active ingredients in conventional acne treatments, including benzoyl peroxide and triclosan; both of which can dry the skin and cause more harm than help.

Have a chemical peel performed. This is a good treatment for very light acne scarring. Different types of acid are applied to the top layer of the skin. The acid is then removed about 15 minutes later. Again this will remove the top damaged layers of the epidermis. Redness and swelling is common after the procedure. Depending on the amount of acid applied, recovery time can take from a day to a couple of weeks

Dermabrasions are another method to deal with how to get rid of old acne scars. This process rubs off the surface layer of skin using a rotating brush head similar to sandpaper. This is also most beneficial for helping with minor scarring as only the top layer of the skin is removed.

first of all don't stress yourself be calm ..
stress also cause the production of hormones, such as cortisol, which can aggravate acne. Stress brings upon different hormone levels. With hormone changes the body prompts the skins oil glands to enlarge, secreting more oil. Which causes white heads, black heads and pimples.
Natural home made skin care recipes is best for you. You can make it easily with available products in your kitchen and in home.

Try a face mask made of plain organic yogurt once a week. The beneficial bacteria will fight the bad bacteria and it also has lactic acid in it which is a mild exfoliant, so it will help clear pores. Leave it on at least 10 minutes and remove with a steamy but not too hot washcloth. You can eat the rest of the yogurt to get the benefit of that bacteria internally as well. A lot of skin problems are actually caused by digestion problems, so it's great to eat as well as use as a mask.
One thing I never realized either is that washing your face twice and rinsing very well helps a LOT. Afterward make sure to use a light moisturizer to replenish the skin so it doesn't produce excess oil to re-moisten it.

you know my suggestion would be leave the skin let it breathe, but while you are doing that change your diet and drink plenty of water while you at it, also i fount that going to the gym and go into the sauna or heat room opens the pores so when you come out just flash the face with some cold water, and if you are using a product give it time to work lets say 3 months, have you try Proactive, by the way that is what clear me and my son's face up, along with my suggestion, try it give it a chance to work and good luck, oh by the way avoid greasy foods

I had tremendous acne problems and I've tried pretty much everything out there. The best thing to do for your skin is to exfoliate it. When you exfoliate your skin your scrub away excess dead skin cells many of the dead skin cells are the dark spots left behind by acne scars. You don't need to spend allot of money to achieve good exfoliation either. Just google natural homemade skin exfoliants you can scrub your face with sea salt, sugar, or baking soda all of these products are safe to use on your skin. You will notice the difference almost immediately. Exercising and taking hot steam baths or sauna baths are god to open up pores and exfoliate the skin as well. Also, Aloe Vera leafs are excellent at helping to heal scars and skin aliments. winter your skin does not exfoliate as much and therefore pores become more clogged and less healthy

Unfortunately scarring actually takes 3 months to heal I talked to a chemist about it because I have scarring I wanted to get rid of fast, she said to me there is no fast cure all you can really do is cover the scars up with make-up until the scars go. I got a scar serum with vitamin E and you have to use it three times a day I have been using it now for a month and little by little my scar is fading away.

Since bacteria are a primary cause of acne, your dermatologist may recommend an antibiotic as a possible solution. Inquire whether there are products on the market that are natural or organic that would have the desired effect. Tea Tree oil, Echinacea or Witch Hazel are three natural products that have proven effective against bacteria and would assist anyone suffering skin blemishes, pimples, zits, acne or blackheads.

When the sebaceous gland is stimulated by androgens, it produces extra sebum. In its journey up the follicle toward the surface, the sebum mixes with common skin bacteria and dead skin cells that have been shed from the lining of the follicle. While this process is normal, the presence of extra sebum in the follicle increases the chances of clogging — and acne.

A better working solution that does sound very weird is using sperm on your face to clean it.

the best bet is to tackle it from the inside (i.e. nutrition) as well as with helpful organic products on the outside. Eating lots of veggies, drinking lots of water (and no other beverages such as pop, juices, milk) and avoiding refined sugars and grains helps, as can avoiding dairy products (completely, unless raw, organic). You might also want to try some natural acne cures like dabbing breakouts with organic coconut oil (with or without a sprinkle of turmeric in it). I also often recommend the Miessence Certified Organic Purifying line to my clients with acne. In combination with healthy dietary change they see very good results. Good luck and hang in there. You can have healthy skin!

Make sure to Cleanse your skin twice daily.
Steam your skin. Fill a bowl with boiling water. Cover your head with a towel and hold your face over the bowl, allowing the steam to penetrate your pores. The steam will draw impurities out from deep within your skin, promoting a clearer complexion. Rub lemon juice on your pimples.
Eat yogurt, it has bacteria that help your digestive tract to function, which, in turn, allow your body to disperse nutrients more effectively. This improves both your overall health, and your acne.
Use gentle cleansers, products like Clearasil can be very harsh on sensitive skin.

Avoid using body soap on your face. Use facial soaps that clean the pores in your skin. Acne is nothing more then your sweat pores clogging. They are called blackheads or whiteheads. When these become infected they become pimples. Blackheads are at the skins surface and feel like a grain of sand stuck in your face. Whiteheads are benethe the skins surface and may cause a small skin colored bump at most. You can lift the blackheads out by washing your face in the hottest water you can stand without burning yourself. Then after you dry your face you can squeeze the blackheads out by squeezing them with your finger tips. Do not use your fingernails because this cuts into the skin. Do not try too hard to squeeze to the point it turns the skin red. If one does not come out just leave it and try again later.

My acne, as yours seems to be, used to be utterly and completely uncontrollable. I, just like you, had tried everything. I was regularly going to a dermatologist and nothing was being fixed. I changed dermatologists, and she gave me a new regimen and my acne began to get better, but still wasn't completely cured. What really fixed my acne was changing my diet. Before, I would eat foods with lots of sugar in them. More sugar means more bacteria. And more bacteria means more acne. I limited the sweet and salty foods and tried to eat as healthy as possible. Also, believe it or not fruit has a ton of sugar in it, be it be good or bad sugar; its sugar. So, though you may think it may be helping you fruit tends to give me acne. But, diet alone cannot get rid of acne. Another thing to consider is what else might me causing it. If you are a teenager it is most likely hormones. Also, if you have really oily skin that might be causing it too. When you go to your dermatologist ask about pills you can take at breakfast that will reduce the amount of hormones your body producing covering both of these aspects. I'm not sure what the name of these pills are, but I'm sure your dermatologist will. This worked for me and I am crossing my fingers that it works for you too, because I know how much it hurts to have bad acne.

Covering the pimple with foundation will only make the problem worse, as will touching it. It will only increase the bacteria in the area and can irritate it, making it worse. What you should do is use a wash cloth with warm water and hold it against the pimple to bring the bacteria to the surface. Then use a gentle exfoliater with salicylic acid to wash the pimple to help exfoliate. Then wrap tissues around your fingers to get eliminate the risk of bacteria in it, and pull the skin apart. This should help pop the pimple. Then lightly squeeze and blot away the pus that comes out. If there is no head, don't try to pop it or it will only make things worse. Then follow up with 5% or 10% benzoyl peroxide on the area and it should eliminate the zit by the next day. If you get more zits, you should go to your dermatologist. He or she can give you free samples of products to try that may help too.

I know the Lotus Oil must scare you because you have oily skin, but The Lotus oil accually shrinks your pores and reduses your oil glands! So dont be afraid! haha Look it up at Clarins.com and read about it if you'd like.
My face had a MAJOR breakout 2 weeks ago, I bought the carisonic, cleared everything right up, seriously. Im so glad I bought it.
the clarisonic Mia isn't cheap so beware.

put half a cup of cucumber slices, half a cup of rosemary (u can get this from walmart), and 2 1/2 table spoons of salt into a blender. blend it. after you wash your face with any cleanser that doesnt moisterize, spread ONLY the juice from the blend onto your entire face. dont put on too much because you wont be washing it off. the cucumbers prevent acne, salt kills bacteria, and rosemary treats the acne and gives you a nice piney smell you need to keep it on as long as possible
blend it very well, but you only really need the juice strained from the blend
oh yeah i forgot theres one other ingredient: one egg white

Aloe has been used for years to naturally (without harsh chemicals) heal the skin.
"One of the most popular natural skin care herbs that can alter your appearance and change your complexion too. The juice of fresh aloe vera plant can remove scars within months. If you have not tried it, it’s never too late. Aloe vera based creams and facials are also effective, but not as good as natural aloe vera juice itself."Olive Oil
"Olive oil is a great aid for marks and scars appearing on the body. Massage your skin with olive oil to have scar-free skin and an even complexion."

Rinse your face daily in morning at before bed with lukewarm water.
Many of those things are harsh for your skin and may actually make it worse. Try Dove soap products. Also the 'original' Noxema leaves your skin feeling nice and will moisturize. Use that as a wash rinse.. It's harder to find however seeing as these companies keep replacing their products. I've not had my own in a while but loved to use it.. There is a really nice Dove cream soap in a bottle and it has a great refreshing scent. White bottle, light green lid. I used it up so am not sure the exact name. Just buy one of each. Ha! They have an anti- bacterial lathering cleaner with an orange lid that I liked too. If you are a girl, lay off the make-up. Especially the cover-ups because it will likely make your skin worse. Fortunately I have never had an issue with pimples much of my entire life but this is what I used. I have a sister however who swears by Ivory and loves her make-up.. NOT!! (zits).. Just had to throw that in.

My skin is very sensitive and acne prone and I've tried many moisturizers in my search for one that won't make me break out and that will go with my topical acne gel. For awhile I even just gave up on moisturizing - but I tan frequently so that isn't a solution. My best choice is Alba Botanica - Green Tea & Aloe Oil-Free Moisturizer. My skin is actually in better condition with an even tone after I use it, and it feels so soft afterward.

The first thing you need to do is to wash your face gently to remove excess dirt and oils from the surface.
You will then need to warm a clean towel in warm water and apply it to your face for 3 minutes. Do the same thing with the cold water but this time for one minute.
Carry out both the warm water and cold water procedure about 3 times but always finish with cold and then pat dry with another clean towel.
Next mix a small amount of castor oil with a small amount of olive oil. A 50/50 ratio will do just fine. Apply the mixture to your skin and let it stay there for 30 minutes and then rinse with warm water. Pat dry with a clean towel and you are good to go.

Here are some natural face masks.
Make your own face mask and exfoliater.
Here is an exfoliater:
Mix 2 teaspoons of baking soda with a few drops of warm water. Massage the paste over your face and rinse with warm water over the sink. Do this at least twice every week. Now here are some face masks:
Oatmeal-Yogurt Mask for OILY SKIN- Mix 2 tablespoons of uncooked oatmeal and 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt.
Honey-Oatmeal Mask for DRY SKIN- Mix 2 tablespoons of honey and 1 tablespoon of uncooked oatmeal.
Yogurt-Cucumber Mask for SENSITIVE SKIN- Puree 2 tablespoons of yogurt with 1/4 cup of peeled and sliced cucumber. Use a cotton ball to pat the mask onto your face and rinse with cool water.
Do these masks twice a week
THIS STUFF REALLY HELPS!
To get rid of acne also do this:
Stay hydrated!
Don't touch your skin a lot.
Wash your face every morning gently with soap and water.
Don't pick at your zits, it will leave scars.
Wash your pillow case often about once a week.
At night, put toothpaste on your zit and leave it on the whole night. Wash it off in the morning.

Even though dirt, pollution and oil in the exterior part of the skin do not cause acne, it could worsen the situation by blocking the pores. It is advisable to wash your face regularly or at least twice a day so that the pores do not get clogged.
Use an astringent to remove the excess oil.
Never use any oil-based cosmetic.
While going to bed make sure to remove your makeup and it is also advisable not to use any kind of cold cream and lotions.
When it comes to diet it is advisable to eliminate oily and fried stuff, fish and iodized salt. Too much consumption of iodine exacerbates the acne.
Alcohol-based lotions and creams are to be avoided completely.

Acne care: Clean skin with soapy water or an organic cleanser. You should do this twice a day even when you have no zits. The benzoyl peroxide (10%) creams are the most effective but are very hard on the skin. Most commercial products (including Proactiv) are based on this – use whichever one is cheapest.
Creams with tea tree oil (like ones by Thursday Plantation and Sanctum from Australia in the region where the tea tree oil comes from) work nearly as well but do not hurt the skin. They may take 3 or 4 applications to work compared to 2 or 3 for the peroxide. They are found in health food shops and are certified organic. Sanctum does a face wash too.

The best thing to use would be a face product that has glycolic acid in it or an Alpha Hydrox product. In time it will lessen the color of the scarred area. Do not use toothpaste. I know people suggest it a lot but it burns the skin. Vaseline will do nothing but make your skin greasy.

It's awesome that you're not trying to cover up your pretty face with makeup! You don't need it! I'm in my 20s. Although I still get pimples here and there, my skin is in great shape. Here's my skin care regiment for keeping my skin clear and fading dark spots:
I wash my face twice daily with the Wal-Mart brand of Neutrogena's Oil-Free Acne Wash. It really helps minimize acne.
In the morning, during the summer and fall, after washing my face, I moisturize with Ambi Even & Clear Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30. I love this moisturizer cuz it's lightweight, non-greasy, and has sunscreen. The summer sun makes our dark spots darker, but the sunscreen in this moisturizer prevents the darkening process.
At night after washing my face, I moisturize with Wal-Mart brand Vitamin E oil (a little goes a long way). Vitamin E is good for fading dark spots, but it takes time, about 3 weeks or more. I use this oil nightly all year-round. In the winter, my skin gets dry and ashy so I use this oil in the morning too. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized during those harsh winter days.
That's pretty much all I put on my face, other than eye makeup occassionally. When I wear eye makeup, I wash my face at night with Oili of Olay Daily Facials Hydrating Cleansing Cloths for normal/dry skin. These are good year-round too.
You might want to try more products in the Ambi line. Most Ambi products are geared toward evening skin tone and texture.
Also, make sure you drink water often. If you drink a lot of sodas or juice, try to limit your intake of sugary drinks, especially ones that are heavily colored. The more water your drink, the clearer and brighter your skin will be.

Mild comedonal acne is composed only of non-inflammatory comedones and can be usually treated with topical retinoid therapy (examples of which include treninoin, isotreninoin, adapalene, tazarotine, and retinaldehyde). This treatment eliminates mature comedones and prevents its formation. Some non-retinoids such as salicylic acid and azelaic acid are also used for the same purpose. When comedones become too large, physical treatment like extraction and electrocauterization in a clinic becomes necessary.

Use it twice a day, once a day with a washcloth to get ride of more dirt and grime. After a week, you should see results.

theres no over night cure. But clinique makes a good ance cleanser and kit. But it will cost you a pretty penny and take about 4 weeks to see improvements. But see a dermatologist they can give you pills or other treatments. But your acne will get worse before it get better with any treatment.
Or just stop eating junk food, Eat healthier, Drink water and not cokes and surgery drinks. Go outside more times during the day for fresh air. Get 8 hours of sleep and don't stress as much.

The sun is a powerful, natural acne solution because the sun's ultraviolet rays kill the bacteria that produces acne on your skin. So, normal exposure to sunlight is good because of it's ability to kill bacteria and drying effect on excess skin oil.
Normally, light to moderate acne cases can be treated at home with a homemade remedy. You can buy the things required at your local grocery store.
One of the most unusual acne remedies is bean tea. To make this tea, boil, then simmer a packet of green beans in a quart of water for about ten minutes. Add three tablespoons of dry chamomile flowers before simmering for another ten minutes. Chamomile teabags can be used for this. After boiling, cover until it is cool, the strain the tea into a clean bottle. Use instead of water to wash your face three times a week.
Another acne remedy is Aloe Vera juice or gel because it is a neutralizer and it starts healing acne outbreaks. One issue with it is that it can dry out your skin, so you will have to use some kind of moisturizer because dry skin will further increase the production of excess oils.
Also, lemon juice is quite an effective home acne solution. The acid inside the lemon cleans pores and promotes healthy skin regeneration. Lemon juice will help remove excess oil, kill bacteria and promote a normal pH balance for your skin.
Cucumber works quite well too. In a food processor, blend a peeled cucumber, strain and apply this juice to your skin. After that, clean you face and apply raw egg white with a cotton ball or swab to your face and/or any other areas affected by acne. Let it dry and tighten, as it will work as an astringent to soak up excess oils, Wash off with warm water.
Natural oatmeal or porridge oats are a good home solutions for acne and all sorts of other skin irritations. Gently cook for a couple of miutes and then cool some rolled oats. When it is lukewarm, apply this to your face and let it dry for about 15 minutes. Then, wash it off completely. Oats provide an acne solution as they have astringent properties to remove oil and impurities, so that your skin stays clean and acne-free.
Strangely, you can wash your face with an acne solution made from sugar, a tiny bit of water and several drops of olive oil. Wash your hands and then pat this scrub onto the blemished areas. Sugar has an antibacterial effect on your skin, clearing it of acne and blemishes.

I use tea tree oil on acne as well. I put it on before bed after I've washed my face. You have to be careful that you don't put too much on though (and believe me, u will know if you do...it'll burn) and also do not get it near your eyes. Just last night I had to wash the oil off because the fumes alone were burning my eyes.

Find the cause of it! If you've been clear for so long and are just now starting to break out, there must be a change within your body.
Are you eating new foods? Have you gone out for fast food? Something may not be agreeing with your body. You may be intolerant to a certain type of food. Milk seems to do it to me. I can drink small amounts daily, but if I drink it more often it shows in my skin! Yuck... :(
Using any new products? They might not work with your skin. Or, if you've just started using something, your skin might be adjusting itself to them. It takes a month or two sometimes. You may be over cleansing. Do you find your skin is quite oily? Ditch the toner (it's not needed...makeup artists will tell you the same thing). Most of the time it just dries out your skin. Your cleanser will do everything the toner claims to do. Tea tree oil is great...So stick with that. Just make sure it's gentle enough. Drying out your skin (even if it's oily to begin with) can just make it produce even more oil and in turn more acne. You could even try cleansing and moisturizing at night and then rinsing with water in the morning. It works well for me. I have dry skin and hate to over cleanse it!
Even a new shampoo or conditioner can give you breakouts. So keep that in mind.
Is it that time of the month? Breakouts around your period are very common. Sometimes a week or two before...Sometimes during...Sometimes a week or two after! Not much you can do for that.
I suggest you drink TONS of water and fill up on water filled foods like watermelon, cucumber, celery, salad...etc. That way, the toxins will be flushed out of your body much faster. Water is GREAT for skin!

First of all: Dont touch your face with dirty hands(dont pick at it) and dont pop your pimples because of course that causes scars. Wash your face with warm/hot water to open the pores and use a good face cleaner. I used to wear cover up make up and I stopped. Keeping my face clean and drinking lots of water cleared it up. Now I dont need cover up.

Only use oil free products that won't clog pores & cause acne! Products that work for one person may not work for another person, so always do small patch test on face for a couple of days to see how skin will react to product! Don't quickly jump from product to product! Give skin a break before trying new product to prevent irritation! Natural & gentle products are sometimes more effective than acne medicine! If you are going to use acne medicine, prevent irritation & dryness by using a medicine-free cleanser (step 1), and then only using ONE medicated formula! Decide which ONE formula will have the acne medicine in it:

open your pores first by placing a hot damp cloth over your face for a couple minutes, then spread the honey on. it works because the natural sugars kill bacteria. it also softens your skin. leave it on for about 10-15 minutes then just rinse off with warm water.
also when using products on your face, make sure no more than 1 product is medicated. he may have told you this already, but over medicating your skin can irritate it and make it break out more

I know this is probably going to sound gross for most of you peoples, but when i was younger everybody was telling me to wash my face, so i obeyed and i started washing my face. washing my face was the worst thing i ever did to my skin no matter what kind of soap i used, even that gentle stuff for sensitive skin... I stopped washing my face shortly after i started and have only washed my face when i needed to from caked on costume makeup (like going into washroom specifically to wash my face, scrub it so on). I never had really bad acne like ive seen before, but i didnt understand why if my face wasnt breaking out into one big pimple why i would want to wash out what wasnt negatively effecting my skin to make room for what could.
however when i do get a pimple, i use this natural stuff from the health store. my favorite stuff was this clay stuff that dried it out and it would dissapear the next day. only makeup thing i use to rid of pimples is almay. i swear by it. put it on and its gone next day!

The aspirin mask both exfoliates your skin and heals blemishes and scars. I've had a few acne scars on my cheeks that haven't healed from any of the expensive masks, and this took care of them within a few days!I apply facial moisturizer after the mask to make sure that my skin doesn't dry out too much. I don't need to apply any other sort of facial creams or anything because the mask takes care of everything for me.Your face feels refreshed and clean, and your wallet isn't completely empty for it. I use the aspirin mask every other day, and I don't have any problems with acne at all! Just remember to keep the powdered aspirin capped off, since it gets chunky from absorbing moisture if you leave it open for too long.

there are several measures you could take to lighten the discoloration caused by your scars. Make a mixture of equal parts of lime juice, hydrogen peroxide and water and dab this on the particularly persistent scars. This should not be left on your skin for more than five minutes. Then you can wash this off with plain water well and thoroughly. Make sure that there are no remnants left on your skin. After this, you should apply a paste made with sandalwood powder and rose water to your face. This will help to soothe the skin,

Many teens have acne problems mostly brought on by changes in hormones. Some are worse than others.
It's important to keep your skin clean. Use acne products designed to your particular needs. There are different kinds that you can get OTC.... www.acne.orNeutrogena On-the-Spot,Clearasil,Oxy-10Fostex,Clear by Design,Persa-Gelg/over-the-counter.php
Keep your hands off your face as much as possible. You might be surprised how much you do lean on your hands during the course of a day. This can make it worse. When you get close to your periods then you need to be especially vigilant in a routine of keeping your skin clean.Because of the type of acne you describe you may need to use an oral antibiotic to help keep your skin clear. These are usually very mild doses but work great. If you do get a deep pimple, use a damp heat pack to help make it come to the surface. Those kind are basically a type of infection. until they drain, they are going to hurt. I know that you don't like the look after they start draining but you need to allow that.As soon as you can get to a doctor about it do go and get help in keeping your skin clear.

3 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next morning with warm water. If done daily for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root.

Don't use any chemicals. Just use a mild soap to wash your face at least twice a day.
Drink a lot of water...at least 1 liter per day and eat fruits. Apples, Pear, Peach and Oranges. I had pimple problem before and used chemicals to get rid of it. Nothing worked so my mum told me to just drink plenty of water and eat fruits. Now my face is soooo clear and smooth
Trust me it takes about 2, 3 months for the pimples to go away but it better than using chemicals. Chemicals will make it worse. If you use chemicals your pimples will disappear in like a week but they will be back and will be worse. Drinking water keeps your body system healthy and water and fruits are very good for the skin.

i had the same prob and nothing worked until my gramma told me about lemon juice. what i do is wet my face with warm water get a cotton round, squeeze th elemon juice onto the round, sprinkle some sugar and scrub your face for about a min and rinse. i do this every night ans it got rid of all my acne and its even starting to fade my scars. the best thing is its so cheap and it works 10x better than any product Ive tried.
i use neutrogena fade and fight correcter to help fade acne scars works great with the lemon

Get a needle. Put it in rubbing alchohol or under fire for 10-20 seconds each. Pit the needle (after cooling or drying) through the pimple (as there should be no pain). Then when it has gone all the way through pull up. When you have gotten all the pimples just wash your face.

Whenever you clean your face at all times use a medicated soap created for use with acne. Always clean your face carefully, cleaning too hard is likely to aggravate your acne. Only wash your face a couple of times a day, more than this can provoke the glands of the dermis, causing it to create too much oil.

Look for foods that are a great source of vitamin A such as eggs. It is able to help eliminate toxins from your system and is a strong antioxidant. As well as helping promote clear skin it also helps deter outbreaks of acne in the future.

Boil water. Add some salt into water, and then apply to pimple on face.(use wash-cloth) The water must be very hot in order to work, it will burn, but this helps kill the germs, wash with your regular face-wash, and apply your face cream. The next morning u will notice it is gone down, repeat every night and you'll see the difference.

Improper skincare products are often a cause of pimples. When you are buying skincare products, make sure that they are suitable for your skin type. Pimples usually decrease as a person ages because the skin produces less oil.

its so embarrassing and horrible to have acne. Never touch your face! Touching your face causes acne i stopped touching my face and my skin cleared up fast. Try not to use concealers or face makeup because they clog your pores use a cleanser with salicylic acid in it and u can use non oily moisturizers around the dry areas of your skin its best to wash your face everyday night and morning and dont stress it only causes more acne. Using too many products can irritate ur skin and make it worse. also do not use accutane because it has very dangerous side effects

i have a lot on my face from acne and they make me self-conscious. however, scars that are located on my legs or other bodies...well, nobody cares really!
besides they're scars. you can't get rid of them!

To remove pimple marks, grind two or three neem leaves into a paste and mix with a tablespoon of multani mitti soaked in water. Apply this to clean skin and let it dry completely before washing it off. Do this daily for 15 days.

Raw tomato can be applied on acne lesions for a smoothing effect. Picking or squeezing a pimple always makes it worse, that is why we got to be always gentle with it. Apply fresh cut slices or just tomato pulp over the pimples and let it work for a while, then sweep an ice cube over it for few second. Rinse off and pat dry.

My suggestion useing
1)Garnier-Deep clean Foaming wash;Use this morning and night, with warm water a face cloth and circular motions. dry your face after
2)Biore-Triple action toner-Using cotton makeup rounds, place a generous amount onto cotton pad makeup round and palce on face. let it dry in
3)Benzyl peroxide(start off with 2.5% than go to 5%.), This is the active ingredient in proactive, so this product may not work for you, so if not, i would suggest OXY acne solution creams.(you can also try clearasil extra strength 8 hour cream or neutrogena acne cream)
This is a 3 step process, which you must continue twice daily, every day.
if you want something cheaper for you face wash, try Gamophen, comes in a soap, but its not a soap, its for your face :)
-Try also to wash your wash after swetting, being around dirt etc.
-Get your hairy out of your face.
-Use a proper, non oily sunscreen(i dont use sunscreen at all, it causes me to break out)
-stay away from chocolate. soda, etc
-Have Cod Liver Tablets daily, from chemist.(they dont have on the packet that its good for your face. but trust me, its great for your skin).
-I have 2 carrots daily, helps also with your skin-drink plenty of waterThis is what i followm, day in day out, and know i have amazing clear skin, about 6 months ago, it was horrible .

DO NOT SQUEEZE THEM.
get a spot-on-roll-thing and apply it whenever you have time. Use tea tree face washes. Wash a lot. Don't coat your face in make up (if ur a girl,) cos tho it may make it look better for a day, it will be a *LOT* worse tomorrow.

acne is quite normal for teenagers because of hormonal changes however there are some things you can do to reduce it. the major cause of bad acne is diet. if you eat a well balanced diet with lots of vegies you will notice a huge difference. also drink lots of water everyday to keep your skin hydrated. stay away from the harsh skin cleansers and try an antibacterial wash with tea tree oil in it. also exfoliate regularly. the main thing is the diet tho. let me explain why. the skin is basicly the last route out for all the toxins in the body, including toxins in the food you eat. much of this can get trapped in your pores and become infected and this is why you get pimples. so if you are eating healthy food with minimal toxins, then you are attacking the problem at it's source rather than trying to fix it from the other end with facial cleansers etc.
good food for your skin:
*oily fish - tuna, salmon
*avocado
*strawberries
bad food for your skin
*acidic fruits like oranges
*milk and other dairy products (in a surprising amount of people, acne can be the result of a mild allergy to dairy products without them even being aware)
*fats and oils
*sugar
i guarantee you will notice a difference if you change your diet. give it a try for a month or so and see what happens :)
i hope this helps, i suffered through bad acne even after i was a teenager and a change in diet was the only thing that helped. good luck to you!

Try this tea tree oil treatment:
1 tsp apricot kernel oil
10 drops pure organic tea tree oil
3 drops chamomile essential oil
2 drops geranium essential oil
Combine all ingredients in a small pump bottle. Can be used twice daily on problem areas. The author says not to use during the first 3 months of pregnancy.
If you don't want to buy all of those oils, go with just tea tree oil and apricot or other base oil.

diet....make sure to eat right. a balanced diet,will help. and less caffeine products which stimulate acne pron people. sugars too. less greasy foods. keep face washed with simple face products. keep away stress as much as possible. as your body adjusts and balances out ,as you get older it will go away. look up vitamins for skin...maybe you are lacking those and can eat what puts those back into your body.if you are female..try not to wear makeup for awhile.or change to one that does not have all the oils in them.

he main thing you need to do is drink a lot of water. try to carry a bottle with you at all times. water will clear up your system. yes you are going to go to the bathroom but do it for a few days and your acne will clear up. you should try not to eat junk food, once in a while is okay. and also try to eat fish. I know some people may not like it, but the fish oils are good for your health and will help clear up your skin.

i'm struggling with acne right now. :P But here are some things that might help. Some things might work, others might not. There are different types of acne and different causes.
*wash your face twice a day
*use lemon juice and honey as a mask
*dab tea tree oil directly onto pimples (it's really drying)
*get some OTC meds for acne
*drink a lot of water
*wash hair daily and keep hair out of face
If you try all of those and your pimples still don't go away, you should probably visit a dermatologist, which is what i'm probably going to do.

I have been using this product for two years now. Yes, two years. Every morning, I get three uncoated aspirin and mix it with some water, scrubbing my face while in the shower. My skin just FEELS better when I'm done with this. I ran out of aspirin a few days ago, and started breaking out with small pimples and clogged pores all over my chin. I ran out to go buy the aspirin, and within ONE day, it is better. I love the Aspirin exfoliation. I buy a big thing of 500 at Walmart for 3.50ish, very cheap price. Sometimes, if I'm having a breakout, I'll do the mask, and that also seems to be effective in healing my larger pimples quicker than normal. I have encouraged my sister to try this as well, and it's made her skin so soft and smooth.

If you have pimples & want them to heal while you cover them up, try a concealer with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid or sulfur. You’ll want to avoid makeup with mineral oil or petrolatum, which can clog pores, according to NYC dermatologist Brad Katchen in the March 2006 issue of InStyle magazine.
Extra tip: If you have pimples, apply concealer with a concealer brush. Clean brush between applications. A good cleanser is Paula Dorf Brush-Out Cleanser.

1. Get a bowl of steaming water and hold your face over it for 20 secs.
2. wrap 1-2 ice cubes in a paper towel and hold it on the affected area(s) for 10 secs.
3. Repeat 1-2 7 times
4. Wash your face with any special acne soap (or any facce soap)
5. Get cleansing pads (i use sterix, available at walgreens)
repeat these for a week! (clean your face 2-3x a day)

Apply a honey mask to your face once or twice a week - Honey has antibacterial properties so it is great for disinfecting and healing minor blemishes. It is also gentle on sensitive skin.
Wash twice a day with acne soap - You should wash your face twice a day with a sulfur based soap designed for acne. Once when you first wake up in the morning and then, right before you go to bed at night. Be extremely gentle to your skin when washing - do not scrub or use any sort of rough cloth. Overwashing your skin will actually stimulate your sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, thus increasing your acne.
Keep your hair off your face - If you have long hair or bangs, pull your hair off your face. Your hair contains oils as well, and will contribute to your breakouts. You'll also want to wash your hair everyday and after workouts
Take a potent multi-vitamin - Acne can be a sign that something is wrong on the inside. Your skin depends on nutrition. It is a vital organ that is usually neglected. If your body is not receiving the right nutrition, it will fight back. One common way it will rebel is to produce excessive sebum, clogging pores, and reducing the ability for your skin to heal and fight bacteria.
Include chromium in your diet - Chromium is well known for weight loss diets. But it is also excellent for healing infections on the skin. Taking a chromium supplement once a day will help heal your pimples quickly and prevent future breakouts.
Eat carrots for beta-carotene (Vitamin A) - Vitamin A strengthens the protective tissue of the skin and actually prevents acne. It helps reduce sebum production. This vitamin is essential for the maintenance and repair of the tissue which the skin and mucous membranes are made of. Vitamin A is also a powerful antioxidant needed to rid your body of toxins. Did you know that a deficiency in vitamin A can actually cause acne?
Avoid wearing makeup - Leaving makeup products on your skin only contributes to clogging your pores, causing more pimples and blackheads. If you feel you must wear makeup, be sure it is water-based.
Do not pick or squeeze your blackheads and pimples - As tempting as it may be, do not squeeze, scratch, rub or touch your pimples and blackheads. Do any of these actions, actually increases the sebum production. Plus, when you squeeze, you are actually rupturing the membranes below your skin, causing infection and sebum to spread underneath your skin. The result is more pimples.
Wash your pillow case every other day - Your face lays on your pillow case every day. Your pillow case absorbs the oils from your skin and reapplies the dirt and oil. Thus causing breakouts. Keep your sheets and pillow cases clean.
Eat foods rich in zinc - Zinc is an antibacterial agent and a necessary element in the oil-producing glands of the skin. A diet low in zinc can actually cause acne breakouts.

The very best over the counter medicine for acne is benzoyl prexoide. Use this, but be careful because it will bleach clothes, so maybe nightime is better. This will cause some dryness so you can use some face lotion over it, which will help the irritation as well.
If you have moderate acne, i would go see a dermatologist and ask for a medicine called ACNZONE. It prevents pimples and is quite effective at doing so. I have been using samples for 2 months and not had one breakout since. I used to get big cysts, but now i am breakout free. This medicine is made in USA, so i'm not sure if it's available in India, but do go check.Now, be confident and don't worry about pimples because it's a normal thing and studies is more important.

Here's some generic tips!
1. Try to not let your hair touch your face (transfers a lot of oil).
2. Try to sleep with your face upwards on your pillow or keep your pillowcase clean (again, oil transfer + grime if you don't wash your hair before bedtime).
3. Don't pop them (scars)!
Money solution~
If you've been using saclylic (sp?) acid based face cleansers, try glycolic ones. They're the same price and your skin's chemistry might just work better with another type.

I suggest that you try red clover acne tea. It's actually and blend of several natural ingredients and good for a variety of inflammatory skin conditions, acne being one of them. I personally endorse this product because I use it and began using it without telling my family about it, drinking it one to two times a day.Shortly after beginning to use it--about 2 weeks--I was helping my mother do something on the computer. She kept looking looking at me. Finally, she just stopped and said "What did you do to you skin?" Confused, I said "Nothing. Why?" She said "It looks so much better and so healthy!" Thinking rapidly I responded "Oh, that. I started to drink this special tea to help me with my acne. I suppose it's working!"
I've now been using red clover tea for a few months and my skin is healthier than ever. The bumps on my face have gone down, my skin is smoother than ever and my skin is less oily. The bumps on my back and chest have also gone down. I still have a few but compared to before they're nothing about which to complain. The best part is that it only costs me $15 every 6 weeks to 2 months to maintain my acne fighting routine which is significantly less than other acne fighting systems like Proactiv or Klear and my skin is not left feeling dry and tight, as is a common side effect with those systems.
It does treat scars but only slightly. They are supposed to be releasing a mask that help to heal the skin and treat scars.I do continue to clean my face a few times a week with a facial cleanser and I do use a drying agent every now and again as they do have their benefits but I do not rely on them anymore.

Use a Detergent FREE Facewash. As you have Acne-prone skin, it will be sensitive and detergents can cause irritation which could lead to further infection.
Secondly NEVER use a Facewash that dries your skin - this will cause the skin to overcompensate and produce too much oil, which could lead to clogging of pores. Any facewash which promises to clean all the oil is not advisable as natural Oil produced by the skin is essential for the nourishment and protection of the skin.

Do not Scrub the Acne spots unless you are using a Natural and Gentle scrub - say something herbal.Always use a "Moisturizer for Acne-prone skin" after washing the Face as letting the skin dry could lead to aggravation of acne and use a Gel instead of a Cream to apply on Acne spots.

Yes without a doubt, my son has/had really bad acne. On his face, back, arms, legs. You name it! I took him to a local dermatologist that has really reasonable rates 50.00. Each visit they evaluate him and provided a series of lotions and an antibiotic, a freeze method (kills off the bacteria) and UV light treatment. His skin cleared up very quickly. Call around and find a good dermatologist. One that uses this method it works. Try and get a handle on it cause you don't want permanent scars. Good luck! BTW the lotions and pills were extra but still very reasonable and a much better way to go then proactive cause it didn't work for him either. This method above works~
