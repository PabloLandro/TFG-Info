ATHLETE'S FOOT TREATMENT
We believe that having the right information will equip you in making the best decisions regarding your foot and ankle health.

Dr. Pinkser is extremely dedicated to providing the most up-to-date and accurate information so you can learn more about your injury or condition, the activities that lead to them and treatment information.
Our podiatric office treats all aspects of foot and ankle injuries and conditions. Common foot and ankle injuries include:

For your use, we have provided an extensive patient library covering an array of topics on foot and ankle health. If you have a specific concern or topic of interest, please use the search box below on the left or browse through our resource library.
While you can find valuable and helpful information on our site, it should not be used as a replacement for a proper consultation and examination by Dr. Pinsker. If you have sustained an injury, are experiencing any pain or are concerned about a foot or ankle problem, please contact our office and schedule an appointment today.
If untreated, skin blisters and cracks caused by Athlete's Foot can cause serious bacterial infections. The treatment of Athlete's Foot depends on the type and extent of the fungal infection, so it is important to consult our practice before choosing a therapy.
Athlete's Foot can usually be treated with antifungal creams. Re-infection is common, so it is important to continue the therapy as prescribed, even if the fungus appears to have gone away. Lasting cases of Athlete's Foot may require foot soaks before applying antifungal creams. Severe infections that appear suddenly (acute) usually respond well to treatment. Toenail infections that develop with Athlete's Foot tend to be more difficult to cure than fungal skin infections.
