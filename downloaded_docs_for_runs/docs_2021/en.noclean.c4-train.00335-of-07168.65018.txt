Description</a></p>
<div class=”ntc_box_1″>
<p>L-Theanine is what gives tea its relaxing, anti-stress appeal. In
this concentrated form, it creates a focusing anti-anxiety effect that is
valued in itself, and is also used to take the edge off other nootropic
compounds.</p>
<p>Often taken with an early morning coffee, L-Theanine reduces the
jitters and anxiety of caffeine whilst amplifying the cognitive benefits,
creating a clean and lucid energy. It has a similar mellowing and amplifying
effect on <a href=”../piracetam/”>Piracetam</a>, <a
href=”../phenylpiracetam/”>Phenylpiracetam</a> and <a
href=”../adrafinil/”>Adrafinil</a>.</p>

<p><b>Capsules per day</b>: 1 – 3</p>
<p><b>Effects onset</b>: 30 – 60 minutes</p>
<p><b>Effects duration</b>: Main effect lasts 2 – 4
hours, with some residual effects up to 10 hours.</p>

<li>If used for sleep quality improvements, take 1 hour before

<p><b>Alcohol note:</b> Safe to consume with alcohol.
Additionally, L-Theanine has some tentative evidence of being a potent
antioxidant and hangover prevention method, as well as protecting the liver
from damage caused by alcohol consumption.</p>
