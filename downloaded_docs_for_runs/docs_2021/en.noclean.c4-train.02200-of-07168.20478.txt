If you ever get a light burn on your fingers, my grandmother always said to bury your fingers in your scalp for a little while. It will take the heat away. And, also she would put dirt in a bowl and add water and make mud. It's a cooling reaction and, it works. : )

When you have a mild burn, rub toothpaste over it and sprinkle some salt. It prevents the blisters.

I am sure the advice on putting toothpaste and salt on a burn is BAD. For minor burns, one should run cool water or place cool wet compresses on the burn. No salves of any sort. For deeper, second or third degree burns, standard practice is medical care for severe burns. If a burn blisters, cover the blister with sterile bandage and leave it alone. Do not pop blisters.. Opening a blister invites infection. The skin over the blister protects it.

Hello! For a minor burn, aloe vera directly from the plant really eases the burn and it's all natural. Happy New Year! :)

crack open a fresh egg and apply the membrane which is against the egg shell against the area that is burned. apply that the part of the membrane that was touching the egg itself. Instant relief because the nerve endings in the skin have been separated from the air.

I agree with the above poster from Thrifty_Fun who says this is bad practice. Minor burns are just a reddened area - if the burn is bad enough to blister it is not a minor burn. The only thing I would add to the correct recommended first aid treatment above is for any burn, minor or major, to minimise damage cool the area under running cool water FOR A MINIMUM OF 20 MINUTES immediately it occurs. This also relieves pain.

I am writing to respond to a previous submission. I am absolutely sure that putting toothpaste on a burn works. I have done it many times, and it is amazing how it works. I only wish I knew why. Cold water is important to stop the burning immediately after the burn has occurred, but toothpaste (and it must be the white paste -- the gel doesn't work) not only stops the throbbing but it somehow toughens the skin on the outside of the blister so that it is less likely to break, thus allowing your newly-forming skin to heal itself in the safety of the blister. You don't have to apply the toothpaste immediately (as you would the cold water). Rather, cool the burn, dry it carefully or let it air dry, then apply the toothpaste. I let it dry before covering it because I don't want the bandage to absorb the toothpaste.

The skin will toughen overnight. Over the next few days, you'll notice that the blister goes down and the skin gets tougher. Eventually, the outer/burned skin falls off. If you break the blister, however, I would treat with an antibiotic and keep moist (with antibiotic) and covered.
Bizarrely, toothpaste works better than any product I've ever tried. Note that I have only used this on minor burns.

If you've burnt your hand, make up a paste of baking soda and water, and apply to the burnt area; it will really ease the pain.

I think that the advice about putting aloe vera on a burn is the best (besides running under cool water) this is all natual and it has a cooling action. You just have to reapply as the aloe absorbs the heat and isn't cool any more.

Whatever you do DON'T PUT SALT OR TOOTHPASTE ON A BURN it irritates the skin and also dries it out so now you have 2 irritations on top of each other.

My favorite remedy for a minor burn is apple cider vinegar. I have used it many times since I am a kitchen klutz with the oven and I have never blistered. I keep it very close and douse area liberally alternating with cold tap water and finishing off with more of the apple cider vinegar. I have been using this remedy for over twenty years and recommend it highly.

for a minor burn on your finger I was always told to immediately pinch your earlobe to cool it. I have done this for years and it works well...if you don't have any cold water to run over it. Give it a try.

I burned my left index finger on my outdoor grill's hood. I briefly ran cool, not cold, hose water on it and applied white toothpaste on it---as I have done for years---and almost immediately the pain went away.

This ABSOLUTELY works every time. I have no idea why, but I swear by it.

I'm sorry to have to disagree with nearly everyone, but cool water is not the best idea. It does make the burn feel instantly eased at the moment, but it will actually make it burn longer. You are just driving the heat deeper, in a manner of speaking. If you can withstand the pain for a little while it will go away much much more quickly than if you stick it under water. Adding aloe or tripple anitbiotic ointment does help the pain and is a must to get through that time right after the burn happens, but cool water, ice, whatever... they will all make it burn longer than it would without them.

What do you do for a burn that has had ice on it for two hours, but it just won't stop throbbing when the ice is taken off the burn for more than four seconds?

I had a fairly severe burn from a raging hot clothes iron. The burned skin instantly turned black. I was in immense pain, you know... the barely tolerable kind, when my mother-in-law told me to put toothpaste on it. I seriously thought she was out of her mind but at that point I would have put nearly anything on it at the hope of taking the edge off the pain. Not only did it work and I felt no pain after just a few moments, but after a few days the black skin seemed to peel away and there's not so much as a scar.

Now to anyone reading this that might get funny ideas... if you get any type of third degree burn the first thing you should do is seek medical attention. In my case, the toothpaste was a welcome relief and I've used it ever since. The only way to know if it works for you, is to try it yourself. Take care!

The two people who said not to use toothpaste have obviously never tried it. Don't listen to them... it absolutely does work. I can't even count how many times I've used it, but it has never failed. Immediate relief, no pain, and no blister. I have no idea why.
There was one burn over a large area where I missed a spot. It was very obvious which area had been treated with the toothpaste and which had not.

I burned myself with fireworks one year on the Fourth of July and a young hispanic gal that was with me told me to apply toothpaste to the burn. I thought she was crazy, but it hurt like hell so I did, and what do you know, it worked! Try it for yourself.

I just burnt my fingers on a hot grill, placing my fingers in ice was a quick way to stop the pain but as soon as I removed them, the pain was intolerable, so I tried the toothpaste remedy and guess what, I felt immediate relief!

The best thing for you to do is put colgate toothpaste on your burn. But it can only be paste not gel.

On 4th of July, I burnt my finger. I didn't cry. I did put it in cold water for 2 minutes then I put ice on it. Then I put cream on it, and wrapped in a bandage. The next day it is just a blister.

Putting salt on a fresh burn sounds odd, but it works to keep the skin from blistering. I'm a cook and getting burnt all the time. It won't take the pain away, but it truly will stop it from blistering.

I got burned 45 min back. Touched a hot pot. I put cold water straight away, and used a bowl of cold water. Saw here everyone is saying about toothpaste. It's been 5 mins. I have put white colgate. It doesn't seem to be working.

I burned my finger tips with pop tart icing sticking to my fingers while taking it out of the toaster. Burning is unbearable it was burning for 3 hours I ran my fingers under cold water, used ice pack, aloe, and A&D cream. In the end I applied a gel toothpaste (didn't have white paste available) It still throbbed for 5 minutes, but the pain is less and getting better. Thanks for the remedies.

To day I accidently stepped on my curling iron and it hurts a lot. I hear tooth paste works but what other stuff I can use to make the pain go away.
Editor's Note: Cool water or ice on any new burn helps.

Use toothpaste and you won't get cavities where the burn was! Must be a paste and have flouride.

*DO NOT* use ice water on the burn. It's only useful if you do it in the first few seconds of the burn occurring. Otherwise you run the risk of frostbite. Cool or tepid water is fine, it keeps the burn site clean. Go to a respected medical site for more info, mother's remedies for burns are really not appropriate.

Cough Syrup! I burnt two of my fingers pushing in my oven rack, then spent an hour with my finger cooling in water. This was only a temp pain reliever, so I went to the store (almost jumping up and down from the pain, is there anything worse then a minor burn?) and the burn ointment did nothing.
Came back home, checked here, and went on a search for paste toothpaste (I don't have any). Then I went looking for Baking Powder (couldn't find it). But on my shelves I saw the cough syrup! I thought since it numbs painful throats it might work on my finger.Dabbed it on, Instant relief! From a throbbing pain level 7.5 down to a 0.5. It really works! I also covered my blisters with band-aids to keep the syrup on longer.

I worked as a short order cook for many years. When you burn yourself, cool it immediately and then (if you don't have burn cream) put some damp salt on the burn. It prevents blistering.
