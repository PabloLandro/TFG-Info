hite hair patches or poliosis is a condition wherein a person has a patch of grey or white hair in his head in an otherwise naturally colored hair. People are either born with it or develop it. It can be seen in both adults as well as children primarily resulting due to lack of or decrease of melanin in the roots of the hair or hair follicles that have been affected. Though poliosis is harmless and can be easily covered using hair dyes, bandanas, hats etc., sometimes it may accompany some serious health issue. Though more commonly affecting our scalp hair, white hair patches may also appear on eyelashes, eyebrows or any other hairy body part. Once you have poliosis it hardly spreads. It is a permanent hair condition. [1]

Causes of White Hair Patches
Some of the factors that may lead to poliosis or white hair patches include
Autoimmune disease
Genetics
Hair follicle damage
Certain Medical Conditions That May Occur Along With Poliosis Include
Alopecia areata: Loss of hair primarily from the scalp
Vitiligo: Pigment loss from the skin resulting in melanin-less patches in the epidermis
Piebaldism: A white hair patch appears above your forehead and many a time causes discoloration of the forehead skin.
Halo moles: Moles having white rings surrounding them
Tuberous sclerosis: Overgrowth of cells in different tissues and organs of the body
Allezandrini syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and Waardenburg syndrome: These rare conditions lead to hair and epidermal pigmentation changes along with vision, neurological and hearing issues.
Certain medicines can also trigger white hair patches. These include cetuximab, an anticancer drug, and chloramphenicol, an antibiotic.
Sudden and extreme psychological stress, some disease or pain have also been linked to poliosis. [2]
White Hair Patches Could Be a Warning Symptom of the Following Detrimental Health Conditions
Eye conditions: Research has revealed that white patches of hair occur more often in those suffering from uveitis, an eye inflammation which if not treated can lead to cataract and glaucoma. So, you can consider poliosis as a warning signal and seek appropriate therapy before any condition of eye develops.
Melanoma: This skin cancer affects those cells that give the epidermis its color. At times, white hair patches serve as the first signal of melanoma.
Thyroid problems: A study had revealed that children suffering from vitiligo a condition related to poliosis were more prone to autoimmune disorder and thyroid problems. Thyroid problems can lead to depression, fatigue, memory problems, high cholesterol, weight gain etc.
Treatment Options
Certain medical therapies are said to reverse poliosis. These are:
A study revealed that a grafting treatment of skin which was followed by light therapy for a period of four to eleven months helped completely correct white hair patches combined with vitiligo.
In another study, it was reported laser therapy along with regular topical application of an ointment and consumption of oral medication helped a thirty-seven-year-old man with vitiligo and poliosis in left eyebrow.
After forty-four sessions of laser therapy in six months, seventy percent return of eyebrow color was seen.
Dyeing is also used to cover up the white patches.
Natural Therapies That Can Be Used
As white hair patches often accompany vitiligo some of the natural vitiligo therapies may help with poliosis. These include; [3]
Natural therapies
Folic acid and vitamin B12
Copper
Beta carotene
Zinc
Vitamin C
Aloe vera
Vitamin D
Gingko Biloba
1. Folic acid and vitamin B12
A combination of sun exposure, folic acid, and vitamin B12 was found to be effective in initiating repigmentation in more than half of the participants in a two-year study. In sixty-four percent of the patients, vitiligo spread could be inhibited especially in the areas that got maximum exposure to direct sun. A variety of food rich in folic acid and vitamin B12 is good for health. Vitiligo and white hair patches can cause depression. In that case, vitamin B12 comes to rescue. Folic acid, on the other hand, helps to maintain overall wellness and health.
2. Copper
In Ayurveda, copper is believed to promote activities of melanocytes, thereby boosting melanin and repigmentation. Ayurvedic practitioners, therefore, recommend keeping water in copper vessels overnight and then drink it in the morning. Copper-rich foods should be included in the diet.
3. Beta carotene
Foods like kale, carrots, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes are rich in the skin and eye health-promoting beta carotene, lycopene, zeaxanthin and lutein. These can also work on inflammation and inhibit melanoma like skin damage.
4. Zinc
Zinc deficiency is also associated with vitiligo. Zinc helps build a strong immune system, fights autoimmune condition, promotes absorption of nutrient, heals tissues and strengthens the bodyâ€™s response to cancer.
5. Vitamin C
Vitamin C rich foods like fresh and organic vegetables and fruits can help lower the rate of cellular damage by offering antioxidant benefits. These can also help in building up of collagen required for our skin, joints, bones etc. However, those suffering from vitiligo can avoid citrus fruits as it may negatively affect pigmentation in some.
6. Aloe vera
Presence of various antioxidants in aloe vera makes it beneficial for this condition. It has vitamins A, B12 and C, and folic acid and minerals like calcium, zinc, chromium, copper etc. that may help in repigmentation.
7. Vitamin D
Exposure to the sun is considered to be a good therapy against vitiligo and white hair patches. But many people are sensitive to sun rays and especially some conventional therapies increase their sensitivity. In such cases, vitamin D rich foods should be part of your daily diet which includes raw milk, cod liver oil, mushrooms, eggs, wild fish like salmon, sardines, tuna, and mackerel.
8. Gingko Biloba
It has been found to be effective in initiating repigmentation. In a study, the participants were given sixty milligrams of gingko biloba two times a day for three months. Significant improvement was seen in twenty percent of them whereas repigmentation occurred in thirty percent.
