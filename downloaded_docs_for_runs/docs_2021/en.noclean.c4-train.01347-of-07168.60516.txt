The Dark Side of Your Emotional Needs – Mind and Body
Posted on March 27, 2018 by ihbPT
“The human body experiences a powerful gravitational pull in the direction of hope. That is why the patient’s hopes are the physician’s secret weapon. They are the hidden ingredients in any prescription.” – Norman Cousins
Your body matters, and so does your mind, because they’re the same matter. Your emotions directly affect your body, and it goes the other way too. Mental and physical health cannot be disentangled.
Each and every one of us has a natural current running through us called the ultradian rhythm. Every 90 to 120 minutes we shift from left-brain dominance to right-brain. The shift takes about 20 minutes, and it usually makes us feel a little entranced or day-dreamy.
It’s during this shift that the immune system does its upkeep, the brain incorporates new learning, and the gut digests and absorbs nutrients. It’s little wonder that when we continue to swim against the tides of this natural rhythm we start to feel broken and emotional.
Sure, you can refuse to listen to your physical needs for a while, override them for a bit… but do it for long enough and you’ll come to feel depleted on every level.
Hypnotizing someone is often a case of just letting the sails catch the breeze of this warm and wonderful natural shift in physical and mental focus.
People increasingly treat themselves as machines. We work through lunch, sleep too little, eat junk on the run, skip the gym, and prop up our flagging bodies with ‘energy drinks’.
But neglecting proper nutrition, sleep, rest, and exercise long term leads to psychological problems and stress-induced illness, and not just on the individual level. In unhealthy populations, collective emotions run riot. And that can lead us down some dark paths.
With too little exposure to natural light, poor nutrition, and scant exercise we start to feel second-rate… we become weak and sick in mind and body.
And what is good for the body is good for the mind. Having a terrible diet (or eating foods your body is intolerant of) can make you feel depressed and anxious. Conversely, physical exercise, even a 30 minute walk is protective against anxiety and a wonderful mood enhancer, especially when done outdoors in nature.
It’s a cliché to talk about ‘self-medicating’. But people do. Whether through comfort eating, smoking, alcohol, or barbiturates, or cannabis, it’s a common way to ‘switch off’, forget about the day and absorb oneself in the moment.
But self-medication is always accompanied by self-delusion – convincing ourselves, consciously or unconsciously, that the ‘medication’ has few side effects, or that somehow we can cheat the future.
Cliché it may be, but ‘self-medication’ is a fine analogy. Indeed, it’s the side effects that are the problem. Side effects that can make it harder for people to meet their actual physical and emotional needs.
When we seek in the long term to provide ourselves with energy through coffee instead of rest, to distract ourselves from problems through the oblivion of drugs, or to resort to any form of self-harm rather than actually working to solve our problems, then the attempted ‘solution’ becomes the enemy – not the comforting or encouraging ‘friend’ it might masquerade as.
Listen and you will hear…
We all need to work at being attuned to our bodies. If we don’t, we can lose the capacity to interpret the signals from our bodies. We need to listen to our bodies – always. What is it you actually need?

Is Detoxing for You?
Posted on December 24, 2017 by ihbPT
Robyn Openshaw is a researcher and expert in human detoxification.
You’ve heard about cleansing or detoxing, and maybe you’ve wondered:
Is it scary?
Will I suffer?
Will I be hungry?
Don’t I have a liver and kidneys already “detoxing” for me?
Will my food addictions get the best of me?
Will I fail?
Robyn made this short video about WHO should detoxify, and WHY…..after over 20 years of studying with the most gifted and knowledgeable holistic clinicians all over the world–on 4 continents, in 19 clinics.
She learned that the vast majority of medical doctors have no idea how to optimize the detoxification pathways of the body.
And why you NEED to, just like you need to change the air filter and oil filter in your car.
(If you’d had a Model T in the 1930’s during the infamous Dust Bowl, could you have driven forever without changing the air filter? With 84,000 chemicals approved for use in our environment now….well, it’s the equivalent of the Dust Bowl!)
Eating processed food and animal products, and even conventional produce sprayed with herbicides and pesticides, adds to your Toxic Body Burden. (That is, the amount of toxicity that goes in, reduced by the amount that is filtered out, by your organs of elimination.)
Toxins in your beauty products and in your water and air are other sources of exposure.
We live in a strange new world full of synthetic chemicals harmful to human life, everywhere.
(The Environmental Working Group estimates the average woman is exposed to over 100 harmful chemicals every week, through personal care products alone!)
In your food, there are genetically modified ingredients, synthetic additives, preservatives, nitrites and nitrates in cured meats, neurotoxins like MSG and aspartame in hundreds of products. And so much more.
Municipal water contains endocrine disruptors like chlorine, fluoride, phthalates, and even residuals of prescription drugs. Bottled water contains leached plastics.
In Robyn’s Detox Video Masterclass she’s made available to us, Robyn tackles all these topics.
If you’ve ever wondered what you can do, to eliminate more toxicity from your body, check out her 4 really educational inspiring and educational videos in the masterclass on these topics:
Could Toxicity Be Why I’m Sick? The 7 Types of Toxins in Your Body and How to Eliminate Them
How to Change Your Weight Set Point Forever (Detoxing, Not Dieting)
8 Foods That Help You Detoxify (and 11 That Cause Toxicity)
Bonus: How a Physical Detox Can Resolve Emotional Issues
She’s offering you a spot in her FREE video class, on how to clean up and reboot your organs of elimination, to feel better than you have in 20 years.
VIDEO: Is Detoxing For You?
After 20 years of research and experimentation, Robyn has now supported over 10,000 people through a 26-day detox process.
She’s gathered data, including 500 detoxers’ inspiring stories, and she has some pretty interesting things to say about what happens, in the process!
(What’s “easy and fun.” What’s “hard.” She’s really honest about it.)
If you think detoxing is for weight loss, think again. Watch the short video to learn why some folks in the “ideal weight” category are shown to be at higher risk than those with lots of external body fat.
Detoxing is for anyone who lives where there’s car exhaust, processed food, chlorine and fluoride in the water, electronic devices in your energy field, or who experiences chronic stress. Robyn explains why.
It’s a strange, polluted world out there, and we have to get very smart, to eliminate higher-than-ever “toxic body burden.”
That’s where A (the input of toxic chemicals) minus B (the amount of chemical burden your elimination channels successfully excrete) = C (what’s left).
So, what do you do about the remainder? That overwhelm of toxicity, when kidneys, liver, lymphatic system, blood, and respiratory system can’t keep up?
An extremely well tested detoxification process radically reduces your disease risk.
Plus, following the program for 26 days robs your fat stores of the job they’re currently doing for you.
(Because your fat stores are hoarding toxic chemicals. Why? So they don’t get into critical organs and kill you. Your fat plays a very important role, especially around the middle of your body. And your body will keep hoarding fat, until you decrease that toxic body burden.)
I highly recommend this Video Masterclass, where Robyn explains that. She began researching detoxification when she was obese, very ill with 21 diseases, and her 1-year old was dying, in and out of hospitals, on constant bronchial drugs, steroids, and antibiotics. A “failure to thrive” baby below the 5th percentile, he clung to life and bounced in and out of emergency rooms.
What she discovered is in this Video Masterclass. Detoxing twice a year is how she became a competitive athlete, and ditched 70 pounds and all medications and disease states. She was dying, and on half a dozen drugs, diagnosed with 21 diseases, at 25. Now she’s 50 and free of all symptoms, diagnoses, and prescriptions.
She believes that aging isn’t so much about years, as much as toxic body burden overwhelming the immune system.
And I won’t be a spoiler, but there’s a really amazing story about what happened to her severely ill “Failure to Thrive” baby, in one of the masterclass videos as well.
Watch this short video to help you think through whether a period devoted to resting, rebuilding, and repairing your elimination organs and immune system is right for you.
If you’re intrigued by the idea of decreasing your own toxicity, take a deeper look, in the free video masterclass. And ask questions of Robyn after watching any of the videos. Enjoy!

Nutritional Supplements for Stress & Anxiety
Nutritional Supplements for Stress & Anxiety Related Issues
Can nutritional supplements help ease stress and anxiety levels? Latest research is suggesting that balanced quality nutritional intake can bring your body and mind back into balance and, if you take steps to resolve the source of your stress and anxiety through therapy, then the results can be impressive.
Alleviate stress with the powerful nutrition
Best stress treatment
The best way to treat stress over the long term is to identify the root causes of it, and see if your lifestyle can be changed to reduce it. Much of the stress you feel will be emotional stress, which can create emotional blockages within the body and often show up as excess weight or pain in the body, and sometimes both. Hypnotherapy is a quick and powerful way to eliminate emotional stress but you can also try meditation, yoga, controlled breathing, tai chi or exercise, like relaxing walks in nature, to help cope with stress.
The following are some nutritional supplements you can try for yourself but if you are taking any medications you should always check with your physician before taking nutritional supplements as they could conflict with your medication.
Co-Q10, 5-HTP, Quercetin, L-Tryptophan, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid), Skullcap Extract, Ashwagandha Extract, Bacopa Monnieri Extract, Valerian Root Extract, Passion Flower Extract, Hops Extract, Chamomile Extract, Melatonin, L-Theanine, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin D3, Vitamin E, Vitamin B-Complex: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin, folic acid, and the cobalamins (B12),
Probiotic: L. Helveticus (Lactobacillus helveticus), Glutamine, Chromium as Chromium AAC (Amino Acid Chelate), Phenylethylamine or PEA, Amylase, Wheat grass powder, Magnesium, Ginger Root Extract, Licorice Root, Eleuthero root extract, Citrus Aurantium Extract (Bitter Orange), Aspartic Acid, L-Serine, White Tea Extract, Satiereal™ Saffron Extract (crocus), Ginkgo leaf extract, St. John’s Wort, Phosphatidylserine, Lemon Balm, Kava, Guarana, Garcinia Cambogia, Fish Oil.
Please Note: The following ingredients research is not company supplied but based upon my own independent Google research, you are welcome to do your own research…
Co-Q10
A recent study in Cairo, Egypt has uncovered an unusual property of Co-Q10 that is rather surprising: It eliminates depression and anxiety.
After stressing out the mice with forced swimming and chronic restraint stress (CRS), something cruel kids might do, anxiety and depression were artificially induced in the mice, a standard lab gimmick. Then they were fed large amounts of Co-Q10 for three weeks.
It became apparent that most of the observed anxiety and depression abated during the Co-Q10 feeding. The biological markers also showed increased antioxidant activity in the hippocampus, reversing oxidative cellular and DNA damage.
-Source: http://www.naturalnews.com/039051_chronic_depression_Co-Q10_heart_health.html
A small study found that out of 31 patients who suffer from migraines, 19 of them reported the number of days they had migraines cut in half. Another small study of 42 migraine sufferers compared Coenzyme Q10 to an inactive placebo. In that study, of CoQ10 and migraine, the supplement was three times more likely than placebo to reduce the number of migraines.
A larger study of 1,550 patients ages 3 to 22 with migraine measured their Coenzyme Q10 levels. Of those migraine sufferers, 33 percent had low levels of CoQ10. Those with low levels received Coenzyme Q10 supplements and had fewer migraines.
-Source: https://migraine.com/migraine-treatment/natural-remedies/coenzyme-q10/
5-HTP
“5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) is a naturally occurring substance derived from the seed pods of Griffonia simplicifolia, a West African medicinal plant. In humans, 5-HTP is the immediate nutrient precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). This means that 5-HTP converts directly into serotonin in the brain (see Figure 1). Serotonin has many profoundly important functions, including a role in sleep, appetite, memory, learning, temperature regulation, mood, sexual behavior, cardiovascular function, muscle contraction, and endocrine regulation.” –Source: http://www.life-enhancement.com/magazine/article/178-5-htp-enhance-your-mood-your-sleep-and-a-lot-more
“5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), an antioxidant and a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, has been shown in studies to prevent both migraines and tension-type headaches. Taking 5-HTP as a supplement is believed to help reduce headache frequency and severity by modulating serotonin and increasing endorphin levels. “
“In one clinical trial, 124 patients with chronic migraines received either 5-HTP or methysergide (a drug used to prevent migraines) for 6 months.[5] Significant improvement in frequency and number of severe attacks occurred for 71% of those in the 5-HTP group, which was the same effect achieved with the prescription medication. “
“5-HTP has also been used successfully in the prevention of chronic tension-type headaches.[6] Since 5-HTP is also beneficial for insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms, it is especially appropriate for individuals who have headaches accompanied by sleep or mood disorders.” -Source: https://universityhealthnews.com/daily/pain/3-therapies-for-natural-migraine-relief-and-other-headache-remedies/
The amino acid 5-hydroxytryptophan, or 5-HTP, is another natural option for upping serotonin levels. As a serotonin precursor, 5-HTP may help those for whom SSRIs like Prozac don’t seem to work, says Katie Baker, ND, owner of Stone Turtle Health, a naturopathic family medicine practice in Seattle. “SSRIs block the uptake of serotonin so it sticks around longer,” she says. But that won’t do much good if not much serotonin is around to begin with. In contrast, 5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the body. “With 5-HTP, you are not plugging up the drain, so to speak; you are just putting more into the sink,” says Baker. A six-week study of 63 people found that those who took 300 mg daily of 5-HTP had the same depression relief as those who took prescription antidepressants-but with fewer side effects.

Quercetin
Have you ever wondered what makes a “superfood” super? Or what key superfoods like red wine, green tea, kale and blueberries all have in common? The answer is quercetin, a natural compound tied to what all of us seek: better longevity, heart health, endurance, immune system and more.
Research shows that anti-inflammatory foods containing quercetin can help manage a number of inflammatory health problems, including heart disease and blood vessel problems, allergies, infections, chronic fatigue, and symptoms related to autoimmune disorders like arthritis. -Source: https://draxe.com/quercetin/
“Quercetin has been found to powerfully stabilize mast cells, helping prevent stress-induced anxiety and allergic reactions. A chain of recent discoveries helps place the significance of these discoveries in context, with far ranging implications for human health, and improved nerve tolerance for managing stress.”
“Another new study shows that stress turns up the volume on mast cells3, priming them to release inflammatory chemicals that are typically involved with allergies, asthma, skin conditions, and digestive problems. Furthermore, the communication coming from mast cells feeds back to nerves, and modulates behaviour through a sense of anxiety.” –Source: https://www.wellnessresources.com/news/quercetin-skin-issues-and-stress
L-Tryptophan for Anxiety and Stress Relief
One of the most useful benefits Tryptophan for anxiety provides is mood regulation, through the production of the neurotransmitter Serotonin. Supplementing with L-Tryptophan and its by-product 5-HTP may improve mood and relieve stress.
Once consumed, L-Tryptophan is converted into 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) and other metabolites in the liver. 5-HTP, which is also available as a mood supplement, travels through the blood stream to the brain. Once there, it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier.
In the brain, 5-HTP is converted into Serotonin, the neurotransmitter most commonly associated with the regulation of mood.
In addition to the role it plays in regulating mood, Serotonin is also converted into the hormone Melatonin. Melatonin is a sleep-regulating neurotransmitter that controls the sleep/wake cycle (circadian rhythm).
During the day, the brain produces more Serotonin, and Melatonin production is very low. When light levels drop at dusk, Serotonin is converted more readily into Melatonin, and levels rise in the body.
Melatonin helps you stay asleep throughout the night and wake feeling rested. This may help to control anxious thoughts during the day.

Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)
What is it? Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) is a chemical made in the brain and often taken as a supplement to relieve anxiety, improve mood, reduce PMS symptoms, and treat symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Does it work? There’s limited evidence to suggest that orally-administered GABA supplements can help promote relaxation and immunity and reduce anxiety during times of stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
GABA is a highly important element in the brain. Essentially, it plays a key role in regulating the depressive neuroactivity in the human brain. In other words, it’s responsible for helping your mind switch from “work mode” to “relaxation mode”. It also plays a role in sedative changes in the brain, which are key to falling asleep at night.
How GABA helps reduce stress: GABA, in supplement form, is used for its relaxation-inducing effects, and to help relieve stress. It has also been shown to help improve mood, which can also lead to less stress in the future. Essentially, it works by blocking brain signals that incite anxiety and stressful feelings, allowing the brain to remain calm and inducing relaxation.

Skullcap Extract
Skullcap herb is an amazing plant for stress, tension, anxiety, nervousness and panic attacks. If I were pressed to simply list one application for skullcap it would be its ability to relieve stress and anxiety. It works well in acute situations and can be taken over time to decrease chronic stress (along with lifestyle modifications of course).
It works well for acute and sudden onset anxiety or panic attacks. For people susceptible to sudden onset anxiety or panic attacks, fresh skullcap tincture can be kept on them at all times.
Experienced herbal medic, Sam Coffman, shares his reliance on skullcap herb for shock-related anxiety.
Skullcap (Scutellaria spp.) and Passionflower are two that have never failed me as a formula to help someone cope quickly with shock-related anxiety. – Sam Coffman, Plant Healer Magazine 11
Not just for acute cases, skullcap can be taken over time as a nerve tonic to support nervous system health in people who have been through prolonged periods of stress and feel like their nerves are constantly on edge.
-Source: http://www.herbalremediesadvice.org/skullcap-herb.html
Ashwaghanda
I hold Ashwaghanda very high on my personal list of most effective herbs against anxiety. Ashwaghanda’s main use is to help the adrenals adjust to stress in our daily lives. It basically produces stress hormones when you need them, and stops producing them when you don’t need them, how cool is that! But the benefits of Ashwaghanda don’t end there, this ‘magic herb’ as I like to call it improves your immune function and greatly improves sleep.
-Source: https://anxietyexit.com/best-anxiety-supplements/
Promotes Graceful Aging
Stress, both metabolic and emotional, dramatically affects aging. Cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, contributes to muscle loss and weakness, wrinkles, and cognitive impairment. Research has found that Ashwagandha improves resistance to stress, possibly decreasing cortisol production. [1] One study of 64 individuals observed a reduction in stress and a significant decrease in cortisol levels in individuals taking Ashwagandha compared with placebo.
Menopausal Support
Ashwagandha acts on the endocrine system by encouraging hormone balance. A study involving 51 menopausal women supplementing with Ashwagandha noted a significant reduction in symptoms such as hot flashes, anxiety, and mood. [2]
Mood Booster
Ashwagandha is a known mood-boosting herb, and research suggests that the therapeutic plant may play a potential role in fighting mood imbalance. [6] Women battling mood swings may benefit from supplementing with Ashwagandha.
Sexual Potency
The Kama Sutra, one of the oldest surviving texts on human sexuality, mentions Ashwagandha in its literature as a potent sexual stimulant for both men and women. Research indicates that the herb supports sexual health and vitality by increasing blood flow and reducing bodily tension. Women taking Ashwagandha typically experience an increase in sexual desire and satisfaction.
Memory Support
Recent research has shown that Ashwagandha reduces memory impairment in animal models. The herb may also protect the brain from the oxidative stress that leads to neurodegeneration. Relaxation, a benefit derived from the herb’s stress-fighting effects, also improves long-term visual memory. [3] [4]
Revitalization
Another benefit many women report after taking this herb is in regards to energy levels. This anecdotal evidence is supported by scientific investigation; a recent study reported Ashwagandha’s benefits for improving energy while reducing stress-related disorders. [5]
Fertility
Stress, illness, hormone imbalance, and nutrient deficiencies — all of these issues threaten female reproductive health and make it difficult for a woman to conceive. Research shows that Ashwagandha supports thyroid function, an organ responsible for regulating hormones. [7] Also, by decreasing stress, Ashwagandha may encourage a situation that is optimal for fertility. [8] More research is needed to clarify whether or not Ashwagandha is effective for helping infertile females struggling to conceive.

Bacopa monnieri
Bacopa monnieri is an herbal nootropic, a plant-based supplement that boosts brain power and reduces anxiety naturally. Bacopa monnieri is one of the oldest and most well-respected nootropic supplements. A traditional Ayurvedic medicine, sometimes referred to as Brahmi, has centuries of history as a potent cognitive enhancer, stress reliever, and brain protectant.
Bacopa monnieri is used to improve memory formation and speed of recall, make learning faster and easier, enhance clarity of thought, and augment overall brain function. It is also believed to act as a brain protectant, and studies show that it has potential as a treatment for dementia.
Bacopa has also been shown to have significant anxiolytic or anti-anxiety effects, producing a feeling of calmness and tranquility and reducing feelings of stress. Users report that it is an excellent general relaxant and can improve the quality of sleep, so they wake feeling rested and refreshed.
-Source: https://www.braintropic.com/nootropics/bacopa-monnieri/
Valerian Root
What is it? Valerian is an herb commonly used to treat insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Although it’s considered safe for most adults, the effects of long-term use are unknown. Short-term side effects include headaches and sluggishness in the morning, especially if taken at higher doses.
Does it work? Early research indicates it could be helpful in reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of pressure when under stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
Some herbal supplements reduce anxiety without making you sleepy (such as L-theanine), while others are sedatives. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is squarely in the second category. It is a sleep aid, for insomnia. It contains sedative compounds; the German government has approved it as a treatment for sleep problems.
Valerian smells kind of nasty, so most people take it as a capsule or tincture, rather than a tea. If you want to try it, take it in the evening—not before you go to work! Valerian is often combined with other sedative herbs such as hops, chamomile, and lemon balm.
-Source: http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20669377,00.html#valerian-2
Valerian is a very helpful form of herbal stress relief if you suffer from tension and anxiety, or have a tendency to get easily over-excited and/or hysterical. It is very calming but is unlikely to make you sleepy (although I wouldn’t suggest taking large quantities and then driving) and you can use it without any worries about getting addicted to it. If you have trouble sleeping, try taking valerian an hour or so before you go to bed. If your body gets so tense that you experience pain, taking valerian can help to relieve the discomfort. –Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Passionflower
Studies have shown that passionflower lowers anxiety in mice, but only one study has been carried out in humans, according to Lenz. That randomized, placebo-controlled study was done in 2001 in patients with general anxiety disorder, and found that 45 drops of liquid passionflower daily was as effective in treating the disorder as the drug oxazepam. Still, more research on its safety and effectiveness is needed, Lenz wrote in his study.
-Source: https://www.livescience.com/16975-herbal-supplements-stress-reduction.html
Passion flower is extremely useful if you suffer from long term insomnia. It can be taken over a long period of time. It helps you get to sleep, sleep well and wake up without any of the heavy feeling of some sleeping tablets. It has a generally tranquillizing effect. It can help to relieve restlessness, irritability, nervous stress and anxiety and can also be used where great tension is causing spasms in the body as it is also an antispasmodic. -Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Hops Extract
Hops work as a central nervous system relaxant. This makes them a very helpful form of herbal stress relief if you suffer from insomnia and the stress states caused by not getting enough sleep. Hops help to relieve tension and anxiety and are helpful in reducing restlessness. Hops have a strong muscle relaxing effect so if being stressed gives you headaches, indigestion, stomach pains, palpitations or a nervous cough, then taking hops, especially in the form of a tincture, could prove very helpful for you.
-Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Chamomile Extract
Chamomile is a mild relaxant and sedative. A cup of chamomile tea before bed can help you to fall asleep easily and sleep well. Like lemon balm, it also has anti-spasmodic properties. This is a wonderful tea for children. It can be slightly bitter so sweeten it with a little honey if you like. -Source: http://www.family-stress-relief-guide.com/herbal-stress-relief.html
Recent clinical and laboratory research has determined that chamomile is not only relaxing, but it can significantly decrease anxiety and even fight depression.
The most recent study, from the UK’s University of Nottingham Medical School, found that chamomile significantly relaxed blood vessels and smooth muscle fibers. This effect was indicated specifically with the application of three of chamomile’s central constituents, apigenin, luteolin and bisabolol – all hydroxylates.
The fact that chamomile is an anti-anxiety and anti-depression herb was cemented by a clinical study at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. This study was done in 2009, but its data and findings were re-investigated and confirmed last year.
The researchers enlisted 19 people diagnosed with anxiety with depression, along with 16 people who were diagnosed as having a history of anxiety and depression. These groups were studied along with a control group of 22 people who had no anxiety or depression – past or present.
The study was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. The researchers gave the subjects either 220 milligrams of chamomile extract (standardized to 1.2% apigenin) or a placebo study, both in capsules.
The researchers found that 57% of the group using the chamomile extract had significantly reduced (greater than 50%) anxiety scores using the HAM-A system.

Melatonin
What is it? A hormone produced by the brain’s pineal gland, melatonin helps control sleep cycles. Because sleep and mood are closely connected, supplementing with melatonin can alleviate stress. It’s considered safe, but can cause side effects like headaches, short-term feelings of depression, dizziness, and irritability.
Does it work? Early research indicates it could be helpful in reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of pressure when under stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
Generally, people use Melatonin supplements to help with sleep disorders, such as primary insomnia. It also used for a variety of health conditions that include bipolar disorder, dementia, depression, endometriosis and anxiety.
Melatonin is a hormone made by the brain to regulate sleep cycles, but it can also play a role in mood and anxiety. It helps to control the level of stimulation and activity experienced by the body, and demonstrates anxiolytic effects.
If you have anxiety, melatonin may help make it easier to fall asleep at night, since insomnia is a common side effect of this mood disorder. It can also improve depression symptoms in patients with both anxiety and depression.
-Source: https://nootriment.com/melatonin-for-anxiety/
Theanine (L. Theanine) (Found in Green Tea)
There’s been a resurgence of interest in the anxiety-relieving powers of L-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea.1
Discoveries over the past two years have uncovered exciting additional properties of this nutrient best known for inducing calming, tranquilizing effects while simultaneously improving alertness.
L-theanine relieves anxiety in large part because it bears a close resemblance to the brain-signaling chemical glutamate. L-theanine produces the opposite effect in the brain.
While glutamate is the brain’s most important excitatory neurotransmitter, L-theanine binds to the same brain cell receptors and blocks them to glutamate’s effects. This action produces inhibitory effects.1,2 That inhibition to brain overactivity has a calming, relaxing effect in which anxiety fades.3
In addition to blocking excitatory stimuli at glutamate receptors in the brain, L-theanine also stimulates production of the inhibitory, relaxing neurotransmitter GABA, adding to its calming, anti-anxiety effects.2
Unlike prescription anti-anxiety drugs, however, some of which mimic GABA’s effects, L-theanine produces its anti-anxiety effects without producing sleepiness or impairing motor behavior.4 In fact, L-theanine has been shown in human studies to moderately improve alertness and attention while exerting its anxiety-reducing effects.5
Of particular interest are studies showing that L-theanine supplementation prevents the abrupt rise in blood pressure that some people experience under stress.1 The reason this is so critical is that many people have normal blood pressure readings at rest that spike up to dangerously high levels when subjected to stressful situations.
There’s a link between anxiety, reaction to stress, and the brain’s most fundamental function, maintaining cognition. Studies over the past two years suggest a potential role for L-theanine in supporting cognitive function and preventing its loss.
-Source: http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2016/3/brain-benefits-of-l-theanine/page-01
How L-theanine helps reduce stress: Primarily, L-theanine helps to relax the body and mind, without having sedative effects. So, it’s a great way to help manage stress, and you can use it during the day because it won’t cause drowsiness. Theanine supplements may also help to reduce the perception of stress and help you stay in a more positive mindset. Theanine has also been shown to work synergistically with other supplements, including caffeine. Research has shown a combination of 200mg of theanine with 200mg of caffeine promotes significant improvements in cognition and attention.
Many people consider L-theanine a way to “take the edge off”, so to speak. Particularly when used in combination with stimulants, like caffeine, the relaxing-but-not-sedative effects of L-theanine really come into play. Also, while most people drink caffeine on a daily basis, few people know that coffee and caffeinated beverages can actually worsen anxiety and stress symptoms. But when combined with L-theanine, you shouldn’t experience any negative effect from the caffeine, and you can still enjoy that helpful pick-me-up from a cup of coffee, combined with the calming effects of the amino acid supplement.

Vitamin B-12
Vitamin B12 benefits your mood, energy level, memory, heart, skin, hair, digestion and more. Vitamin B12 is also an essential vitamin for addressing adrenal fatigue, multiple metabolic functions — including enzyme production, DNA synthesis and hormonal balance — and maintaining healthy nervous and cardiovascular systems.
Because of its wide-reaching roles within the body, a vitamin B12 deficiency can show up in many different negative symptoms, many of which are very noticeable, such as potential chronic fatigue, mood disorders like depression, and chronic stress or feeling run down. Vitamin B12, sometimes also called cyanocobalamin, also helps with digestion and heart health.
Vitamin B12 benefits the central nervous system in many important ways: It helps maintain the health of nerve cells — including those needed for neurotransmitter signalling — and helps form the protective covering of nerves, called the cell’s myelin sheath. This means that when vitamin B12 levels are low, almost every cognitive function can suffer.

Vitamin D3
There is evidence that stress, fatigue, and depression are connected to low serum levels of vitamin D, in addition to known immunity, illness and disease issues.
Dr. Lipman is the founder of the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in NYC. He lists fatigue, restless sleep and poor concentration among other symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Over 80% of his clients are vitamin D deficient, which correlates with the general population epidemic. [1]
Dr. Anna Dorothea Hoeck, MD, from Cologne, Germany, has treated fatigue with vitamin D therapy, using the 25(OH)D3 test first, then boosting those readings accordingly.
She has discovered with actual clinical treatments that those with lower levels of chronic fatigue recovered quickly, while more severe cases required adding minerals with the vitamin, especially calcium and magnesium.
http://www.naturalnews.com/041772_vitamin_D_levels_stress_fatigue.html
Clinical Trials have proved Vitamin D3 to be superior to Vitamin D2
A 2011 Cochrane Database study highlighted the significant differences between the two and examined mortality rates for people who supplemented their diets with Vitamin D2, versus those who did so with Vitamin D3. The analysis of 50 randomised controlled trials, which included almost 100,000 participants, showed a 6% relative risk reduction among those who used D3, and a 2% relative risk increase among those who used D2.
Your body deals with the different types very differently
According to recent research, Vitamin D3 is approximately 85% better in raising and maintaining Vitamin D concentrations in the body and produces 200-300% greater storage of Vitamin D than Vitamin D2.
With either form your body must convert it into a more active form, and Vitamin D3 is converted 500 percent faster than Vitamin D2.
Vitamin D2 has a shorter shelf life and it binds poorly with proteins in your blood which further hinders its effectiveness.

Vitamin E
Vitamin E is important for strong immunity and healthy skin and eyes. In recent years, vitamin E supplements have become popular as antioxidants. These are substances that protect cells from damage.
Balances Hormones
Vitamin E can play a crucial role in balancing your endocrine and nervous systems, naturally working to balance hormones naturally. (5) Symptoms of a hormonal imbalance may include PMS, weight gain, allergies, urinary tract infections, changes in the skin, anxiety and fatigue.
Helps PMS Symptoms
Taking a vitamin E supplement two to three days before and two to three days after a menstrual period can reduce the cramping, anxiety and cravings and other PMS symptoms. Vitamin E can decrease pain severity and duration, and it can reduce menstrual blood loss. It does this by balancing your hormones naturally, and it helps keep your menstrual cycle regulated.
Important during Pregnancy for Growth and Development
Vitamin E is critical during pregnancy and for proper development in infants and children because it protects critical fatty acids and helps control inflammation.
Other vitamin E benefits include its role as an important fat-soluble vitamin that’s required for the proper function of many organs, enzymatic activities and neurological processes.

Vitamin B-Complex
What is it? The vitamin B-complex refers to all of the known essential water-soluble vitamins except for vitamin C: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin, folic acid, and the cobalamins (B12). B vitamins are important for cell metabolism. Most people who eat a balanced diet should have adequate B vitamins, but a vegan diet or an immune disorder such as lupus can lead to B12 deficiencies.
Does it work? Some research indicates B-complex vitamins are linked to improved mood.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
How B vitamin complex helps to reduce stress: In several clinical trials, B vitamin complex supplements have shown great potential in reducing stress levels. Taking a b-vitamin daily helped patients to improve mood by improving the body’s natural production of serotonin and other neurotransmitters. It also helped to reduce levels of homocysteine, a toxic amino acid that can lead to many health issues down the road. B vitamins also play a key role in energy production, and as you likely know, stress is much easier to counter when you’re feeling energized.

Probiotic: L. Helveticus (Lactobacillus helveticus
Supplementation with the probiotic combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 is an evidence-based, biologically plausible approach to addressing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Studies show favorable biochemical and behavioral changes in animals treated with the probiotic, and sharp and significant decreases in symptoms of depression and anxiety in human trials.
For anyone experiencing anxiety and/or depression, regular supplementation with this probiotic combination seems a natural and worthwhile practice. It is conceivable that such supplementation could reduce reliance on prescription medications and deliver freedom from the burdens of these common mental illnesses.

Glutamine
Glutamine supplements may have a beneficial effect on depression and patients suffering from depression may have lower levels of glutamine in their brains. If you experience high levels of stress, your body may need a higher amount of glutamine, as it is easily depleted by high levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
Depression Facts
Clinical depression occurs in several forms, including major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, dysthymia and postpartum depression. According to NYU Langone Medical Center, depressive symptoms vary from person to person — some people experience just a few symptoms while others may experience a combination of many symptoms.
Some of the common symptoms of depression include feelings of low self-worth, irritability, sadness, a lowered mood, sleep problems, appetite changes, a decreased sex drive, fatigue, a lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed and, in some people, suicidal thoughts or gestures. Researchers believe a number of factors contribute to depressive disorders, including genetics, stressful life events, drug and alcohol addiction, lack of social support, medical illnesses and changes in brain chemistry.
Additionally, nutritional deficiencies can also cause depression. Although research on the benefits of glutamine for depression is limited, some people believe that it may help reduce depressive symptoms.
Clinical Evidence
A study published in the February 2007 issue of the “Archives of General Psychiatry,” a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Medical Association, found that depressed study participants had lowered levels of glutamine in their prefrontal brain tissue. However, most of the evidence confirming the benefits of glutamine supplementation on depression is anecdotal.
A systematic review published in 2002 in the “Medical Journal of Australia” states that only an uncontrolled experiment has been performed to verify the benefits of glutamine supplements on depression.
The experiment referred to is a study published in the July-August 1976 issue of the Belgian medical journal, “Acta Psychiatrica Belgica.” This study showed that l-glutamine supplementation showed antidepressant properties on adult study participants suffering from depression. However, more clinical research is needed to fully evaluate the potential benefit of glutamine supplementation on depression.
Considerations
Glutamine supplements are sold online and in health food stores in powder and capsule form. However, you should not use glutamine as a cure for depression or as a substitute for conventional medical care. -Source: http://www.livestrong.com/article/477074-glutamine-depression/
Chromium as Chromium AAC (Amino Acid Chelate)
Chelated chromium is a nutritional supplement that allows cells to receive and absorb blood sugar for energy, according to Source Naturals. Chelation is the process of bonding with amino acids. This bond allows the mineral content to stay intact, and it provides maximum assimilation into the body.
Chromium is also used for depression, Turner’s syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), lowering “bad” cholesterol, raising “good” cholesterol in people taking heart medications called beta blockers, metabolic syndrome, heart attack, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and binge eating disorder.

Phenylethylamine or PEA
PEA supplements are great for helping with the symptoms of anxiety. Since PEA is so good at increasing natural levels of dopamine, which is one of the ‘feel-good’ hormones, it is great at combatting negative feelings of anxiety.[7]
Low levels of dopamine are known to cause anxiety and depression, along with a number of other mental illnesses. Taking phenylethylamine boosts your dopamine levels.[8] Increased dopamine levels make you feel happier, calmer and more sensual.
Another great benefit is phenylethylamine for studying. By increasing catecholamines and dopamine, phenylethylamine give a clear focus and energy boost, associated with increases in cognitive power and learning capabilities.

Phenylethylamine Benefits:
May significantly improve mood and produce overall feeling of well-being
Helpful for reducing high levels of stress and anxiety
Known to assist with those experiencing symptoms of depression
A common element used in treating anxiety and depression
Produces higher energy levels
Minimize fatigue that can often be associated with depression anxiety symptoms
Ability to increase Acetylcholine levels. Increased levels of this neurotransmitter will commonly result in faster memory recall and retention.
Many have reported improved attention span and overall learning aptitude.
Enhanced ability in focus and concentration

Amylase
Stress is by far one of the worst things in the world for your health, particularly chronic stress. Research is showing that amylase can be a very helpful and accurate marker of stress levels.
One study looked at the whether or not the salivary enzyme alpha-amylase could indicate stress-reactive bodily changes. Researchers repeatedly measured salivary alpha-amylase and salivary cortisol as well as plasma catecholamines and cardiovascular activity before, during and after 30 young men underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Results indicated that salivary alpha-amylase is sensitive to psychosocial stress and may be a very helpful additional parameter for the measurement of stress in humans. (9)

Wheat grass powder
Wheatgrass powder is made by freeze-drying, oven-drying or air-drying fresh wheatgrass. Adding wheatgrass to your diet is an effective way to get your quota of five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day, according to Illinois State University.
Restores pH Balance
Wheatgrass is an alkaline food supplement and it balances the body’s pH levels. Hence, it is beneficial for reducing the acidity in the blood and restoring its alkalinity (9).
Reduces Fatigue
Tiredness often symbolizes sleep deprivation and a weak immune system, which can be effectively treated with the help of wheatgrass. This amazing ingredient contains chlorophyll, which, apart from boosting our immune system, also assists in cell regeneration. This, in turn, helps heal our body and reduces fatigue. Additionally, chlorophyll helps boost our adrenal system, which is essential for the prevention of chronic fatigue.
Helps Improve Mood
Wheatgrass also helps uplift your mood in a number of ways; it is rich in vitamin K and magnesium. It boosts the adrenal system and helps your body deal with stress. Additionally, wheatgrass contains a good quantity of iron, the deficiency of which can cause fatigue that eventually worsens your mood. It also helps fight depression.
Increases Libido: Consuming wheatgrass powder regularly helps in enhancing the reproductive health of both men and women. It also increases vigor and helps in conception (21).
Is Good For The Liver
With its detoxifying properties, wheatgrass can revitalize your liver. In a study conducted in 2014, it has also been shown that having wheatgrass regularly can protect the liver from the harmful effects of alcohol. -Source: http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-wheatgrass-powder-for-skin-hair-and-health/
Magnesium
What is it? Magnesium is a mineral essential for nerve and muscle function. Although most people who eat a balanced diet get enough magnesium, an analysis of data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that a majority of Americans consume less than they should.
The supplement is considered safe, but side effects can include stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Rarely, large doses can cause irregular heartbeat and low blood pressure.
Does it work? Early research indicates it could be helpful in reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of pressure when under stress.
-Source: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/all-stress/stress-supplements/
Although it is found in several dietary sources, as well as included in most multivitamins, magnesium deficiency is extremely common. An estimated 57% of Americans do not get adequate magnesium in their diets, and that number is even higher in many other countries. A deficiency in magnesium can cause all sorts of health problems, and can worsen stress and anxiety. The good news is that it’s easy to fix magnesium deficiency by changing your diet or adding a supplement.

Ginger Root Extract
Ginger Increases Brain Levels of Important Neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals used by brain cells to communicate with each other. They control your ability to focus, concentrate, and remember, and regulate mood, cravings, addictions, sleep, and more.
It’s estimated that 86% of Americans have suboptimal levels of neurotransmitters. (13) Ginger increases levels of these important brain chemicals, including dopamine and serotonin. (14) Dopamine is considered the “motivation molecule” that helps you get focused and be productive. It’s also in charge of your pleasure-reward system. Serotonin is your “happiness molecule” that is critical for keeping up a positive mood.
Ginger Root Reduces Adrenal Fatigue
Overwhelming tiredness is not the only symptom of adrenal fatigue. Other symptoms include brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and an inability to handle stress. (29)
Dr. Michael Lam is an expert on adrenal fatigue syndrome and the author of Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome – Reclaim Your Energy and Vitality with Clinically Proven Natural Programs.
He recommends ginger root along with ginkgo and ginseng as part of his natural adrenal fatigue protocol. (30) These adaptogenic herbs strengthen the adrenals, increase resilience to stress, and modulate levels of the stress hormone cortisol. -Source: https://bebrainfit.com/ginger-root-benefits/
Licorice Root
There is research that shows that the Glycyrrhizic acid that is in licorice root can help with nervousness and depression by encouraging the function of the adrenal glands. Our adrenal glands control stress hormones including cortisol. When one’s stress hormone levels are low it can often be the cause of persistent fatigue, melancholy, anxiety, and having less resistance to infections and allergens. Licorice root also happens to also have the Asparagine amino acid that is needed to preserve equilibrium in the body’s nervous system.

Eleuthero root extract
Some of the most important health benefits of eleuthero include its ability to help relieve stress, increase cognitive function, boost the immune system, reduce fatigue, lower inflammation, protect heart health, prevent degenerative diseases, boost respiratory health, and increase energy levels.
Reduce Fatigue
One of the major claims to fame for eleuthero is its ability to boost energy levels. This is accomplished by its impact on the nervous system, boosting the metabolism, increasing circulation, and reducing cloudiness and fatigue. For people who regularly need naps during the day, feel the mid-day exhaustion following a large meal, or find themselves tired without a good explanation, regular supplementation with eleuthero can get you back to normal.
Stress Relief
Eleuthero is considered an adaptogen, one of those rare herbs that can actually help your body adapt and change to better handle various stimuli or conditions. For example, eleuthero has been shown to improve user response to stress, namely in the way that their body responds when anxious or upset. Eleuthero’s powerful components actually teach the body to handle bio-chemical situations in the best way possible.
A Final Word of Warning
There is some controversy about the various applications of eleuthero, and it’s important to understand the risks. If you suffer from certain mental conditions (mania or insomnia) or hormone-related disorders, it can be dangerous to take eleuthero. Also, in the case of heart conditions, diabetes, or cancer, eleuthero use can be beneficial, but only under the strict guidance of your medical provider. This is a very powerful herb and can have complex interactions with other drugs, so caution and consultation is highly recommended.

Citrus Aurantium Extract (Bitter Orange)
Background and objectives
Reducing anxiety is very important before operation. Preoperative visit and use of premedication are popular methods to achieve this goal, but the role of anxiolytic premedication remains unclear and postoperative side-effects may result from routine premedication.
Citrus aurantium is used as an alternative medicine in some countries to treat anxiety, and recently the anxiolytic role of this medicinal plant was established in an animal model study. The aim of this study was to assess the anxiolytic effect of Citrus aurantium blossom on preoperative anxiety.
Methods
We studied 60 ASA I patients undergoing minor operation. In a randomized double-blind design, two groups of 30 patients received one of the following oral premedication two hours before induction of anesthesia: 1) Citrus aurantium blossom distillate 1 mL.kg-1 (C-group); 2) Saline solution 1 mL.kg-1 as placebo (P-group). Anxiety was measured before and after premedication using the Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI-state) and the Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale (APAIS) before operation.
Results
After premedication, both the STAI-state and the APAIS scales were decreased in C-group (p < 0.05); while exhibiting no significant changes in P-group.
Conclusions
Citrus aurantium blossom may be effective in terms of reduction in preoperative anxiety before minor operation.

Aspartic Acid (Women’s Formula Only)
Aspartic acid, also known as L-aspartate, is thought to help promote a robust metabolism, and is sometimes used to treat fatigue and depression. Aspartic acid plays an important role in the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle, during which other amino acids and biochemicals, such as asparagine, arginine, lysine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine, are synthesized.
Aspartic acid gets its reputation as a treatment for chronic fatigue from the crucial role it plays in generating cellular energy. Aspartic acid moves the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules from the main body of the cell to its mitochondria, where it is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fuel that powers all cellular activity.
In short, the more NADH a cell has, the more chemical fuel it produces, and the more energy you have to get through your day. (Some studies have shown that aspartic acid actually increases both stamina and endurance levels in athletes.) In addition, this amino acid helps transport minerals needed to form healthy RNA and DNA to the cells, and strengthens the immune system by promoting increased production of immunoglobulins and antibodies (immune system proteins).
Aspartic acid keeps your mind sharp by increasing concentrations of NADH in the brain, which is thought to boost the production of neurotransmitters and chemicals needed for normal mental functioning. It also removes excess toxins from the cells, particularly ammonia, which is very damaging to the brain and nervous system as well as the liver.
-Source: http://www.vitaminstuff.com/amino-acid-aspartic-acid.html
Aspartic acid is used as a testosterone booster aging and infertile men. Men taking D-aspartic acid during the 90-day study dramatically improved sperm count and motility. As a result, they became more fertile and pregnancies increased among their partners. [7]
After taking D-aspartic acid for 12 days, participants increased lutheinizing hormone and testosterone levels by 33% and 42%, respectively.[8] These are just a few benefits of high testosterone levels:
Greater muscle growth and strength
Fat loss
Better sleep quality
High libido
Positive mood
More Energy
Aspartic Acid is also used by athletes as a temporary booster. Elevated testosterone levels only last a week to a week and a half in healthy men, with testosterone returning to normal afterward.
During the 1950s and 1960s, European researchers discovered a simple and inexpensive way to treat physical and mental fatigue — including the kind caused by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).aspartic acidThey found that aspartic acid supplements could seriously boost stamina and alertness and benefit health in many ways.
It’s no wonder that scientists believe aspartic acid can cure CFS. In fact, CFS may result from a deficiency of aspartic acid, which lowers cellular energy — and subsequently decreases your stamina.
Aspartic acid is responsible for the production of cellular fuel. The more of it your body has, the more energy you have throughout your day.
A study published in The Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences in September of 2006 documented that additional energy was created when rats were dosed with aspartic acid. For the study, 2 groups of rats swam until metabolic exhaustion set in. Researchers noted that the exhaustion point for the group given aspartic acid arrived after a significantly longer swim time.
The results of the study indicate that aspartic acid will typically increase physical endurance. Recent studies conducted with human athletes support these conclusions.
The athletes who took mineral salt preparations of aspartic acid experienced greater aerobic competency. It also appeared that the mineral salts increased endurance and stamina levels overall.
Other studies showed that 75% to 94% of patients suffering fatigue due to a multitude of different causes experienced notable improvement when treated with aspartic acid.
In fact, in one study of 80 patients who had struggled with post-surgical fatigue for more than one year, one gram of potassium-magnesium aspartate twice daily brought more than 90% complete relief from all symptoms within 2 weeks.

L-Serine (Women’s Formula Only)
The syndrome fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that affects many people. It is characterised by diffuse tenderness, widespread pain, cognitive disturbance and fatigue. The exact causes of fibromyalgia are unknown, however people suffering from this condition have lower levels of serine in their blood compared with healthy people.
Source: http://aminoacidstudies.org/l-serine/
Recent research being done in Australia has led to the conclusion that people who suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFIDS), especially those with more neurological symptoms, may actually have a treatable amino acid deficiency. At the February 1998 CFIDS conference in Sydney, doctors from Newcastle University in Callaghan, Australia, who have formed the Collaborative Pain Research Unit (CPRU), presented their intriguing discovery that a substantial number of CFIDS patients have a deficiency in the amino acid, serine.

D-serine vs. L-serine
This article includes references from studies using both enantiomers of serine. The two may have somewhat similar effects since L-serine is converted to D-serine by serine racemase, an enzyme that requires vitamin B6 to function. It is thus important to supplement vitamin B6 when supplementing L-serine.
Mood and Depression
D-serine produces both acute[1] and chronic[2] antidepressant effects in animal models. Chronic use was also reported to lower markers of anxiety. Studies have also shown that it may prevent cognitive impairment in subjects exposed to stressful situations[3] (like a job interview) but not in normal day-to-day situations. D-serine, therefore, does not strictly meet the definition of a nootropic. It is, however, ubiquitous in the body, and with many interesting effects in promoting cerebral health, certainly a worthy supplement.

White Tea Extract
White tea flavonoids and Caffeine can ease depression by stimulating release of hormones in brain and thus reduce stress.
This remarkable tea has also been shown to fight free radicals from sun, stress and poor diet, and reverse some of the signs of aging. According to a study by Kingston University in London, it seems that white tea may be an interesting option for reducing and preventing wrinkles. Out of 21 different compounds tested, white tea was found to contain by far the highest concentration of antioxidants.
Is there anything this tea doesn’t help improve? Well, let’s see here, white tea may also reduce blood sugar and lessen the symptoms of diabetes. This astounding tea has shown to reduce stress and yet increase energy levels. Now who doesn’t want to have more energy throughout the day?

St. John’s Wort
In one study of 40 patients with social anxiety disorder, taking St. John’s wort for two weeks seemed to slightly improve anxiety symptoms; however, the difference between the groups in the study may have been due to chance, and the study itself was poorly designed, according to Lenz.
Many herbal supplements are sedatives and should not be taken with other sedative drugs or alcohol, Lenz said.

Guarana
“Guarana acts on the central nervous system to prevent fatigue and break down lactic acid from muscle stress. Guarana also discourages blood clots, stimulates the urinary system, and promotes production of digestive juices. Guarana was used to treat diarrhea, decrease fatigue, reduce hunger, and to help arthritis. Guarana has been thought as a high energy source that increases mental alertness, slows the pulse, decreases the appetite, fights fatigue, an excellent mood elevator.” –Source: https://www.practo.com/healthfeed/8-benefits-of-eating-guarana-3438/post
Guarana is marketed as the rocket fuel behind energy drinks and demonised as a dangerous form of supercharged caffeine, but what’s the naked truth to this Brazilian herb?
Guaraná contains caffeine, the stimulant found in coffee, tea, yerba mate, colas and chocolate. “Guaraná also contains a whole mix of other compounds that act together to stimulate you over and above its caffeine content,” says Professor Stephen Myers, Director of NatMed-Research at Southern Cross University.
In fact, at the University of Tasmania a study comparing the effects of coffee, guaraná and yerba mate showed that guaraná produced the greatest alertness and improvement in the performance of mental tasks. Coffee produced a peak in alertness after about 30-45 minutes then rapidly fell away, while the effects of guaraná were still continuing – and increasing – after 150 minutes. “There might be substances in guaraná that delay the metabolism of caffeine or slows the absorption of caffeine to prolong its effect,” Professor Myers explains.
Like other forms of caffeine, guaraná may interact with certain medications, and too much guaraná carries all the risks associated with high levels (over 300mg) of caffeine – insomnia, trembling, anxiety, dehydration and palpitations. Unlike coffee, however, laboratory tests have shown no evidence of toxicity even in large doses, but guaraná should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation, or when there is high blood pressure.

Garcinia Cambogia
Garcinia cambogia (GC) is a small pumpkin-shaped fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and India. The key active ingredient found in garcinia cambogia is Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA), which some research suggests can help certain people lose weight. Developing research suggests that HCA might prevent fat storage, control appetite, and increase exercise endurance.
This weight loss supplement does more than just inhibit fat development. It also affects the brain. It is important to understand how garcinia cambogia improves your mood and how this affects weight loss.
The main ingredient in Garcinia Cambogia is called Hydroxycitric Acid, or HCA. HCA affects the body in a few different ways. It prevents your body from storing unused carbohydrates as fat that could add to your weight.
It also creates a full sensation while eating so that it becomes easier to consume fewer calories while dieting. The third important effect is that the HCA in Garcinia Cambogia increases the production of serotonin in the brain. Higher levels of serotonin have been proven to improve mood over time.
Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in the brain. It is responsible for several things. Serotonin helps to regulate many functions in the body. It also allows messages to pass freely through the brain. Low levels of serotonin can lead to lethargic behavior, depression and anxiety. These factors can put you in a bad mood regardless of what is really happening around you.
Taking Garcinia Cambogia regularly will naturally stimulate the production of serotonin in your brain. You will begin to feel emotionally better. You will have fewer problems with depression, anxiety and feelings of hopelessness.
