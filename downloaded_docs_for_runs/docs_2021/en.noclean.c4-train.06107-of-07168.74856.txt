Aromatherapy
Aromatherapy is the practice of using essential oils to improve physical and psychological well-being.
Essential oils have been used in medicine, perfume, cosmetics and for therapeutic, spiritual and ritualistic purposes in ancient Egypt, the Middle East, China, India, Greece and Rome for thousands of years. These oils are concentrated, volatile substances, extracted from different parts of plants, flowers, leaves, bark, peel, wood, roots and resin. The chemical constituents of each essential oil have unique and valuable therapeutic properties.
In UK, essential oils are most commonly combined with massage although they can also be used in the bath, for inhalation and for making creams, lotions and compresses.
The treatment
During this holistic treatment, the aromatherapist combines a gentle but firm whole body massage with a tailor-made blend of essential oils combined specifically towards individual needs. The synergy of the blending of 3 essential oils and the power of touch enhances the therapeutic effects; encouraging deep relaxation and relief of tension, elimination of toxins and calming of body and mind.
