Feed A Cold – Starve A Fever? Holistic Treatment Tips
With cold and flu season upon us, you may be wondering if the long-standing rule of feed a cold – starve a fever is true. In a time where people reach for the medicine cabinet at the first sign of a cold, flu, or fever, it turns out grandma may have known what she was talking about.
Holistic Treatment Tips
While over the counter medications may help relieve the symptoms, they do not work to treat the cause. The rule of starving a fever and feeding a cold has to do with allowing your body to do what it does best: fight infections naturally.
Here are some health truths and holistic treatment tips:
Feeding A Cold
Catching a cold indicates that your immune system is not functioning at full capacity. In order to bolster your immune system you need to feed it with nutrients that can support high immune function to fight the cold.
If you feel a cold coming on, reach for the fruit bowl rather than the medicine cabinet, for a natural and holistic approach. Foods rich in vitamin C will help improve your immune function to fight off that pesky cold.
You have probably heard that chicken soup is great for colds. This is true if you are eating the right kind of soup. While canned soup may make you feel better, homemade soup contains the nutrients your body needs. Making a homemade soup containing chicken, broth, and vegetables will have you feeling better in no time.
Starving A Fever
While there has been little research to prove that starving a fever has any effect on the length of your fever, you probably have noticed that while feeling feverish, you don’t have an appetite. However, you should always eat when you are hungry while avoiding particular foods while running a fever.
One food group you should avoid while running a fever is dairy. Excessive body heat can cause the dairy to break down to quickly and spoil in your stomach. This can lead to nausea and vomiting to go along with your fever. If you are hungry, you should opt for light foods such as soup, broth, crackers, and dry toast.
Holistic Treatment Options
Many people are turning to holistic treatment options to fighting and preventing illness. These approaches have been working for generations and include massage, nutrition, and even essential oils that improve your overall health without the side effects of prescriptions and over the counter medications.
