Home Remedies for Scars
Burns and injuries are just some of the things that may cause scars. Treating a wound may not keep a scar from appearing. But it helps restoring healthy skin on the affected part.
Give it time to heal
Let the wound heal in its own time after first aid, or appropriate medical treatment if needed, has been made. Do not rush the natural hearing process by applying unnecessary treatments like creams. Avoid picking on the wound, especially when it begins to itch as it heals. Keep it clean and cover with breathable bandage.
Aloe Vera
Aloe vera is a natural moisturizer. The gel-like substance extracted from aloe leaves has a soothing effect on the skin and may even help in healing wounds. It can help in reducing the size and improve the appearance of scars.
Cocoa Butter
The use of cocoa butter can help in reducing the appearance of a scar. It is a great emollient and penetrates deep into the skin keeping it smooth and soft. It helps in keeping the scarred part of the skin and the area surrounding it moisturized, soft, and supple which can improve the scar’s appearance.
Lemon
Lemon extract can be used as a cleanser. It may also help in lightening the appearance of the scar.
Vitamin E
Whether it is in your diet or applied directly on the affected part, Vitamin E is good for your skin. To keep your skin healthy, maintain a nutritious diet with the recommended daily intake of Vitamin E you can get from foods like almonds, avocados, olive oil, and certain types of nuts among others.
