Tick Removal Video
This animated video shows how to safely and properly remove a tick from yourself or your pet- the process is the same. Do not use old methods such as Vaseline, burning or smothering the tick. That will only serve to potentially cause the tick to get angry and "regurgitate" their intestinal contents into you or your pet, transmitting disease.
