Fever and High Temperature
What is a fever?
A fever is the body’s internal coping mechanism. A fever is when the body temperature increases and the fever then acts as a sign to show that something out of the ordinary is happening inside the body.1
Most people believe that the severity of a fever is dependent on the severity of the illness however, this is not the case.2 A fever often assists the body’s immune system in fighting off the infection.3
What is a normal body temperature?
The normal body temperature range of an individual is around 37 degrees centigrade - give or take a degree depending on the individual.4 Also, minor fluctuations in temperature may occur depending on what time of the day it is.5
What temperature is a fever?
The fever triggered by a viral or bacterial infection is caused by chemicals produced by the immune system, which reset the body’s thermostat to a higher level.
Most cases of mild fever resolve by themselves within a couple of days. A mild fever (up to 39°C) can actually help the immune system to get rid of an infection. In children between the ages of six months and six years, fever can trigger convulsions. A fever of 42.4°C or higher, particularly in the elderly, can permanently damage the brain.
What causes a fever?
When the body’s natural thermostat shifts, it forces the normal temperature of the body to increase and this is when the fever occurs. Fevers can be caused by:7,8
Viruses (i.e. colds, upper respiratory tract infection)
Bacterial infections
Heat exhaustion and heat stroke (i.e. fever without sweating)
Extreme sunburn
Inflammatory conditions
Some medications and immunizations
The most common cause of a fever is an infection however, the cause can sometimes be unidentified.9,10
What are common fever symptoms?
Fever symptoms can vary depending on what is causing the fever. Some symptoms of a mild fever (fever temperature of 37 – 39.4°C) include:11,12
Feeling unwell
Feeling hot and sweaty
Shivering
Chattering teeth
Flushed face
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Dehydration
General weakness
How do I know if I have a fever (diagnosis)?
A fever is a symptom not an illness, meaning the cause of the fever needs to be determined for a diagnosis.13 If the cause of the fever is unclear, a doctor may perform the following tests:14,15
Basic family history test
Blood tests
Urine examination and culture
Throat swabs or mucus sample
Stool examination and culture
X-rays
What are the treatment and relief options available to help with fevers?
There are various treatments that can help with fevers and provide relief. However, the severity and the cause of the fever will determine which treatment method is most appropriate.
If suffering from a mild fever, the doctor may suggest not using any treatment as the body will fight the infection naturally.16
Over-the-counter medications
If experiencing a fever, speak with your pharmacist about over the counter medications, such as ibuprofen, that can help lower body temperature and relieve symptoms and whether these medications are appropriate for you.
Ibuprofen assists in blocking the production of prostaglandins which are chemicals in the body which cause inflammation, pain and fevers by increasing body temperatures and dilating the blood vessels at the location of the pain source.17
Prescription medications
A doctor may prescribe medication depending on the cause of the fever.
For Infants and Children
For infants who are younger than 28 days old, the child should be admitted into hospital for treatment.18 A fever at this age could indicate serious illness and infection.19
At home self-treatment
To help provide fever relief at home, try the following tips:20
Take medication such as ibuprofen to help bring temperatures down
Drink fluids, especially water
Avoid alcohol, coffee and tea
Sponge exposed skin with tepid water to cool the body
Avoid taking cold baths or showers
Rest
If you are unsure about what treatment is most appropriate for you, visit your pharmacist or doctor.
How can I prevent another fever from occurring?
The best way to prevent another fever from occurring is to reduce exposure to other infectious diseases.21 Below are some tips to help reduce exposure:22
Wash hands regularly
Avoid touching nose, mouth and eye area
Cover mouth when coughing or sneezing
Avoid sharing food, cups, water bottles and utensils
When do I see a doctor (adult)?
It is best to see your doctor if any of the following appear whilst you have a fever:23,24
Fever stays for three days
High Temperature - over 40°C
Shivering, shaking and teeth chattering
Hot but not sweating
Symptoms worsen
Unusual symptoms occur (i.e. vomiting, neck stiffness, rash, rapid heart rate, chills or muscle spasm)
Feeling confused and drowsy
Difficulty breathing
Severe headache
Persistent vomiting
Recently travelled overseas

Younger than 6 months
Fever stays for more than 2 days
Headache, pain in the stomach or limbs
Earache
Problems swallowing
Vomiting or diarrhoea
