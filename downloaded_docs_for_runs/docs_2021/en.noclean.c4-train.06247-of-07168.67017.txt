Sumatriptan: uses, dosage, warnings, side effects
Everything you need to know about using sumatriptan to relieve migraines and cluster headaches
By Helen Marshall
22/11/2016
What is sumatriptan used for?
Sumatriptan tablets, injection and nasal spray are used to relieve migraine attacks and cluster headaches.
How does sumatriptan work?
Sumatriptan is a type of medicine called a serotonin (or 5HT) agonist, more commonly known as a 'triptan'. These are painkillers specifically used to relieve migraine attacks.
The cause of migraine attacks is not fully understood, but is thought to involve changes in the levels of chemicals in the brain. The throbbing pain of migraine headaches is a result of blood vessels in the brain widening or swelling.
Sumatriptan acts on serotonin (or 5HT) receptors that are found on blood vessels in the brain, causing them to narrow. It's also thought to inhibit the action of the trigeminal nerve. These actions relieve the headache and other symptoms that you may get with your migraine, such as feeling sick or sensitivity to light or sound.
How long does sumatriptan take to work?
This depends how you take it.
Sumatriptan tablets start to work about 30 minutes after taking a dose. Imigran Radis tablets are a brand of sumatriptan tablet that starts to work faster than standard tablets, because they disintegrate faster in the stomach.
Sumatriptan nasal spray starts to work within about 15 minutes of administering a dose into the nose. The medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream through the blood vessels in the nasal lining.
Sumatriptan injection starts to work 10 to 15 minutes after injecting a dose under the skin.
What should I know before using sumatriptan?
Sumatriptan shouldn't be used to prevent migraines or cluster headaches - it won't work for this. It will only relieve these types of headache once they've started. There's no point in taking sumatriptan during the aura phase of a migraine because it won't prevent the headache developing.
You may get feelings of warmth, heaviness, pressure, tightness or pain in certain parts of the body, including the chest or throat after having a dose of sumatriptan. Although sometimes very strong, these feelings usually only last a few minutes. If they continue for more than two hours or are particularly severe (especially chest pain), you should get advice from a doctor immediately, as there have been extremely rare reports of such problems being caused by a heart attack. Do NOT take any further doses; your doctor will decide if you should stop using sumatriptan.
Sumatriptan may cause drowsiness. If affected do not drive or operate machinery.
