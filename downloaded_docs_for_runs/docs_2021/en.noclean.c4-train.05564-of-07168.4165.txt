PRP plus Minoxidil beats PRP plus Finasteride: More PRP evidence for Hair Growth
January 1, 2018

Articles, News
Combination therapy has been the mainstay of treatment for hair loss for a long time. In other words, where your regular doctor will likely prescribe one thing at a time for any given medical condition, your hair doctor will recommend several, simultaneously, and urge you to stick with all of them.
This is because, generally speaking, each treatment that we find works for hair tends to help other treatments work better. Minoxidil (Rogaine) is good for hair, but minoxidil PLUS finasteride (Propecia) works better. And furthermore, minoxidil, PLUS finasteride, PLUS shampoos, PLUS light therapy devices (like laser helmets, etc.) works the best!
Nothing so far used to treat hair is mutually exclusive in any case, so using all these treatments makes sense.
Enter the newest treatment for hair loss – Platelet Rich Plasma, also known as PRP. In a recent study, combination treatments using PRP with either minoxidil OR with finasteride showed that the PRP combined with minoxidil gives hair the biggest boost. The design of the study was useful in that it treated only HALF the head at a time in order to leave the other half as a “control.” On the flip side, the design of the study was small, using only 24 subjects, which is a bare minimum to show statistical significance, so to really PROVE this a larger study needs to be done exactly like it.
Nevertheless, it is exciting to know that patients have a this option for treating their hair, and that the evidence is building for the potential efficacy of using PRP to treat patients with hair. If you have questions about whether PRP might work well in your case, ask your hair doctor and do not give up on multiple simultaneous therapies in the meantime.
