This scientific report shows the relevance between Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and Supplementation with Vitamin B6,B12 and ,Folic Acid.
“Vitamin therapy with folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamins B6 and B12, and dietary supplementation with enriched cereal-grain products and breakfast cereals containing folate can reduce plasma homocysteine levels.”
Here is an abstract of the scientific research.
Plasma Homocysteine as a Risk Factor for Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease
Sudha Seshadri, M.D., Alexa Beiser, Ph.D., Jacob Selhub, Ph.D., Paul F. Jacques, Sc.D.,
Irwin H. Rosenberg, M.D., Ralph B. D’Agostino, Ph.D., Peter W.F. Wilson, M.D., and Philip A. Wolf, M.D. N Engl J Med 2002; 346:476-483
METHODS
A total of 1092 subjects without dementia (667 women and 425 men; mean age, 76 years) from the Framingham Study constituted our study sample. We examined the relation of the plasma total homocysteine level measured at base line and that measured eight years earlier to the risk of newly diagnosed dementia on follow-up. We used multivariable proportional-hazards regression to adjust for age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, vascular risk factors other than homocysteine, and plasma levels of folate and vitamins B12 and B6.
RESULTS
Over a median follow-up period of eight years, dementia developed in 111 subjects, including 83 given a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The multivariable-adjusted relative risk of dementia was 1.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.9) for each increase of 1 SD in the log-transformed homocysteine value either at base line or eight years earlier. The relative risk of Alzheimer’s disease was 1.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.5) per increase of 1 SD at base line and 1.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.1) per increase of 1 SD eight years before base line. With a plasma homocysteine level greater than 14 μmol per liter, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease nearly doubled.
CONCLUSIONS
An increased plasma homocysteine level is a strong, independent risk factor for the development of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
