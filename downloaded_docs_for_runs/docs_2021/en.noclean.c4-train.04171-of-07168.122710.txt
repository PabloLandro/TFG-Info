Cholesterol Control:Cholesterol is one of the major reasons for the development of heart disease and cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol forms plaque-like structures inside the blood vessels and arteries that obstruct the blood flow. This in turn causes the heart to pump with higher force, resulting in heart weakening, which can be followed by a heart attack. For starters, cholesterol is one of two types. One is HDL or high density lipid cholesterol, which is good cholesterol, and the other is LDL or low density lipid cholesterol, which is bad cholesterol. It is the LDL or the bad cholesterol that forms plaque and leads to heart weakening. Recent studies have shown that the intake of goji berries reduces high cholesterol levels. In particular, LDL cholesterol levels are reduced.
Free Radical Scavenging:Free radicals, if left alone, can damage our tissues, cells, cell membranes, and DNA over time, resulting in the development of various diseases. Research studies have suggested that the consumption of goji berries may help in the reduction of medical conditions related to free radicals. The antioxidants present in goji berry may also help in boosting the immune system. Healthy Body: The health benefits of goji berry also include general well-being and a healthy body. Results of a study conducted suggest that consumption of goji berry enhance and improve gastrointestinal functions and reduce stress and fatigue. It also improves neurological and psychological performance as well. Protects Brain Cells from Damage: Goji berry extracts have shown significant neuroprotective activity.
