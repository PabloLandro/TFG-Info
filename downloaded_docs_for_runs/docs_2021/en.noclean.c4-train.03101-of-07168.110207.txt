Arthritis Pain
Arthritis pain is as a result of an autoimmune disorder and is one of the most severe forms of the disease. It normally affects the joints, especially in the hands, feet and fingers. It usually affects both sides of the body at once. The disease destroys the protective cartilage in the joint. Women are more likely to suffer from this disease than men.
Symptoms
Symptoms include aching or stiffness in the joints, especially upon waking; loss of motion in the joints that are affected and decreased strength in the muscles attached to those joints. Other symptoms you may experience are fatigue, low fever, small lumps that form under the skin called rheumatoid nodules and deformity of the joints over time.
Causes
The cause of the underlying disease and resultant pain, Rheumatoid arthritis, is not known, it can be triggered by viral or bacterial infection. The immune system turns on itself, trying to attack the virus.
Cautions
Left untreated, rheumatoid arthritis can be debilitating due to the pain, inflammation, and deterioration of the affected joints. Medicinal plants can complement medical treatment however you should consult your doctor and follow a regulated treatment.
