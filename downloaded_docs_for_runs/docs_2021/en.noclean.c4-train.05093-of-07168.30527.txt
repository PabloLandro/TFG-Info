Effective UV Curing Requires the Right UV Lamp
Ultraviolet radiation is utilized in many industrial and commercial processes worldwide to instantly dry and cure polymers. When polymers such as epoxies, silicone and polyurethane are exposed to UV radiation, a photochemical reaction occurs which bonds and seals the polymer within seconds of exposure.
There are many advantages of using UV curing over other curing methods such as air drying or using chemicals. Air drying polymers leaves the coating susceptible to contaminants such as dust to affect the quality of the surface as well as evaporation which can leave an uneven surface and an inconsistent process. Using chemicals can pose a health risk to employees and requires purchasing, storing and disposing of chemicals properly.
UV curing delivers a quick and consistent process which results in enhanced product durability and strength without evaporation or contamination.

High Performance UV Lamps for Ballast Water Treatment Systems
UVC radiation is a highly effective, proven method of sterilizing and purifying water, air and surfaces. With the new Ballast Water Treatment Convention, BWTC, that went into full effect last September of 2017, shipping companies are required to maintain an effective system on board their vessel. Contaminated ballast water is considered to be one of the top 5 threats to the sustainability of the planet’s oceans, as foreign marine organisms are picked up in one port and released in another.
This has wreaked havoc on the fishing industry in many shipping ports and threatened the safety of human life in cases where foreign invaders take over without their natural predators. Jellyfish have been known to multiply to uncontrollable levels while mussels attach to structures such as dams and bridges causing damage by upsetting the natural ecosystem. UV lamps utilized in ballast water sterilization systems solves this problem with a highly effective and simple to maintain system.
UV Lamps with Powerful Water Sterilization Effects
Ultraviolet technology is proven to sterilize water by instantly killing bacteria, viruses and microorganisms naked to the human eye. With powerful wavelengths emitted at 254 nanometer, nm, the DNA of these living organisms is immediately altered making them unable to replicate rendering them harmless.
LightSources Offers Patented UV Lamps for Water Treatment

Phototherapy Lamps for Effective Psoriasis Treatment
Phototherapy is using light to provide a therapeutic treatment and is proven to be highly effective at treating and curing many medical conditions. Light therapy is used worldwide to help patients suffering from a host of various ailments. It is important to know which type of light works best for specific conditions, as the wrong lighting may not help at all or could worsen some conditions.
Working with your doctor and respected lighting and phototherapy lamp providers can provide assurance that you are receiving the right type of treatment for your condition.
Phototherapy Successfully Treats Psoriasis and Other Skin Conditions
The National Psoriasis Foundation endorses the uses of phototherapy to treat psoriasis when under a doctor’s care. Indoor tanning beds do not provide the same effective wavelength of UV light to treat psoriasis and can further damage skin. It is important to use the right type of phototherapy lamps when treating psoriasis.
UVB light is effective in treating psoriasis by slowing down the production of new skin cells which allows the skin to heal. Patients may be sent home with a special phototherapy lamp which emits the proper amount of UVB rays.
Light therapy is also highly effective at treating other skin conditions such as eczema, acne, vitiligo and jaundice.
Light Therapy for Jaundice Treatment
UV light is used in hospitals in the newborn unit to treat jaundice in newborn babies. Jaundice occurs when the liver does not break down toxins like a fully developed or well-functioning liver would. UV light effectively breaks down bilirubin in the blood which is why these lamps are often referred to as ‘bili’ lights. Phototherapy lamps used to treat jaundice may even be sent home with new parents to help nurture their baby’s liver to a healthy state.
LightSources and our valued partners represent the leading high-tech lamp designers and manufacturers available in the lamp industry today. We provide lamps and lighting solutions to a multitude of applications including patented products for light therapy treatment.

UV Air Purification Provides Clean and Healthy Air
UV air purification and sterilization systems are proven to effectively clean the air we breathe, providing healthy air for people in residential and commercial settings. Commercial building owners in particular owe it to their patrons and residents to provide safe air free from harmful contaminants. UV air purification safely and effectively removes harmful contaminants including viruses, bacteria, microorganisms and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air to prevent the spread of airborne illnesses.
Air purification is especially important in settings where people with compromised immune systems frequent such as doctor’s offices, medical complexes, nursing homes and hospitals. HVAC air purification delivers a higher quality of air with proven sterilization methods to promote health and wellness.
UVC Germicidal Lamps Eliminate Bacteria
UVC germicidal lamps eliminate bacteria and viruses even naked to the human eye with powerful UVC radiation which is completely safe with no harmful side effects. UVC light emitted at 254 nanometer, the wavelength most effective for germicidal effectiveness, kills harmful contaminants on contact within seconds. Instant exposure alters the DNA of these viruses making them harmless and unable to reproduce.
Ozone emitting systems also remove odors from the air, although may contribute to eroding some HVAC and cooling systems so be sure to speak with a UVC germicidal specialist to install the right system for the right application.
