Breaking it down
Below we've broken down the main functions of our Magnesium Glycinate and the benefits it can provide.
Helps Relieve PMS symptoms
Magnesium deficiency can increase contractility of smooth muscle and level of prostaglandins, both which contribute to drive period pain. Studies have shown that magnesium, especially when paired with B6 can reduce the severity of PMS symptoms, with those who supplemented experiencing a significant decrease in the severity of water retention. Magnesium also helped reduce severity of depression, craving, and anxiety symptoms during PMS.
Supports Neurological Health
Research has shown magnesium to improve neurological function recovery post injury while enhancing nerve regeneration. This study also showed a suppression of inflammatory responses.
Relieves Occasional Migraines
Research has shown that magnesium deficiency may be present in up to half of migraine patients due to increased excretion and decreased absorption. Magnesium may be effective because of it's ability to block tranmission of pain chemicals in the brain as well as prevent narrowing of brain blood vesssels.
