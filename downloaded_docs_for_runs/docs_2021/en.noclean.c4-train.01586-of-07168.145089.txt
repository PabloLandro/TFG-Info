Environmental Hazards
Vinegar doesn't have any negative impacts on the environment. As a compound, it's biodegradable; capable of decaying through the action of living organisms. Also, it won't linger in the soil and water. Thus, it's not harmful to plants and animals. Therefore, it's an Eco-friendly product!
Human Health Hazards
Even though vinegar is good for a lot things from cooking to cleaning, it still has its flaws.
Vinegar is highly acidic. Hence, when consumed in large amounts, it can cause caustic burns to the esophagus and stomach. According to Dr. Chung, a patient who drank 1 tbsp. of rice vinegar in an attempt to dissolve a bone stuck in her throat, (a common home remedy in China) suffered inflammation in the throat and second-degree caustic burns in the esophagus. Second-degree caustic injury may require endoscopy for diagnosis and treatment, along with a special diet or possible surgery.
Too much vinegar can cause teeth erosion in the mouth. Because of its high acidic level, it cause the teeth to erode and destroy the teeth enamel. The teeth enamel protects the teeth from breaking down and developing cavities.
