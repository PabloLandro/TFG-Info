Caffeine
Cognitive functions
Found in:
Leaves and fruits of certain plants.
Do you need it?
It sure feels very good those early mornings, when the 2-o´clock dip hits or when working late. Actually, it feels good to be alert and awake when you need to.
Consequences of not getting enough
Zombie state has been observed.
Research
Cognitive functions
Widely used for focus and attention, caffeine supports mental alertness by stimulating the central nervous system.
Numerous studies have shown that caffeine is known to exert positive effects on cognitive performance such as reaction time, alertness, and sustained attention. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies found that moderate levels of caffeine enhanced sustained attention and alertness, decreased feelings of mental fatigue, reduced reaction time, improved performance on attention tasks and increased overall mood ratings:

Vitamin K2
More Info
Vitamin K2
Bone Support
Heart health
Muscles
Found in
Natto, hard cheeses, egg yolk.
Consequences of not getting enough
Deficiency could reduce bone mineralization and contribute to osteoporosis.
Vitamin K2 appears to increase cardiac output.
Increased risk of cardiovascular heart disease.
Do you need it?
Vitamin K2 is not typically common in a Western diet because they are found in a variety of fermented foods.
You may need Vitamin K2 if you have a disease that affects absorption in the digestive tract, such as Crohn's disease or active celiac disease. Or if you take drugs that interfere with vitamin K absorption, if you are severely malnourished, or drink alcohol heavily.
Research
Bone health
Post-menopausal women, who have the highest rate of osteoporosis, were selected for a 2009 clinical study on the effects of Vitamin K on bone health. 244 healthy postmenopausal women were given 180mcg per day of vitamin K2 or a placebo for three years, and their bone strength and density was measured each year. Vitamin K2 reduced age-related decline in bone mineral content and bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the total hip. Bone strength was affected positively by vitamin K2 and a decrease in the loss of vertebral height in the lower thoracic region was found:
Three-year low-dose menaquinone-7 supplementation helps decrease bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women
In a 1991 study, blood samples were taken from two groups in order to review the levels of vitamin K2. The subjects in the first group had osteoporosis and had experienced a recent fracture; those in the second group were healthy and did not have osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 levels were significantly higher in the group without osteoporosis. In the osteoporosis group, only two of the 29 patients were getting sufficient levels of vitamin K2:
Depressed levels of circulating menaquinones in patients with osteoporotic fractures of the spine and femoral neck
The benefits of supplementing K2 may be enhanced even further when combined with a vitamin D supplement, because the two vitamins have synergistic effects:
Vitamins D and K as pleiotropic nutrients: clinical importance to the skeletal and cardiovascular systems and preliminary evidence for synergy
Muscles
Vitamin K2 supplementation may boost the output of the heart by 12% in aerobically trained males and female athletes. The study's finding might translate into an effect on edurance exercise capacity:
Oral Consumption of Vitamin K2 for 8 Weeks Associated With Increased Maximal Cardiac Output During Exercise
Heart Health
Vitamin K2 supports heart health by stimulating Gla-protein in order to prevent calcification of the arteries and soft-tissue. Clinical studies have attempted to further prove the benefits of vitamin K2 for heart health.
16,057 women who were free of cardiovascular disease were analyzed using a food frequency questionnaire. After approximately 8 years there were 480 cases of cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) in the group. The average daily vitamin K2 intake for the patients who developed CHD was 29.1mcg, far below the recommended daily intake of 80mcg/day:
A high menaquinone intake reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease
A 2004 study also reviewed vitamin K2 intake and its relation to CHD. The Rotterdam study reviewed the dietary intake of 4,807 subjects. They found the relative risk of CHD mortality and severe aortic calcification was reduced in the middle and upper tiers of vitamin K2 consumption when compared to the lower tier:

A 2015 clinical study attempted to prove a link between vitamin K2 and arterial stiffness. 244 healthy post-menopausal women were randomized and given either a placebo or 180mcg of vitamin K2 per day. After three years, the group receiving vitamin K2 showed fewer signs of arterial stiffness than the placebo group when measured using echotracking:

Resveratrol
Immune system
Found in
Grapes and grape products, peanuts, berries.
Consequences of not getting enough
Resveratrol is not an essential nutrient, however emerging research indicate that it may be efficient for the reduction of skin wrinkling and that it can aide immune responses.
Do you need it?
Emerging research
Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in several types of plants, including red grapes, blueberries, and nuts. Resveratrol plays a defense mechanism role to help protect against environmental stressors. Scientific evidence suggests that it can also help promote healthy ageing in humans and animals. Resveratrol is drawing a lot of attention in the scientific community with almost 3000 studies published in the last year alone; the total number of publications on resveratrol now approaching 11.000, making it one of the fastest growing bodies of evidence for a health and wellness ingredient. This published research and clinical data suggests that resveratrol can aide in healthy ageing through maintaining bone health, cardiovascular health, blood glucose control, healthy cognitive function, skin youthfulness and oral health.
Still, it’s important to note that while experts agree that it does have potential, there’s still not enough data to confirm its effectiveness. The biggest problem with observing resveratrol’s effects, has been that it rapidly metabolizes when taken in pill form. The oral bioavailability of resveratrol is almost zero due to the rapid and extensive metabolism. However, Plein’s dosage form is designed to facilitate more effective absorption of resveratrol, enabling close to 100% uptake. The films are a perfect carrier for ingredients like resveratrol, where absorption is critical and challenging.
Research
Immune System
Our immune response declines with age. Resveratrol has been shown to have potent antiaging and health-promoting activities. Studies in cells and various animal models have showed that resveratrol reduce inflammation:
Resveratrol, an extract of red wine, inhibits lipopolysaccharide induced airway neutrophilia and inflammatory mediators through an NF-kappaB-independent mechanism
Regulation of inflammation and redox signaling by dietary polyphenols
A study also suggests that dietary intake of resveratrol may help the elderly to generate an improved response to vaccines with stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses:
Dietary Intake of Resveratrol Enhances the Adaptive Immunity of Aged Rats
Resveratrol improves health and survival of mice on a high-calorie diet
The following study suggests that resveratrol could be considered as an adjuvant to enhance the body’s immune response to vaccines, as well as dietary additives for animals to enhance humoral and cellular immunity and to play antioxidant and antiaging effects:

Healthy Skin
A placebo controlled, double-blind study published in 2012 found that subjects given resveratrol supplements had improved skin moisturization and elasticity, and diminished skin roughness and depth of wrinkles. Intensity of age spots had significantly decreased, as evidenced by improvement in the individual typological angle:

Coenzym Q10
More Info
Coenzym Q10
Immune system
Found in
Seafoods, organ meats, whole grains.
Consequences of not getting enough
Muscle weakness and energy fatigue.
Do you need it?
CoQ10 plays a significant role in boosting the immune system and physical performance, as tissues and cells involved with immune function are highly energy-dependent and therefore require an adequate supply of CoQ10 for optimal function.
Age
As we age, CoQ10 levels decrease, and in some cases supplementation can help keep those levels high.
Medical conditions and smoking
Certain health conditions can also place individuals at higher risk for having low CoQ10 levels. These include cancer, diabetes, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, muscular dystrophies, depression, and Parkinson’s disease. Smoking tends to deplete the body of CoQ10 as well.
Research
Immune System
Antioxidants, such as CoQ10, can neutralize free radicals and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage they cause. CoQ10 improves energy, augments the immune system, and acts as an antioxidant. The potential use of coenzyme Q10 supplements alone or in combination with other drug therapies and nutritional supplements may help prevent or treat some of the following conditions: cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, cancer, periodontal diseases, mitochondrial disorders, radiation injury, obesity, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), gastric ulcers, allergy, migraine headaches, kidney failure, muscular dystrophy, and aging. CoQ10 plays a significant role in boosting the immune system and physical performance, as tissues and cells involved with immune function are highly energy-dependent and therefore require an adequate supply of CoQ10 for optimal function:
Coenzyme Q10: The essential nutrient
CoQ10 supplementation may partly improve the process of inflammatory state:
Effects of Coenzyme Q10 on Markers of Inflammation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Coenzyme Q10 supplementation ameliorates inflammatory markers in patients with multiple sclerosis: a double blind, placebo, controlled randomized clinical trial
Pregnancy
197 pregnant women with high-risk of preeclampsia were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were designated to receive 200mg of CoQ10 or a placebo daily from 20 weeks of pregnancy until delivery. 30 women in the placebo group experienced pre-eclampsia, compared to 17 in the CoQ10 group:
Coenzyme Q10 supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia
Heart
Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) experience a reduction in ecSOD, an important antioxidant system within the vessel wall. 33 CAD patients were split into two groups and received 300mg of CoQ10 per day or a placebo in a 2007 study. The treatment group experienced statistically significant improvements related to their coronary artery disease: their expression of ecSOD, endothelium-dependent relaxation, and peak VO(2) and O(2) pulse increases were greater:

Selenium
More Info
Selenium
Immune system
Found in
Seafood, organ meats, grains and breads.
Consequences of not getting enough
Weakened immune system.
Selenium deficiency is associated with male infertility.
Do you need it?
Norwegian soils are known to be poor in selenium, and hence grains and breads locally grown will not fulfil our selenium levels. However, fish consumption can balance this out.
Diet
People who eat only local foods grown in soils that are low in selenium, or have a limited intake of seafood, grains and breads and other food types that contain selenium.
Research
Immune System
Selenium is crucial for the health and proper functioning of the immune system. Higher levels of selenium may be beneficial for boosting the immune system in patients with influenza, tuberculosis and hepatitis C:
The influence of selenium on immune responses
Dietary Selenium in Adjuvant Therapy of Viral and Bacterial Infections
Selenium is a powerful antioxidant that fights oxidative stress and helps defend the body from chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.
Things like smoking, alcohol use and stress can cause an excess of free radicals. This leads to oxidative stress, which damages healthy cells. Oxidative stress has been linked to chronic diseases like heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, as well as premature aging and the risk of stroke:
Free Radicals, Antioxidants in Disease and Health
Pregnancy
A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial studying the effect of supplementation with selenium on postpartum depression, suggest that supplementation with selenium during pregnancy might be an effective approach for the prevention of postpartum depression:

Bone Support
Immune system
Found in
Fatty fish, milk products, and sun.
Consequences of not getting enough
Soft bones / loss of bone density.
Osteoporosis and fractures.
Muscle weakness.

Sun Exposure
Increasing and maintaining healthy Vitamin D levels can be as easy as spending 5-30 minutes in midday sun twice per week.
But if you're not getting this, and most of your sunlight come from behind a glass window or through a screen? And when you're finally out, you use sunscreen? Then you actually might have Vitamin D deficiency. Also, living in the Northern hemisphere may contribute to inadequate exposure to sunlight:
Deficiency of sunlight and vitamin D
Diet
Also, if your diet is low in foods such as fatty fish and milk products, you may be deficient.
Age
As we age, the capacity of our skin to synthesize Vitamin D decreases. People who are lactose intolerant and those who don’t get enough sunlight may be at risk of deficiency.
Research
We have put sunlight (Vitamin D3) conveniently inside Bone Support and Immune System, to offer you a summer's day, every day!
Immune System
There have been multiple cross-sectional studies associating lower levels of vitamin D with increased infection. One report studied almost 19,000 subjects between 1988 and 1994. Individuals with lower vitamin D levels (<30 ng/ml) were more likely to self-report a recent upper respiratory tract infection than those with sufficient levels, even after adjusting for variables including season, age, gender, body mass and race:
Association Between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Level and Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Vitamin D levels fluctuate over the year. Although rates of seasonal infections varied, and were lowest in the summer and highest in the winter, the association of lower serum vitamin D levels and infection held during each season. Another cross-sectional study of 800 military recruits in Finland stratified men by serum vitamin D levels. Those recruits with lower vitamin D levels lost significantly more days from active duty secondary to upper respiratory infections than recruits with higher vitamin D levels (above 40nmol):
An association of serum vitamin D concentrations < 40 nmol/L with acute respiratory tract infection in young Finnish men
There have been a number of other cross-sectional studies looking at vitamin D levels and rates of influenza. All have reported an association of lower vitamin D levels and increased rates of infection:
Epidemic influenza and vitamin D
Vitamin D for treatment and prevention of infectious diseases: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials
Results of studies looking at potential benefits of administering vitamin D to decrease infection have not been consistent, most likely secondary to a number of methodologic concerns.
One recent well-designed prospective, double blind placebo study using an objective outcome, nasopharyngeal swab culture (and not self-report), and a therapeutic dose of vitamin D showed that vitamin D administration resulted in a statistically significant (42%) decrease in the incidence of influenza infection:
Randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation to prevent seasonal influenza A in schoolchildren
Supports bone health
Vitamin D is necessary for calcium and phosphorus absorption, which is why it is a major component of bone health. Ingesting adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life as part of a well-balanced diet may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
Cognitive functions
A randomized double-blind placebo control trial conducted in Norway recently indicated that vitamin D status in adolescents may be important for both executive functioning and mental health:
