Description
Evening Primrose Oil
Evening Primrose Oil helps improve skin irritations, promotes healthy functioning of body tissue and hydrates skin. That’s primarily a result of the high amounts of gamma linoleic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid, found in Evening Primrose Oil.
Evening Primrose Carrier Oil is a rich source of gamma linoleic acid, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids which can be used to nourish the skin. It also soothes inflammation and can be used in dandruff applications. Small amounts are often added to other carrier oils for fortification.
Evening Primrose can be used for soap making and bath and body manufacturing applications. It is used in dilution with other carrier oils suitable for massage. Evening Primrose Oil is reputed to nourish the skin and hair; reduce signs of eczema and fights the effects of aging.
EPO may help relieve symptoms from skin conditions, including itching, crusting, edema (fluid, swelling), and redness. EPO can be used in children and adults with skin conditions.
