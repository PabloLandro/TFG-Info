Recently topical use of 2% Ketoconazole solution has been reported to have a therapeutic effect on androgenic alopecia. Minoxidilis a vasodilatory medication used primarily as antihypertensive drug. It was discovered to have the side effect of hair growth andreversing baldness. Tretinoin is commonly used topically for acne treatment and in the treatment of photoaging. It is used by someas hair loss treatment. Objective. To compare the stimulatory effect of Ketoconazole, Minoxidil, and Minoxidil with Tretinoin on hairgrowth in a mouse model. Materials and Methods. Coat hairs on the dorsal skin of seven weeks old male mice were gently clippedand then stained by using commercial dye. These mice were divided into four groups each of five treated with topical applicationof ethanol 95%, Ketoconazole solution 2%, Minoxidil solution 5%, and Minoxidil with Tretinoin solution 0.1%, respectively. Thedrugs were applied once daily for three weeks, the clipped area was photographed, and the ratio of regrown coat area was calculated.
Results. The results demonstrated that Ketoconazole, Minoxidil, and Minoxidil with Tretinoin had a significant stimulatory effecton hair growth compared with the control group and Minoxidil was the most effective drug among them.
Ketoconazole (KCZ) is an imidazole antifungal agent.
Long term use of 2% KCZ was reported to be effective against Androgenic alopecia is a partial or complete loss of hair that androgenic alopecia in patients without seborrheic dermatitis occurs in a progressive pattern in genetically predisposed and dandruff [7].

The age at onset of androgenic alopecia differs but occurs This appears to explain its vasodilatory effect [8] but may also usually in mid-twenties.
