Tags: Athleteâ€™s Foot Home Remedies
Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that should be seen by a foot doctor. While contagious, Athlete’s foot is very curable and can even be eased with home remedies made from easy-to-find ingredients that many people have in their pantry. One of the simplest cures for Athlete’s foot is a salt water soak
Allow your feet to soak for 10-15 minutes in a mixture that contains about two cups water and two teaspoons of salt. This can be repeated at regular intervals until the skin no longer peels. Another option is a green tea soak.
Dip about five or six tea bags in boiling water. When the water is lukewarm, soak the feet in the tea water for about 30 minutes and then pat dry. Water can also be mixed with baking soda or mustard oil to create other mixtures that can treat Athlete’s foot.
For more information about how to treat and prevent Athlete’s foot, consult with Dr. Alan Discont, D.P.M. of Family Foot and Ankle Care. Dr. Discont will answer any of your foot- and ankle-related questions.

Celebrity Affected by Athleteâ€™s Foot

Tags: Foot Pain Athleteâ€™s Foot Tinea Pedis Fungal Infections Foot Discomfort Burning Feet Flaking Feet
The National Inquirerclaims that Lindsay Lohan has been contending with athlete’s foot. The Inquirer’s sources believe that the fungal condition is behind Lohan’s struggle with bad smelling feet that has affected her for years.
“Lilo’s horrified by her athlete’s foot,” one of the actress’ friends has stated. “She has no idea where she caught it because she’s always so careful in communal bathrooms and spas. But she’s suffered smelly feet ever since she was a teenager, and it’s been a hugely embarrassing cross to bear.” Lohan will be the subject of an Oprah Winfrey network 8-part documentary on drug use and rehabilitation.
Athlete’s foot can cause both physical and emotional discomfort. If you have athlete’s foot, see podiatrist Dr. Alan J. Discont of Family Foot & Ankle Care, PC. Dr. Discont can treat all your foot and ankle conditions.
What is Athlete’s Foot?
If you suffer from itching, burning, dry, and flaking feet, this may be a sign of athlete's foot. Athlete's foot, also known as tinea pedis, can be extremely contagious, and it often infects shower floors, gyms, socks and shoes, and anywhere else feet may come in contact with. It is commonly found in public changing areas and bathrooms, dormitory style living quarters, around locker rooms and public swimming pools. This condition can also be prevalent in "commons" areas in prisons and residential care facilities.
Solutions to Combat Athlete’s Foot
- Hydrate your feet by using lotion
- Exfoliate
- Buff off nails
- Use of anti-fungal product
- Examine feet and visit your doctor if any suspicious blisters or cuts are present.
What is Tinea?
- Athlete’s foot is often caused by the same fungus that causes ringworm (tinea).
- Tinea can invade other parts of the body as well, if the proper thriving conditions for it are met.

Athlete's Foot Very Common in Florida and Other Warm Geographic Locations

Tags: Foot Pain Athleteâ€™s Foot Tinea Pedis Fungal Infections Foot Discomfort Burning Feet Flaking Feet
Athlete’s foot is a bother and not something that is an enjoyable thing to endure. According to Angie Ferguson an exercise physiologist from Fort Myers, if you are a resident of a warm location like Florida, California, or Arizona to name a few, you might be more prone to developing athlete’s foot than that of someone living in a slightly cooler location.
Once you develop athlete’s foot, the fungus tends to travel from the third toe to the fourth and fifth one. Athlete’s foot is most commonly contracted on bare floors such as locker rooms, pool decks, public showers, or any sort of changing rooms. If you do become infected with the condition, it can easily be treated with over the counter medication.
Anyone is susceptible in attaining Athlete’s foot, but can be easily avoided following the right preventative care and treatment. A podiatrist like Dr. Zahid Ladha of Foot First Podiatry Center will be able to determine your condition and follow the appropriate treatment options for foot care needs.
