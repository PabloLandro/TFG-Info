Are Imitrex Side Effects Worth Its Benefits? Ask This First
Posted by Ashley Greene | Aug 20, 2018 | 349
Medical Review by AHS Headache Specialist Cynthia Armand, MD
If you’re one of the approximately 1 billion people worldwide who get debilitating Migraine attacks, you know how this unpredictable “monster” has the ability to devour your entire day. Imitrex is considered to be the “gold standard” prescription medication to relieve attacks. Trouble is, Imitrex side effects keep some people from using it.
If you’ve been dealing with Migraine for a while, it’s likely that you have tried or considered trying Imitrex or the generic version, sumatriptan. You may even have tried it years ago and are considering trying it again. During different stages in your life, different medications can have different efficacy. Just because a medication does not work at one stage, does not mean it may not give you relief in a new stage of your life.
7 Questions to Ask About Imitrex Side Effects, Risks and Benefits
Most of these medications have different routes of administration, too, so if Imitrex tablets don’t give you relief, another route may just do the trick. It’s important to keep an open mind and ask a few key questions:
1. Am I ready for a prescription Migraine medication?
Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer) and combination analgesics with caffeine (Excedrin) are inexpensive options if they work and provide relief. Even OTC meds like NSAIDs have risks you should understand before popping them.
If over-the-counter pain relievers do not work and your Migraine attacks are moderate to severe, prescription triptans could be for you. Triptans are a good option for those Migraine attacks that disrupt daily activity and can alleviate symptoms that OTC cannot touch. Since their development, triptans are the most common class of drug used to stop Migraine attacks.
2. Do I need an abortive or a preventative?
Imitrex is the brand name for sumatriptan, the first Migraine-specific medication approved in the 1990’s 1. It is not a preventative, but rather an abortive medication that should be taken at first sign of a Migraine attack. Most patients’ Migraine attacks subside within two hours of taking Imitrex.
Most people with Migraine can benefit from a prescription abortive medication like Imitrex. If you have fewer than 15 headache days a month, or episodic Migraine, an abortive may be the only prescription medication you need to manage your Migraine disease. Preventative medications should be considered along with abortives for those with Chronic Migraine, or 15 or more headache days a month.
3. What symptoms are my most troublesome and will Imitrex help them?
Triptans can help alleviate many symptoms of an attack including head pain, nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light.
Essentially, triptans like Imitrex work by reversing the changes in your brain that lead to a Migraine. Triptans act as agonists for serotonin receptors at blood vessels and nerve endings in the brain. Whether you get a severe morning Migraine, a sickening Migraine with nausea, or a hormonal Migraine, Imitrex in its 3 different dosing treatments is specifically designed to provide relief.
4. What kind of Imitrex side effects can I expect?
It is important to note that Imitrex may provide different benefits and side effects for different patients and all of this course, under your doctor’s care. Many patients report side effects like:
Chest pain or tightness
Difficulty swallowing or throat tightness
Dizziness or spinning
Grogginess or sleepiness
Weakness
Body temperature changes or cold hands and feet.
Nausea or vomiting
While these may be unpleasant, many patients find these Imitrex side effects far more tolerable than the pain.
5. What is the best delivery method of Imitrex for the type of attacks I get?
The generic sumatriptan is available in several forms: tablets, nasal sprays, injections, pen injections and as a needleless injection that uses a burst of gas to get the drug under the skin. One of the common Imitrex side effects, nausea and vomiting, makes it difficult to keep tablet medication down long enough to work. The injections and nasal sprays bypass the digestive system and get into the bloodstream to start working fast.
6. Do I need brand name Imitrex or can I get a generic?
Generic drugs including generic Imitrex (sumatriptan) are not exactly the same as the original branded drug in the 90’s, although they are similar and commonly viewed as effective as their branded counterpart. Generic forms of Imitrex are widely used in the United States. Imitrex is a market leader in a class of triptans that are commonly used to treat migraines.
Generic triptans are widely available. For example, Relpax now has its own generic form, Eletriptan. As a Migraine patient, it is wise to vary medication and to be aware of medication overuse. Medication overuse happens when the same medicine you use to treat your headaches or Migraine attacks actually makes things worse. Medication overuse headache is a separate headache diagnosis that is characterized by the use of one medication for 10-15 or more days per month 2. It is a vicious cycle to be caught up in and it happens pretty often.
7. Is it safe for me to take Imitrex?
For most people, Imitrex is considered a safe therapy. However, if you are pregnant, under 18 or have heart problems, read this article on Who Should and Should Not Use Triptans for Migraine Relief first and discuss with your doctor.
The good news for those with coronary risk is that a new class of abortive migraine medications known as ditans are in clinical trials. The first of which is lasmiditan, said to offer many of the same benefits of triptans like Imitrex without the heart-related complications.

A few final notes …
Imitrex should not be the only tool in your arsenal. Migraine requires a detailed management plan, including prevention, a balanced lifestyle, pain relief coping mechanisms, and self-care.
You are your own advocate. Be curious. Get involved in online support communities and trusted Migraine websites so you know what questions to ask when you visit your doctor and pharmacist. If you have not tried Imitrex or the generic sumitriptan since the 90’s it may be time to have an open discussion with your doctor about new delivery methods and which one is right for you.

Migergot suppositories work for me, using less than half of suppository. A little nauseous, but migraine ends.

I have taken Imitrex or Sumatriptan for approximately 30 years. It is the only abortive medication that has ever worked for me, so side effects are worth it. I would probably not have survived without it!

Imitrex works every time for me. It is a miracle drug. I do get a tightness in my chest and very sensitive to hot water for some reason.
