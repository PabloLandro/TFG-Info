6 Amazing Benefits of Magnesium During Pregnancy
Posted on 11 April 2018
Magnesium is a vital mineral that helps you abate various health conditions (especially during pregnancy). For example, it builds, relaxes, and repairs your muscles and tissues. It also reduces leg cramps and even regulates the blood sugar levels of pregnant women. The astounding benefits of magnesium for expecting moms do not simply end here...
In fact, this essential mineral plays a critical role in controlling both fetal and maternal health during pregnancy. In this context, please keep reading and learn 6 amazing benefits of magnesium during pregnancy.
1. Magnesium relaxes muscles
Do you know that magnesium is a potent and powerful relaxation mineral? If any your body is tight, crampy, stiff, or irritable -- then, it could be a symptom of magnesium deficiency. This crucial mineral is responsible for more than three hundred enzyme reactions. It is found almost in all of our tissues (particularly in our muscles, brain, and bones).
You must have a right proportion of magnesium in your cells to generate energy, stabilize membranes, carry out various biochemical reactions inside your body, and relax your core muscles. It is also important for ensuring muscle flexibility. If you do not have enough magnesium, it will result in a buildup of lactic acid, causing tightness, cramps, and pain. Please note, leg cramps are a common problem for expectant mothers. To overcome this issue, please make sure to take an adequate amount of magnesium during pregnancy.
2. Treats headaches
Shortage of magnesium is often linked to migraines and headaches. Magnesium (especially magnesium oxide) is extremely effective at preventing and treating headaches and menstrual-related migraines. The best part is that it's a natural and safe element that does not induce any negative side-effects. If you are suffering from migraines, then you should take a dosage limit of 400-500 mg magnesium oxide per day. Alternatively, magnesium sulfate can be effective for expecting mothers that are encountering the symptoms of a migraine with aura, but always check with your doctor first!
3. Lowers the risk of osteoporosis
In the previous section, we revealed that magnesium is a potent relaxation mineral and offers pain relief from headaches. But, did you know that this mineral can even lower the risk of osteoporosis? Please note, osteoporosis is a condition in which your bones become brittle, weak, and susceptible to fracture. Various research studies have uncovered that women with osteoporosis generally have relatively lower serum magnesium levels. Thus, magnesium deficiency can be a serious risk factor for osteoporosis.
To lower the risk of osteoporosis, it is important to consume naturally occurring sources of magnesium - it can be found in green leafy vegetables, whole grains, seeds, and nuts.
4. Reduces cramps
Muscle cramps are a widespread issue for pregnant women. And adequate magnesium intake is an easy and effective way to treat such muscle cramps. Being a versatile mineral, magnesium can reduce muscle pain, tension, swelling, and inflammation. Furthermore, it promotes healthy nerve function and good muscle tone. This potent mineral is deemed to relieve muscle cramping in many ways. For example, it relaxes your muscles and even increases the absorption of calcium. Apart from that, it keeps your heart steady and healthy, keeps bones strong, and boosts immunity.
5. Prepares your body for delivery
Magnesium during pregnancy is essential. Needless to mention, it provides plenty of benefits and performs different functions during pregnancy. One of the most notable benefits of magnesium is that it prepares your body for labor and delivery. For example, it regulates your blood pressure levels and maintains a balanced blood sugar level in your body. In addition to these benefits, the versatile mineral can even increase your pain tolerance threshold. In this way, it prepares your body for a smooth, seamless, and comfortable delivery.
6. Helps build strong teeth and bones in your baby
Not only do you need magnesium to stave off illness, prevent inflammation, and support many bodily functions, but also you need to be extremely careful about your magnesium intake as it helps build strong teeth and bones in your baby. Research has proved that magnesium is one of the essential nutrients that every child needs. That's primarily because it helps babies to develop strong teeth and bones, as well as a healthy immune system, heart, muscle, and brain.
Magnesium fosters the growth of your fetus, improves fetal circulation, and even ensures better sleep and wake cycles for newborns.
Though getting enough of EVERY essential mineral is vital during pregnancy, it can be difficult to track how you are getting enough of each through your diet. We saw this as a concern among our pregnant readers and created a Prenatal Nutrition Guide + Two-Week Meal Plan that includes grocery lists, over 40 recipes, and check lists to help make sure you are meeting ALL of you and your baby's nutrient needs.
