Achilles tendon injuries
2-minute read
Listen
The Achilles tendon (often simply called the ‘Achilles’) is the thick cord you can feel at the back of your ankle. It attaches the calf muscle to the back of your heel.
You can strain your Achilles, or it can become weak due to a lot of very small tears (which is known as degeneration), or it can tear (which is known as rupture).
If you have a problem with your Achilles, it is a good idea to see your doctor or physiotherapist.
Symptoms of Achilles tendon injuries
If you have injured your Achilles, it might hurt during or after exercise.
You might also feel weakness or stiffness at the back of your heel or have some swelling in the tendon. If you rupture your Achilles, it can feel like a hit to the back of the ankle. You might have trouble walking. If you have pain under the heel, it is usually not an Achilles problem.

Diagnosing an Achilles tendon injury
To diagnose a tendon injury, your doctor or physiotherapist will examine you and ask about your symptoms. An ultrasound or other scan such as an x-ray may be done to help identify the problem, but this is usually not needed.
Treatment of an Achilles tendon injury
If you think you may have hurt your Achilles, see a doctor straight away.
It is a good idea to stop any activity and carry out RICER — Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation and Referral for treatment — for 2 to 3 days.
Painkillers such as paracetamol can help relieve pain, if necessary.
Depending on the nature of your injury, your doctor or physiotherapist may advise you to:
keep your weight off your ankle (such as by using crutches)
do stretching and strengthening exercises
tape your foot and heel
use orthotics (firm inserts placed into a shoe)
If your Achilles is completely torn, surgery may be needed to repair it. This may reduce the chance that it will rupture again.
Some people require a program of rehabilitation that can last for months.
For more information, visit the Sports Medicine Australia website.
Prevention of Achilles tendon injuries
You can help protect your Achilles tendons by:
wearing supportive shoes
warming up and stretching before and after exercise
gradually building up your level of physical activity
resting between workouts
doing exercises that strengthen your calf muscles

Injection treatment for painful Achilles tendons in adults | Cochrane
The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. Painful and stiff Achilles tendons are common overuse injuries in people undertaking sports, such as running, but also occur for other reasons in inactive people. The underlying cause is an imbalance between the damage and repair processes in the tendon. Painful Achilles tendons are often disabling and can take a long time to get better. Many treatments exist for this condition and this review set out to find out whether treatment with an injection, with a variety of agents, decreases pain and allows people to return to their previous activities.

Surgical interventions for treating acute Achilles tendon ruptures | Cochrane
Rupture of the Achilles tendon is common and said to be increasing. It typically occurs in males in their 30s and 40s who play sport intermittently. People present with severe pain in the tendon, at the back of the ankle. Signs include a palpable gap at the rupture site, and marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion (movement so toes point downwards). Options for management include non-surgical interventions (plaster of Paris, bracing or splinting) or surgical repair of the tendon. Following either method of treatment, the ankle may be immobilised for up to 12 weeks (in a cast, allowing no movement at the ankle and variable weight-bearing), or mobilised early (in a brace, allowing movement at the ankle and partial to full weight-bearing).

Non-removable pressure-relieving interventions help to heal foot ulcers in people with diabetes | Cochrane
Foot ulceration is a complication of diabetes and can lead to amputation. Ulcers can occur due, in part, to abnormal pressures on the sole of the foot. The studies included in this review compared non-removable pressure-relieving interventions (foot casts) with other ways of relieving pressure on the ulcer site to improve healing. The comparisons included dressings alone, temporary therapeutic shoes, removable pressure-relieving devices and surgical intervention. The review found that the non-removable interventions were more effective than any of the other external pressure-relieving methods. Non-removable casts used with Achilles tendon lengthening were more successful in one forefoot ulcer study than using a non-removable cast alone.

Platelet-rich therapies for musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries | Cochrane
Muscle, ligament and tendon injuries frequently occur during activities such as sports, and may be due to tissue degeneration. These injuries are more frequent in particular parts of the body, such as the tendons located in the shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle.
