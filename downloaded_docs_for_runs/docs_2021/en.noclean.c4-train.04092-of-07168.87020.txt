Treatment For Ovarian Cyst: Deciding On A Treatment
Ovarian cysts, while usually harmless, can cause ovarian cancer. As one of the leading causes of death among women of all ages, this is a subject that should not be taken lightly. The functional cysts are the most common and are usually harmless, whereas the follicular and luteum cysts can cause ovarian cancer. There are a few treatments that are most often turned to shrink and eliminate ovarian cysts.
When treatment for ovarian cyst must be found, the first that most doctors suggest is the birth control pill. There are a few treatment options available, one being the birth control pill. Birth control pills are often enough to get rid of ovarian cysts, by tricking the body into thinking it’s pregnant. This is the treatment most often chosen for functional cysts that are growing quite large.
For larger cysts that are noncancerous, a cystectomy is often required. A cystectomy is often the treatment used in more serious cases, and is a surgery in which the actual cyst is removed. The benefit of a cystectomy is that after the procedure the woman is still able to have children, which is not the case with an oophorectomy. For the worst-case scenarios an oophorectomy is often necessary, a surgery in which one or both of the ovaries will be removed.
Doctors try to hold off on performing this surgery as long as possible, because it means that the woman would no longer be able to have children. Hormone replacement therapy is often prescribed after the procedure, which can be problematic because it’s been linked with the development of ovarian cysts in post menopausal women. This is known as an oophorectomy surgery, in which either one or both of the ovaries are removed. Women need to be educated and willing to work with their doctor to find the best treatment for ovarian cyst.
Women also must remember that even if their treatment is completely successful, cysts can still return. One of the most important things a woman can do for her health is get in to see her doctor for regular pelvic exams. This is the only way to keep an eye on the ovaries and ensure that they’re healthy with no malignant cyst growth. Ovarian cysts are never easy to deal with but at least we are aware of the different treatments that are available today and how successful they can be.
