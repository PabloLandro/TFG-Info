LEMON CORIANDER RICE N MIXED HERBED GRILLED FISH
Its a new morning and I am still alive. The scenario was little different last night. I got a fresh Rui / Bengal Carp this week and I had to cook it yesterday evening. There is nothing wrong in doing so.... what went wrong was the timing. IPL Tournament is starting, yesterday night was its inaugural programme.... and if Ravi Shastri is the comparer, fish bone has to stuck. I have a teen son, who is not so much of a Bengali though he has come out of my womb. The chicken-o-manic teen does like fish only when boneless pieces of fish are made into kebabs or an oriental dish of sweet and sour fish. So, when his typical Bengali mother prepares a fish curry the authentic Bengali way, she has to sit and remove all bones from the fish before serving him.The father shouts.... the mumma is spoiling her son. I know if I do not de bone it for him, he will not take a single bite. The mumma has serious doubts whether the son would choose a Bengali life partner or not. In future she might get such calls.... mumma... we had grilled fish on a bed of greens with a tartar dip. No wonder the mumma is spending sleepless nights thinking whom to give away her bundle of saris. Such nightmares does not stop her from buying them either. No point overthinking, not everyone will be like my beautiful friend Bianca Castafiore who lovingly does a red, hot prawn curry or at times kebabs just as perfect as another beautiful Saira Banu.
Coming to fish bones, I do not have any bone of contention with fish or mutton as any other "Bong-o-Lolona".... Bengali girl. I did prepare a very authentic Bengali fish curry yesterday to be shared later. So far 'the bone got stuck' is concerned, Ravi Shastri is to be blamed. He took me back to his Bombay Dyeing modelling days, we were teens then. A big piece of bone did stuck on my throat, if this happens to you? Do not worry, just gobble a table spoon of cooked rice and do not chew or drink water. However, these men steal all my attention.... from Ravi Shastri, Imran Khan, Wasim Akram to the blue eyed David Gower.... end of the day I do take care of my men's likes and dislikes. Today I felt like sharing a combo dish of mixed herbed grilled fish served with lemon coriander rice, a 'no sweat in the kitchen' kind of dish my men loves. Though the salad part is for me to be shared with Cristine, I have stopped expecting my naughty chopsticks duo to have salads. The duo's 'we do not care anyone in the world' is a major reason of my sugar level treading upwards. We do not get everything as we wish to, there definitely are a number of unacceptable traits in me that the duo have accepted and they do not complain. So, I happily cook what they prefer alongside my preferred, authentic Bengali dishes. Come let us prepare the grilled fish and the lemon coriander rice together which takes an hour or so.
For the Lemon Coriander Rice, I have drawn inspiration from the Cilantro Rice recipe of Add a Pinch Blog and gave it an Indian touch.
INGREDIENTS : [for the lemon coriander rice]
Cooked Rice : 3-4 big cups
Lemon Juice : 1/4 medium cup
Chopped Coriander Leaves : 1 small cup
Chopped Green Chillies :2-3
Turmeric Powder : 1/2 tsp
Salt : As Required
Mustard Seed : 1/2tsp
Oil : 2-3 tbsp
INGREDIENTS : [for the mixed herbed grilled fish]
Fish Fillet : 4-6 pieces [any white firm fish will do]
Mixed Dried Herbs : 1tbsp [I use the Fun Food one]
Salt : As Required
Vinegar : 1tbsp
Butter : 2tbsp [melted]
Black Pepper Powder : 1tsp
METHOD :
Wash and marinate the fish fillets with the vinegar for half an hour. Through away the excess vinegar water. Marinate the fish again with salt, mixed dried herbs, black pepper powder and melted butter. Arrange them on a baking tray and place atop a grill tool. Pour the remaining marinade on top of the marinated fish fillets.
Since I do not have a griller, all my grills and bakes are done in the convection mode of my microwave.
I grilled one side for 12-14 minuted, flipped over and did the other side for 8-9 minutes. It was done.
Now we would prepare the Lemon Coriander Rice.
Take out the refrigerated cooked rice 15 minutes before cooking. Heat oil in a pan. Temper with mustard seeds and add the turmeric powder and chopped green chillies. Stir at low heat once.
Add the rice and fold in well. Increase heat, add salt, lemon juice and chopped fresh coriander leaves. Fold in very well and keep stirring for a minute or two. It is done.
Transfer to serving plates, arrange the mixed herbed grilled fish along with your preferred salad and enjoy hot and fresh!!
