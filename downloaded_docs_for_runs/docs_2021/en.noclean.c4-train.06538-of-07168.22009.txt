The dimpled silicone Achilles insert provides protection and a massage effect over the tendon that helps reduce pain. The elastic, anatomical knit provides a precise fit and compression for targeted support around the malleoli ankle bones. Three inserts in 1/2", 5/16", and 1/5" are included to customize the needed heel height for optimal relief. Pull tabs at the top of the support make this Achilles tendon brace easy to apply and remove after use.
