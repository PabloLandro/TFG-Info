Can I bathe my baby if he has a fever?
My baby has a fever and I'm wondering if it's okay to bathe him while he has a fever or should I wait until the babies fever has gone away before bathing him?

Yes you can give your baby a lukewarm bath or sponge bath when your baby has a fever.
Also giving your baby a bath while he/she has a fever may also help reduce the babies fever and make him/her feel better.
Bathing a baby or child with a fever was very common as a way of reducing fevers before fever reducing medicine became available.
