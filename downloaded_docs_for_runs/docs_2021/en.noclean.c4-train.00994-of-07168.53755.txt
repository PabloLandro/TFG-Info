L-Theanine has a relaxing effect. One of the reasons it is found in green tea for example. Originally L-Theanine is used by patients suffering Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
In people with healthy brains L-Theanine can benefit the increase in dopamine and serotonin levels, both of which are responsible for general well being and good mood.
Stacking with caffeine can benefit memory, enhance focus, increase motivation and cause a better mood.

Stacking
To achieve better results, L-Theanine can be taken alongside caffeine. When taking both L-Theanine and caffeine together, a ration of 2:1 (200mg L-Theanine and 100mg caffeine) is generally recommended. However this is not the case for people that are anxious.
Side-Effects
L-Theanine generally has little to no side effects. In combination with caffeine it can however cause minor side-effects such as headache, dizziness and stomach distress.
Attention
As with any supplement, people with medical conditions, especially heart conditions, should take L-Theanine with great care and consult a doctor prior consumption.
