Vitamin D supplements offer protection for asthma patients
According to a recent review of existing studies Vitamin D may make asthma less dangerous. The researchers led by Professor Adrian Martineau from Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research at Queen Mary University of London write that previous research has linked low blood levels of Vitamin D to a heightened risk of asthma attacks. The researchers, part of Cochrane, analyzed data from nine studies lasting from six to twelve months that included children and adults. Those who took Vitamin D supplements cut the incidence of asthma attacks severe enough to require hospitalization in half, from 6% of all attacks down to 3% in Vitamin D users. Also, the use of Vitamin D supplements was safe. The supplements did not improve lung function nor everyday symptoms but reduced the need for steroid drugs (and kept people out of emergency rooms). Steroid drugs are used to reduce inflammation in the lungs.
Note: Cochrane is a global independent network of researchers, professionals, patients, and people interested in health. Their contributors are leaders in their fields - medicine, health policy, research methodology, or consumer advocacy - and groups are often situated in well respected academic and medical institutions. With 37,000 contributors from 130 countries, Cochrane groups systematically review evidence from randomized controlled trials combining the results for a greater level of evidence for the use of drugs, medical procedures, surgeries, diets, nutritional supplements and other health-care interventions and diagnostic tests. The results of the reviews are then published in the Cochrane Library.
