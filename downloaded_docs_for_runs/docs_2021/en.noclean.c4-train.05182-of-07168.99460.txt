Can depression result in anxiety?
Anxiety disorders and depression are separate conditions. However, some people who have depression have said that they often have similar symptoms to those associated with an anxiety disorder. Keep in mind that each disorder has its own symptoms and causes.
There are a number of different kinds of anxiety disorders, just as there are a number of different forms or types of depression. However, symptoms that are experienced in both can be:
Irritability
Sleeping issues
Issues with concentrating
Nervousness
Therefore, anxiety and depression are often seen as the fraternal twins of mood conditions and disorders. It is possible to suffer from depression and anxiety at the same time. Anxiety will typically come first and can then lead to the development of depression.
What is a depressive disorder?
Having a depressive disorder is more than simply feeling down, it involves having feelings of worthlessness and sadness that are persistent. A depressive disorder is also known as clinical depression, major depression, and in some cases, refers to another mood disorder, the most common being bipolar disorder.
Can depression result in mental confusion?
Anxiety, stress or depression can often result in confusion, forgetfulness, memory issues, difficulty concentrating, as well as a number of other issues that interfere with daily activities. In some cases, the medication used to treat depression can result in mental confusion.
Can depression result in memory loss?
Memory problems have been linked to depression, as mentioned above, these include confusion and forgetfulness. These can cause difficulties in trying to focus at work, completing tasks, thinking clearly or making decisions. Depression has been associated with memory loss that is short-term, but as stated, this may also be a result of certain medications.
How does exercise help with the symptoms of depression?
Getting regular exercise will help ease depression as exercising allows for the brain to release certain chemicals that can boost the mood of the person concerned. The main chemicals released during exercise are endorphins. The effect of these can be felt for a number of hours after exercising and when physical exercise is done on a regular basis, this can help depression sufferers to see positive results in their condition and a significant ease of their symptoms. Exercise also helps the body release any agitation or irritation and can help alleviate stress.
What does a low mood mean?
To be sad and have a low mood, which means to feel down or unhappy for some reason, are absolutely normal emotions to go through from time to time. However, it can be seen as a cause for concern when this low mood is persistent and does not go away, this is normally the first sign of depression. When a low mood lasts for longer than two weeks, it is best to get professional help and allow for a trained healthcare professional to diagnose the issue. There is often an underlying cause, for example, the death of a loved one may result in a low mood for a number of weeks, it is when this mood impacts the functioning ability of the person’s daily life that help must be sought.
Is major depressive disorder the same as bipolar disorder?
Bipolar disorder is known as a type of specifier of major depressive disorder. Bipolar was previously known as manic-depressive illness and is characterised by severe ups and downs of one’s mood, going through severe mania (being elated and unusually happy), followed by an episode of depression (feeling sad and unhappy). There are also periods of a normal mood in between. Depression consists of a prominent low mood without the episodes of mania.
Is there a cure for clinical depression?
Clinical or major depression is a severe and serious condition, but it is treatable. The treatment of the condition is dependent on the symptoms the patient is experiencing as well as upon the doctor or mental healthcare professional prescribing the medication and creating the treatment plan.
Through various means of treatment such as talk therapy, which allows for the patient to voice their feelings and emotions and learn how to cope with them, as well as the administration of antidepressants, many patients have stated that they have noticed a significant improvement in their symptoms. In this regard, there is a cure for depression. However, some patients never seek professional diagnosis and treatment and the results can often be fatal as the patient may attempt or commit suicide.
