16 Natural Home Remedies for Children

Natural Home Remedies for Little Children
My husband is the oldest of 12 children. He and his siblings were home schooled. Their mother fed them very natural diets before it was popular because she used what she had access to. Her husband was a bee keeper, so they used Honey a lot. One of her 6 daughters name is Honey! She also uses natural healing remedies. I am the youngest of 8 children and could not have been raised more differently. I am learning a lot from her and I would like to share her secrets with you!
Be sure to pin this on your ‚Äúhealth‚Äù pin board so you can come back to it for reference often.
Acne:
Remedy #1: Combine a tablespoon of wheat germ oil with a tablespoon of honey and apply as a mask for fifteen minutes. Wash off with warm water and a soft cloth.
Remedy #2: Natural Clay Masks can be purchased at stores. Clay will pull dirt and oil out of the skin leaving your skin healthy and clean.
Anxiety:
Remedy #1: Massaging, pulling, pressing and tapping the hands inhibits the transmission of nerve impulses through the body and lessens reactions to stress. Use this finger pressure technique next time emotions rise: The Tchong-Tchrong point is on the top side of the hand at the bottom of the middle nail on the side nearest the index finger. The Chen-Menn point to free up anxiety is on the palm side, just above the wrist under the line of the fourth finger. Gently rub or press on either of these points when you or your child feels tense.
Bruises:
Remedy #1: Wash the bruised area with warm water and a mild soap. Apply ice wrapped in a cloth. Ice stops the internal bleeding and reduces inflammation. Apply ice ten to twenty minutes of every hour for the first twenty-four hours after an injury. NEVER use heat in the first twenty-four hours.
Remedy #2: Grind caraway seed and add enough water to make a paste if it‚Äôs too dry. Apply the paste directly or in a cloth to a bruise. It should take away the black and blue spots of bruises
Remedy #3: Dip a cloth into Apple Cider Vinegar directly to the bruise.
Burns: (Some of these remedies are good for sunburns too!)
Remedy #1: Immerse injured part into ice water or apply clean, ice cloths to the burn. Use this method as long as tolerable. Do not place ice directly on the skin. It can damage skin cells.
Remedy #2: Break off a leaf of Aloe, slit it open and dribble the aloe juice on the burn. Aloe juice heals the skin and prevents scarring. This is also very useful on Sun Burns too!
Remedy #3: Sunburns: Add two or more cups of Apple Cider Vinegar to a bath and soak in it. Alternately you can add a half a pound of cornstarch to a tub of water for a nice healing bath.
Remedy #4: Cut a potato in half and place directly on the burn. The redness will be gone in thirty minutes or so, and it should prevent blistering.
Remedy #5: Soak a cloth in milk and apply to the burn.
Cavities:
Remedy #1: Roast or cook a small piece of Ginger. Shape the ginger to fit over the troubled tooth. Bite down on the ginger for as long as possible. Let the saliva flow through the mouth and marinate the tooth. Relief often follows immediately!
Colds:
Remedy #1: Ginger is also a natural remedy for colds and upset stomachs. Even ginger snaps can help sooth a stomach.
Remedy #2: This may sound strange, but to keep a nose from running, tie a fat rubberband around one thumb joint at a time. Leave it on for no more than fifteen minutes. Take off the rubber band if it hurts or the area becomes purplish. Repeat again and again until the nose stops its dripping. An ears, nose and throat specialist discovered this!
Remedy #3: Settlers from the Scandinavian countries have introduced us to a method passed down from generation to generation. At the first sign of a cold, ice the two big toes. Let me know if you try this and if it works üôÇ
Remedy #4: Mustard has been used for centuries to cure the cold. Lightly rub olive oil on the heels of each foot. Combine one tablespoon powdered mustard (found in the condiment isle) with three tablespoons flour and a half a tablespoon of tepid water. The paste should not be loose or runny. Apply it directly to the heel where the olive oil is (the olive oil keeps the skin from being burned by the mustard). after applying the mustard, wrap a flannel cloth around each food to keep in the heat. Put on wool socks. Wash off immediately of the heat is not tolerable. Keep it on for one to two hours then try to take a nap. This method can also be used as a mustard hot foot bath‚Ä¶.
Remedy #5: Run hot water into a large pan or use the tub. Add two tablespoons of mustard powder and soak your feet for about 5 minutes. Wipe your feet and try to take a nap.
Remedy #6: For mucus Native Americans have taught us this trick. Make a tea using pumpkin seeds by placing 20 or so seeds in 2 cups of water. Strain and drink as needed.
Remedy #7: Garlic, Peppermint Tea and Catnip can also help.
Constipation:
Remedy #1: Drink two glasses of cold water every morning to help stimulate the digestive system. And then eat steel-cut oats.
Remedy #2: Eat figs.
Remedy #3: Each morning drink a glass of cold water with honey in it. First add the honey to some warm water to dissolve it, then add the cold water.
Cough:
Remedy #1: Take a teaspoon of honey
Remedy #2: Make a hole inside an apple or pear, fill it with honey and bake until soft. Mash and eat.
Remedy #3: Make a mustard paste and apply to chest and back. Make sure you rub the skin with olive oil first and use the paste in a handkerchief. Do not apply directly to skin.
Cuts and Wounds:
Remedy #1: Aloe. Simple. Apply to the wound, cover with a clean bandage.
Remedy #2: Basil leaves are placed on the wound to help it to stop bleeding, then cover with a clean bandage.
Diarrhea:
Remedy #1: Remember BRAT. Bread, Rice, Applesauce and Toast.
Remedy #2: Chinese Acupressure tells us to press firmly at the web between the pointer finger and the thumb until you touch the bone. Do not use this if you are pregnant. It can make your uterus contract.
Ear Infections:
Remedy #1: A few drops of garlic oil in the ear then keep the ears warm with ear muffs or a scarf.
Remedy #2: For swimmers ear: Combine equal amounts of apple cider vinegar and rubbing alcohol in a small jar. Dip a cotton swab into the mixture and carefully dab the outside of the canal. Then tilt your head with the aching side up and let the mixture work its way into the ear canal. It will help the water evaporate and prevent itching.
Hiccups:
Remedy #1: A spoonful of sugar. Not kidding!
Insect Bites:
Remedy #1: Cut a slice of onion and place it on the bit until the sting goes away.
Remedy #2: Make a mud paste and slather it on the bite and let it dry. It will pull out the toxins like the onion does.
Nausea:
Remedy #1: Ginger. I like to give my kids ginger snaps üôÇ
Remedy #2: Peppermint. Usually given to them in candy form, put if they will drink the tea, that would be better.
Rashes:
Remedy #1: Cooked and slightly cooled oatmeal applied to skin.
Remedy #2: Wash and peel cucumber. Slice it and place it directly on the rash.
Sore Throats:
Remedy #1: Do as the Hawaiians do. Make a ginger tea for one cup. Add 1/4 teaspoon honey and juice a lemon. Cool and gargle. Then gargle pineapple juice. Discard. Repeat as needed throughout the day.
Remedy #2: My mother in law swears by cayenne pepper. If your child is old enough to talk into taking it. It will help! Add a pinch of pepper to a glass of water and gargle vigorously.
There you have it! I would love to know if you use any of these remedies and if they worked for you. Here‚Äôs to good health!
