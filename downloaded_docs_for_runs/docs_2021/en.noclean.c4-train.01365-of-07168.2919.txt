Living in the Great White North means sometimes you have to deal with the Winter blues.

And sometimes those winter blues are more than just the snow getting you down. Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as SAD, is a mental illness that occurs in the winter when our Vitamin D intake is low. The deficiency results in a chemical imbalance that throws off our circadian rhythm and can cause depression, tiredness, anxiety, and other damaging symptoms.

During the non-winter months, the sun provides enough Vitamin D to keep us energized and happy, in the winter we have to rely on other sources.
Enter light therapy lamps.
These modern inventions replicate the natural sunlight and helpful UV rays that deliver Vitamin D through our skin.

Seller: Verilux
Cost: $59.99
Promising Review:
“Many, many friends had to recommend this to me before I finally bought one to try. I did not expect it to work, but now I’m hooked! I wake up earlier every morning just to use it, and since day 1 there has been an immediate definite difference. I am really happy with this product and have been recommending it to everyone I know who also suffers from SAD.”

2. Verilux VT10WW1 HappyLight Liberty Compact Light Therapy Lamp
Seller: Verilux
Cost: $49.99
Promising Review:
“I bought it for my 15-year-old cat. She had been very ill and I added light to her environment along with a 15-minute cuddle every morning before I went to work. She recovered almost 100% – in fact, I think she is on her 2nd of 9 lives … fortunately for me.”

3. TaoTronics Light Therapy Lamp, 10000 Lux
Seller: TaoTronics
Cost: $49.99
Promising Review:
“I was prescribed a light to help with depression. I ordered this lamp based mainly on the positive reviews, and I must agree! It certainly works and the timer and different brightnesses are great! But what I most like is the customer service – I received my lamp very quickly but it sounded like something was broken inside. It worked and I used it but I did contact Customer Service. They responded very quickly and said a new lamp was on its way and told me to just keep the first lamp. The 2nd lamp arrived within 2 days and is fine. Great lamp & great service!”

4. FITFIRST Portable Light Therapy Energy Lamp, Daylight Full Spectrum Light Lamp
Seller: FITFIRST
Cost: $69.99
Promising Review:
“I have only had this amazing light for a few days and I have already feel my mood enhancing! Living in Canada our days are long and dreary in the long winters we have. I have hashimoto disease and I feel the effects of low vitamin D. This light is super easy to use and it has a timer so I can’t accidentally leave the light on when I’m done. I can’t wait to see how I feel in February that’s when the depression really kicks in!”

5. Circadian Optics Lumine Light Therapy Lamp
Seller: Circadian Optics
Cost: $89.99
Promising Review:
“I bought it to fight the winter blues, I never had any expectation but I wanted to give it a try. I’m seriously surprised how fast it worked on me in only one week (20min daily exposure in the night to prolong the daylight). I have it lightning my face right now and I don’t want to turn it off because of how good I feel. I highly recommend it to anyone living in a northern country!”

6. Circadian Optics Lumos 2.0 Light Therapy Lamp
Seller: Circadian Optics
Cost: $99.99
Promising Review:
“Works exactly as described. I love the small form factor of this light compared to others. I love that it can sit in different positions with the adjustable base. I like that it has 3 light settings. I have been using it for an hour every morning for a few weeks and already notice a measurable difference in my moods. Highly recommended.”

I would recommend this light to anyone with depression, anxiety, or SAD.”
