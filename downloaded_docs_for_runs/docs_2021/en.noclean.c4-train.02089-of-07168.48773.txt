Top Six Powerful Light Therapy Devices & How to Use for the Best Effects
February 10, 2018 / yumi2110 / 1 Comment
Using light therapy devices is a method of treating seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and a number of other conditions. This is usually achieved by exposure to artificial light. Seasonal Affective Disorder is a kind of depression that happens at a particular time of every year and this is often in the winter or fall.
Usually, this would be as a result of sitting at home a lot to work or to do anything else.
In the process of light therapy, you usually have to work or sit near a device known as a light therapy box. This box lets off bright light that replicates the natural light we have outdoor.
Light therapy is believed to have effects on the brain chemicals which are connected to mood and sleep. This will in turn, improve the symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Using a light therapy box could also help with a number of other types of depression, sleep disorders as well as other conditions. Light therapy is also called phototherapy or bright light therapy.

How Does Light Therapy Device Work?
On a general note, light is an essential part of life. As a matter of fact, we need light for life to flourish. With most of us spending time indoors either watching TV or working or doing any other indoor activity, contacting the essential natural light becomes tough. This may result in fatigue, anxiousness or lethargy. Light therapy is what is used to deal with this situation and this is how it works;
Light therapy devices normally come with lux. This is the unit which measure the intensity of light . Lighting indoors is usually less than 500 lux in the summer and spring. On the other hand, the lux outside could be up to 10,000 in the summer and in spring.
In the winter, it is tough to get that much light. With lights of up to 10000 lux, you can go through the light therapy and find the energy you need to get on with your life. All you need do is get a 10000 lux light for up to twenty or thirty minutes a day.
When your eyes get up to 10,000 Lux of bright light your brain receives signals. These signals are sent to it to regulate levels of melatonin and serotonin in your body. This light has to shine in your eyes so you should glance at it from time to time. However, you should not stare at it consistently. It is also important to keep regular hours of sleep and do frequent outdoor exercises to get the best effects.
How to Use Light Therapy Device for the Best Effects
There are number of things that are important for you you to do (or not do). These will help you get the best out of light therapy. Here are some of those things;
Do not use a normal lamp
Use light boxes that are designed for Bright Light Therapy. This will ensure that the light box emits up to 10,000 lux. That is up to twenty times the strength of normal indoor lighting. If you have a lamp which does not have up to 10000 lux, you might have to use the lamp for longer periods of time. This will ensure that you achieve the same effects.
Your light box should provide the full spectrum of bright white light which you need. It should also keep out ultraviolet rays which can be harmful to you.
Place the box at the level of your eye or higher than that
The position and distance of your light box from the position of your eyes has an important role to play. The light box should replicate the natural light which is outdoors.
Let the light box be a distance of two feet away from your eye.
If your light box provides up to 10,000 lux light, you should sit about 2 feet away from the box. If your light box is weaker than 10000 lux, you should sit closer to the light to achieve good results.
At about 2 o’clock or 10 o’clock, keep the light box at an angle to the right or to the left.
At this time, recommend you that avoid putting the light right in front of your eyes. Instead of doing that, place the light about 45 degrees to the right or left from your eyes or your mid-line.
Depending on your personal needs, use the light box in the morning for 20 to 60 minutes.
Start by using the light box for 20 to 30 minutes every morning. This is to find out if that will help to boost your energy as well as your mood. If this does not result in any significant changes, try doing this for longer periods of time. They recommend the time is sixty minutes every morning.
Try to consistently use the light box every day from early fall to winter.
Using the light box daily is more likely to produce better results, boosting your mood and your energy. If you get the winter blues, you should begin your light box therapy from early fall. Also make sure to use the light box each morning. If you only get to use the light box a few times in the week, it will not be as effective and will produce lesser results.
Avoid using the light therapy if you are on photosensitive medications
Photosensitive medications will make your skin become sensitive to light. This will lead to changes in your skin that can have the unpleasant look of a rash or a sunburn. These medications include melatonin, lithium, some antibiotics and some acne medications like isotretinoin.
Keep tabs on your mood to see if the therapy is working.
After about one to two weeks of using your light box, you should begin to notice positive changes in your mood and in your energy levels. Sometimes, you could experience these changes even more quickly.
Combine the light therapy with other approaches you know are effective for seasonal depression.
You can combine Bright Light Therapy with other approaches to help get rid of your seasonal depression. You can use approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy about two times a week. Also, spending more time outdoors doing exercises, yoga and mindfulness could be very helpful.
It is important to note that talking to your doctor before trying bright light therapy is the safe thing to do. This is because sometimes, bad reactions can occur. These reactions include hypomania, suicidal thoughts, excess energy and lack of sleep could actually occur in the first few days.
