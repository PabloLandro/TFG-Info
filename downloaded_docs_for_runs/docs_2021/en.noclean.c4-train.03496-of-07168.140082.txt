List of the best scar removal creams
1. NewGel+E Scar gel cream
Sale
184 Reviews
NewGel+ Advanced Silicone Gel
Works on all types of scars
Helps reduce and fade scars
Safe for facials scars
Results can be observed after a short period of application
Buy on Amazon
NewGel+E is one of the top-rated gels for scars. The great reputation of this scar recovery gel is due to the clinically proven ingredients it contains. Something that distinguishes this scar gel is the fact that it is suitable for the treatment of multiple scar formations, varying in type, size, and shape.
Both newly formed and older scars can be successfully treated in a fairly short period of time.
According to most patients, who tried this scar removal formula, the simple ingredients list, combining medical-grade silicone (also known as polysiloxanes) and tocopherol (a type of vitamin E) make NewGel+E way more effective and safe, compared to other scar removal creams. Often, such formulas contain more than 50 ingredients, some of which have a proven negative effect on the skin surface – they may either contain irritants or harmful preservatives and these won’t help the scarring recover faster.
Medical-grade silicone is used to keep the skin well moisturized, by creating a hydrating barrier on it’s surface, while promotes the scar healing process.
Tocopherol, on the other hand, provides a strong antioxidant effect and helps the affected scar tissue regenerate quickly.
Scar patients who shared their progress with NewGel+ are generally satisfied with their results:
A 37 years old man who got severely injured during an equipment accident. He did not say whether the product is effective or not; he just attached before and after pictures, showing an impressive improvement after using NewGelPlus for a couple of weeks (a huge, probably infected wound transforms into a small, barely visible scar)
Below you can see the improvement of a man who undergone severe cervical neck surgery:
This is why NewGel+ is rated number one in our scar removal creams list.
Pros
Silicone scar treatment is the most popular among dermatologists and plastic surgeons
NewGel Plus is clinically proven to work (visible improvement in patients of different age groups)
Effective on newly formed and older scars
3 months are enough to completely erase or significantly improve the scarring
Patients say NewGel is absorbed quickly, without leaving a greasy residue
Cons
NewGel can be used once the wound has completely healed
This is not the cheapest scar removal option
Approximately 10% of all patients who religiously applied saw no improvement after prolonged application of NewGel+

A young woman who applied the cream to her facial scars (following severe acne) is also very happy with her improvement:
I’m so happy with the results and can’t wait to see the effects after several months use.
The below pictures show the impressive improvement after a deep cut on the cheek. Two months of Puriderma application, only once a day made the scar lighter, less visible, well moisturized and, above all, no longer inflamed:

2,906 Reviews
Mederma Advanced Scar Removal Cream
Affordable scar management option
Promotes the skin cell renewal
Improves the appearance, texture, and color of existing scars
Buy on Amazon
If you are trying to find something unpretentious, yet effective, Mederma Advanced Scar Cream is the most suitable option for you. The active ingredient in the formula is Allantoin [1], which is proven to improve the appearance of scars and fasten the process of skin regeneration.
Even though a prolonged application may be needed, almost all patients report having a positive effect of the treatment with this scar removal cream.
What is more, Mederma seems to be effective on scars that are years old:
It even worked on some very old scars. The key is to use it consistently. It doesn’t work overnight, but over time it does.
As expected, newer scars tend to improve their color and texture faster (you can start applying the product once the wound has completely healed).
People are generally happy with this product – it is one of the cheapest scar removal creams, providing multiple beneficial effects (tested and proven to improve the overall appearance, color, and texture of scar tissue).
However, most patients expect visible improvements within the first days of application but the truth is that the healing process requires persistence and regular application.
The effects people try to obtain may come after weeks, even months of treatment with this scar removal cream.
Here’s the progress of a young woman, suffering acne scars. She reports that Mederma worked on both the new and old scars and it successfully reduced the hyperpigmentation associated:
The next progress pictures are scabs on the legs, treated with Mederma Cream for only a month and a half, once a day:
I’ve been doing it every single day at bedtime.
It seems that Mederma Cream is quite effective on burn scars as well:
The picture on the left is my scar on day 7. The skin started peeling off at this point. The picture on the right is day 12.

Scarless MD before and after surgery
Which would you choose – a scar removal cream that is developed by a plastic surgeon and a dermatologist or a clinically proven one?
Because you can have both. We tend to have higher expectations for scar removal creams, created by professionals in the field when it comes to the largest organ in our bodies, the skin.

Visible results may be observed within the first month of application
Scarless MD is proven to reduce redness and thickness over the course of scar maturation
Scarless MD provides beneficial results for the management of surgical scars, C-sections, cuts and burns
Patients report impressively satisfying results
Scarless MD is one of the most effective scar removal creams. Unfortunately, the price aspect is disturbing, according to those, who are interested in this scar removal cream. The formula is relatively expensive, as it contains high-quality ingredients, while it will be enough for a prolonged period of time.
Thankfully, after trying Scarless MD, most patients believe the money spent correspond to the positive effect of the treatment:
The results are amazing and the scar removal cream is not greasy or slimy at all. I will continue using it until it is finished as the results are visible on a nearly daily basis. I recommend this ScarlessMD to anyone looking for an effective scar removal cream!

Improves the appearance of all types of scar formations (surgical, acne and traumatic scars)

Too pricey, compared to similar scar removal creams

Defining the potential effect of this treatment method is almost impossible for the time being, as the number of people who tried NewGel+ Strips is insignificantly low.
An important characteristic of this method is that it uses medical grade silicone, which has already been evaluated and proven effective during multiple clinical trials.
Reddit users who have used the strips after undergoing surgical procedures appear to be satisfied with the effect of their treatment:

But let’s be realistic here – those few patients who decided to leave a review on the Online retailer’s website they do not seem impressed with their results.

People are complaining that the silicone strips won’t stay on:
Strips are too thick. Won’t adhere to clean, non oily skin, fall off and get lost.

Which is the most potent scar cream for surgical scars?
Surgeries are a common prerequisite for the formation of scars. This rule even applies to plastic surgeries, regardless of the surgeon’s skills. There are certain factors that define whether scarring will form or not. Such include the severity of your scar, the overall condition of your skin, your personal habits etc.
Following the postoperative instructions and recommendations given by the surgeon are the also important prerequisite for the rapid healing and recovery of the skin after an operative intervention.
The next step is the application of anti-scar topical medicines. They are a must in case you would like to reduce the chances of scar formation.
Which scar removal cream is good for old scars?
Old scars are problems for those expecting miracles. The simple truth: old scars require more persistence and patience, while you’ll have to accept the fact that they won’t recover completely.
There are multiple expensive treatments and procedures (such as various ointments, scar removal creams, chemical peels, laser scar procedure etc) aiming to improve the damaged skin. Some of them usually cost more than the average patient can afford.
Which scar removal creams to choose for facial scars
Your face requires more specialized care. Facial skin is usually thinner, more sensitive, more vulnerable and prone to infections.
Your daily skin care routine should take place twice a day – in the morning and in the evening. The specific measures vary depending on the time of the day, the specific needs and condition of your skin.
In case you have a scarring on the face, you should be extremely careful before selecting a scar removal cream. Most formulas contain ingredients, which may lead to irritation, redness or increased sensitivity. The facial skin is more prone to infections, this is why you need to find the most suitable options for you.
A good scar removal cream for the face should be clinically tested, proven safe and specially designed for the facial area:

Good scar removal creams for Burns
Scars after skin burns are formed when the tissue is damaged by high temperature or chemical substances and is replaced by connective tissue.
Usually, burn scars are red at first, then, a process of lightening or pigmentation begins. Unfortunately, there are no chances for complete recovery when it comes to deep burns.
Source: openi.nlm.nih.gov
The main issues associated with burn scars are as follows:
Redness – can continue for months or years;
Pain, itching, tingling, pressure, hypersensitivity or temperature changes;
Pigment changes – alternations of brownish, reddish and discolored areas;
The treatment of scars after skin burns is difficult, prolonged and sometimes disappointing because there is no universal therapy to solve the problem completely. However, there are several scar removal creams, providing positive results in the treatment of scarring, caused by skin burns.
Frequently asked questions
What are the active ingredients that make an effective scar removal cream?
The ingredients in a particular scar cream, their quantities, qualities, and their eventual interactions are the main determinative factors for its’ efficacy. When it comes to the best scar removal cream, the following ingredients are often available in the content (in different concentrations):
Allium Cepa Bulb Extract – or Onion – proven to promote the healing of stretch marks and scars; generally beneficial for the skin; promotes cell recovery
Dimethicone – widely used in cosmetics due to its beneficial properties when applied to the dry, cracked skin; a strong moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, itchy skin and minor skin irritations; it may, however, provoke dryness or slight irritation
Silicone – an ingredient, preventing water loss by forming a hydrating barrier on the skin; it is widely used in cosmetics due to its beneficial properties when applied to the skin; non-toxic and no-irritating ingredient; does not absorb into the skin
Glycerin – it absorbs water from the air; a property that is called hygroscopicity. This makes it possible for glycerin to moisturize your skin for a prolonged period of time. It has such strong absorbing properties that if you pour water on it, not long after, the 100% pure glycerin composition will become 80% and the rest will be water
Glycine – protecting skin from the UV rays; has strong antioxidant properties, provides a deep moisturizing effect
Hydrolyzed Collagen – this is an anti-aging ingredient; protects the cells from oxidative stress; has proven firming properties
What is a scar removal cream?
А scar is a skin that has grown to the point where the former has been disturbed due to a particular reason. This new skin does not have the same properties, does not have the same elasticity and color. Scars are stiffer and often protruding than the skin around them, making them easily noticeable and not very pleasant.
And there are plenty of options when it comes to scar removal.
One of the most affordable ones is the purchase of a scar removal cream – a mixture of ingredients, aiming to restore the damaged tissue to its’ normal appearance. In fact, every treatment available aims to make them less visible and improve their appearance, as they cannot disappear.
Yes, there is no 100% successful method for the treatment of scars. And if someone promises a complete scar removal, consider it a lie.
What helps scars go away?
Before you start treating the scar with anything, you first need to determine what kind it is. Basically, scars are atrophic (often formed after chicken pox or acne) and hypertrophic (the cutaneous condition characterized by deposits of excessive amounts of collagen which gives rise to a raised scar, usually form after cuts and burns). Atrophic and hypertrophic scars have their own characteristics that make them look different.
It is highly recommended to consult a dermatologist before you start treating a scar.
There are various scar removal products on the market, and their costs are quite acceptable. People usually prefer creams, as very good for healing scars and are easy to apply.
You should be aware that scar removal creams perform better on fresh scars than on older ones. This option is the best treatment for scar removal after surgery.
Also, the period of scar healing usually lasts several months, so you need to be patient in order to obtain satisfying results!
Is vitamin E oil good for scars?
This common myth about the treatment of scars should finally stop spreading. Multiple studies have proven that vitamin E does not improve the appearance of the scars, and may even worsen the condition of your skin.
According to the US National Library of Medicine, there is no benefit to the cosmetic outcome of scars by applying vitamin E after skin surgery and that the application of topical vitamin E may actually be detrimental to the cosmetic appearance of a scar. In 90% of the cases in this study, topical vitamin E either had no effect on or actually worsened, the cosmetic appearance of scars. [3]
Important
Everyone's skin is unique, and even if you have chosen the best product for your skin condition, the containing ingredients may still cause some irritation, burning sensation, rash or allergy.
To avoid potential skin reactions, we highly recommend performing a patch test before using the product (you can download printable PDF version here)

I got dermalmd scar serum 2 weeks after abdominal surgery. The scars started diminishing within days, The bumpiness was probably gone in a month. I use this daily and we will see when they go completely away. 4 months so far. I have also seen great improvement in a 5-month-old scar from being scraped by coral.
