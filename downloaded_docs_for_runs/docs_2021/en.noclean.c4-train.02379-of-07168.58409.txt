Following on from the first global approval[1] of dupilumab in the US and the subsequent follow-up approval in the EU[2], dupilumab (Dupixant®), developed by Sanofi and Regeneron was approved by Health Canada in early December 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable[3].
Amanda Cresswell-Melville, Executive Director of the Eczema Society of Canada described dupilumab as “an option to patients unlike anything they’ve ever had before.” This is because “Canadians with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis often cope with chronic, intense, and sometimes unbearable symptoms that significantly impact their daily lives,” she said. [3]
A detailed review is available in the First Global Approval report in Adis’ journal Drugs[4], these details are based on the development milestones tracked in AdisInsight.[5]
