Maternal mental health checks

Review of the National Childbirth Trust Hidden Half report and GP consultation | Centre for Mental Health
Maternal mental health difficulties cause untold distress and suffering to women and their families, and cost the UK £8.1 billion each year. This report, commissioned by the NCT as part of their Hidden Half campaign, explores the implications of extending the current six-week health check for babies to include a consultation about the wellbeing of the mother.
We found that resourcing GPs to offer a ten-minute appointment about the mother’s health would cost around £27 million a year. But this could help to identify more women who are experiencing mental health difficulties after the birth of their child, and ensure that they receive timely, effective support.
The report concludes that an additional health check with GPs would provide an important opportunity to help women whose difficulties were missed during pregnancy. To make the most of their opportunity, GPs would also need training and advice on how to enquire about a new mother’s mental health.

NHS England & NHS Improvement | The Perinatal Mental Health Care Pathways | May 2018
NHS England has confirmed that new and expectant mums will be able to access specialist perinatal mental health community services in every part of the country by April 2019. The second wave of community-perinatal is now being rolled out to areas of the country that are currently underserved; with full geographical coverage anticipated.
This £23 million funding forms part of a package of measures, altogether worth a total of £365m by 2021, to transform specialist perinatal services so that 30,000 additional women can access evidence based treatment that is closer to home and when they need it, through specialist community services and inpatient mother and baby units (NHS England).

Women in a quarter of the UK still can’t access vital maternal mental health services
April 19, 2018 ~ TRFT Library & Knowledge Service	~ Leave a comment
New maps launched today by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance show that pregnant women and new mothers in a quarter of the UK still cannot access lifesaving specialist perinatal mental health services.
According to new data, pregnant women and new mothers in 24% of the UK still have no access to specialist perinatal mental health services. In its press release, the Maternal Health Alliance makes the point that in the most serious cases, perinatal mental illness can be life threatening: suicide is a leading cause of death for women during pregnancy and one year after giving birth.
With more than 1 in 10 women developing a mental illness during pregnancy or within the first year after having a baby, it is important women with the most severe perinatal illnesses have access to vital specialist services wherever they live. If left untreated these illnesses can have a devastating impact on women and their families.

From 2019/20 funding for specialist perinatal mental health community services will be allocated through clinical commissioning group baseline (CCG) budgets.
This funding will see 30,000 additional women getting specialist mental health care, in person and through online consultations including over Skype, during the early stages of motherhood, by 2021.

Aerobic exercise moderately reduces depressive symptoms in new mothers
November 29, 2017 November 29, 2017 ~ TRFT Library & Knowledge Service	~ Leave a comment
Doing aerobic exercise can reduce the level of depressive symptoms experienced by women who have had a baby in the past year | British Journal of General Practice |via National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)
This review of 13 studies showed that involving new mothers in group exercise programmes, or advising them on an exercise of their choice, reduced depressive symptoms compared with usual care. The effect was moderate but significant. Examples of exercise were pram walks, with dietary advice from peers in some studies. The benefits were shown whether or not the mothers had postnatal depression.
The NIHR reports that the evidence does have some limitations regarding its quality but is the best research currently available. This review should give additional confidence to health visitors and GPs to advise women that keeping active after birth can benefit their mental and physical health.
