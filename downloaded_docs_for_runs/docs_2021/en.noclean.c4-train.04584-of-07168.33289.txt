Magnesium Madness
Magnesium Madness
Magnesium is one of the basic minerals that your body needs to function optimally. It is actually involved in more than 600 reactions in your body, including:
· Energy creation: Helps convert food into energy.
· Protein formation: Helps create new proteins from amino acids.
· Gene maintenance: Helps create and repair DNA and RNA.
· Muscle movements: Is part of the contraction and relaxation of muscles.
· Nervous system regulation: Helps regulate neurotransmitters, which send messages throughout your brain and nervous system.
With that being said 80% of Americans are deficient in Magnesium!! How can we be so deficient in such a vital mineral? That comes down to several factors, but the most pertinent is how our soil is farmed in the US. With the mass agriculture our crops are no longer rotated with variety therefore the mineral content is stripped overtime from the soil. Not to mention the amount of pesticides, insecticides, and Glycosphate that are sprayed and leached into the soils.

If you have a medical condition, then check with your doctor before taking a supplement.
Although magnesium supplements are generally well-tolerated, they may not be safe for people who take certain diuretics, heart medications or antibiotics.
Supplement forms that are absorbed well include magnesium citrate, glycinate, orotate and carbonate.
Check with our office and we will help you select the right form for you.
Without enough of this important mineral, your body simply can't function optimally.
