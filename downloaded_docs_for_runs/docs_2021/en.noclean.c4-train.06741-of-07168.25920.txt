Achilles Tendon Injury
Rupture of the Achilles tendon commonly occurs in individuals who are not generally in excellent physical condition. The condition is more common in males between the ages of 30 and 40 and can cause debilitating weakness if left untreated. Although non-operative treatment in a cast or special brace is an option particularly in the elderly, the ideal way to rapidly return the individual to activity and provide the maximum potential for full function, is with carefully performed surgery. Walking in a removable boot is ideal shortly following surgery, and a carefully designed physical therapy and exercise program is essential to maximize the recovery process.
