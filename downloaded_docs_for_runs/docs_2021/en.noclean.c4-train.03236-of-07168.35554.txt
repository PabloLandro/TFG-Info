Caffeine is the worlds oldest and most widely used nootropic and L-theanine is a natural amino acid that calms the nervous system and thus counter balances the unwanted side effects of caffeine such as anxiety, coffee jitters and the subsequent crash. By taking caffeine without wrapping it in coffee we also bypass the metabolic load coffee puts on your system due to its contamination with mould toxins and other processing by-products.
iFocus Caffeine and L-Theanine assist in creating a calm state of mind with improved alertness and focus. This blend is ideal for improving your work, study or training with none of the unwanted side effects other stimulants may carry.
The potential benefits of taking pure Caffeine and L-Theanine together include:
Clean focus and alertness
Reduced anxiety and mental noise.
Improved cognitive function
Improved short-term memory
Calm and balanced nervous system
