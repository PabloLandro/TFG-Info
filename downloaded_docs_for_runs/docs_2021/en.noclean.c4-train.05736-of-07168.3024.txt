QTY
M’lis EVENING PRIMROSE OIL (EPO), comes from the seeds of the evening primrose plant. This Omega-6 fatty acid is a rich source of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid that the body converts to a hormone-like substance called prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Prostaglandins positively affect every organ of the body, and are especially beneficial to the heart, skin, and immune system. A shortage of prostaglandins results in impaired health. With an increase in GLA in the diet, the body is better able to function and properly fight disease. Each softgel contains 500mg of Oil of Evening Primrose.
