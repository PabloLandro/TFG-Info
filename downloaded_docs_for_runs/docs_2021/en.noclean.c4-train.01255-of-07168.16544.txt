Fever
What is a fever?
A fever means the body temperature is above normal. Your child has a fever if:
The rectal temperature is over 100.4° F (38° C).
The temperature taken by mouth is over 100° F (37.8° C).
The armpit temperature is over 99.0° F (37.2° C).
The ear temperature is over 100.4° F (38° C).
The pacifier temperature is over 100° F (37.8° C).
Fever helps fight infections. Most fevers are not harmful. They may last 2 or 3 days.
How can I take care of my child?
Use medicine only if the child needs it. Remember that fever helps your child fight the infection. Use medicine only if the fever is over 102° F (39° C) and your child is uncomfortable.
You can give acetaminophen (Tylenol) to children older than 3 months. Fever medicine lowers the fever by 2 to 3° F (1 to 1.5° C).
You may want to give your child ibuprofen instead. Ibuprofen (Advil) works 2 hours longer than acetaminophen. Give the right dose for your child's weight, every 6 to 8 hours, as needed. You can give ibuprofen to children over 6 months of age.
Do not give your child or teen aspirin.
Sponge your child if the fever does not go down. Sponge your child if your child's temperature stays over 104° F (40° C) 30 minutes after your child has taken acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Always give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen first. Sit your child in only 2 inches of lukewarm water. Sponge off the child's skin. If your child shivers, stop sponging or put in more warm water.
Have your child drink a lot of cold fluids.
Have your child wear as little clothing as possible. Do not bundle up your child. It may make the fever go higher.
For fevers of 100 to 102° F (37.8 to 38.9° C), cold fluids and little clothing may be all your child needs. Your child may not need acetaminophen.
Call your child's doctor right away if:
Your child is less than 3 months old.
Your child's fever is over 104° F (40° C).
Your child has a seizure.
Your child looks or acts very sick.
Call your child's doctor within 24 hours if:
Your child is 3 to 6 months old (unless the fever is due to an immunization shot).
Your child has had a fever more than 24 hours and you don't know what is causing it AND your child is less than 2 years old.
Your child has had a fever for more than 3 days.
The fever went away for over 24 hours and then came back.
You have other concerns or questions.
Fever - Teen Version
What is a fever?
A fever means the body temperature is above normal. You have a fever if your oral temperature is over 99.5°F (37.5°C).
The body's average temperature when it is measured orally is 97.6°F (36.5°C), but it normally changes during the day. Oral temperature normally can change from a low of 95.8°F (35.5°C) in the morning to a high of 99.4°F (37.5°C) in the late afternoon. Mildly increased temperature (100.4° to 101.3°F, or 38° to 38.5°C) can be caused by exercise, heavy clothing, a hot bath, or hot weather. Warm food or drink can also raise the oral temperature. If you suspect such an effect on your temperature, take it again in a half hour.
How do I take my temperature?
Do not have a cold or hot drink for 30 minutes before you take your temperature.
Turn on the thermometer if you're using the digital type.
Place the tip of the thermometer under one side of your tongue and toward the back.
Wait until the thermometer signals that you can take it out.
Read the display on a digital thermometer.
What causes a fever?
Fever is a symptom, not a disease. It is the body's normal response to infections. Fever helps fight infections by turning on the body's immune system. Most fevers (100° to 104°F, or 37.8° to 40°C) are not harmful. Most are caused by viral illnesses such as colds or flu. Some are caused by bacterial illnesses such as strep throat or bladder infections.
How long will it last?
Most fevers with viral illnesses last for 2 to 3 days. In general, the height of the fever doesn't relate to the seriousness of the illness. How sick you feel is what counts. Fever does not cause permanent harm until it reaches 108°F (42°C). Fortunately, the brain's thermostat keeps untreated fevers below this level.
How can I take care of myself?
Extra fluids and less clothing
Drink extra fluids. Cold drinks are helpful. Body fluids are lost during fevers because of sweating.
Dress in light clothing because most heat is lost through the skin. During the time you feel cold or are shivering (the chills), wrap yourself in a light blanket.
If the fever is less than 102°F this is the only treatment needed. Fever medicines are not necessary.
Medicines
Remember that the fever is helping your body fight the infection. Take medicine only if your fever is over 102°F (39°C) and you are also uncomfortable. You should take either acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Acetaminophen: Take any one of the acetaminophen products: Tylenol, Anacin-3, Panadol, or Tempra. The dosage is 2 tablets (650 mg) every 4 to 6 hours. 2 hours after they are taken, these drugs will reduce the fever 2° to 3°F (1° to 1.5° C). Medicines do not bring the temperature down to normal unless the temperature was not very high before the medicine was taken. You will need to take repeated dosages of the drugs because the fever will go up and down until the illness runs its course.
Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen is available in 200-mg tablets without a prescription as Advil, Motrin, etc. The dosage is 2 tablets (400 mg) of ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. When you use ibuprofen, stop taking acetaminophen.
Avoid aspirin: Doctors recommend that anyone under age 21 years) not take aspirin if they have any symptoms of a cold or viral infection, such as a fever, cough, or sore throat. Aspirin taken during a viral infection, such as chickenpox or flu, has been linked to a severe illness called Reye's syndrome.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call immediately if:
Your fever is over 104°F (40°C).
You have fever along with a severe headache, confusion, a stiff neck, trouble breathing, or you can't drink liquids.
Call within 24 hours if:
Your fever went away for more than 24 hours and then returned.
You have a fever for more than 3 days.
You have other concerns or questions.
