FAQ / What medicine can be used for fever?
All over the counter medicines such as paracetamol, aspirin, Tylenol, etc., are all on the avoid list. Remember, a fever is not necessarily a bad thing. It helps the body fight infections so, in most instances, it should be left to do its work at killing all those bad bugs. However, if a child cannot rest due to a fever, a tepid bath or sponge bath with tepid water is recommended.
In any case, if the cause of the fever is unknown, the child is under 4 months old or exhibiting other symptoms (dehydration, seizures, etc.), he/she should be taken to see a doctor or urgent care facility.
