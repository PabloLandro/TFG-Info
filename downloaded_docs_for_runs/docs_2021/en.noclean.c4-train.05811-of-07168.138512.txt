What are My Options with Energy Efficient Light Bulbs?
We all want to do our part when it comes to saving energy, being ‘green’ and contributing to a healthier planet. But when it comes to light bulbs, how do we know which energy saving options are the best? Which bulbs last the longest and save the most energy?
Traditional incandescent bulbs use a lot of energy to emit light, thus 90% of the energy used is given off as heat and is wasted. This is why these traditional light bulbs are being phased out of use. Energy saving choices for light bulbs today includes halogen incandescent, compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL), and light emitting diodes commonly known as LED lighting. These newer choices may cost a little more to purchase, but they will save you money during their life cycle.
Compact fluorescent bulbs are more energy efficient than halogen incandescent, and will pay for themselves usually within nine months of use. CFL bulbs have been shown to use about one fourth of the energy as traditional incandescent bulbs and can last up to ten times longer, providing a quick return on your investment not to mention the time saved in changing bulbs! LED lighting is quickly becoming a popular choice with advancements in technology. LEDs are Energy Star™ rated and use about 25% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, lasting up to 25 times longer.

What is the Most Energy Efficient Light Bulb?
At the LightSources group, we recognize that it is important to produce our energy-efficient lamps in the most environmentally-friendly way. To meet that goal, we continue to develop environmentally-friendly technologies as well as implement green business practices. We also provide on-going training for employees regarding the latest environmental issues and proper practices within our industry.
While we strive to lessen our carbon footprint and incorporate sustainable methods into our day-to-day operations, we thought it is important to discuss lighting options for our own homes. Any visit to a do-it-yourself big box store, indicates the selection of energy-efficient light bulbs intended for home use is getting bigger and more complicated.
The U.S. Department of Energy website offers insight into how to light your home with the same amount of light but less expensively. Data shows 5% of the average U.S. household’s energy budget goes to lighting and that one of the easiest way to reduce your energy bills are to use energy-efficient light bulbs.
Although no longer being manufactured, traditional incandescent bulbs used a lot of energy to produce light and 90% of the energy was given off as heat. However when we look at today’s shelves and shelves of bulbs filled with an assortment of halogen incandescent, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs), it can be confusing on what to buy.
While halogen incandescent lamps meet the federal regulations, there are now better options available. The Dept. of Energy states compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are simply curly versions of the long tube fluorescent lights we are all familiar with. Although they are more expensive than traditional incandescent bulbs, CFLs typically pay for themselves in less than nine months. An ENERGY STAR rated CFL “uses about one-fourth the energy and lasts ten times longer than a comparable traditional incandescent bulb that puts out the same amount of light.”
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) represent the fastest developing light technologies. ENERGY STAR LEDs are rated as using only “20%–25% of the energy and last up to 25 times longer than the traditional incandescent bulbs they replace.” They also use less energy and last 8 to 25 times longer than halogen incandescent bulbs.
LightSources and our affiliated companies represent the leading high-tech designers and manufacturers in the lamp industry today. Our products are used world-wide in a multitude of applications and industries such as our UV air treatment systems that offer patent-protected, OEM-oriented solutions. Regardless of whether you are a small or large company, or an entrepreneur with a new product idea; trust us with your specialty lighting needs.

Defining Terms Use in Specialty Fluorescent Lights
There are many terms used to specifically describe the various aspects of fluorescent lighting and the technology behind the engineering and manufacturing of them. One such term used to help define color in fluorescent light is CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairageis), the international standards organization that sets the standards for color and color measurement.
Fluorescent lamps may be described as cold cathode. This type of lamp has a cylindrical metal shell (electrode) covered on the inside with an emission coating. Cold cathode lamps are not heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons such as in hot cathode lamps, but rather, their interior surface produces secondary electrons upon electron and ion impact. To accelerate ions to a sufficient velocity in order to create free electrons, cold cathode lamps require higher voltages than hot cathode lamps.
Hot cathode lamps usually have a higher power density than cold cathode lamps and emit more electrons from the same surface area, which results in a higher output and the ability to operate at a higher lamp current. Generally the lamps have a tungsten filament covered with an emissive layer made of material with lower work function that emits electrons better than bare tungsten metal. The filament is either directly heated, where the filament itself is the source of electrons, or indirectly heated, where the filament is electrically insulated from the cathode.
Another important term in fluorescent lighting is CRI (Color Rendering Index), which quantitatively measures a light source’s ability to render color on a scale of 0 to 100 percent and is independent of color temperature. If the light has a CRI of 85 to 90 percent, it is considered good at color rendering. A rating of 90 percent or above, offers the most accurate color discrimination. If you need more information and clarification on our lamps, please see our website.
LightSources and our affiliated companies represent the leading high-tech designers and manufacturers in the lamp industry today. Our products are used world-wide in a multitude of applications and industries such as our avionic display backlighting that is part of the National Defense and US Space Program. Please contact us to learn more about our extensive selection of lamps.

Build a System for Your Specific Germicidal Application
For many OEMs, it is often less expensive and more effective to design their system around a customized lamp design rather than trying to build their system around a standard model lamp in order to meet their need for a specific germicidal application. That is why we offer clients, regardless of whether you are a large OEM, a much smaller operation, or maybe just a start-up, the opportunity to buy exceptional quality standard and nonstandard designs.
Our engineers work diligently with each client to develop a model of lamp that meets your mechanical, electrical and output characteristics. We will also customize the lamp’s shape and size to meet your requirements. In fact our scope of experience includes doing just that for our partners in the new equipment market.
The LightSources group also includes a specialty manufacturer of custom ceramic components, Cerlux. This means we have the resources to offer system-level designs that not only take into account ambient operating conditions, UVC watts and operating life, but also a fully customized ceramic base. Moreover our clients benefit from the opportunity to design proprietary and patented ceramic bases and sockets for their fully customized lamps.
By creating individual base configurations, you will be able to offer exclusive proprietary products along with the opportunity of increasing your re-lamp sales potential. We offer a broad choice of colors including all standard pantone colors and premium colors upon request.
In addition this flexibility of design allows businesses to conform their system components to corporate identity guidelines. All of our quartz lamps are supplied with UV and ozone resistant ceramic bases unless otherwise specified. Contact us for more information and learn how we can help you get started on designing a germicidal system that specifically meets your needs.
LightSources and its affiliated companies – LCD Lighting, Voltarc, LightTech, and Cerlux represent the leading high-tech designers and manufacturers in the lamp industry today. Our products are used worldwide and are found in a multitude of applications and industries such as our UV germicidal lamps that offer patent-protected, OEM-oriented solutions.

Which is Better for Your Application – Quartz Glass or Soft Glass?
At LightSources and LightTech, we offer our customers a choice of quality germicidal UVC lamps in either quartz glass or soft glass. One of the biggest differences between the two is that quartz germicidal glass is made from silica phosphate, which gives it a much harder tensile strength. Germicidal soft glass is made from a highly refined and pure type of soda lime glass that is similar to visible light fluorescent lamps.
So how do you know which glass is better for your application? To start with, if your application requires the highest UVC output possible and a long operational life, then you will probably want to go with high-quality quartz glass UVC germicidal lamps. However as the glass does have a very high Celsius melting point that makes it more difficult to work and requires skilled human operators to manufacture, it is more expensive to produce. Nonetheless despite the higher cost, the advantages include an approximately 9% higher transmission of UVC than soft glass as well as a higher initial UVC output.
Additionally quartz germicidal UVC lamps can produce 254nm wavelength (killing wave) and 185nm wavelength (Ozone) while still maintaining 85% of their output at 16,000 hours. The quartz glass is also perfect for high powered lamp designs such as amalgam lamps.
Soft glass has a relatively lower Fahrenheit melting point that makes it much easier to work. This means that it lends itself to manufacturing automation and can be produced at a lower cost. The disadvantages of soft glass UVC germicidal lamps is that the transmission of UVC is around 9 percent lower than quartz lamps and has a lower initial UVC output. Also soft glass does not allow the transmission of UVC wavelengths below 200nm, which means that it cannot be used to produce ozone at 185nm.
LightSources and our affiliated companies represent the leading high-tech designers and manufacturers in the lamp industry today. Our products are used world-wide in a multitude of applications and industries such as our UV germicidal lamps that offer patent-protected, OEM-oriented solutions. Please contact us to learn more about our large selection of specialty custom and standard lamps.
