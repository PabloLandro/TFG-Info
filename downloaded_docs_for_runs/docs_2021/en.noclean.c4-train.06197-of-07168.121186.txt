The Best Cream Products to Treat Acne Scars
Acne is the most common skin disease in the U.S., according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. The effects of acne may be seen in the form of acne scars long after the actual problem has disappeared. You don't have to live with these scars. The American Academy of Dermatology says that skin-care creams formulated with retinol, glycolic acid or vitamin C can help fade your scars and improve your skin's complexion.
Doctors Dermatological Formula Retinol Energizing Moisturizer
Paula Begoun, a cosmetics expert who tests thousands of skin-care products, ranks DDF's retinol cream as one of the best retinol creams on the market. In her review, she praises its combination of both blemish-reducing retinol and antioxidants. The latter can help protect your skin from future damage. Begoun also says that the manufacturer includes beneficial fatty acids, which help the cream "go beyond merely moisturizing skin."
Shiseido White Lucent Emulsion
InStyle magazine ranked Shiseido's vitamin C-based emulsion as one of the top 10 buys for beautiful skin. Dr. Susan Taylor, writing for InStyle, says it can help fade darkened spots and blemishes on your skin and improve your "overall brightness." The University of Maryland Medical Center says vitamin C can help firm your skin, too.
Dr. Jeffrey Dover Glycolic Day Cream SPF 30
Dr. Jeffrey Dover's glycolic cream was ranked as one of the best skin-care products by the beauty editors of Real Simple magazine. It contains no oil ingredients to help prevent aggravation to your acne-prone skin. The magazine gave it positive marks for its time-released acid, which exfoliates your skin slowly throughout the day for sensitive skin. The best day creams should contain sunscreen ingredients, according to Begoun. This product contains sunscreen for an effective SPF of 30.
Alpha Hydrox Retinol Night ResQ
Alpha Hydrox's retinol cream is the best for several reasons. First, its packaging is opaque, which helps block out light that would otherwise degrade the efficiency of its retinol ingredient. Second, the manufacturer adds anti-irritants--these help soothe your skin and combat redness that may be caused by the retinol--as well as additional scar-improving ingredients like vitamin C and vitamin E, according to Begoun. For these reasons, Begoun concludes that it is "one of the top retinol products" on the market.
