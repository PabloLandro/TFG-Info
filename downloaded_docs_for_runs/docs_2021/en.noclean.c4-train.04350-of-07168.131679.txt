Vitamin E is found in foods like vegetable oils, meat, eggs, milk and leafy vegetables, according to Drugs.com. Supplemental forms of vitamin E, such as capsules, can be ingested to treat a vitamin E deficiency when recommended by a health care professional. In addition, applying vitamin E directly to facial skin has potential benefits for your skin's appearance and texture.

Moisture
Vitamin E, whether obtained by breaking oral supplement capsules or as part of a facial moisturizer product, can help hydrate delicate facial skin. It is possible to have minor to moderate skin irritation when using vitamin E topically; discontinue use if this occurs.
Scar Treatment
Regularly applying the contents of a vitamin E capsule to a scar, such as an acne scar, may reduce the scar's appearance over time. This potential benefit has not been well explored by research but it is often recommended by dermatologists and other skin professionals as one of the few potential ways to treat permanent skin marks without surgery. DoctorYourself.com suggests applying vitamin E to scar by breaking open a capsule and applying the liquid directly to the scar.
Burn Treatment
Vitamin E promotes healing, states the University of Maryland Medical Center. Once a burn has healed, which is characterized by new skin forming, topical application of vitamin E can help prevent scaring. The Center also suggests talking with a doctor about taking oral vitamin E before surgery to promote healing.
Anti-Aging
Topical application of vitamin E may reduce the length and depth of facial lines and wrinkles, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. One specific form of vitamin E that has this benefit is alpha-tocopherol cream. Using such a cream can also reduce skin roughness.
