Can You Use Athletes Foot Cream For Ringworm?
January 24, 2018
/ Foot Care Tips
Ringworm has a bad reputation. Many people attribute the condition to poor hygiene.
However, ringworm is a common skin disease that can be picked up by anyone, even the most careful and hygienic of people. In fact, doctors estimate that about 20% of all people will contract ringworm at some stage in their life.
What is Ringworm?
Contrary to popular belief, ringworm is not an actual worm. This contagious fungal infection got its “ringworm” name from the kind of ring-like protrusion it can produce on the skin.
Ringworm (tinea corporis) of the body is a fungal infection. It develops on the top layer of your skin. It’s characterized by a red circular rash with clearer skin in the middle. Ringworm, jock itch (tinea cruris) and athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) are collectively and scientifically known as “tinea.”
So, since ringworm and athlete’s foot basically come from the same family, does that mean you can use athlete’s foot cream for ringworm on other parts of the body? We’ll get to that. But first, let’s make sure we understand some other basics.
How Does Ringworm Spread?
The spores that cause ringworm conditions like jock itch and athlete’s foot are so tough that they can survive for months on household objects such as towels and combs, your skin and even in the soil. Without going into any further scientific jargon, the particular fungi that cause tinea are called dermatophytes, and they tend to do well in warm, moist areas.
When you introduce heat and moisture, these spores begin to thrive and grow, which is why contracting the condition often occurs in gym locker rooms, swimming pool changing rooms and showers.
Typically, these spores spread in four ways:
Through human to human contact
Through animal to human contact (you may stroke an infected dog and contract the spores)
By touching infected objects such as combs, towels, socks and wet clothes
By touching or playing in infected soil (this is the least common type of contraction)
Generally, children are at highest risk for contracting ringworm, but that does not mean adults do not get it. Instead, adults more commonly carry the fungus but do not exhibit signs or symptoms of the disease. Unlike a child, an adult’s body usually has more time and a stronger immune system to fight the infection and prevent it from fully developing into red, itchy patches.
Signs and Symptoms
Some of the most common signs and symptoms of ringworm include:
A raw, itchy red patch that starts off as a small bump.
A small bump that becomes circular and develops raised, bumpy borders
Bumpy borders that surround a scaly, inflamed center. In some cases, blistering may occur which can be painful, itchy and produce a burning sensation. When left untreated, blisters can crack and result in open sores that bleed with an intense, consistent itch.

For ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis), you may notice:
Pimple-like sores that start off as a round-reddish bump
A bump that becomes flaky, crusty or scaly and can be easily mistaken for dandruff
A bump that becomes tender, red in color and may cause a bald, circular patch of broken hair
Swollen lymph glands that appear at the back of the head
For ringworm of the nails (tinea unguium), you may notice your nails become:
Yellowish or whitish
Thick and brittle
How to Prevent Ringworm
There are many myths surrounding ringworm, and even medical professionals disagree on many aspects. While it is a fairly common condition and quite easy to pick up, there are precautions physicians recommend to reduce your chances of infection:
Dry your feet carefully, especially between the toes
Change your socks often, particularly if they get wet
Use cotton socks
Wear leather or other natural material shoes that breathe well
Wear open sandals when practical
Do not wear the same shoes daily. Allow them a day or two to air out
Do not share personal items like combs, brushes, towels or clothing
Wear flip-flops or sandals in locker rooms, gyms, and public swimming pools
If you touch a dog, wash your hands afterward
Use antifungal powder on your feet
Other precautions to take:
Inspect your feet often for any irregularities
Buff nails
Exfoliate the skin on the feet regularly
Consult a specialist if you suspect there is a problem
These precautions are not foolproof, but they will reduce the odds of getting ringworm. Regular foot care and bodily inspection will also help.
When should I see a physician?
If you notice symptoms of ringworm or suspect you might have it, only your doctor can correctly diagnose the issue. There are a number of other skin conditions that resemble Ringworm.
If your rash doesn’t improve within a few weeks or if you treat it with over the counter medication and it returns, it is best to seek medical attention from a doctor. You may need a doctor’s diagnosis and a prescription medication.
Treatment prescribed by medical professionals for most types of ringworm on the body is usually an anti-fungal medication that can be taken orally or topically (applied directly to the affected area).
In many cases, topical treatment is fast and effective while many oral medications have side effects.
Can Cream For Athletes’s Foot Foot Work for Ringworm?
Now back to the original question.
If preventative measures fail, can creams for athlete’s foot effectively treat ringworm?
Many over the counter creams formulated to treat one condition may be used to treat the other. It is best to read the label of the product or research the product that you are using to find out if it is effective for ringworm.
There are many creams that you can purchase without a prescription to aid in treating the inflammation.
Listed below are a few remedies that are promoted by the companies producing them as a treatment for both ringworm and athletes’ foot.
Lamisil Cream
Puriya Wonder Balm
Family Care Clotrimazole Anti Fungal Cream, 1% USP
Ingredients That Make Athlete’s Foot Creams Effective
The main chemical ingredient at work in good antifungal treatment is clotrimazole (Lotrimin), but there are a few others. Other effective nonprescription antifungals are miconazole (Micatin), terbinafine (Lamisil), and tolnaftate (Tinactin). These nonprescription antifungals are all applied to the skin (topical medicines).
Other natural ingredients like lavender oil and tea tree oil also help, not only with the infection but with the healing process as well, i.e., pain and itching. Some creams also include soothing aloe leaf juice, cetyl alcohol, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol and purified water. Try to avoid creams with a strong fragrance and unnecessary oils.
Checklist for Treating Ringworm with Athlete’s Foot Cream
Here’s a quick checklist you can use to ensure you’re using the right ringworm treatment:
Stops the irritation and itch
Prevents the condition from spreading
Acts quickly. Improvement should be noticed after a few days. After a week, the condition should clear up almost completely.
Prevents reoccurrence
Non-allergenic
Many companies that stand behind the quality and effectiveness of their creams offer a 100% money-back guarantee.
If you’re buying a cream online or at the drugstore, be sure to compare prices of different creams. The most expensive cream may contain similar ingredients as its lower-priced alternatives while working no better or faster.
Final Thoughts
Ringworm is not pleasant. However, treatment is quick and easy and relatively inexpensive, so never ignore symptoms hoping they will go away. They will only get worse!
If you find yourself with ringworm, act quickly and treat the condition immediately with the guidance of a physician. But remember, prevention is often better than having to struggle with treatment, so do your best to avoid it in the first place!
