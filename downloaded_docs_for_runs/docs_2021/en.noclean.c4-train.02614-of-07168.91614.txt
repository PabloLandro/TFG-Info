Tips For People Over 60 And Suffering From Hip Pain
ARE YOU OVER 60 YEARS OLD WITH HIP PAIN AND MORNING STIFFNESS? CHECK OUT THE CURRENT EVIDENCE SURROUNDING HIP OSTEOARTHRITIS
INTRODUCTION
Hip osteoarthritis is the most common source of hip pain for older adults, and studies show that it has a prevalence rate of 0.4% to 27%. According to a study published in 2009, hip osteoarthritis affects the entire joint structure and often causes hip range of motion limitations, articular cartilage degeneration, and pain. Other pathologies, including the formation of bone spurs and cysts are also associated with hip osteoarthritis and can cause further joint dysfunction. Hip weakness is one of the most significant findings in people diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis and can lead to difficulties with walking and stair-climbing.
RISK FACTORS
Age >60 years old
History of a developmental disorder that affects the hip
History of a previous injury
Family history of hip osteoarthritis
Increased sports exposure
Leg length disparity
Obesity
Occupations requiring excessive squatting, stair climbing, heavy lifting, floor activities, working in tight spaces, or kneeling
RECOMMENDATIONS
If you have three or more of the above risk factors, have pain at either the front or side of your hip, or if you have morning stiffness in your hip that lasts less than 1 hour, you may want to ask a physical therapist or your doctor to consider screening you for hip osteoarthritis.
INTERVENTIONS
Recent evidence shows that hip osteoarthritis does not always need to be managed surgically in order to increase quality of life and decrease pain. Manual therapy performed by physical therapists including hip mobilizations, which can help minimize pain and increase hip range of motion, have been shown to increase quality of life in people who have hip osteoarthritis. Hip mobilizations are specialized treatments that consist of specific stretching of the hip joint capsule. Other forms of exercise including high-velocity low-resistance exercises focusing on hip and knee strength have been shown to significantly increase muscle properties and physical performance in people with hip osteoarthritis.
