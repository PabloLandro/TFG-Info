Canesten HC cream
Canesten HC cream contains two active ingredients, clotrimazole and hydrocortisone. Clotrimazole is an antifungal medicine used to treat infections with fungi and yeasts. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid medicine that is applied to the skin to relieve the symptoms of inflammation.
What is it used for?
Skin infections caused by yeasts (eg Candida), dermatophytes (eg Trichophyton, Tinea), moulds and other fungi, such as those listed below, when rapid relief from inflammation and itching is also needed:
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis).
Fungal infection of the groin, ie jock itch (tinea cruris).
Ringworm (tinea corporis).
Fungal nappy rash caused by infection with Candida albicans.
Sweat rash caused by infection with Candida albicans.
Relieving the external symptoms (candidal vulvitis) of vaginal thrush (candidal vaginitis).
Inflammation of the penis and/or foreskin (candidal balanitis) caused by infection with Candida albicans (also known as thrush).
How does it work?
Canesten HC cream contains two active ingredients, clotrimazole and hydrocortisone. Clotrimazole is an antifungal medicine used to treat infections with fungi and yeasts. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid medicine that is applied to the skin to relieve the symptoms of inflammation.
Clotrimazole kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. It works by stopping the fungi from producing a substance called ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal cell membranes. The disruption in production of ergosterol causes holes to appear in the fungal cell membrane.
The cell membranes of fungi are vital for their survival. They keep unwanted substances from entering the cells and stop the contents of the cells from leaking out. As clotrimazole causes holes to appear in the cell membranes, essential constituents of the fungal cells can leak out. This kills the fungi and treats the infection.
Clotrimazole cream is used to treat a wide range of skin infections caused by fungi. These include infections with dermatophytes such as tinea, eg ringworm (tinea corporis), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and jock itch (tinea cruris) and infections with yeasts such as candida, eg fungal nappy rash, sweat rash, or thrush affecting the outside of the vagina (vulva and labia) or the end of the penis.
Hydrocortisone reduces skin inflammation by stopping skin cells from producing various inflammation-causing chemicals that are normally released when the skin reacts to irritation. These inflammation-causing chemicals include prostaglandins and various other inflammatory substances. They cause blood vessels to widen and other inflammatory substances to arrive, resulting in the affected area of skin becoming red, swollen and itchy. By preventing these inflammatory chemicals from being released in the skin, hydrocortisone reduces inflammation and relieves its related symptoms such as redness and itchiness.
The combination of medicines in Canesten HC cream is used to treat fungal skin infections when rapid relief from the symptoms of inflammation, such as itching, is also needed.
How do I use it?
Canesten HC cream should be applied thinly and evenly to the affected area(s) of skin twice daily and rubbed in gently.
Wash your hands after applying the cream.
Canesten HC cream should be used for a maximum of seven days. If the infection is still present after this time treatment can be continued with steroid-free Canesten cream. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
If you are using Canesten HC cream to treat athlete's foot you should make sure you wash and dry the feet, especially between the toes, before applying the cream.
If you are using Canesten HC cream to treat vaginal thrush it will only relieve the external symptoms of the infection, such as itching, inflammation and soreness. It won't treat infection inside your vagina, and so should be used in combination with a thrush treatment that does, for example clotrimazole pessaries or cream that are inserted into the vagina, or an antifungal medicine taken by mouth. Your doctor or pharmacist can advise you about which products to use.
Not to be used on areas of skin affected by:
Untreated bacterial skin infections.
Viral infections such as chickenpox, shingles, cold sores or herpes simplex.
Vaccination reactions.
Acne.
Chronic inflammatory disorder of the facial skin (acne rosacea).
Inflammatory rash around the mouth (perioral dermatitis).
This medicine should not be used if you are allergic to one or any of its ingredients. Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have previously experienced such an allergy.
If you feel you have experienced an allergic reaction, stop using this medicine and inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
