Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that usually starts between your toes. It often causes itching, burning, scaling, peeling skin, discolored nails, and even blisters, which can spread to your hands if the infection is not treated. Luckily, there is an easy home remedy that will get rid of the fungus in a short period of time. Apple cider vinegar both relieves inflammation and pain and kills the fungus that causes athlete’s foot.[1] However, see your doctor if your infection doesn't improve with home care or if you have diabetes.
Steps
Method 1
Using Apple Cider Vinegar Alone to Treat Athlete’s Foot
1
Buy cloudy, 5% vinegar. The cloudy, brown film you see in some bottles of apple cider vinegar is called “the mother”, and it’s a good thing. It means the vinegar is of high quality, and contains extra healing nutrients that will make it even more effective.[2]
2
Pour 2 to 4 cups of apple cider vinegar into a large bowl. You will want enough so that you can stick both your feet in. If more volume is needed, consider adding warm water, being sure to not dilute the vinegar beyond one part vinegar to one part water.[3]
If you do not have apple cider vinegar, you can also use white vinegar.
3
Wash your feet before soaking them in the vinegar mixture. Rinse your feet with soap and water. Once your feet are scrubbed clean, dry them off with a towel or let them air-dry. If you choose to use a towel, make sure to wash it immediately after you use it so that it can’t spread the fungus to other parts of your body.[4]
4
Soak your infected foot. Place your foot in the large bowl of vinegar mix. The acid of the vinegar will kill the fungus, as well as soften and break down the calluses it causes. If you want, you can use a washcloth to gently scrub the infected spot while your foot soaks in the mixture.
5% vinegar should not be too harsh for your skin. However, if you feel burning or a rash occurs, stop soaking your foot and add water to dilute the mixture.
5
Let your foot rest in the solution for 10 to 30 minutes. You should do this two to three times a day for seven days. Once those seven days are up, continue to soak your foot for one to two times a day for three more days. After the 10 to 30 minutes have passed, take your foot out of the bowl and dry it.
6
Apply vinegar directly to a very small infection. If your infected spot is very small, you can also dip a cotton ball or washcloth into the solution and rub the infected spot. Press the cloth on the fungus and hold it there for several minutes, then dip it back into the mixture and repeat. Do this twice a day for 10 to 30 minutes at a time.
7
Use a moisturizer after treating your feet to minimize damage. The acid in vinegar can be hard on your skin. To protect it, consider applying a thin layer of moisturizer after treating your feet.

Method 1 Quiz
Why is apple cider vinegar good for treating athlete's foot?
It makes the itch go away.
Close! The itching or burning you experience with athlete's foot is a symptom, not a cause. While you may feel less itching or burning after you treat with vinegar, it's because of vinegar's effect on the underlying cause. Choose another answer!
It will dry out your skin.
Not exactly! Vinegar can definitely be harsh on your skin, but that's not going to help with treatment in this case. If you're using vinegar to treat athlete's foot, it's a good idea to apply lotion afterward, to keep your skin from drying out. Guess again!
The acid kills the fungus.
Correct! Vinegar is very acidic and the acid will help kill the athlete's foot fungus and soften and break down the calluses on your feet as well. Just be aware of burning or rashes because of the treatment. If the vinegar is too harsh on your skin, you can always dilute or avoid it. Read on for another quiz question.
It infiltrates the skin to the source of the athlete's foot.
Nope! Athlete's foot is a fungus and occurs on the outside of your skin, not internally. Vinegar helps treat the external symptoms and cause, but not by breaching the skin. Guess again!
Method 2
Using Apple Cider Vinegar Alongside Other Substances
1
Make oxymel, a combination of honey and vinegar used since ancient times. Unprocessed, cloudy honey has proven antifungal properties.[5]
Mix four parts honey with one part apple cider vinegar.[6]
Apply it to the infected area and let it sit for 10-20 minutes.
Wash it off and dry thoroughly.
2
Alternate soaking in apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide. Like apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide is an effective antifungal.[7] Indeed, it is even stronger than vinegar, which is why it is best not to use it as a daily soak. Instead, alternate one day with apple cider vinegar and the next with 2% hydrogen peroxide.[8]
Purchase 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Dilute the hydrogen peroxide by adding water in a ratio of 2 parts hydrogen peroxide to 1 part water.
If you experience burning or a rash, dilute the hydrogen peroxide further by adding more water.
WARNING: Do not mix vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together, or treat your foot with one after the other. Mixing the two can form peracetic acid, a caustic chemical that can both burn your foot and damage your lungs through its fumes.[9]
3
Apply colloidal silver after soaking your feet in apple cider vinegar. Colloidal silver (tiny particles of silver suspended in liquid) at a strength of 100 ppm (parts per million) is an effective antifungal and antibacterial agent. After you have soaked your feet in apple cider vinegar and dried them, apply colloidal silver solution to the affected areas and let it air dry.
WARNING: Never ingest colloidal silver. It has no benefits and can build up in your skin causing permanent, bluish-gray discoloration.[10]

Method 2 Quiz
When treating athlete's foot at home, what should you never do?
Mix vinegar with hydrogen peroxide.
That's right! Be extremely careful not to mix the two agents, or to soak your feet in one right after the other. When combined, they can cause chemicals burns to your skin and inflammation of the lungs via inhalation. They are both effective treatments, but always be careful. Read on for another quiz question.
Use oxymel on your skin.
Try again! Oxymel is actually an ancient home remedy for athlete's food, composed of honey and apple cider vinegar, and can be very effective for treating the fungus. Try again...
Apply colloidal silver after you soak in vinegar.
Not quite! Colloidal silver is an effective antifungal and antibacterial agent. As long as you dry your feet thoroughly is should not interact negatively with the vinegar. That being said, never ingest colloidal silver, as there are dangerous side effects and no known benefits. Try another answer...
Method 3
Preventing Athlete’s Foot from Returning
1
Keep the infected site clean and dry. In between soaking your foot in the vinegar mix, make sure that the area stays clean and dry. The fungus that causes athlete’s foot loves moist areas, so having damp feet can mean that the infection will get worse or will come back.
A great way to keep your feet dry is to wear socks made of natural fabrics or fabrics that wick moisture away from your feet. Change your socks if they get wet.
Consider wearing sandals or flip-flops in hot weather.
Wear shower shoes, flip-flops or sandals around pools, gyms, hotel rooms, and shower or locker areas.
2
Wash your footwear. Fungus is a pesky organism that won’t go away without a fight. It stays in your shoes and on your towels after your infected foot has touched them. Because of this, it is important to disinfect anything that your foot has touched while it has been infected. Rinse your shoes (yes, even the inside) with water and let them air dry in the sun. After they have dried, sprinkle anti-fungal powder into them to make sure that the fungus doesn’t come back.
3
Get shoes that fit properly. Athlete's foot occurs most often due to a combination of sweaty feet and tight-fitting, confining shoes.[11] Don’t buy shoes that feel too tight and hope they will stretch out. To prevent athlete’s foot, you want shoes that are both long and wide enough.
4
Alternate the shoes you wear every day. This will ensure that your shoes are dry when you put them on.
5
Disinfect your shower and bath. As mentioned above, this kind of fungus loves moisture. When you have athlete’s foot and take a shower, some of the fungus will stay in the shower, which means it can infect your foot again as soon as you take another shower. Because of this, you should disinfect your tub or shower. Put on some gloves and use bleach or apple cider vinegar to scrub the floor in your shower. Once you are done, throw the gloves and sponge you used to clean into the trash.[12]

Method 3 Quiz
How can you avoid athlete's foot?
By wearing dry socks.
Almost! Athlete's foot loves moisture and heat, so changing your socks out when they get wet or sweaty is definitely one way to cut down on your chances of contacting it again, but there are other measures to take too. Pick another answer!
By wearing flip flops in communal showers.
Close! Communal showers, like those found in locker rooms or college doors, definitely have a higher chance of carrying the athlete's foot fungus, but you don't need to share a shower to contact it. Click on another answer to find the right one...
By washing the inside of your shoes.
Try again! Washing the inside of your shoes, especially if you've already had athlete's foot, is a great step to take toward eliminating the fungus, but it can be found in many places and there are other reasons to be careful. Guess again!
By wearing the right sized shoes.
Not quite. Athlete's foot develops in environments that are hot and wet, and shoes that don't quite fit can make your feet sweaty and moist, but that's definitely not the only way that athlete's foot is contacted, so you can't rely on just your shoes to stay safe. Try another answer...
All of the above.
That's right! Athlete's foot can be found anywhere that's moist or warm, including shoes--or the showers in shared locker rooms. Take these steps, and more, to keep yourself safe from the fungus and its itchy, annoying symptoms. Read on for another quiz question.
Method 4
When to Seek Medical Care
1
Visit your doctor if your infection doesn’t improve after a week. You should start seeing some improvement within the first week of starting home treatment. If you don’t, contact your doctor to discuss other treatment options. Your doctor will examine your foot to make sure you have athlete's foot. Then, they’ll treat your condition.[13]
Your doctor may decide to take a skin sample by scraping the rash. Then, they’ll look at it under a microscope to confirm your diagnosis.
2
See your doctor immediately if you have diabetes and athlete's foot. Your doctor can check your feet to make sure that what you have is athlete’s foot and not a complication from your diabetes. Additionally, they can prescribe you an anti-fungal treatment that will help your infection heal faster, which will prevent possible complications. Since diabetes causes slow wound healing, it’s possible for an athlete’s foot infection to cause a secondary infection if it’s left untreated.[14]
Your doctor may give you a prescription-strength antifungal cream. Additionally, they’ll likely have you come back in for a checkup to make sure your infection heals.
3
Try an over-the-counter antifungal treatment if you haven’t already. Look for antifungal creams, ointments, powders, and sprays on the foot care aisle at your local drug store.[15] To apply a cream, coat the end of a cotton swab with the cream, then dab it onto the affected area. If you’re using a spray or powder, administer it directly onto the rash. Repeat as directed on the dosing instructions.[16]
Make sure your read and follow all of the directions on the label.
4
Use an antifungal cream if your doctor prescribes it. Usually, over-the-counter antifungal products can treat your infection. However, your doctor may prescribe a prescription treatment if your infection won’t go away. Apply your cream as directed by your doctor until your infection clears. Also, keep your feet clean and dry.[17]
Read and follow all of the directions that come with your medication.
5
Take an oral antifungal medication if you have a severe infection. In rare cases, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication for a persistent infection that doesn’t respond to other treatments. Make sure you take your medication as directed, and follow up with your doctor so they can monitor your recovery.[18]
Your feet will heal faster if you keep them clean and dry.
You likely won’t need an oral antifungal.

Question
Can bleach kill athlete's foot?
wikiHow Staff Editor
Staff Answer
Some people think that bleach can treat athlete's foot, but even if it can, it is always unwise to apply bleach to skin. Bleach can cause irritation, burns and blisters, so just imagine having burns or blisters in addition to your athlete's foot! It is possibly safe to use diluted bleach for this kind of treatment, but it is really easy to mess up the dilution and end up with a burn. Remember that over the counter antifungal creams and powders are proven effective and don't have any risk of chemical burns, which makes them a much better option.

Question
How do you get rid of athlete's foot fast?
wikiHow Staff Editor
Staff Answer
The best strategies for treating athlete's foot quickly is to notice the first signs of itching as early as possible and then to wash your feet frequently, use an over the counter cream like Lamisil and keep them aired out and dry whenever possible. Try to wear sandals or go barefoot and wear synthetic socks if you must wear shoes. Be sure to clean your shoes or sandals well, keep them dry and apply antifungal powder if necessary.

Question
Should I soak both feet if only one is infected?
Community Answer
Yes, it's a good idea to soak both feet. If the fungus is present on one foot, it could be present on the other, even if it's not visible (yet).

Question
Can I use organic coconut oil as a moisturizer?
Community Answer
Usually, this would be possible, but this should be avoided if you suffer from any fungal infection as the coconut oil seals in moisture, which can make the fungus worse.

Question
I have an open wound because of athlete's foot, should I try it or not? White vinegar hurts a lot.
Community Answer
It's probably best not to soak your foot, instead moisten a cloth with the vinegar to spread it on your skin and avoid getting any on your wound.
Thanks!
Yes No

Question
Can I put the vinegar in a heated foot bath?
Community Answer
If you heat the mixture, the effects will usually be stronger, unless it's a substance that will just evaporate out of the water with increased heat. I would dilute the vinegar more than usually for the first few attempts. If the desired effect doesn't show, you can always increase the amount of vinegar after a few tries.

Question
Is it possible to get athlete's foot on the bottom of the foot?

Question
Can I reuse the bowl after using the apple cider rinse for fungus?
Community Answer
The bowl needs to be thoroughly and completely cleaned, like in the dishwasher or with dish soap as you would any other dishes before using it again for any other purpose. You cannot reuse anything in the bowl - all of that is now contaminated and must be thrown out.

Question
I get blisters in between my fingers, then they pop and become wounds. Is that athlete's foot?
Community Answer
If you are unaware of anything else that could cause these blisters, like specific, repetitive hand movements at work or overly hard workouts of some sort at the gym, then quite possibly they could be caused by a fungal infection, just like athlete's foot. If the blisters popped, don't apply vinegar, just use 3% hydrogen peroxide and then some Neem tree oil, or possibly an anti-fungal cream from the pharmacy. Also, avoid ketoconazole based creams on wounds, as that could get into your bloodstream and cause liver damage.
Thanks!

Tips
Avoid sharing towels, socks, slippers and shoes to make sure that you go not spread the fungus to anyone else, or get the fungus from someone.
Warnings
Only perform a vinegar soak if you have checked your foot and know for sure that you do not have any open wounds. The vinegar will cause a serious stinging sensation if it gets into an open wound.
If you have tried using vinegar and your condition doesn’t seem to be improving after 2-4 weeks, talk to your doctor.
Though it has been used to treat athlete’s food for centuries, there are no quality peer-reviewed studies measuring the effectiveness of vinegar as an antifungal. For best results, consider using an over-the-counter antifungal cream or spray.[19]
