Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum
Brian Michael Good - Friday, April 29, 2016
Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum works fast to rebuild collagen and correct pigment, and is even more effective in healing scars with Alpha Lipoic Acid, DMAE and Organic Rose Hip Oil.
All three help to break down that injured collagen and allowing it to re-form in the correct structure, reducing acne scarring, pigmentation scarring on the face and body.
Organic Rose Hip Oil is is the main anti-aging ingredient, as well as a wrinkle reducer, and contains Vitamins A and E, but is also rich in Vitamin C, containing more than 20 times more Vitamin C than oranges. Organic Rose Hip Oil is essential in the formation and synthesis of collagen in the skin. Without it, your skin would age prematurely.
Pure Emu Oil contains a variety of elements that are highly beneficial as a skin serum including vitamins E and A, both major antioxidants known as healing agents; vitamin It is an effective skin repair agent, oleic acid, a skin regenerator, a natural treatment for burns, and an anti-wrinkle agent for the beauty and protection of your skin.
Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Grape Seed Oil in this pure virgin form retains the high amounts of vitamin E, vitamin C, beta carotene, and other antioxidants; it is believed to be regenerative and helps control skin moisture and protect cells from unstable oxygen molecules that can ravage the body.
Research studies have demonstrated that when DMAE is applied to the skin it begins to work within 20 minutes of application, continuing to firm and tighten facial and neck skin, resulting in better facial tone and less sagging over time with use.
Alpha Lipoic Acid is the body's most important antioxidant, and has 400 times the antioxidant power of both Vitamin C and E.
Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum is effective for Skin Imperfections.
Diminishes scars and pits.
It effectively reduces scars caused by acne, surgery, burns, chicken pox, injuries and cuts. Organic Rose Hip Oil's potent cell regenerating and wound-healing properties help to replace ugly scar tissue with healthy, normal skin. It not only repairs damaged skin structure, it also improves skin color and elasticity.
Fights skin aging
Balance of Nature Antioxidant Srum halts and reverses pical sign of aging like wrinkles, crow's feet and sagging skin by accelerating the skin's cellular activity to augment skin renewal and cell regeneration. The face becomes firmer and smoother as signs of aging diminish.
Lightens pigmentation
It increases the skin's capacity to produce new cells. As new cells replace old ones, pigmentation spots gradually fade.
Reduces stretch marks Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum repairs and replaces skin tissue which significantly reduces the appearance of stretch marks, and makes the skin tone more even.

Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum is part of the Smooth Fusion ® Organics skincare line, a highly effective organically made premium quality skincare product that is 80% organic and 20% natural ingredients, organically made, non-comedogenic, non-greasy, paraben free, contains no harsh chemicals, is non-toxic with no heat.
We suggest using Pure Emu Oil, a transdermal carrier oil as a base that brings Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum's ingredients through the derma layer of skin.
Research has shown that Pure Emu Oil applied in a massage is absorbed into the body within 1 hour so using Emu Oil will provide essential fatty acids to your diet.
Emu oil contains high levels of linolenic acid, a substance known to temporarily ease joint pain, and oleic acid, a substance which has a local anti-inflammatory effect on dermal tissues. When Emu oil was tested, it proved to be very hypo-allergenic and to have an extremely high purity level.
Directions:
Shake well before using. Keep dropper tip off skin Nutricare Plus "Take Away Bottles" are lightweight, convenient size, perfect for dispensing oils accurately; one drop at a time, allowing your oil to last up to twice as long. A little bit goes a long way. Gently apply an ample amount onto the affected area. Apply as often as the antioxidant oil/serum is absorbed into skin.
Apply a few drops of the Emu Oil and mix it on the pack of your hand with the Balance of Nature Antioxidant Serum.
Massage gently onto your skin using a circular motion until completely absorbed. The thinnest skin on the body is found around the eyes. It can be thinner than a millimeter!
This means that a light touch and proper care are necessary for this delicate area to look and feel beautiful. Pat with your ring finger near the eye exerting the least amount of pressure rather than pulling skin. Apply any excess serum onto to your hands, fingers, neck, legs, and feet.
Keep your natural and organic skincare that you use on a daily basis refrigerated at home or in the office, out of direct sunlight. When traveling keep in a ziplock bag when placed in a gym bag, purse or in a chilled cooler when at the beach.
Do not leave antioxidant skincare in the car or anywhere hot. Keep your antioxidant serums, oils, salves, and creams out of direct sunlight, refrigerated between 52–61 degrees Fahrenheit so that the rich healing combination of organic nutrients, plant extracts, and vitamins A, C and E last twice as long or more. Close bottles, jars, and tins immediately after using them. Oxidation will age your organic skincare. Do not freeze your skincare or glass.
