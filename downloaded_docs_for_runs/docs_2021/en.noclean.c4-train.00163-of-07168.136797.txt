People take theanine by mouth for reducing anxiety and stress, for preventing It is not known if theanine is safe when used for longer periods of time. Theanine. Jul 5, The pharmacist discusses whether or not it is safe to take L-Theanine if you are taking antidepressant medication. There is no known drug interaction between L-Theanine and any antidepressant medications. SSRI antidepressants (e.g. Zoloft, Lexapro, Paxil, Celexa).
It Safe To With Antidepressants? Take L-Theanine Is
I started taking it to manage extreme anxiety and stress. About thirty minutes after the first dose I noticed a super relaxed feeling. It felt really good.
However within about hours it faded. After a few doses I noticed I started experiencing head aches. Nothing to major but I do feel a little nauseous with the headache so Im only assuming its causing slight migraines which I was already experiencing. The anxiety is still there. But my responses to it is a lot better.
I still have the worry in the background. I still have the obsessions. But I am dealing with them better. I have a psychiatry appointment next week where I will be discussing this supplement with my doctor and also seeing if they think there are other supplements that will be safe to add.
In conclusion I feel that for mild anxiety and stress L theanine would be your answer. Eventually I might increase the dosage. I have been anxious and reacting to various things, both mental and physical. My doctor wanted me to take various benzos, but I did not want to do that. I found L-theanine on my own on the shelf with other supplements and decided to try it. I thought it was great right away, but just stopped taking it about a week before Christmas.
In a few days, I felt mentally messed up and upset much more than usual. Not sure I want to take it again only mg per day. I do have other factors that contribute to my mental state. Would welcome comments or suggestions. I am a high profile person and have to function.
I took L-theanine and felt sooooo good that I was afraid of becoming addicted. I could not believe that it helped me so much, even sex was better. SSRI or Xanax never made me feel this good. SSRI always give me major diarrhea within 2 days, xanax makes me extremely fatigue. I had not realized I was so strung out, I could not think straight or focus. Within a couple of days using mg of L-theanine and I could think straight. I could see what I needed to do to get control of my anxiety. After using it every other day, off and on for about 3 months, I began to feel like it was making me dizzy.
I cut the dosage back and tried again. I always got the wonderful sleep but next day felt dizzy. I stopped for 4 or 5 days, then tried just around 50 mg. Could handle that for a day or two but felt the dizziness. I finally stopped using but I still have a dizzy problem. When using L-theanine I had more energy, sleep felt so refreshing, and my focus was great. I also gave it to my male cat who was peeing on the dog bed, it improved his outlook greatly.
We just moved crossed county after 15 yrs in one place, been stressful. I purchased a bottle of Nutricost L-Theanine from Amazon. I took it on Thursday and Friday. This was my first time to take L-Theanine. I woke up Saturday morning breaking out in hives. Since I had no other changes in diet or surroundings, I felt it had to be the supplement and I have not taken any more.
I continued to break out in new hives on Sunday and Monday. By Tuesday, the large hives had condensed into a dense, bright red, itchy rash all over my arms and thighs. The rash finally began to subside Thursday and today, Friday 7th day , I am finally not miserable.
I have never had an allergic reaction like this except to poison ivy. The direct, systemic reaction tells me it had to be the supplement, however, I have no idea if it was the L-Theanine or the other ingredients in the supplement. I took two capsules of L-theanine last week. They are mg. I took one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday. The first dose made me feel good and relaxed so I took the second dose.
However, on Wednesday afternoon I started to feel lightheaded, shaky and unstable. By the evening I also had chills and diarrhea. I stopped taking it but still feel the effects 4 days later! I have brief episodes of lightheadedness and flu-ish symptoms. I am super sensitive to all meds. I believe I am allergic to green tea and obviously allergic to this supplement.
I will not take this again. I just tried 1 capsule of Source Naturals Theanine Serene yesterday. It is a good brand but I did not respond well to it. I became very sleepy and also felt depressed. Then during the night I had a lot of acid indigestion. I take mg. I will probably not try it again and will give it to my friend who can take supplements and herbs without problems. I started with 2x mg capsules a day and within mins I feel a lot more relaxed, and able to get my studies done in a focused state.
This makes sense as it raises Alpha brain wave activity. I recommend it if you have stress issues or anxious energy. S I have it with a strong coffee as L-Theanine works in synergy with caffeine. I usually go mg theanine to approx.
Appetite has not changed. L-theanine works great for my focus and anxiety. The only downside is that I get a weird lightheaded feeling a few hours and taking mg of Suntheanine.
Worked immediately on all his problems. Not sure if we should continue…. It helped me quit smoking. I go straight to sleep at night. I feel like I did on shrooms, very verbal and alert of my own thoughts and feelings.
I work two jobs and this has helped me zoom through the day. And I have gotten drunk while taking it and no effects. Helps PMS go away. Got drowsy after 45 min and slept soundly for 7 hours. Upon awakening, I was full of energy and, as day wore on became more hyper and very slightly dizzy. My only prescription drug is a low dose statin. I take vitamins in the AM. Low BP could be causing light dizziness.
I noticed at work after a couple of days of taking my Adderall, coffee and drinking some cold diet green tea I felt really good. The only thing I added was the green tea so I started researching and learned about the L -theanine.
I take Adderall, luvox and Neurontin but would like to feel better. My meds help some. One of my sleeping problems is that I have very vivid dreams and love to sleep… like going to the movies!
I decided to start taking L-theanine to feel better. I was hoping to wake up feeling refreshed and more focused during the day. I bought some Sundown naturals stress formula from Walmart which is L-theanine. I started taking only mg one morning and had some coffee with it.
I woke up not feeling that great because I slept my day away. I slept for 12 hours straight and I think the only reason I woke up was because I had to go to the bathroom.
I dreamed all night long. I felt sluggish most of the day. I noticed that according to bottle a serving is 2 pills which would be mg. Hoping this is just my body getting used to it. May have to go back to just some cold green tea with my coffee in the mornings instead of this. Will wait and see. I recently purchased a supplement that is an energy supplement that also helps one to focus contains caffeine and l-theanine and theacrine.
The first time I took it, I thought maybe I was coming down with something because I felt terrible. I took it again another day and thought, again, maybe I was coming down with something.
I wanted to take a nap, it did not give me energy and I had a headache. I took it a third time, when I knew I was feeling healthy, and again, so tired and felt like crap all day with a headache and nauseous.
I will never take it again. My body rejects it. Tried L-theanine and it causes horrible muscle spasmodic episodes in my back and legs. Waited a week and tried again with even worse consequences, it triggered sleep paralysis and almost charley horse knots, this was two days after being glutened been gluten free 8 years, as it causes Narcolepsy in me the Brand was expensive Integrative medicine prescribed by my Naturopath! Headache and moodiness follow for a few days!
Same thing happened to me. Only took 2 days. I took mg of l theanine once and got diarrhea the day after. I am also on antidepressants so I will not take it again. I also have been taking ashwagandha for several weeks and it worked brilliantly to calm me down. But it is an adaptogen which means that once I was calm it began to speed me up, this resulted in severe diarrhea. So be very careful with this.
I began taking Twin Labs chew tabs of l-theanine as needed. I paid no attention to whether I had food in my stomach or not. Once or twice a day at most. Started having really bad stomach aches. All day every day for weeks. I stopped taking them as a first step to figuring out what my stomach aches were from. I discovered L-Theanine when it was an ingredient in a dog biscuit for anxious dogs.
That worked well for my dog too. I'm sorry to have you confused. I am not trying to sell anything or make any money?!?! No because it was purely a scientific review of the substance only containing a link of where you could get it.
I'm sorry that I put the other link in there since it was a page on a site selling green-tea. I'm sorry for the confusion. I was just trying to give people an idea of what it does. On the topic of green tea, I am a believer in the ill-effects of caffeine even the little that is in green tea so I believe it is not a wise drug to take and especially for people with anxiety. Green tea has very small amounts of L-theanine and comparatively much higher amounts of caffeine, so the effects are not very substantial in terms of reducing stress and anxiety.
A lot of times caffeine can heighten my stress level so I don't recommend green tea for any reason other than if you find it a pleasure to drink. To tomgunc my personal advice to you is if you are on an anti-depressant I highly recommend you get off of it because it is a dead end i've been there.
I'm telling you man L-theanine is all you need if you feel like you should take something for depression, stress, and anxiety. The average doctor won't tell you about it because truthfully they hardly know anything about health and the healthcare industry is purely a business in which they Benefit from people having health problems.
From a financial standpoint they have incentive to give people essentially bad advice because if they truly helped people it would be throwing the customer out the door. My advice is to get off the drugs and get on L-theanine. I have no doubt that Anti-depressants are a dead end due to my own experience. The healthcare industry is extremely cruel because they know they aren't giving the right advice they are just trying to make a buck. I take L-theanine and it's help has been tremendous.
Now I feel all I need is what's in my health list in my previous post. In my experience I have learned that this position is naive and I payed for it. I NEED clean water, exercise, "healthy" food, and l-theanine. I just feel the need to impart my knowledge to others so it can help them as it dramatically helped me.
Thanks Peace and Love Chris. Ok so you are an advocate for this supplement. But you are not the first to advocate for a supplement. There are many supplements with testimonial. Testimonials are not science, they are hearsay. My experience with supplments is that there is alot of placebo effect and especially in the first few days. After that, nothing, or not much - remember St.
This site is to help people with panic attacks. Your claims are outlandish in that this supplement might CURE panic attacks. There is no scientific evidence you can provide, just your opnion, and some websites who also use testimonials, one of which sells the product. So what are we to think? You see your promotion is too strong and too repetitive and not believable in the way you present it - it appears as a con and perhaps you are wishing that others will contact you, I don't know.
We don't sell things here. There is no mineral, amino acid or enzyme supplement to stop panic attacks and if you claim this is so then you are wrong. Think I understand Jeff's point. I personally believe that a complex B vitamin helps me a little though I am also aware that it's easy to latch on to something after having a few better days on that something. Perhaps it would have been better just to say ' I found L-Theanine helps me somewhat' without the added links etc.
It is folly on here to give out names of any products with such wonderfully insistent claims without pointing out that just because it works well for you it isn't a guarentee to work for someone else. People who are suffering with these disorders do tend to be on the look out for a quick fix and we have to be very careful when being insistent as opposed to making a more general and casual claim with regard to a personal experience.
That's just my view. Ok so perhaps you're right and I've gone about this wrong. All I can say is from my own experience the continued effects not placebo have been Fantastic in its ability to relieve my stress and anxiety.
Yes I know very well that a lot of supplements that people take give them a placebo effect mainly because its a confidence booster and they trick themselves into thinking its the pill and not just the boost of confidence they get from believing in the pill. Believe me I was an example of this with the numerous supplements that I used to take. For me L-theanine is very different than anything that I have ever taken or that is out there. The effects are very consistent and very real each time I take it.
Good point about the St. Haha that stuff is totally bogus and never did anything for me. Ok so comparatively St. It seems everybody is tricked into buying the bogus supplements and are rarely referred to things that actually work it is a business. So I feel from my own experience that L-theanine's ability to do what it actually says it does and much more is an extreme rarity in the supplement world. I do believe it is the best kept secret for stress and anxiety out there. I believe that there is almost no comparison in terms of performance when up against any other substance for stress and anxiety believe me I have taken them ALL-natural and pharma.
In my opinion comparing it to St. One does absolutely nothing and the others effects are very real, reliable, continuous, and positive.
This is my testimonial. Its just my opinion but advocating marijuana use for anxiety problems is actually worse than the L-Theanine debate.
Are you aware Chris that some people who come on here actually blame the use of this drug for kickstarting their anxiety problems? Paranoia cured by L-Theanine? Well perhaps you have the answer to some of the mysteries of psychosis because paranoia is prevelant in that condition!
Have you heard of drug induced psychosis? Our senses are already very well heightened by our sensitized nervous system. One could say we are seeing reality far too well. I am sure most who read that part of your post Chris thought things similar to me. I think its great that you want to help people Chris, I really do but please be careful and recognise the implications of what you write. I know its an individuals right to make up their own mind and the majority despite their anxiety will hopefully rationalise what you write, but do remember how vulnerable, fragile and hopeless some people on here may feel.
We also get very young people coming on here who are scared and very open to suggestion. I dont think their parents would thank you for encouraging them to use marijuana. Sue, Well I respect your opinion but it seems that you aren't listening because you have already made up your mind that L-theanine is worthless.
That is unfortunate because you most likely have no actual experience with L-theanine so therefore you are making a blind judgment. I'm 19 years old and I've already gone through the worst pain, suffering, and "psychosis" that I can possibly go through so I feel I know what I am talking about.
Yes I know people that come on this forum will feel helpless and hopeless. That did not happen and that is what I am trying to do now so it can help others. The big three to conquer anxiety 1. I do not advocate using marijuana from an unknown source until you have gotten your anxiety under control or unless you are only using certain strains of sativa. There are in fact strains of marijuana that are mostly sativa if you want to know what I am talking about research the plant that can be actually a tremendous help with anxiety.
If you live in a medical marijuana state then you can have access to these particular strains that will help. These are both great for boosting confidence and melting anxiety. The claim that all marijuana will heighten anxiety and paranoia is simply a false claim. This claim is also from ignorance and lack of experience. In my mind its FACT. Please take my advice. Sue I was going to say something about the weed too but every time I mention something people go off on me about how I don't know nothing about marijuana.
I happen to live in California where you can go buy weed just around the corner and boy do they have different plants off all kind. I saw it on the news I wouldn't step foot into one of those clinics.
I smoked weed at 19 and my life changed for the worse.
