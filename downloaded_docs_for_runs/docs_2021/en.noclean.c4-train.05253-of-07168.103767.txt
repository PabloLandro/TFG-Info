WHAT IS MINOXIDIL
Minoxidil was initially created to treat patients suffering from high blood pressure. Upon discovering a side effect of significant hair growth, the formula was adapted into a topical solution to be applied directly to the scalp of men and women struggling with varying degrees of balding, notably androgenic alopecia.
Although the mechanism of its efficacy is still not certain, clinical testing proved the treatment highly effective amongst the majority of the test subjects within just months, specifically on the crown (vertex) area*.
Two resounding results were apparent:
1. The rate of hair loss was reduced, and in some cases, halted.
2. Deadened follicles were re-invigorated, resulting in new growth.
Minoxidil is now available for men and women right here online. Through a simple course of treatment followed diligently, you too can enjoy an invigorated head of hair.
*NOTE: Minoxidil has proven to exert maximum effect to the crown/vertex of the head. Treating frontal baldness and receding hairlines may prove ineffective.
WARNING: Although such accounts are rare, minoxidil is a medication that can have serious side effects. It is imperative you read the instructions and warning information thoroughly prior to use.
WHAT IS TRIOXIDIL
Trioxidil was developed and perfected by the experts at FOLIGAIN® to infuse hair and scalp with key nutrients, bioactives and botanicals for healthier, thicker-looking hair.
Trioxidil uses a triple-action approach to ensure product efficacy, starting with key proteins being boosted within the follicle to promote hair that is denser and full of body. Bioactives then go to work on the hair strand, strengthening the hair matrix, giving them resilience and a revitalized youthful appearance. Finally, proprietary moisture barrier technology locks in the key bioactive ingredients to boost efficacy and retain skin moisture for improved results and decreased dryness and irritation.
