Being overweight, even moderately, impacts weight bearing joints and can increase pain associated with arthritis. Research has shown that, during walking, the hips, knees, and ankles bear 3 to 5 times a person's total body weight. For every pound a person is overweight, 3 to 5 pounds of extra weight is added to each knee during walking. In contrast, a 10-pound weight loss essentially relieves 30 to 50 pounds of additional stress on the joints.
For people with arthritis, extra pounds burden the joints and lead to increased inflammation and pain. Osteoarthritis, the wear-and-tear type of arthritis, is more common among overweight people. Studies have indicated that losing extra weight lowers the risk for developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Losing weight can help slow the progression of arthritis, too.
Weight Loss Guidelines
Traditional height and weight charts are no longer used per the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the definition and treatment of overweight and obesity. The assessment of overweight considers:
body mass index (BMI), which you can calculate using a calculator
waist circumference
risk factors for diseases
conditions related to obesity
Tips for Successful Weight Loss
When considering weight loss strategy and diet one must be reasonable and realistic. Fad diets and quick weight loss schemes are not only unrealistic but can be unhealthy, unbalanced, and deplete the body of essential nutrients. An estimated 95 percent of dieters losing weight on quick weight loss diets gain back the weight within a year. The formula is simple. To lose weight, you must burn off calories by either:
decreasing food intake
increasing energy output through regular exercise
Moderate physical activity on most or all days of the week is recommended. Besides its contribution to weight loss, exercise:
strengthens joints and bones
lowers blood pressure
improves the cardiovascular system
Walking a mile burns about 100 calories. Gardening for 30 to 45 minutes, raking leaves for 30 minutes, and certain other ordinary activities burn up about 150 calories.
Eat Regular Balanced Meals
It is recommended that people eat three healthy, balanced meals and avoid unhealthy between-meal snacks. It is also recommended that you decrease dietary fat and be mindful of nutritional needs, such as:
calcium
zinc
potassium
fiber
vitamins D, B12, and E
Cutting caloric intake by 500 calories a day every day will lead to a loss of a pound a week. You can use a simple calculator to determine how many calories to aim for each day. A reasonable time frame for a 10 percent reduction in body weight is 6 months of treatment, with a loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week.
Tips for Healthy Eating
Advice for healthy eating:
Eat only lean cuts of red meat in small quantities or no red meat with poultry and fish as an alternative.
Trim away fat and skin.
Cook by steaming, grilling, baking, or microwaving; avoid frying.
Eat non-fat cheeses and yogurt; frozen yogurt instead of ice cream; drink skim or 1% milk.
Starchy foods are healthy and satisfying like bread, rice, potatoes, and pasta; don't add fattening sauces or butter.
Chips, cookies, cakes, pies should be replaced with fruits, vegetables, and lowfat convenience foods.
Use spices/herbs to flavor food rather than butter and heavy dressings.
Go light for dessert like angel food cake, gelatin, or fruit salad.
Drinking water is another helpful tip for those trying to lose weight. Drinking 6 to 8 eight ounce glasses of water per day in addition to other beverages is recommended. Drinking water is both healthy and helps to suppress the appetite.
Balance Is Key to Successful Weight Loss
The key to successful weight loss is to find a balance between exercise and healthy diet which can contribute to calorie reduction but at a reasonable, undramatic pace so that the weight loss will be maintained through the new, healthy lifestyle.
