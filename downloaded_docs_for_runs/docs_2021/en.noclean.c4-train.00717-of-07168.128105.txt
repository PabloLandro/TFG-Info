Still Dealing With Acne Scarring?
More review at www.sourchengine.info and www.latestsearchengine.info.
Acne is an unsightly skin condition that most of us have had to deal with at some point in our lives. The good news is that the pimples usually come and go within a week or so. The bad news is that after they have cleared up, they can sometimes leave lesions or scarring in their place. Depending on the depth of the scars, they can become a permanent fixture, and a constant reminder that you once had acne. Are there any ways of preventing this from happening? Although there is no real cure for acne scarring, there are a few ways of helping to lessen the chances of developing permanent acne scars.
The first weapon in preventing acne scarring is to try to keep your acne at bay. To do this, there are a few basic techniques that have proven to be very effective in acne prevention.
-Gentle Skin Cleansing
It is important to choose a face cleanser that is gentle on the skin. Never wash your face with deodorant soap or body wash. This will strip the skin of moisture and cause redness and irritation. Use a soft cloth instead of a scrub pad and gently rub in small circular motions. Scrubbing vigorously will only make matters worse. Wash the affected area once in the morning and once before bedtime.
-Never Rub or Pick at your Skin
Picking or rubbing your skin will only increase your chances of developing acne. The dirt and oil from your fingers will cause acne to develop, and your fingernails are a breeding ground for acne causing bacteria.
-Use the Correct Moisturizer
Because face cleansers can dry the skin, it is important to use a good moisturizer. Use a non-pore clogging moisturizer to help the skin to be healthy and balanced.
-Be Consistent
When it comes to proper skin care, consistency is important. Cleansing the skin once in a while, or even a few times a week is not enough. Make time to do your skin care regiment every day.
Scarring is the body's way of repairing itself. Scars are made up of mostly the protein fiber collagen. When you have developed acne scars, there are a few things that will actually make the scarring worse.
Sun - Exposing scars to the sun's ultraviolet rays will cause them to darken and slow down the healing process. Before going outdoors, cover the skin with a quality broad-spectrum sunscreen that has a SPF of at least 15. The sunscreen should be applied every two hours to ensure complete protection.
Vitamin E - It is a common misconception that applying vitamin E cream for acne scar removal will help it to heal faster. According to the latest studies, the opposite is true. Vitamin E cream has been known to actually hinder the healing process. As a matter of fact, some patients in recent studies have developed contact dermatitis.
The thing that does seem to help in acne scar removal is the use of cortisone and fade creams. Cortisone works in reducing inflammation, and fade creams that contain a bonding agent are very effective in making acne scarring appear lighter. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is another effective fade cream.
I am a freelance writer and besides conquering acne myself, I regularly research and write about skin care topics such as acne, scarring, moles, warts and the like. For more information, tips, and resources on acne scarring, visit our website and join the discussion on acne scar removal right here.

7 Myths About Hair Loss In Men
Male pattern baldness or hair loss is one of the most common problems faced by males by the time they reach 60. There are some who start losing hair at a younger age. Although men don't overreact on their hair loss, it affects them in a similar way like women. American men spend nearly $1 billion a year looking for ways to restore their hair back. In this article, we will discuss about the common myths about hair loss in men:
#Myth 1: Genetic Baldness Comes From The Mother's Side
This is a common myth but not completely true. Although the X chromosome which men get from their mothers is the primary baldness gene, hair loss in men also has other factors responsible for it. This myth buds from the fact that the hereditary factor is somewhat dominant on the mother's side, however recent studies have made it clear that men who have a bald father are more likely to develop the problem later in their life.
#Myth 2: Ageing Men Go Bald
Many people tend to believe that if you are bald that means you are getting older, however this is not true. Although hair loss is common in men who are in their 50s or 60s, the problem may also strike men in their teens. Stress or genetically induced hair loss may also affect 20 and 30 year old males. If hair loss begins early and you do not take necessary precautions to prevent it, the problem is more likely to become severe at a later stage.
#Myth 3: Wearing Hat Causes Hair Loss In Men
Don't blame the poor hat for your receding mane because unlike the contrary belief, it is not responsible for stunting the growth of your follicles. This is good news for men who love wearing hats but fear that they will lose more hair due to this. You must however make sure that you do not wear dirty hats as this would cause infection on the scalp which further accelerates hair loss, so take care of your hygiene.
#Myth 4: Excessive Physical Or Emotional Stress May Turn You Bald
This is true however there is a catch here. The physical and emotional stress will not induce any hair los, however if you are already facing this problems then stress can aggravate it. When you are stressed, the body releases stress hormones or cortisol. It also leads to a hormonal imbalance inside the body which impacts the hair growth. Drastic changes in the body weight may also contribute to hair loss.
#Myth 5: Stay Away From Gels And Hairspray
Some people believe that the products they use contribute to their hair loss; however this is not entirely true. It is not the products but the way you choose them that may impact the growth of your hair. When looking for products to prevent baldness, you must first understand the root cause of the problem and choose a product after proper evaluation. Don't blindly follow the infomercials and try everything that claims to solve the problem. Look for the ingredients present in the product and preferably select the ones that contain powerful and potent ingredients such as saw palmetto and He Shou Wu. This will go a long way in preventing your hair loss issues.
#Myth 6: Eating Carbohydrate May Cause Baldness
Contrary to the popular belief that loading your body with carbohydrate may cause hair loss, it has been proved that carbohydrate and red meat actually provide the essential nutrients that are required for maintaining a full head of hair. Researches have also shown that including certain vitamins and minerals to your diet may help restoring hair growth.
#Myth 7: Exposure To Direct Sun Accelerates Balding
Too much of exposure to sun may make your hair limp and dull but they are not responsible for your baldness. Tanning beds are also not responsible for this problem.
Break free from the myths and try to identify the reason for your hair loss. It could be due to a certain illness, unhealthy life style, lack of proper diet, genetics or due to specific medications. If it is due to an underlying illness then identifying it and getting it treated can help restore hair growth. Many times certain medications that you are taking may be responsible for the problem and it can be easily reversed by discontinuing these medications.
Although there are hair loss medicines available, natural treatment methods are the most effective as they get to the root of the problem and treat it inside out. You may consider including the essential vitamins and minerals in your diet to get the required amount of nutrition for the hair growth. A good hair massage and using shampoos and conditioners that contain natural ingredients can go a long way to keep your hair healthy and strong.

5 Natural Remedies For Getting Rid of Acne
More review at www.sourchengine.info and www.latestsearchengine.info.
If you have ever suffered from acne, you know how painful it can be! If the pain is not bad enough, you also get ugly scars! Acne can happen both to teenagers as well as adults! For some people, the acne eventually goes but the scar remains for a long time; for others, acne vulgaris is a regular affair! In this article I will tell you about some of the natural remedies you can use to treat acne!
Before I go on to elaborate on the natural remedies, I must tell you that if you are allergic to any of these substances, you must stop its use immediately! Also, if these natural remedies do not help you, you may eventually have to go for more expensive alternatives such as dermabrasion and laser treatment! For most people, however, these remedies usually work wonders!
One more thing: regular washing of your face with clean water is a habit you must inculcate, if you have not already! Also, if you apply make-up or cosmetics, it is important that you remove the make-up/cosmetic once its job is over, instead of letting it remain on the skin. A lot of cosmetics contain powerful chemicals that would harm your skin in more ways that you could imagine!
Okay, I have rambled enough now, so here are some of the recommended natural treatments for acne:
Lemon Juice: The lemon is one versatile remedy provided by nature - you can cure so many ailments with it - even acne vulgaris! The lemon juice contains natural bleaching agents that would help you get rid of the redness caused by acne. The lemon juice also helps in removing the acne scar tissue so that new, healthier tissue can emerge in its place.
The treatment is simple: get a clean cotton swab or pad, and use that to apply lemon juice on to the affected area! Leave it like that for some time, and then wash the area with clean water!
Apple Cider Vinegar: Before using any kind of acne treatment, it is important to note that our skin has the tendency to renew and rejuvenate itself naturally, over time. Apple Cider Vinegar detoxifies your body by cleansing it of all the toxins that are causing acne; on top of that, it also speeds up our skin's rejuvenation process. You can take either it as an oral medicine if you want, or apply it on the affected area of the skin!
Oatmeal: Along with lemon, this is one of the most commonly used natural remedies for acne! Mix oatmeal powder with rose water and apply it on the affected area, then leave it on the skin for at least 10-15 minutes, after which you should wash the face with cold water. Do this every day and you would notice that not just your pimples but even those ugly acne scars have vanished!
Egg whites: Not many people know that you can use egg whites in order to treat acne! Create a facemask out of egg whites and leave it on your face for an entire night; it is preferable to wear this 'mask' at bedtime for obvious reasons!
The Tomato-Cucumber Combo: These oft-eaten vegetables are also great in treating acne. Extract the liquid juice from both these vegetables and then mix them; then wash your face thoroughly, and apply the juice on to the affected area! The antioxidant properties of tomato would help prevent further damage of your skin. These two vegetables also help in making the skin smoother, tighter and stronger!

Salt As An Acne Scar Remedy: The Absolute Truth Revealed!
Almost 70% of our earth is covered with water, of which almost 98% is salt water (sea, oceans, etc.) It is ironical that while people all over the world spend billions on acne scar treatments, nature offers us this remedy for free and in abundance!
Salt has been traditionally used to treat acne scars. Mind you, I am not talking about the table salt we eat; the table salt is rather a processed salt which goes through many processing cycles before it is made available on our table, and during those cycles, it loses much of its natural strength. Nope, I am talking about 'mined salt'!
What is a 'mined salt'? Well it is the raw, natural salt found in sea, so f you live near the sea, you have got a free acne scar remedy at hand; if not, then you would want to buy it from your local market. Good news is that mined salt is usually cheaper than table salt (at least it is in where I live)! If you have not ever purchased mined salt, ask for the Himalayan Pink salt; sure, any kind of mined salt should do well, but this is one of the most well-known varieties available!
So how to apply the treatment? Pretty simple really! First you need a bowl of warm (lukewarm) water and pour the salt into it. Why warm water? Because it offers three major advantages over cold water: it helps the salt dissolve properly into the solution; it makes your skin more receptive to the concoction by opening up the pores of your skin - thus helping your skin absorb more of the essential nutrients present in the salt water solution you have prepared; last but not the least, when you message your face using warm water, it feels much more better than with cold water - don't you think so? Oh, you would also need a clean cotton pad (or ball) - obviously, you would soak the cotton ball into the solution and then message it gently on to the affected area!
How much salt should you add to the water? That is really a tricky question! You would want to start by adding 2-3 teaspoonfuls of salt into water and test it out: if the stinging effect you get from the touch of the solution on your skin is too much (in other words, if your skin irritates a lot) then probably you have added too much of salt and would therefore want to lessen the strength of the concoction by diluting it a bit with some more warm water. On the other hand, if you don't feel any good effects after the message, then probably the amount of salt you have added is not enough and then you would want to add some more salt into the solution!
Like with any natural remedy, you must not expect any kind of miracle cure. Do this message at least 2-3 times per day and you would certainly notice a little difference in the appearance of the scars within a week or two; however, in order for the scars to get healed completely, it may take you several months or even a whole year (depending on how old the scar is). The point I want to make is that - with this (and in fact, ANY) natural treatment, the trick is to keep going and have confidence in yourself. Don't give it up even if you don't notice any immediate result!

Buy Retin-A Cream for Acne Treatment
It has been revealed scientifically that when applied to the skin, Retin-A improves blood supply to the skin which in turn increases the turnover of dead skin cells. This aspect improves the quality of skin making it appear fresh and more youthful looking. With regard to the treatment of acne, evidence suggests that when applied topically, Tretinoin reduces blackhead formation and invigorates the development of the follicle cells that extrude blackheads.
Overwhelming clinical evidence and histological evidence, where the anatomical study of the microscopic structure of the skin tissues are minutely studied, indicates that topical retinoids such as Retin-A can control and modify to a certain extent the structural changes induced by excessive sun exposure.
According to the Dermatologists, creams such as Retin-A, are especially useful for initiating the 'milder' changes of aging including fine lines, wrinkles or roughness. It has been proven that the usage of this cream for a period of just 6 weeks shows astounding results - like fine lines disappear completely while the severe wrinkles are greatly reduced and the skin regains a youthful glow.
The use of generic drug Tretinoin is not just limited to fighting the visible signs of aging and for treating acne prone skin. It can be used to:
Treat and reduce stretch marks.Speed up the rate of skin repair.
It should be applied sparingly to the skin's surface 5 times a week initially and thereafter thrice a week. However, Retin-A may cause few unwanted side effects. Normally, the application of Retin-A may cause a little skin reddening but this may be due to the improvements in the skin's blood supply. Those having more sensitive skins may also experience burning, scaling and itching.
Retin-A increases skin sensitivity which implies that the risk of developing extreme sunburn is increased and extra care should be taken to prevent over exposure of treated skin to ultraviolet light. Retin-A may also cause a thinning of the skin. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that patients who are using Retin-A should avoid waxing. In all cases a gradual increase in the frequency and amount of Retin-A is best when applying this cream, since this allows the skin to adjust to this treatment. The advice of the health care professionals should be followed.
Retin-A must not come in contact with the eyes. Immediate rinsing of the eyes with cold water is necessary if it accidentally gets into the eyes. The application of Retin-A to skin should be avoided if the skin is suffering from psoriasis, eczema or if the users are suffering from a form of skin cancer.

Pushing Past Acne With Home Remedies
Scared of coming out of the closet? Pimples can do that-nasty pestilences on the skin, pimples are reddish bumps filled with pus which are caused by the bacterial infection of oil-secreting glands located inside the skin. They are considered socially embarrassing and are a cause of much distress, as sufferers of acne, which is a frequent breakout of pimples, go through a lot of negative psychological and social effects. To counter this problem, there are a lot of over-the-counter drugs and creams you can use to reduce the occurrence of acne-but why resort to expensive chemical drugs, when you can make easy and simple remedies right in the comfort of home?
There are numerous home remedies for acne which can be found online and in many lifestyle magazines, but their effectiveness is always subject to question. One needs to remember that if a remedy works for a friend, it won't necessarily work for said person. Also, though most remedies are made using harmless ingredients, some of them can cause irritation or an allergic reaction which can only worsen the condition. That is why prior to applying any remedy, you should always apply it to a small patch of your skin and proceed with using it on the rest of the area affected with acne after you've confirmed there aren't any harmful side effects of the remedy.
A very popular home remedy for pimples is the use of lemon juice, as it has a slightly acidic influence and helps to reduce inflammation and scarring. Remember, you should only use freshly squeezed lemon juice as it helps to mix it with other ingredients like sandalwood powder, cinnamon powder, rosewater or groundnut oil. Another important home remedy is the use of papaya juice, a very proficient natural product for skin care. And like deterring vampires, rubbing garlic cloves can also provide relief from acne, along with some other remedies which can be mixed with water or rosewater, like use of turmeric powder, tea tree oil, baking soda and even consumption of green tea.
The list tends to go on, but these are some very popular and successful remedies which are sure to help you combat acne over time. Of course, along with the use of home remedies, it's important to monitor your diet and include ample amount of fresh fruits, vegetables, water and fiber in your meals. Also, don't pop those pimples! It may give you instant gratification, but the scars don't leave easy.

How to Repair Damaged Hair Fast at Home
Most of us know how to take basic care of our hair, but we also do a lot of damage to it on a regular basis. If you are coloring your hair, blow drying it, brushing it while it is wet, swimming in a pool, or using a flat iron, then chances are that it is not nearly as healthy as it could be. Learning how to repair damaged hair is something that will help your hair look better in the short term, but it will also help it to grow faster, longer, and remain thicker throughout your entire life.
What Causes Damage to Hair?
Your hair is primarily made up of protein and it is not quite as sturdy as you might think. Protein is easy to break down and that is why you will start to see "split ends" within days of getting your hair trimmed. The reason why you need to learn how to repair damaged hair is because whether you know it or not, you are doing damage to it on a daily basis.
Shampooing - Most of us were taught that we should shampoo our hair every day in the shower, or at least every other day. However, this much shampooing actually strips your hair of the essential oils that it needs to fight off environmental damage. You can easily get by with only shampooing once or twice a week.
Brushing - Brushing your hair might make it appear to be shiny, but if you are doing it while your hair is wet, then you are actually doing potentially a lot of damage to it. When your hair is wet, it is easily broken, so you should never use anything other than a wide-toothed comb.
Styling - You probably already realize just what you are doing to your hair when you can hear it sizzling or smell it burning during styling. Any kind of heat styling is damaging to your hair, no matter how much product you put on it to protect it. The only safe way to let your hair dry is to gently towel it off and let it air dry. If you must use heat to style it, then try not to make a habit of it.
Environment - Whether it is the poor diet that you are eating, the chemicals in your shampoo, or the toxins in the air that you breathe, the environment is doing all it can to harm your hair. Therefore, any step that you can take to diminish this damage, such as choosing to eat a chemical-free diet or using products on your hair and skin that are sulfate-free can really help.
How to Repair Damaged Hair
As with most health problems, it is a lot easier to avoid the damage than it is to cure it, so if you can start taking better care of your hair, you will notice results right away. However, there are things that you can do that will help repair some of the damage and enable healthier hair to grow back.
The most common method of how to repair damaged hair is to use a thick conditioner on a regular basis. Obviously, one should be used after washing your hair, but you should also start using an intensive conditioner at least once a week. You can make your own conditioner out of ingredients such as honey or avocado, or you can use an oil-based humectant that will help to repair your hair and prevent further damage. This method might take an hour or so out of your week, but it is an affordable and very easy way to ensure you have healthy hair for a long time.
And finally, If you have 2 minutes, then I will show you a simple, step-by-step routine that you can do in 2-4 times a week that is guaranteed to give you the healthiest and most naturally beautiful hair that you've ever experienced.
Permanently put a stop to dandruff, dry scalp, split ends, hair loss, thinning hair and other unhealthy problems! It can grow your hair faster, longer, thicker, and more beautiful in as little as 3 weeks! Uncover my secret at http://makemyhairgrowfaster.org/mira-hair-oil

Top 5 Acne Scar Removal Treatments for You!
If you ever had the misfortune of suffering from an acne breakout, you sure know how painful it is! The worst part of an acne attack is that it leaves lots of ugly scars on your skin long after the acne is gone! There are lots of acne scar removal treatments available; in reality, while some of these treatments do remove the scars, other simply hide your scars for a temporary period. Depending on your needs and requirements, you may want to go for one or the other treatment! In this article, I will tell you about five such treatments. Note that some of these can be real expensive, so choose with care!
Laser Treatment: Also known as laser resurfacing, this treatment involves heating up the dermis of the skin and then removing the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin), using a laser beam! Note that depending on the age of your scar, it can take several such laser treatments before you get rid of them completely!
Chemical peels: The chemical peels method takes a slightly different approach for removing the skin's epidermis: it uses a very powerful acid for the scar removal. As a matter of fact, this acne scar removal treatment is highly recommended by many skin care specialists!
Dermabrasion and Microdermabrasion: Dermabrasion is yet another treatment you can use for acne scars. Note that it does not completely remove your scars (unless they are very superficial scars), but it does help alleviate the visibility of even very deep acne scars. Dermabrasion involves the use of a wire brush at a very high speed in order to remove the skin's outer layer!
Microdermabrasion is a newer technique that takes a slightly different approach for removing the outer layer of the skin: instead of using a wire, it involves blowing crystal balls on the affected area. Most people these days prefer this treatment to dermabrasion. However, the thing to keep in mind is that just like dermabrasion, microdermabrasion also does not remove the scars completely (except superficial scars), and even for that to happen, you may need to undergo several treatments!
Fillers: Using fillers is yet another technique for hiding your ugly acne scars. Under this treatment, you will have fillers (for example, collagen) injected into the affected area. Like chemical peels, this treatment too involves the use of strong acid. Just like microdermabrasion, it only helps to hide your acne scars and does not remove them completely, and even for that, you would need to go for regular treatment as the results achieved from it are usually short-lived!
Surgery: Most of the above methods outlined above only help to hide your acne scars. If you what to get rid of them once and for all, you would want to go down the road of surgery. Yes, surgery is more expensive compared to the above treatments, but as they say, you get what you pay for! Under surgery, the each and every scar is removed by cutting it out and then filling up the hole in the skin by stitching or grafting!
Depending on the age and depth of your scars, you would achieve different results with different treatments. Unless your scar is very deep and old, surgery is something you should use only as a last resort, not just because it is very expensive, but also because it takes time for your body to recover from a surgery!

Hair Loss Shampoo Guide
It is undeniable that a proper hair care regimen is essential for people who are suffering from hair loss. However, even until now people are still not sure of the best ways to take great care of their hair and scalp. So in this article, we will discuss about hair loss shampoo which is the most commonly used solution when it comes to hair loss.
As we know, shampoos are basically a form of cleansing agent that contains chemicals like sodium lauryl sulfate that helps to remove unwanted build up in our hair and scalp, keeping them clean and manageable. If you purchased your own shampoos, then you will notice that they are normally made to suit 3 main types of hair conditions. Which are normal hair, oily hair and dry hair. The main difference between them, are the amount of moisturizing oil they contained. Shampoo for dry hair will contain the highest level of moisturizing oil, as it needs to keep the hair even more moisturized from its already drying state after every wash. A simple mistake like using the wrong type of shampoo for your hair condition, can greatly affect the health of your hair which may lead to hair loss in long-term.
Beside the above mention shampoo types, they are also categorized in different pH level. Due to the chemicals used in the shampoos, shampoos are usually more alkaline in nature and this will cause our hair to easily tangle. Therefore, manufacturers have produces acidic and pH balanced shampoo types to counter this after use effect.
The next group of shampoos is the ones that contained special medicated ingredients which are normal from herbs or natural plant extracts. They are commonly used for the treating of scalp problems such as dandruff, itchiness and other. These shampoo may seem to be very beneficial when it comes to maintaining healthy hair but they will not do much when dealing with hair loss. Unless you are using special hair loss shampoos such as DHT blocker shampoo.
However, normal shampoos will still improve scalp condition and temporary prevent hair loss that is scalp related. By using them regularly in the correct way, they will help to keep your hair and scalp clean and remove any unwanted build up such as androgen which can cause hair loss.
The most common mistaken that people did when using shampoo is to pour it directly on the scalp when washing. By doing so will cause your hair to be clean unevenly. Always lather the shampoo on your palm and then gently scrub your scalp with moderate strength, following by rinsing it off thoroughly. So getting the right shampoo and using it in the right method will surely guarantee your hair to be healthy for the years to come.

Carrot Soap: Benefits and Uses
Over the years, our skins may have become dry and damaged because we have been using products that are incompatible with our skin type. We may have not known it, but our pimples and blackheads are that stubborn because we keep using harsh soaps. Well, this article can inform you about another alternative that is natural and may just be what your skin needs!
Probably most of us have heard and/or used placenta, kojic or glutathione soaps. These are only some of the most commonly used and recommended skin care soaps. However, have you ever heard or tried the carrot soap?
The carrot soap is, of course, made from the natural ingredient, carrots, which have beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is a very powerful anti oxidant that functions to remove harmful and damaging toxins from our body. In addition to that, it boosts the regeneration, renewal and removal of skin cells which makes you shed old, dead cells faster. The result is a finer and whiter skin to those who have tried the product because new, healthy cells are exposed. Acne marks and pimple scars are made lighter by the constant use of this product. Some product users have described their skin complexion as healthy, pinkish-white. It can also even out one's skin tone.
Carrot soap also contains another vitamin found in carrots, vitamin A. Vitamin A is strongly related to vision-development. Other than that, however, it also helps fight and prevent infections. In our skin, infections that commonly occur come in the form of acnes and pimples. Moreover, it has vitamin C that can also aid in healing stubborn pimples and blackheads. In a matter of days, one can see his/her pimples drying up. The vitamin C component can also help us look young and radiant because it triggers the production of collagen, a substance that is known to prevent wrinkles. Collagen is also responsible in defending us from skin-ageing.
Amazingly, this soap can also help heal wounds, burns, cuts, ringworm, skin allergies such as scabies, prickly heat, eczema, white spots while keeping the body free of emitting offensive smells. To get rid of dandruff, flaking and scalp hair destitute, you can use the product on your head and hair. Damage due to the heat of the sun is also eased through using carrot soaps.
Now, this product is slowly getting recognition. People are getting more interested with how the product works because it is mild, organic and free of chemicals- ideal for those who have sensitive skins. Some chemicals that are aggressive can cause irritation on the skin. Usually the perfume added to some soaps cause redness, burning, peeling and can make some people develop a medical skin condition. With regular use, the effects can be visible in 6 weeks and can produce results that are of a longer term. Use lotions as well to keep your skin properly hydrated and moisturized. Sun block is also necessary to protect your skin from the heat of the sun.

Skin Treatments for Acne - 3 Steps You Shouldn't Miss
In this article we shall be talking of skin treatments for acne. We should understand what causes acne and how to take care of our skin in order to prevent and ultimately cure it. It isn't enough just to wash your skin repeatedly for eliminating acne. This article focuses on 3 steps you should take in order to treat acne effectively. Most people might just do one or two steps, so their results are not as effective or long lasting.
The 3 important stages involved in skin treatment for acne are:
Cleansing and exfoliating,
Keeping the skin clear,
Medicine (if required).
1. Cleansing and Exfoliating:
Acne is a skin disorder which is mainly caused due to inflammation of the skin glands and their hair follicles. Acne is formed under the skin, so just washing away the skin surface oils will not do you much good. In fact, too much washing of the skin might aggravate the problem by causing irritation of whiteheads and blackheads.
It would be much better if you use mild cleansers in order to clean your skin. Some of the recommended skin cleansers available in the market are - Cetaphil, Clarisonic, Aveeno, Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System. These are some of the popular brands of acne cleansers which are very popular and widely used in skin treatments for acne.
Besides skin cleaning, it is also important to exfoliate with the help of facial scrub. Exfoliating means removing the layer of dead skin cells. This step is very important if you want to enjoy a healthy and acne-free skin. Again, some of the recommended products for face scrubs are - Nivea Face Scrub, St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Aveeno Daily Scrub and Olay Scrub to name just a few.
2. Keep The Skin Clear:
This is the next step you need to undertake. Remember what I said in the beginning of the article. Most people just perform one or two of these steps and then wonder why their acne is not gone permanently. You shouldn't skip any of these steps if you want to enjoy a healthy skin which is free from acne and pimples.
In order to keep your skin clear, you should use oil-free cosmetics, lotions and sunscreens. Try to avoid hair gels as they tend to be oily. Stay a foot or two away from oily cosmetic products as they are not good for you since you have this acne problem.
When you buy any skin product look for label that reads "noncomedogenic" which means it won't clog your skin pores. Some of the popular oil-free products you can try out are as follows:
Oil Free Lotions - Neutrogena, Earth Mama Angel
Oil Free Sunscreens - Coppertone Lotion, Neutrogen Ultra Sheer, Eltamd UV Clear etc.
3. Medications:
This third step is also important otherwise your acne treatment would not be complete. I have listed down some popular medications you can try out for treating acne. Some of them might require advice from a skin specialist before you try them out.
a) Salicylic acid: This is commonly used to treat non-inflammed acne. It is a popular ingredient which can be found in many lotions, creams and other acne treatment products. There are a few products from Neutrogena and Glytone which contain Salicylic acid in order to treat acne.
b) Benzoyl peroxide: It helps in killing bacteria, unplugging oil ducts and thus helping in preventing the spread of pimples. You should start gently by using a 5% gel or lotion once a day. After a week, increase the use to twice per day. If the acne still persists after a month or two, try a 10% solution.
Most of these lotions are available over-the-counter without requiring a doctor's prescription. Some of the leading products containing Benzoyl peroxide are - Topix Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Wash, Glytone Acne Gel, Topix Benzoyl Peroxide 5% Wash, Neutrogena Vanishing Formula.
c) Antibiotics - These are to be taken only with a doctor's prescription. They are helpful in treating acne which is red and/or swollen. If your acne problem is persistent even after trying out other medications and above steps, then you might need to consult a doctor for trying out antibiotics.
Make sure you follow the doctor's instructions properly and also take plenty of water throughout the day when you are on a dose of antibiotics. Their use might increase your skin's sensitivity to sun, so try to wear a sunscreen lotion when going outdoors while you are on antibiotics treatment.
Do you want to know which are the topmost products in the market for treating acne? Then you can read our article which rates these products here - acne product reviews.
Also don't miss out our article on home remedies for acne as you can save a lot of money by treating acne condition at home with natural ingredients.

Get Thicker Hair Naturally - 10 Tips to Get Thicker Stronger Hair
Experts say that hair grows for three to five years prior to falling out naturally. During this period, there are various steps you can take to make it stronger and thicker. In addition, take steps to prevent hair loss. Some of the top ten tips include:
Washing
Washing using hot water is not advised. Use cold water so it will close your hair cuticles and retain the moisture. It's also preferable to wash your hair frequently to help keep it clean and healthy.
Massaging
Massaging your head will increase its circulation and this will help make your hair healthy. Healthy hair is naturally strong. The key here is to massage the scalp, not just move the hair around.
Diet
Eating healthy food can help your hair to grow strong. Though a generally healthy diet is good, foods rich in vitamins A and D are particularly good for healthy hair.
Supplements
Supplements with folic acid, biotin and B6 are good for strengthening your hair. Nutritional supplements with minerals like zinc, silica and magnesium may also help with thick hair growth.
Exercise
Exercising also helps to make hair strong and healthy, since hair is part of the human body. Exercise routines that will promote blood flow and lower stress are the most effective.
Drinks
Plenty of water and fruit juices are also encouraged. At the same time, drinks which contain caffeine and alcohol should be avoided.
Natural Treatments
Some people say that a mixture of coconut oil and white hibiscus kept in sunlight for a 7 days is good for your hair. In this case, the oil is used to massage the scalp, and it will help make your hair stronger. There are other natural treatments you can try.
Hair products
Choose treatment products carefully. Alcohol based products are harmful to many types of hair. This is because alcohol tends to make it dry; and hair without moisture breaks easily.
Trimming
In most cases, the ends are weaker than the rest. For this reason, you need to trim the hair regularly. Just a little trim at the ends once a month or so is enough to leave you with strong hair. This also has got the advantage of taking off the split ends.
Doctor's advice
After you have done all these and more and your hair is still weak you may want to consult your doctor. There could be an underlying health issue.

Acne Advice Anyone Can Find Quite Useful
More review at www.sourchengine.info and www.latestsearchengine.info.
Ensure that you're getting at least eight glasses of water every day to help your skin to be clear of acne. Dry skin can clog up your pores, leading to even more pimples, so drink enough water daily and you'll find your skin is softer, more moisture-rich, and zit-free, too!
To get rid of acne, make sure you are getting a good night's sleep every night. Sleep is what your body needs to repair itself from the wear and tear of the day, and this also holds true for your skin. If you are already on medication for acne, this also allows ample time for it to work so that you can see results in the next day.
A great tip to help reduce acne problems is if you drink chamomile tea, save the teabags. Not only does the chamomile tea help relax you which can reduce the amount of acne in itself, the teabag is a great natural cure. Soak the bag in cold water for about thirty seconds and then apply it to the acne.
Use toothpaste to help your acne. This is a very effective home remedy for drying up pimples. Simply dab a small amount on the pimple, rub it in gently, and leave overnight. Upon waking, wash your face, and apply a little oil-free moisturizer to the area. You will definitely notice a difference. Two warnings when using toothpaste: only use the paste, not gel, and never apply toothpaste to broken skin.
Sliced or grated cucumber applied directly to problem areas can be a great treatment for acne. In the same way that cucumber helps tighten up skin around the eyes, it can reduce the size of enlarged pores as well as hydrate the skin. Apply the cucumber and leave it on for about 15 minutes for maximum benefit.
If you wear glasses or even sun glasses, it is very important that you keep them clean. Wearing dirty glasses will clog the pores around your nose, causing you to break out. Clean your glasses before you wear them each day, and you won't have to worry about them causing you any breakouts.
Try to live a healthy life. Make sure that you get plenty of sleep, drink plenty of water, and get a decent amount of exercise. In addition, try to make sure you control your stress levels. Your skin and your body work together and if you take good care of one you will also help the other.
As you can see, problems with acne are not totally incurable. If you follow the tips that were discussed in the article, your acne problem will be aided, if not cured. But please see your physician or a dermatologist before doing anything very extreme, as they may have useful warnings or cautions.
Others find that more information about pimples and acne helps them make there skin smooth and clean.

5 Ways Of Dealing With Acne Scarring
More review at www.sourchengine.info and www.latestsearchengine.info.
Acne scarring is one of the most adverse effects of the acne skin condition. Although you may have gotten rid of your acne you may be left with the unsightly effects of this condition. There are a number of ways of dealing with acne scars and the methods you use are dependent upon your preference and what works best for you skin. To determine the best approach, it may require a process of trial and error. However the following are 5 great ways you can deal with this problem.
1. The use of scar removal creams. Some products promise to remove scars but do not. The key however is to find a product that is proven to be effective in removing acne scars, based on its track record as well as on reviews from persons that have used the product in the past. Scar removal creams work well to get rid of scars, that is, if you find a good one. There are a number of great creams to do the job of removing scars, a simple Google search would help you to find a number of useful product. If your search turns up empty contact me on my blog and I'll be sure to point you in the right direction.
2. Homemade remedies, like scar removal creams, homemade remedies also work well in getting rid of scars, however these may take a much longer time before you are able to see results. The homemade remedies are endless and a little research would definitely lead you in the right direction. One of the remedies that is well known is the application of lemon juice directly on the scars. Lemon juice is said to be a natural skin lightener and may result in a reduction in the appearance of the scars overtime.
3. Skin exfoliation, the skin can be exfoliated with the use of facial scrubs. The action of scrubbing the face on a daily basis removes dead skin and produces a more youthful appearance overtime. Acne scarring can be significantly improved after embarking on a consistent regimen of daily exfoliation using a facial scrub that is not too abrasive, that is, one that has small particles. Abrasive scrubs may actually damage the skin more than improving its appearance.
4. Reducing the frequency of squeezing pimples. When we squeeze acne we rupture the skin. When the skin is ruptured it has to be repaired by healing. During the process or healing scar formation develops. It is important to note that scar formation may develop during the process of healing acne without squeezing them so it is essential not to aggravate the situation further and cause more scarring, by squeezing the face.
5. Incorporate the above 4 measures. To achieve better results in a faster time following the above 4 procedures would be very effective. Treating acne may require a collective effort since one particular way may not be as effective. Usually it takes a number of procedures working together to in order for the best results to be seen.
With this information you could now effectively deal with acne scarring once and for all.

3 Ways to Get Rid of Blackheads
More review at www.sourchengine.info and www.latestsearchengine.info.
Blackheads refer to those tiny black blots which usually appear in the nose, around the mouth and on the forehead. Blackheads are technically known as open comedones and are caused when there is an overproduction of natural oil due to the sudden disturbance on the sebaceous glands. Oily skin by default is not a cause for blackheads but when exposed to pollution and dirt, an oily skin becomes a haven for bacteria. The oil clogs the skin's pores and when the pores are then unclogged, oil is exposed to air. It reacts to air making it dark in color. Now that's how blackheads are formed. How to get rid of blackheads is easy and can be done in the comforts of your home or with the help of an expert. In getting rid of blackheads, the main objective is to avoid excessive oil and you can do that by doing the following:
1. Exfoliate
Facial scrubs are available in the grocery stores for your consumption. Wash your face with this scrub but be careful that you do not scratch your skin as it may cause irritation and other skin problems later on. Exfoliation must be done once or twice a week only so as to give the skin a time to recover. It is inevitable that the use of facial scrubs not only removes the dirt off the face but it could also scratch the outer layer of the skin so exfoliation must be done in moderation.
2. Steam
Boil water then let it simmer in low heat. Position your exfoliated face on the direction of the steam for 4-5 minutes. This will open your pores and let the blackheads come out on their own. If you are not comfortable with steaming, you may opt to place warm compress on your face for 5-10 minutes. This gives the same results as steaming except that this takes longer.
3. Moisturize
Now that your face is clean and oil free, moisturize it so it will not be dry. Honey is good on the skin and has natural moisturizing property. Apply honey on the face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes then wash your face with water only. You can also apply commercial moisturizer on the face but make sure to select those which are water-based.
There are other options that you might consider depending on availability of time. Washing the face with water 2-3 times daily, once in the morning, noon and at night, will prevent the oil from building up. Peeling strips and masks are also available to remove blockage from the skin. Treatments containing salicylic acid, benzoyl, alpha hydroxide and lactic acid can be bought from the pharmacies without a doctor's prescription.

Acne Treatment Right From Home
Acne is an uncomfortable and embarrassing skin condition that affects thousands of people across the globe. It develops when oily substances and bacteria get into the skin and clog the pores. It most commonly appears on a person's face, neck, or back, but can show up on almost any area of the body. If acne is a concern for you, it is a good idea to visit a dermatologist, however, there are several things that a person can do right from home for acne treatment.
Daily Cleansing- This is the number one acne remedy. It is important to find a gentle face cleanser that works well with your skin type. Regular deodorant soaps or body washes should never be used on the face or effected area. They will strip the skin of its moisture and make matters worse. After cleansing, use a mild moisturizer. It is essential to do this twice a day.
Cucumber- Peel a cucumber and put it into a food processor until a paste is formed. Apply the paste to the skin and allow it to sit for 30 minutes. This is an effective acne prevention method and also works to refresh the skin.
Cumin Seeds- Grind cumin seeds with a few drops of water into a paste and apply it to the skin. Leave the paste on the skin for about an hour, then rinse and pat dry.
Aloe Vera- Aloe Vera gel can be applied directly to the acne areas. This will sooth the skin and help to reduce any swelling and redness that may have developed. Aloe Vera is also available in a pill form and may be taken orally to help prevent the onset of acne.
Rose Water and Sandalwood- Make a paste from sandalwood and rose-water and apply it to the skin. Allow it to sit for at least 30 minutes before rinsing and patting dry.
Fresh Garlic- Although it will produce a bit of an odor, garlic paste can be applied directly to acne irritated skin. Garlic is known to have very effective antiseptic properties and will begin to dry out the acne.
Lavender Oil- Lavender oil can be applied to acne irritated skin to cut redness and swelling and ease any discomfort. Allow the oil to sit for as long as you would like.
Cooked Oats- Cook unflavored oatmeal as directed on the package and apply it to the irritated skin. Allow it to sit and dry for 15-25 minutes. The oatmeal works to dry out the acne and sooth the skin.
Egg Whites- Apply egg whites to the skin and allow them to sit for 20 minutes. Rinse the skin and pat dry.
Fruit and Vegetable Mixture- This is a popular acne treatment. Combine one peeled and seeded apple, Â½ cucumber, 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt, and 1 tablespoon of honey. Use a food processor to make the mixture into a paste. Apply it to the skin and allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry. This will help to reduce scarring.
All of these home acne treatments are effective. Try some of them to find the acne remedy that works best for your skin.

Acne is a condition that is not only unsightly but can also be painful making your skin feel hot and inflamed.
There are many natural skin care remedies and washes for Acne but not many of them address the pain or discomfort associated with it. That's where natural essential oils and some very specific ingredients from your kitchen and garden can be extremely useful.
There are many soothing oils that calm inflamed irritated skin.
Ingredients helpful for inflammation and acne are:
Sweet Almond OilTea Tree OilAloe VeraApple Cider VinegarCalendulaCucumberEucalyptusManuka OilRosehip Oil
These ingredients can be used in facial acne treatments like masks, cleansers and moisturizers.
You can make a basic Acne cleanser and make up remover as follows:
2 tblsp sweet almond or avocado oil
1 vitamin E capsule or 1/2 tsp evening primrose oil
20 drops of neroli, sweet orange or lavender oil (or a mix of the two)
5 drops tea tree oil
few drops lemon juice
Mix well together and store in a glass dropper bottle or jar. Shake well before each use then apply with cotton pad and rinse off with warm water.
You can also make a soothing healing acne mask using:
2 tblsp finely ground oatmeal
1 tblsp extra virgin olive, jojoba, avocado, apricot, sweet almond or coconut oil
5 drops tea tree oil (optional and you can add any of the other oils mentioned above)

The oatmeal, chamomile and lavender oil if you have it are great for soothing angry inflamed skin and for "zapping" acne spots and can be used in pretty much any natural skin care recipes.
If you have very severe acne you can follow a more in depth course using essential oils over the course of several weeks to stop the cycle of acne and give your skin a healing boost.
You can add a small amount of tea tree, lavender or rosemary oil to moisturizers and toners also to use them a gentle anti acne remedy and preventative.

Hair Loss After Illness or Surgery
Although hair loss after illness or surgery is a common occurrence, many people are not aware of this problem until it happens to them. Rarely are they warned in advance of the possibility of losing large amounts of hair after dealing with illness or surgery. Because the increased shedding begins two to three months later, the association may be overlooked.
The most common type of hair loss that occurs after illness or surgery is telogen effluvium. These conditions can create a shock to the system. The hair growth cycle, being very sensitive, thrives on balance and equilibrium. It does not like to be disturbed. Any change, imbalance or stressor that forces the body to have to adapt can cause telogen effluvium. When this happens the normal hair growth cycle that is delicately balanced between growing hairs, resting hairs and shedding hairs becomes disrupted.
In the normal hair growth cycle approximately 85% of hairs are in the growing stage. The other 15% are in the resting/shedding stage. With telogen effluvium a higher percentage of hairs start to retreat to the resting stage where they will be shed approximately three months later. The longer the condition lasts, the more the ratio changes.
When the illness is acute, meaning it comes on suddenly and is short-lived, the shedding will return to normal within several weeks to six months maximum. The thinning will hardly be noticeable to others. A long-lasting internal imbalance can cause prolonged shedding and severe thinness that is noticeable to others. The condition is then known as chronic telogen effluvium.
When surgery is involved, this creates another shock to the system. Whether surgery is due to a medical disorder or a broken bone, hair loss can occur.
Anesthesia, medications and additional medical procedures are also known to cause hair loss. Antibiotic use that is necessary for illness and surgery can cause other undesirable conditions that can cause hair loss if one does not restore beneficial intestinal flora that was destroyed through antibiotic use. All of these components can contribute to the occurrence of telogen effluvium.
The more complicated the condition and procedures are, the more likely one may develop telogen effluvium. Some people are more prone to this condition than others. Once a person develops telogen effluvium they are more likely to experience it again when another opportunity presents itself.
If a person is otherwise active, healthy, fit, youthful, well nourished, and emotionally well, the hair growth cycle will have an easier time restoring itself. If other physical or emotional ailments exist when telogen effluvium begins, the condition may persist longer and become more severe. Our built-in healing system is based on priorities. It will not bother trying to grow hair when it has to re-establish balance in other areas.
The best defense against illness or surgery related telogen effluvium is to take the time to fully heal and recover. The body will need extra nourishment during this time, especially if medications are being used, as certain medications are known to deplete a variety of nutrients that are necessary for healthy hair growth.
We live in a society that does not often honor taking the time for proper healing after illness and surgery. Being good to oneself and getting lots of rest, pampering and nourishment should not be considered a luxury. Not only is it necessary, it will also decrease the chances of long-lasting telogen effluvium and other possible complications.
Female hair loss can be improved or reversed in almost all cases. UNDERSTANDING FEMALE HAIR LOSS explains the types, causes and natural treatments for female hair loss. Includes step-by-step information to create your own natural hair loss remedies using essential oils and other natural ingredients.
Melanie Vonzabuesnig used aromatherapy to successfully treat her own hair loss problem. She has become an advocate for women with hair loss issues. For aromatherapy hair loss formulas and information see: VZ BOTANICALS

5 Ways Of Dealing With Acne Scarring
Acne scarring is one of the most adverse effects of the acne skin condition. Although you may have gotten rid of your acne you may be left with the unsightly effects of this condition. There are a number of ways of dealing with acne scars and the methods you use are dependent upon your preference and what works best for you skin. To determine the best approach, it may require a process of trial and error. However the following are 5 great ways you can deal with this problem.
1. The use of scar removal creams. Some products promise to remove scars but do not. The key however is to find a product that is proven to be effective in removing acne scars, based on its track record as well as on reviews from persons that have used the product in the past. Scar removal creams work well to get rid of scars, that is, if you find a good one. There are a number of great creams to do the job of removing scars, a simple Google search would help you to find a number of useful product. If your search turns up empty contact me on my blog and I'll be sure to point you in the right direction.
2. Homemade remedies, like scar removal creams, homemade remedies also work well in getting rid of scars, however these may take a much longer time before you are able to see results. The homemade remedies are endless and a little research would definitely lead you in the right direction. One of the remedies that is well known is the application of lemon juice directly on the scars. Lemon juice is said to be a natural skin lightener and may result in a reduction in the appearance of the scars overtime.
3. Skin exfoliation, the skin can be exfoliated with the use of facial scrubs. The action of scrubbing the face on a daily basis removes dead skin and produces a more youthful appearance overtime. Acne scarring can be significantly improved after embarking on a consistent regimen of daily exfoliation using a facial scrub that is not too abrasive, that is, one that has small particles. Abrasive scrubs may actually damage the skin more than improving its appearance.
4. Reducing the frequency of squeezing pimples. When we squeeze acne we rupture the skin. When the skin is ruptured it has to be repaired by healing. During the process or healing scar formation develops. It is important to note that scar formation may develop during the process of healing acne without squeezing them so it is essential not to aggravate the situation further and cause more scarring, by squeezing the face.
5. Incorporate the above 4 measures. To achieve better results in a faster time following the above 4 procedures would be very effective. Treating acne may require a collective effort since one particular way may not be as effective. Usually it takes a number of procedures working together to in order for the best results to be seen.
With this information you could now effectively deal with acne scarring once and for all.

4 Natural Ways to Remove Acne Scars Forever!
You know - I think it is probably easier to get rid of your old habits than those terrible acne scars! I mean, these scars don't just disfigure your face; they can also stay for a long time, which is why they are quite annoying to say the least! So, is there something you can do to remove them quickly and easily? Well, in this article I will tell you about 4 easy and natural methods you can apply in order to get rid of acne scars completely!
I must tell you beforehand: please keep your expectations reasonable! I mean, if you are undergoing an expensive surgery, that is one thing, but when you are using homemade treatments, it would take some time for the scars to heal, so please don't expect overnight cure! The advantage of these treatments is that most of them are inexpensive and free from any kind of side-effects; if you want to get rid of your blemishes but are short on budget, these remedies are what you should use!
1. Tomatoes: You might have eaten those sweet-n-sour tomatoes a dozen times but did you know they can also help you get rid of acne scars? Tomatoes are a rich source of Vitamin A which is why it nourishes and rejuvenates your skin. By helping your skin grow quickly, it manages to remove the scars from your face!
Using tomatoes for acne scar removal is very easy: no, obviously you won't be eating tomatoes; instead, you should slice a tomato into four pieces, crush them into a pulp, and apply the paste on your face! There is another method you can use which is a bit more complicated: take tomatoes and avocados/cucumbers, grind them together to make a paste out of them, and then apply it on your face as a facemask.
No matter which method you use, it is recommended that you keep the tomatoes on your skin for at least an hour, before washing your face with lukewarm water!
2. Sandalwood: Sandalwood is yet another remedy for quick acne scar removal! Mix sandalwood with rosewater to make a paste, and then apply that paste on your face (assuming that you got acne scars on your face, if you have got the scars in some other area of your body then that is where you should apply the paste instead). Don't wash off the paste from your face too quickly, no matter what! You should keep the sandalwood paste on your face for at least an hour or longer (I would suggest that you apply the paste on your face at bedtime and leave it there overnight), after which you can wash off your face with a mild soap and water!
3. Lemon Juice: The lemon juice treatment for acne scar removal is quite similar to the sandalwood treatment discussed above, in that you need to apply the juice from the crushed lemon on your face at bedtime using a clean cotton swab or cotton ball, and leave it there overnight! The strong acidic and anti-bacterial components of this vegetable would help get rid of the scars and blemishes caused by acne (if drunk, it also detoxifies your body)!
You might experience burning sensation immediately after applying the juice but it usually lasts only for a little while. If the skin burns too much then dilute the juice with water! Please note that daily usage of lemon can cause your skin to go dry, so, in case you notice flakey skin then add a little bit of honey or (if you are applying the juice at bedtime, in which case it would be difficult for you to get sound sleep with honey on your face) milk to the lemon juice!
4. Mederma Gel: Did you know that the Mederma gel is extremely effective in minimizing the ugly appearance of acne scars? Well, that is because this gel is rich in both Aloe Vera and onion! Note that it does NOT remove your acne scars completely, but if you are going to say, a party, then this gel can reduce the visibility of the acne scars on your face. Usage instructions: you can apply it on your face for no more than four times a day; in case you experience any kind of skin irritation, then you should immediately STOP its usage!
Note that these are just some of the methods you can use for acne scar removal; there so many more acne scar removal remedies used widely! For more information, please visit: http://totalinfotips.com/acne/5-natural-ways-remove-acne-scars-permanently.php
