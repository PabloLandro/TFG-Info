Treating a wax burn
16th April 2015
Waxing can seem like a fantastic way to get rid of unwanted body hair, but as with a lot of beauty treatments, it does have its downsides. One of the drawbacks of waxing is the risk of burn, which can occur if the wax applied to the skin is too hot, causing a great deal of pain and unsightly blemishing. If you’ve experienced a wax burn, follow the steps below for a speedy recovery.

Cool the skin
Submerge the burn in cool water, or allow cool water to run over the affected area. If you’ve suffered a facial burn, soak a flannel in cool water and apply it directly to the burn. You should allow at least five minutes for this process, but closer to twenty minutes will yield better results.
Apply ice
You must never apply ice directly to a burn, but instead wrap a cloth or flannel around an icepack or ice cubes. The cloth should then be pressed against the burn, reducing swelling and soothing the pain.
Aloe it
Aloe is the magic ingredient when it comes to treating burns, and every home should have some on hand. 100% pure aloe vera gel is the best option for treating burns, and it is important to try and buy a clean, healthy product with no chemical additives. The gel should be gently dabbed on with your fingertips, and reapplied several times a day.
Bandage if necessary
To avoid infection, bandaging your burn might be a good idea, especially if it’s in an area that is susceptible to bacteria. If your burn is facial or simply too awkward to dress, make a conscious effort to keep any dirt or unnatural products away from it, and always keep it clean.
Treat the pain
Over-the-counter ibuprofen can not only eliminates pain, but also reduces swelling, and is a very effective tool in the treatment of wax burns.
If you’re looking to get rid of unwanted body hair without suffering the consequences of waxing, laser hair removal is a safe and fast way to achieve smooth, beautiful skin. You don’t have to worry about growing your hair out, nasty burns, or the trouble of the hair returning shortly afterwards.
