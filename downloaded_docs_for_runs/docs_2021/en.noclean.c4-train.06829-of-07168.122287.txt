The Bone-Strengthening Power of Vitamin K
Posted on September 6, 2018 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Vitamin K1 is well known for it‚Äôs important role in blood clotting, but there is also much scientific evidence that vitamin K plays a crucial role in both the reduction of bone fractures and in reducing abnormal calcifications in the body. This makes it an important nutrient for both bone and heart health.
Vitamin K not only helps preserve calcium in the bones, it aids the dissolution of calcium elsewhere, including in the arteries and kidneys. Studies found that those with a higher dietary intake of vitamin K2 had less heart disease and less calcification of the coronary artery. Also, it was shown that vitamin K1 supplementation slowed the progression of coronary artery calcification.
Remember, when there is an excess of calcium in the blood, there is usually a deficiency in the bones. (See Why I don‚Äôt Take Calcium).
Vitamin K1 was shown to increase bone mineral density in rats, and vitamin K2, was shown to improve the quality of bone and strengthen itagainst fracture. Calcium supplementation may increase bone density without improving its resistance to fracture, and at the same time increase calcifications throughout the body.
One study done on rats showed that vitamin K2 in the form of MK-4improved the strength of bones that had been weakened by a magnesium deficiency. (See The Role of Magnesium in Balancing Calcium).
According to Dr. Thomas Levy in his book, Death by Calcium, human studies indicate that supplementing with 45 mg daily of vitamin K2 (MK-4) will sustain bone mineral density and prevent fractures from osteoporosis. He further recommends taking a multi-K formula that includes K1, K2 (MK-4), and K2 (MK-7), as found in a product like Life Extension Super K with Advanced K2 Complex.
The good news is that there is no known toxicity or undesired side effects associated with vitamin K, even when given to newborns or pregnant women.
Even though vitamin K is a blood clotting agent, it does not cause abnormal clotting. You will still want to check with your doctor before taking vitamin K if you are taking a blood thinner like warfarin or have another medical condition.

Magnesium‚Äôs Role in Balancing Calcium
Posted on August 16, 2018 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
For a review of why I don‚Äôt take calcium and how an excess is linked to osteoporosis and other chronic degenerative diseases, read Why I don‚Äôt Take Calcium Supplements #1, #2, and #3.
When calcium blood levels are high, you‚Äôll most likely have a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium has been called nature‚Äôs calcium channel blocker, helping to keep calcium levels in check.
Studies have shown that excess calcium can contribute to calcium deposits (like kidney stones and atherosclerosis) and that magnesium helps dissolve calcium deposits.
Magnesium helps reduce inflammation by lowering excess calcium in cells that induces inflammation. This, in turn, helps keep calcium in the bones and reduces the risk of other chronic degenerative diseases.
Chronic inflammation due to calcium excess is frequently found in those with cancer. Studies have shown that those with a higher magnesium intake seem to have less risk of colon, lung, and rectal cancers. One study showed that post-menopausal women with breast cancer had a higher calcium to magnesium ratio than those without breast cancer.
It is difficult to take toxic levels of magnesium (check with your doctor if you have kidney problems). As long as an excess of calcium is present inside the cells, magnesium is needed to balance it.
Just like prescription calcium channel blockers, magnesium supplements may lower blood pressure temporarily. In those with already low blood pressure, this may be a problem. If this happens, stop taking supplemental magnesium until your blood pressure returns to normal, and then reduce the amount until it doesn‚Äôt have a negative effect on your blood pressure.
Just like vitamin C, if you experience diarrhea when taking magnesium, you can adjust the amount until you achieve bowel tolerance.
The word following magnesium (oxide, citrate, glycinate, malate, phosphate, carbonate, etc.) is called an anion. The anion helps you choose the best supplemental form. Dr. Levy, in his book Death by Calcium, recommends magnesium glycinate in his osteoporosis treatment protocol. He says it is well absorbed, is less likely to cause diarrhea, and is made from the amino acid glycine, which has other nutritional uses in the body.
My least favorite forms are carbonate and oxide, and I take Magnesium Complex, which is a combination of malate and citrate.
A good starting point is to get your blood levels checked for calcium. If you have excess blood levels, consider taking a magnesium supplement. If you do take calcium supplements (I don‚Äôt), be sure to take additional magnesium. Calcium helps muscles contract, and magnesium helps them to relax.

Why an apple a day might help keep the doctor away!üçé
Posted on October 13, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
In the early 20th century, an article in American Medicine magazine praised the apple as ‚Äú. . . therapeutically effective in all conditions of acidosis, gout, rheumatism, jaundice, all liver and gallbladder troubles, nervous and skin diseases caused by sluggish liver, hyperacidity, and states of autointoxication.‚Äù
Apples contain a soluble fiber called pectin, shown to have the following properties:
Pectin helps remove lead and other toxic metals from the digestive tract. This is especially beneficial for those who live in high-traffic urban areas.
Pectin stimulates the growth of beneficial bacteria in the large intestine, which can improve digestion and support the immune system.
Pectin helps lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and raise good cholesterol (HDL), making it useful against heart disease.
Pectin can help balance blood sugar.
Pectin can help manage both constipation and diarrhea.
In addition to pectin:
The peel of an apple contains quercetin, a powerful anti-inflammatory.
Apples contain the mineral boron, which helps increase blood levels of estrogen, acting as a mild ‚Äúestrogen replacement therapy.‚Äù Estrogen helps prevent calcium and magnesium loss from bones. Studies showed that just 3 mg of boron a day decreased calcium loss by 40%! An average apple contains about .5 mg of boron.
According to Psychologist James Penland, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, a lack of boron can affect mental alertness and test performance by slowing the brain‚Äôs electrical activity. Dr. Penland found that just 3 mg of boron a day increased brain activity.
Fruits, nuts, and beans are some of the best sources of boron, as well as honey.
Bonus benefits:
Apples have compounds that are anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral.
When eaten before meals, apples can help suppress the appetite.
Boron may hinder the excretion of magnesium associated with taking diuretics or digitalis.
Recommendation:
Buy organic apples. According to ewg.org, non-organic apples come in second on the list of produce that contains high amounts of toxic residues.

Beans and chocolate‚Äìa disease-fighting duo!
Posted on August 4, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Just one-half cup of cooked beans a day has been shown to reduce cholesterol by an average of 10%. They are an excellent source of fiber, help regulate blood sugar levels, and are linked to lower rates of some cancers. Beans contain phytoestrogens, which can help reduce hot flashes.
Flavonoids are antioxidants that help defend against heart disease and cancer, and cocoa contains three to five times more flavonoids than green tea. In one study, the flavonoids in chocolate made the linings of blood vessels more supple, which helped to lower blood pressure and protect against a buildup of arterial plaque. Flavonoids also help keep blood platelets from sticking together and forming clots, which guards against heart attacks and strokes.
So let‚Äôs put these two disease-fighting foods together in a yummy, healthy dessert!
Blend together until smooth:
1/2 cup cooked beans (black beans work well). If using canned, drain them first, and make sure they have no added ingredients (a little sea salt is okay). You could even use refried beans.
1 to 4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (raw, organic cacao powder is even better). The more cocoa you use, the stronger the flavor.
4 tablespoons pure maple syrup (more or less). You could also use raw honey or stevia. Refined white or brown sugar will negate some of the health benefits. Make sure that you don‚Äôt use ‚Äúpancake syrup,‚Äù which is made with artificial ingredients and high-fructose corn syrup.
1/2 teaspoon unsweetened vanilla extract
This is really rich and makes about two servings. One-half cup of black beans contains five grams of fiber, seven grams of protein, and zero fat. Raw cacao powder contains one gram of protein, zero grams of sugar, and almost two grams of fiber per tablespoon. It‚Äôs also a good source of magnesium and iron.

Eat artichokes to help protect your liver!
Posted on July 28, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
This delicious, fiber-rich vegetable contains silymarin, which has been studied and found to reduce inflammation and growth of tumor cells in the liver. These studies showed benefits for alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, liver toxicity due to drugs and chemicals, and increased survival time among patients with alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis. Silymarin also helped improve insulin resistance. (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21466434).
A widely used source of silymarin is from the seeds of the milk thistle plant, commonly taken as a supplement. Milk thistle can also be brewed as a tea.
Artichokes also contain silymarin! They aid the liver and gallbladder by helping to break down fatty foods, which can help with the absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, and help to lower cholesterol.
Artichokes are a good source of fiber, magnesium, potassium, and folate, all of which are important for heart health.
You can cook fresh artichokes, buy them frozen, or keep canned artichoke hearts on hand. Canned ones (I prefer those in glass jars) should be packed in water or extra-virgin olive oil. Read the labels!
I often top my pizza with artichoke hearts to add fiber and help digest fat in the cheese. Many pizza places offer artichokes as a topping. Add them to a green salad, chicken or tuna salad, eggs, meat and pasta dishes, or eat them with cheese and crackers, etc. Try the easy recipe below for a quick dip, spread, or pesto.
Amazing Artichoke Topping
Blend until smooth:
Approximately 10 jarred artichoke hearts (drained)
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 tablespoon dried Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, rosemary, etc.)
1/8 teaspoon mineral-rich salt
1 or 2 cloves of garlic (pressed)
Eat as is, or get creative and blend in some fresh spinach or parsley, pine nuts, or beans. Adjust liquid (a little water or liquid from the jarred artichokes) and seasonings to taste. Add a dash of cayenne for a spicy version.
Eat with 100% whole-grain crackers, cheese from grass-fed cows or sheep, and/or raw veggies. Use as a sandwich spread. Mix into pasta or rice, or use a topping for chicken, fish, or beef.

Two Brazil nuts a day may help keep the doctor away!
Posted on July 21, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
Reply
Brazil nuts contain selenium, a trace mineral essential to health. Some of selenium‚Äôs impressive benefits include:
*Acts as an antioxidant to protect cells from damage.
*Helps maintain elasticity of the skin and other tissues.
*Aids function of the pancreas.
*Helps prevent hardening of the arteries and has anti-clotting effects in the blood.
*Helps convert thyroid hormone T4 to T3 (important for energy and metabolism).
*Reduces heavy metal toxicity.
*Enhances the immune system by increasing the production of white blood cells.
*Helps improve male fertility, and important for the normal development of a baby during pregnancy.
*Helps prevent cataracts.
*Helps with dandruff and seborrhea.
Consider the following research:
Studies have shown that low levels of selenium are associated with heart disease, skin problems, cataracts, muscular dystrophy, various infections, growth retardation, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, eczema, and psoriasis.
There is a strong link between low levels of selenium and cancer, especially of the colon, prostate, ovary, breast, skin, bladder, and lungs, as well as leukemia.
Studies have shown reduced fertility due to selenium deficiency.
In Australia, studies show that there may be a relationship between crib death (SIDS) and selenium deficiency.
Research in the 1970s demonstrated the following benefits of selenium:
*Helps protect against radiation.
*Helps detoxify heavy metals such as mercury by preventing their absorption and aiding in excretion.
*In animal studies, selenium detoxified the cancer-fighting drug Adriamycin without interfering with its actions.
Selenium is best obtained from whole foods like Brazil nuts (by far, the top source), 100% whole grains, fish, onions, broccoli, tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, sesame seeds, and butter and beef from grass-fed animals. Brazil nuts are also a good source of vitamin E, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and iron. Eat them whole or add them to your salads or smoothies.
The amount of selenium found in foods depends upon several factors:
*The condition of the soil‚Äìhigher levels of selenium are generally found in western parts of The United States. In areas where selenium levels are high, males show significantly lower overall cancer death rates.
*Fertilizers that contain sulfur can prevent the absorption of selenium from the soil by the plant.
*The benefits of selenium are reduced by heat, processing, and cooking. Refining grains (enriched wheat, white rice, quick oats, etc.) can reduce selenium content up to 75%. Selenium is in the bran of wheat and the polishings of rice. Steel-cut oats are more nutritious than quick oats.
Supplementing with selenium can be tricky. The safest and best absorbed forms are selenium yeast and selenomethionine. The inorganic forms that are not well absorbed are sodium selenite and sodium selenate. Sodium selenite may also inhibit absorption of vitamin C. If you are taking a multi-vitamin/mineral or another supplement that contains selenium, check the label to find out which form it is. The inorganic forms of selenium are often added to processed foods.
Have a cup of hibiscus or milk thistle tea for some added selenium!

This frozen treat is both delicious and nutritious!
Posted on July 6, 2016 by Lisa Hernandez, Certified Nutritionist & Health Coach
2
Peel and slice a banana into pieces, then place in a glass container and freeze.
When you are ready for a cool treat, put the frozen pieces into a blender (I use a small 2-cup size), and process on high until smooth.
Place the ice cream into a serving bowl, top with chopped nuts, and sprinkle with cinnamon!
Creamy and delicious!
Bananas provide potassium, magnesium, and fiber.
The nuts contain protein, healthy fats, and fiber, which help to stabilize blood sugar and keep you full longer.
Cinnamon is a source of manganese (helps regulate blood sugar), calcium, iron, and vitamin K.
So, go cool off and satisfy your sweet tooth with some banana ice cream!
If you want to see a picture of my homemade banana ice cream, open the attached picture at the top of this email.
