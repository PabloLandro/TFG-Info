Hair Regrowth Programme
Hair regrowth - thinning hair, hairloss & baldness
1. Hair Facts
The average scalp contains about 100,000 hairs. Roughly 100 hairs are lost from the scalp every day. Each individual hair survives for an average of 4 to 4.5 years, during which time it grows about half an inch a month. Usually in its 5th year, the hair falls out and is replaced within 6 months by a new hair.
Hair is a very powerful symbol of youth and beauty in almost all societies, both now and throughout history.
2. Causes of Hair Loss
Androgenic alopecia
Hormonal changes eg. thyroid disease, childbirth, OCP
Serious illness or fever
Medications eg. chemotherapy
Excessive shampooing and blow-drying
Heavy metal poisoning
Emotional or physical stress
Nervous habits such as continual hair pulling or scalp rubbing
Burns or radiation therapy
Alopecia areata - auto immune disorder
Tinea capitis
3. Androgenetic Alopecia
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the medical name for the most common form of hair loss affecting both men and women. It affects around 50% of men and between 20% - 50% of women by the age of 50.
AGA is caused by the progressive, gradual shrinking of normal hair follicles that produce normal (terminal) hairs into miniturised hair follicles that produce fine (vellus) hairs. The terminal-to-vellus hair ratio, normally 2:1 gradually reduces until it is reversed.
Although AGA is considered by most doctors to be a cosmetic condition, it can have significant psychological and physical effects on those affected by it. Loss of hair allows increased ultraviolet light to reach the scalp and, in Australia, the highest incidence of malignant melanoma is on the scalps of balding men. AGA has also been linked to prostate and cardiac conditions in older men.
Women are particularly prone to suffering the adverse psychological effects of hairloss, as a thick head of hair is a highly valued aspect of feminine beauty in almost every culture.
AGA occurs most commonly in Caucasian men, followed by Asian and African American men. AGA has it's lowest incidence in Native American and Eskimo men. Almost all men and women with AGA begin to lose their hair prior to the age of 40 and many will commence loosing their hair by the age of 30. AGA is distinguished from allother types of Alopecia by it's gradual onset.
4. Male Pattern Baldness
Men present with the gradual thinning of hair in the temporal areas, producing a V shaped frontal hairline. As baldness progresses, a bald patch appears on the crown of the head, which increases in size as the frontal hairline recedes. Eventually the receeding frontal hairline and the bald patch meet up, leading to loss of hair on most of the top of the head, whilst the hair around the base of the head remains intact. This pattern of hair loss is classified by doctors as Norwood/Hamilton stages 1-7.
5. Female Pattern Baldness
Women usually present with diffuse thinning of hair on the crown of the head. This pattern of hair loss is classified by doctors as Ludwig stages 1-3. V shaped temporal recession does occur in women but usually to a lessor degree than in men. In general, women maintain their frontal hairline.
6. Why Me?
The precise cause of AGA is unclear. Even though AGA is inherited, the exact mechanism of inheritance has not yet been determined. It is also likely that systemic or external factors play a role.
Inherited alteration in the way individual hair follicles metabolise testosterone is thought to be the key. The hair follicle produces 5-Alpa Reductase and cytchrome P-450 aromatase. These enzymes react with testosterone to create DHT which acts as a toxin on the hair follicles. Those affected by AGA are believed to experience a higher rate of conversion of testosterone to DHT.
AGA is milder in women. This is attributed to women having lower levels of 5 alpha-reductase and cytochrome P-450 aromatase and a lower number of testosterone receptors in the individual hair follicles of the lower scalp.
7. Approved Treatments
There are currently only 2 clinically proven, TGA/FDA-approved medications available for the treatment of AGA, they are Minoxidil and Finastride.
Minoxidil
Minoxidil is the only clinically proven way to stimulate hair regrowth. Minoxidil stimulates the production of fine (vellus) hairs in the scalp. Minoxidil is used for the treatment of hereditary hair loss in both men and women.
Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Minoxidil appears to lengthen the duration of the anagen (growth) phase of hair and may also increase the blood supply to the hair follicle. Used alone, regrowth is more pronounced on the crown than in the frontal scalp and is not noted for at least 4 months. Consequently, many people become discouraged and give up using Minoxidil before it has a chance to work.
The Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller offers a safe, effective and affordable way to maximise the beneficial results of Minoxodil. Best of all, results can be acheived within 4-6 weeks with daily scalp rolling and a single application of Minoxidil.
Treatment with Minoxidil and the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller is undertaken daily, as stopping the treatment leads to a reversion to the pretreatment balding pattern.
The after photo was taken 3 months after the 1st photo. The treatment regime involved rolling once a day with the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller for approximately 2-3 minutes followed by 1ml of 5% Minoxidil applied to the area rolled and massaged into the scalp. As you can see there is exceptional regrowth of hair in the crown, as well as in the fringe and temple areas, areas where Minoxidil is typically not expected to stimulate regrowth. This photo also illustrates that the roller can be effectively used on longer hair.
Finestride
Finestride is taken orally and is a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor. It is not an antiandrogen. The drug can only be used in men. Finestride has been shown to diminish the progression of AGA in males who are treated, and to stimulate hair regrowth.
The use of Finestrade must be continued indefinately because discontinuation results in the restarting of AGA.
In women with AGA, especially those with a component of hyperandrogenism (research Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome), drugs that act as androgen suppressants (eg, spironolactone and oral contraceptives) may be beneficial. Surgical treatment of AGA has been performed for the past 4 decades via hair transplantation.
The main problem with hair transplantation is covering the bald area with sufficient donor plugs to produce a normal hair pattern. Micrografting techniques produce a more natural appearance than the old technique of transplanting plugs. Scalp reduction has been attempted to decrease the size of the scalp to be covered by transplanted hair. However the scars produced by the reduction technique often spread and become more noticeable with time.
Ideally, if treatment with Minoxidil and the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller is commened soon after the thinning of hair and hair loss becomes apparent, the need for surgical treatment can be prevented.
8. Non surgical hair regrowth using the Clearskincare Hair Restoration Programme and the Clearskincare Hair restoration Pack in combination with Minoxidil
The Clearskincare Hair Restoration Solution -
Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller
Clearskincare CP Hair Tonic
How does it work?
The Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller (needle length 0.75mm, gauge 0.25mm) has 96 finest quality surgical stainless steel needles mounted in the highest quality autoclavable grade plastic rollers and handles. Others rollers on the market were designed to be disposable and use inferior needles and toothbrush grade plastics. The Clearskincare rollers are unique and are the only rollers available worldwide that are designed to be reused, used daily and cared for as directed the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller will last for 12 months.
The Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller has 3 seperate actions that stimulate new hair regrowth on the scalp -
The needles of the roller are designed to penetrate the stratum corneum, the hard relatively impermeable outer suface of the epidermal layer of the scalp (consisting mainly of dead and dying skin cells). Hundreds of tiny channels are created through the stratum corneum, which facilitate the passage and absorption of Minoxidil into the dermis to maximize it's absorption by the hair follicles.
The roller stimulates blood flow to the hair follicles via direct scalp massage.
The roller gently exfoliates excess dead skin cells from the scalp which may otherwise have accumulated and clogged hair follicles, contributing to hair follicle malnutrition and ultimately hair follicle failure and permanent hair loss.
Minoxidil
The scalp is rolled and minoxidil applied only once daily. After rolling with the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller 1ml of 5% minoxidil is massaged gently into the are of the scalp rolled.
Minoxidil stimulates the production of fine (vellus) hairs in the scalp.
Copper Peptides
Once the minoxidil has absorbed the Clearskincare CP Hair Tonic is sprayed onto the rolled area and massaged into the scalp. The Clearskincare CP Hair Tonic is applied twice daily.
Clearskincare CP Hair Tonic, using GHK-Cu peptides, converts these new fine (vellus) into normal (terminal) hairs.
Does it hurt?
The needles of the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller are long enough to maximise the absorption of Minoxidil but are not long enough to cause any damage to the scalp or hair follicles. It is normal for the scalp to be a little sensitive when rolling is commenced, but most people report no problems after the first week. Always use the roller gently at first, increasing the pressure as you become accustomed to the sensation of scalp rolling.
Can the hair restoration roller be used for women and as well as men?
Definitely. Women can use the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller alone or in conjunction with Minoxidil. We recommend that their hair loss should also be assessed by their doctor for other symptoms of androgen excess.
Are there any side effects?
Unlike many other hair loss treatments, which require oral supplements with potential side effects, the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller does exactly as promised, it maximises the absorption of Minoxidil, improves blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles and improves scalp health.
How can I obtain Minoxidil?
Minoxidil can be readily obtained from pharmacies in Australia and throughout the world.
It is recommended that the Clearskincare Skin & Scalp Roller be used by one person only.
