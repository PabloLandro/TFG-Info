Although a tick may appear to just be a tiny pest, it can actually be very harmful to your health. Ticks carry a variety of diseases which may be transmitted to people. You can get ticks in a variety of ways. This may be from walking in the woods or just sitting in your yard. Frequently your family pet will be the one to carry the tick into the house where it then makes its way to you. However you get the tick, you must remove it promptly without leaving any trace of him on you in order to prevent getting sick.
There are many myths about the best way to remove a tick from a person. Yet, most of these are nothing more the folklore. In fact, there is only one proper way to remove a tick to reduce your chances of health problems. Find a pair of clean tweezers and grasp the tick firmly by the head. His mouth is what has embedded itself into your skin so you must get as close to this area as possible. Once you have a firm grip on the pest, do not squeeze as this can release harmful organisms into your body. Pull the tick out with a straight, steady motion. Do not yank or twist as this may not get all of the mouth out of your skin. Ensure the entire tick has been removed and place him in a jar so if you do become ill the doctor can determine which type of tick bit you. Now wash your hands and the affected area with antibacterial soap and water.
When removing the tick from your body, do not apply any substances to the tick. Although it has often been said that Vaseline, alcohol or nail polish will help to dislodge the tick, nothing is further from the truth. This will not prevent you from getting an infection and the tick will just continue to feed on you while you wait for the substance to do some good. While feeding, the tick will be releasing organisms into your body. This is what makes you sick so remove the tick immediately without adding anything to his body.
Once the tick has been removed, you will need to monitor the area to ensure an infection does not occur. This is especially important if you have any concerns that you did not remove all of the pest. Although most people have heard of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease, there are a variety of other illnesses which result from a tick bite. These include Anaplasmosis and Tularemia which may be deadly if not treated. Any disease caused by a tick can make you very ill so monitor closely as symptoms can often take up to a month to appear.
When you ask how to remove a tick from a person, you need to know more than just how to physically remove the creature. What not to do and what to look for after doing so are of just as much importance. As we all know, a tick can be deadly if left untreated. The best course of action is always prevention, but if you do get a tick follow these simple instructions to minimize the risk to your health. This is the only way to ensure your chances of getting sick from this nasty little critter are reduced.
