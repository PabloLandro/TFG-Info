Pharmacology
Indication
Tolnaftate topical is used to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm infections. Tolnaftate is also used, along with other antifungals, to treat infections of the nails, scalp, palms, and soles of the feet. The powder and powder aerosol may be used to prevent athlete's foot.

Pharmacodynamics
Tolnaftate is a synthetic over-the-counter anti-fungal agent.
Mechanism of action
Tolnaftate is a topical fungicide. Though its exact mechanism unknown, it is believed to prevent ergosterol biosynthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase. It has also been reported to distort the hyphae and to stunt mycelial growth in susceptible organisms.
