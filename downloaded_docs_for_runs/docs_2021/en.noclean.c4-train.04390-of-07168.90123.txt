10 Ways Magnesium Keeps You Healthy

5. Regulates Potassium and Sodium
Sodium and potassium are minerals that work together to regulate the body’s fluid and blood volume. Potassium is a negatively charged ion, and sodium is a positively charged ion. In order for cells in your nervous system to be able to send proper signals, they need appropriate levels of potassium inside the cells and sodium outside the cells. Magnesium is an electrolyte that allows potassium to cross cell membranes in order to enter the cells for proper function. Low levels of magnesium mean that potassium isn’t able to cross cell barriers to perform its job.
4. Prevents Heart Attack
Proper levels of magnesium prevent abnormal electrical impulses known as cardiac arrhythmias. Magnesium lowers blood pressure and prevents the formation of atherosclerosis, the hardening of the arteries that can lead to heart attack. Magnesium also aids in exercise tolerance for those diagnosed with heart conditions and decrease chest pain caused by exercise.
3. Prevents Migraines
Magnesium may play a role in the prevention of migraines. Since magnesium works to decrease the constriction of blood vessels, it can prevent the throbbing ache of blood vessels in the head. The effect of magnesium on neurotransmitters in the brain may also help prevent headaches. Magnesium oxide pills in doses of 400-500 mg per day can prevent painful migraine episodes and premenstrual migraines.
