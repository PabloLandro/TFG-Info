Pain Home > What Is Sumatriptan/Naproxen Sodium Used For?
Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium is used for treating migraine headaches. Although the medication cannot prevent migraines from occurring, it can help lessen the pain and relieve other symptoms of a migraine once it starts. Healthcare providers may also occasionally recommend sumatriptan/naproxen sodium "off-label" for treating other types of headaches. There are currently no approved sumatriptan/naproxen sodium uses for children or teens.
An Overview of Sumatriptan/Naproxen Sodium Uses
Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium (Treximet™) is a prescription migraine medication. It contains two different drugs, sumatriptan (which belongs to a group of medications known as triptans) and naproxen sodium (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID).
Migraine headaches are different from other headaches in several respects. Some of the most common migraine symptoms include:
Headache pain on one side of the head
Throbbing headache pain
Sensitivity to light or sound
Upset stomach (nausea) and vomiting
Unusual vision changes.
Some people may have an aura before their migraines occur. An aura can be any unusual sign that a migraine is about to happen, including vision changes, numbness, tingling, or speech changes. The most common type of aura is visual (seeing spots, tunnel vision, or other vision changes). Some people have migraine triggers, which are certain foods, drinks, or situations that seem to lead to a migraine (see Migraine Diet for more information).
Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium is approved for migraines with or without aura. Due to the way it works, it will not help for migraine prevention. The drug is taken to lessen the pain and other symptoms of a migraine once it starts.
