Achilles Tendon Repair
Achilles Tendon Repair
Achilles Tendonitis is commonly caused either by a small tear in the achilles tendon or by an overly tight achilles tendon. An effected tendon can cause a slew of issues including extreme pain in and around the entire foot and chronic plantar fasciitis. When there is pain in the achilles tendon a posterior calcaneal heel spur is typically present, and the tendon insertion becomes inflamed from overuse. In some cases, the posterior heel spur can break, and small bone fragments can pull off of the back of the heel. If you are experiencing any painful symptoms that may be stemming from your achilles tendon, request an appointment with one of our Podiatrists at Da Vinci Foot and Ankle and begin the road to healing.
Non-Surgical Treatments
Our Doctors have developed multiple non-surgical treatment options for those experiencing achilles tendonitis. It is always our goal to avoid surgery if the tendon is stable enough to heal without it.
Initial Doctor Examination
One of our Doctors will examine the tendon and surrounding ligaments to determine their condition with a series of steps including squeezing the tendon from side to side and feeling for any knots or protrusions. Here are a few of our “first line of defense” options:
A walking boot which can help to reduce the pain by eliminating tension/motion of the tendon. When you bend your ankle up and down during walking, it stresses and strains your Achilles tendon – and this can prevent the tendon from healing.
MLS Laser therapy can help to increase tissue healing by stimulating tissue cells to absorb nutrients and healing factors at an increased rate.
Topical anesthetics and anti-inflammatory medications which are effective as the tissue is very thin in the back of the heel with minimal fat (adipose) tissue.
Physical therapy focused on stretching exercises and tissue manipulation.
Heel Lifts and shoe modifications which can aid in reducing Achilles tendon pain.
Supportive ankle brace and custom inserts can also help to stabilize the foot and ankle to reduce tension on the Achilles tendon.
Cortisone injections directed away from the body of the tendon can reduce pain and inflammation.
Casting and non-weightbearing for a period of time is also an alternative to surgery.
Surgical Treatment Options
While our Doctors will always opt for non-surgical options when suitable, sometimes surgery is necessary and simply unavoidable when other methods won’t work. Surgery is an option where the Achilles tendon can be debrided of all scar tissue and re-attached to the back of the heel. The posterior heel spur is also removed at the same time.
Da Vinci Foot and Ankle Soft Tissue Mass
Achilles Tendon lengthening at the same time will also help reduce the pull of the tendon on the back of the heal, which will lead to additional pain relief. This requires casting and non-weightbearing afterwards for a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks, followed by a walking boot.
