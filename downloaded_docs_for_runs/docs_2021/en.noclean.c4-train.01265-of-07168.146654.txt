We’ve dealt with the common signs and symptoms of teen depression, and also the leading causes. We’ll be looking into its management and how to deal with it. Before you can think of any remedy at all, the type and severity of the depression needs to be in check. However, in general, psychotherapy and medication is very effective. Looking at it from an angle, a teen who has been depressed to the point of taking his/her own life will definitely need an upper hand in managing the depression. If, on the other hand, it is still minor or at its early stage, you can take care of it in simpler ways, even before it escalates. I’ll be discussing some options below, which includes: psychotherapy, medications, workout, music, care for yourself, and prayer. Keep reading to know more about these options
Psychotherapy: this can also be called “talk therapy”, and it involves talking with a mental health provider about depression and other mental issues. Cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy, are two very effective psychotherapies commonly used in depression. With this talk therapy, affected teenager can get to talk about how he/she feels, learn all that is there to depression (including how to manage and avoid it). This leaves the teenager with a kind of relief. Any depressed teen who goes through this method has a lesser risk of getting depressed again, at least not anytime soon.
Medications: Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Escitalopram (Lexapro) are two antidepressants that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You can use any of these drugs to get rid of depression, but it is very important that you do not use any dosage without proper health guide. See your physician if you will use any medication at all, and ensure you are aware of any side effects or risks that may come with these drugs.
Work out: staying active also helps. When you feel down and everything seems to crash, why not work it out? You can engage in low impact exercises like walking, jogging, running, and swimming. Let those depressing thoughts fly out of your head as you work out, it is better off than sitting at home all day and staying depressed.
Music: recent studies in music therapy has proven music to be a great cure for depression. Music does not only bring life; it inspires creativity such that you begin to think of many beautiful things you can engage yourself in. It also has a way of controlling breathing and reducing blood pressure. All these work together to promote the health and make you feel just fine. Now, you won’t want to listen to depressing songs and make everything worse! Your choice of songs matter.
Care for yourself: there is really no beautiful thing in depression. It has a way of eating deep into one’s life. Trust me, you won’t want to remain that way. Always remind yourself that you have goals too, and depression shouldn’t hinder you from hitting your target. Motivate yourself to rise, no matter the circumstances surrounding it. Make it a duty to care for yourself at all times; you can’t afford to fail yourself.
Prayer: prayer is very effective, as there is so much it can do. This is a cure on its own. Someone may ask me how possible it is to pray while depressed. True, it may seem difficult and impossible, but you can give a try and you don’t necessarily have to voice out. You can go on your knees and breakdown in tears. Just lay everything down, and surrender all to Jesus. It’ll be fine; you will be fine
How parents can help
Permit me to refer parents back to the causes of teen depression.
As a parent or a guardian, when you figure out that your teen is depressed, considering the sign and symptoms, it is best you take action as soon as possible. If you are the cause of the depression, your teen may not want to listen to you if you try to talk him/her out of it; in this case, see a professional.
You may not be able to provide your teen enough financial needs; this doesn’t mean you should also withdraw your care and make the teen feel neglected (both in finances and care, which are actually the teen’s rights).
If, by chance, your teen is not doing well in school as supposed, rather than scorning such child or depriving him/her of some rightful things, it’s best you call the teen closer and discuss about what could be going on. This doesn’t only build a stronger relationship between you and your teen, but it also reduces the risk of depression.
Depression is a mental disorder that should be well taken care of, at all cost. We’ll be concluding this series in our next post on depression, and I’ll be sharing few experiences from teenagers.
