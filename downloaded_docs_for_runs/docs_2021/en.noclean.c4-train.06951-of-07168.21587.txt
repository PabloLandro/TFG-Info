If youâ€™re experiencing itching between your toes, chances are that youâ€™re suffering from athleteâ€™s foot, or â€˜tinea pedisâ€™ to give it its clinical name.
Athleteâ€™s foot is a common fungal infection â€“ thought to infect around 25% of us â€“ that can be caused by transmission of at least four different kinds of fungus. It is not a serious condition although should be treated promptly to avoid spreading it to other people and to other parts of your own body.
Remember to consult your doctor if you want a specific diagnosis. They will be able to examine your toes to see whether fungus is present, or whether you are experiencing something different.

Itching between your toes â€“ usually starting at the little toes
A flaky and scaly rash may then develop
The skin between your toes can split and develop fissures which can be painful
Painful blisters can develop too
Who gets athleteâ€™s foot?
The fungi that causes athleteâ€™s foot thrives in warm, moist conditions â€“ that means people who get sweaty regularly may well contract it at some point.
Itâ€™s a very contagious fungus so anyone who is sharing space or walking barefoot in a space where the athleteâ€™s foot fungus is lurking is also at risk.
Athleteâ€™s foot can afflict anyone but there are a few factors that can put you more at risk of catching it:
Athletes or those that keep their feet cooped up in warm, sweaty shoes all day
People that use swimming pools, gyms and communal showers
People who use nail salons
Types of athleteâ€™s foot
There are four different types of fungus that can cause athleteâ€™s foot although the most common is trichophyton rubrum. These fungi live on hair, nails and skin and are generally passed along the skin.
They can spread to the toenails and hands so be sure to tackle the problem early to limit the spread.
The most common type of athleteâ€™s foot is interdigital â€“ i.e. between the toes.
Another type of athleteâ€™s foot is a moccasin infection. These infections tend to see the skin of the entire sole thickening and perhaps even spreading to the sides of the feet. The skin may crack.
Even rarer is a vesicular infection, which is characterised by a number of blisters appearing on the sole of the foot.

How to cure athleteâ€™s foot
There are a few different methods on the best way to cure athleteâ€™s foot. You may need to try a few things before you find the right cure for you.
Keep an eye on whether any cracks in the skin between your toes have allowed the introduction of a secondary infection into your skin. If you spot any signs of this, remember to consult your doctor so they can tackle your specific problem.
Best antifungal creams for athleteâ€™s foot
Most athleteâ€™s foot cases can be cured with at least one round of topical antifungal cream. These are generally available online, over-the-counter, or even by prescription if necessary.
Antifungal creams tend to be the first option most athleteâ€™s foot sufferers start with and it can prove very effective â€“ particularly on mild to moderate infections.

Home remedies for athleteâ€™s foot
Some people choose to address their athleteâ€™s foot with a series of home remedies â€“ often in conjunction with an antifungal cream in order to speed up the healing process.
Here are a few ideas that you should be able to source easily from home:
Tea Tree Oil â€“ this is a powerful, natural antifungal that should destroy the fungus and stop it spreading. Add it â€˜neatâ€™ in small doses to the fungus or add a few drops to a foot bath and soak.
Apple Cider Vinegar â€“ vinegar creates an acidic environment in which the fungus cannot survive. Use it in a soak or spray it directly on to the affected area.
Colloidal Silver â€“ silver supports the immune system in destroying fungi and bacteria. Spray directly onto the athleteâ€™s foot.
Oregano Oil â€“ this has antifungal, antiseptic and antibacterial properties. Dilute a couple of drops in a teaspoon of coconut oil and apply to the athleteâ€™s foot.
Antifungal pills for athleteâ€™s foot
In the rare cases when neither home remedies or topical creams can provide a cure for your athleteâ€™s foot, your doctor may need to prescribe you antifungal pills to rid you of the infection.
While mostly effective, often these pills have to be taken for a long period of time before a total cure is achieved and can carry some nasty side-effects.
Speak to your doctor about the risks of taking antifungal pills before you embark on a course.
How to prevent athleteâ€™s foot
Like with all medical conditions, prevention is always better than cure when it comes to athleteâ€™s foot.
Follow these recommendations if you want to keep your feet and toes healthy and fungus-free:
Dry your feet and between your toes thoroughly after getting them wet
Wear sweat-absorbent socks when youâ€™re wearing shoes all day or playing sports
Ensure your shoes fit well and arenâ€™t causing any repetitive trauma to your toes
Wear flip-flops or sandals when using a locker room, communal shower or walking around a swimming pool
Wash your feet with antifungal wash regularly
Use an antifungal powder in your shoes
Donâ€™t share towels, socks or shoes
