There are many herbal remedies that can help to ease rheumatoid arthritis pain, and many have a long history of use. Long before Bayer synthesized aspirin in the late 1890s, Hippocrates (400 BC) was prescribing treatments using white willow bark to relieve pain and reduce fever. 1
Supplements for arthritis: The best way to deal with the pain of rheumatoid arthritis is to do everything in your power to prevent it. A diet high in refined sugars and animal products can lead to even worse inflammation. Chronic Vitamin D deficiency is symptomatic of both obesity and RA. Check your vitamin D levels frequently and supplement if they are low. Turmeric is a first rate anti-inflammatory herb. It contains at least two chemicals, curcumin and curcuminoids, that act to decrease inflammation much like NSAID COX-2 that inhibit the production of prostaglandins which are linked to arthritic inflammation. 2
EFA for arthritis: Botanical seed oils are good sources of essential fatty acids that cool inflammation. Supplementing your diet with flax seed, evening primrose, and hemp oil provides the right kind of essential fatty acids your body needs to lessen arthritis symptoms. Borage seed oil is used as an anti-inflammatory for chronic inflammatory arthritis. Borage seeds are a good source of (GLA), the omega-6 fatty acid that the body uses to make an inflammation fighting, auto-immune-prostaglandins. (Duke,James, Ph.D.) The seed oil of evening primrose may significantly help arthritis pain, and reduce inflammation especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis, due to it's GLA content.
Aromatherapy for arthritis: Essential oils are used in massage formulas to ease pain without putting extra strain on your liver and stomach. The diuretic and depurative actions of juniper make it an excellent remedy for arthritis and gout. It may be used externally, suitably diluted in a carrier oil, as a mild analgesic rubefacient to relieve rheumatic pain. (Tisserand,Robert B. "Art of Aromatherapy") Eucalyptus oil is an excellent topical remedy for aching joints and rheumatism. Dilute with a carrier oil and use in massage blends or as a bath oil. For arthritic aches and pains, apply lavender compresses, or massage with a lavender oil blend.
Arthritis and weight management: When you have rheumatoid arthritis, being overweight puts even more stress on your weight bearing joints and can cause your knees, ankles and lower back to degenerate much more rapidly. Carrying around extra pounds may also give you a greater chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis in the first place. This makes a healthy diet for weight control an important component of your fight against arthritis. Flexibility and muscle building exercises like swimming and yoga are just as important as diet.
