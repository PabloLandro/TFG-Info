Unfortunately, many Americans suffer from the pain of arthritis. There are many people who believe that cracking your knuckles can cause arthritis however several studies disprove this point. Many people run to the pharmacy for some over the counter pain relievers or use prescription meds from their doctors that cause more side effects and damage to their immune systems than the arthritis itself ever did.
There are plenty of other ways to help relieve the pain of arthritis. Check out this list of our 17 common sense home remedies for this painful condition and try some of them before you subject your body to those toxic chemical pain relievers.
1. Copper Bracelets
The medical establishment will tell you that copper bracelets do nothing to stop arthritis pain and that it’s no better than a placebo. Remember, however, that modern medicine is also telling us that there is no danger in the mercury that we inject into our bodies with every flu shot. There are a multitude of people who claim that they get relief from wearing these mineral bracelets. If they work for you, then great, if not, try some of the other remedies that are listed here. Even if they don’t work for you, they look cool.
2. Exercise
You’ve probably heard the old saying “If it rests, it rusts”. This applies to more than tools and machinery! Although arthritis makes moving painful, it’s vital that you move to stimulate circulation, healing, and keep your muscles strong. Try low impact exercises such as swimming, water aerobics, walking, Tai Chi, or yoga. Many people find light gardening not only helps their pain but reduces stress and inflammation.
3. Tart Cherries
The Arthritis Foundation states that cherries, cherry juice and supplements made from cherries have been tested and found to be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis and gout related arthritis. In this study, participants ate at least 10 tart cherries daily, one tablespoon of concentrate, two eight ounce bottles of cherry juice or one cherry tablet per day. It’s believed that the pain relief is linked to the antioxidants, anthocyanins, which are found in red and purple fruits. Try some cherry supplements if you don’t live in a place where you can regular access to fresh cherries or cherry juice.
4. Heat
There are plenty of reasons people tend to move south when they get older. The warmer climate that helps with arthritis pain is one of them. Almost everyone with arthritis claims that they feel more pain when temperatures drop.
If you can’t move south, try using hot tubs, Jacuzzis, saunas, and bath tubs. There are also heating pads, hot packs, and arthritis warming gloves.
5. Essential Oils
There are many essential oils that can help relieve the pain of arthritis. Some of the best for this purpose are:
Frankincense
Rosemary
Marjoram
Eucalyptus
White Fir
Peppermint
Lavender
Cypress
Ginger
Roman Chamomile
Wintergreen
Basil
Clove
Helichrysum
Add just one or two drops to a tablespoon of coconut oil, sweet almond oil, olive oil, or any other massage oil of your choice and then massage the affected areas. Read more about benefits of essential oils.
6. Ginger
The regular consumption of ginger, either fresh organic, dried, or in tea, can actually work better to relieve the pain of arthritis than many over the counter NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. Fresh, organic ginger will have the strongest pain relieving properties. Slice about one teaspoon of fresh, organic ginger into a cup of boiling water and let steep for about 5 minutes. Strain out the chunks, and then sweeten with a bit of raw honey if you like.
7. Apple Cider Vinegar
This is one of the most popular home remedies around. There’s a good chance your grandparents used this since it’s been around for ages. Mix about ¼ cup of apple cider vinegar into a glass of water and drink daily. If it’s a bit sour for your taste, you can add a teaspoon of raw honey to sweeten it up. Find out other uses of apple cider vinegar.
8. Stinging Nettle
The use of stinging nettles has been used topically as well as internally to fight the inflammation that come with arthritis. The extract of stinging nettles has been used to successfully to decrease the inflammation to the point that normal NSAID use could be reduced; this according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Nettle is a fairly common weed that likes to grow in high nitrogen soils. A very old fashioned method to use stinging nettles is to flail the affected joints and then apply a fresh stinging nettle plant. You don’t have to go that far; however, you can buy supplements in almost every health food store.
