Ingrown Hair Scars
Ingrown hair scars on cheek
Ingrown hair scars is one of the consequence of having ingrown hairs, which are hairs that have curled around and grown back into your skin instead of rising up from it. Apart from scarring, such hairs might also cause uneven skin tone, skin infections, itchiness, red bumps, boil like sores that are painful, skin irritation, post inflammatory hyperpigmentation or even keloid scars (ingrown hair scar bump).
Ingrown hairs are caused by the end of a hair becoming caught underneath the skin while it continues growing. The area becomes infected and pus-filled, often causing people to try to pick or pop the infected area. This leads to damage and scarring, leaving behind areas of skin discoloration long after the ingrown hair has healed.
Skin is a seamless organ, like a fine cloth protecting valuable assets. Just one small tear can make a big difference in how it looks. And it’s the same with skin. Any burn, injury, or other trauma, such as surgery, can cause a scar. The truth is the scar will never completely go away. But there are some methods that can help reduce its size and change its appearance.
How Scarring occurs
Scarring is a natural part of the healing process after an injury. Its appearance and its treatment depend on multiple factors.
The depth and size of the wound or cut and the location of the injury matter. So do your age, genes, sex, and ethnicity.
Types of Scars
These are several different types of scars including:
Keloid scars. These scars are the result of an overly aggressive healing process, usually extend beyond the original injury. Over time, a keloid scar may hamper movement. Treatments include surgery to remove the scar, steroid injections, or silicone sheets to flatten the scar.
Contracture scars. If your skin has been burned, you may have a contracture scar. These scars tighten skin, which can impair your ability to move. Contracture scars may also go deeper, affecting muscles and nerves.
Hypertrophic scars. These are raised, red scars that are similar to keloids but do not go beyond the boundary of the injury.
Acne scars. If you’ve had severe acne you probably have the scars to prove it. There are many types of acne scars, ranging from deep pits to scars that are angular or wavelike in appearance.
Why ingrown hairs occur
Ingrown hairs occur more on people who have curly hair because they are essentially curly hairs. At least most people will experience having an ingrown hair at least once in their life. Ingrown hairs are also more likely to happen with people who tend to use hair removal processes quite often.
Hairs that are left alone on the body will just grow or fall out normally, but when you mess with hairs by cutting them or removing them from the root, they develop tendencies that can lead to the problem of ingrown hairs.
Anyone can get ingrown hairs and a number of factors such as ethnicity (Latin Americans and African Americans tend to have curly coarse hairs), clogged hair follicle by dead skin cells or sebum, having curly thick hair, shaving, waxing, tweezing and razor bumps can increase the chances of having ingrown hair scarring.
However, if you have the habit of squeezing, picking or scratching the raised red bumps due to ingrown hairs, you are likely to discolour your skin and end up with ingrown hair scars.
Where you get scars from ingrown hairs
Some of the common areas you are likely to end up with ingrown hair scars include pubic and bikini areas, face, legs, stomach, chin, inner thigh, etc. men tend to have ingrown hairs on their chin, neck and cheeks after shaving, there are the same areas where they are likely to develop scars.
Moreover, women tend to have ingrown hair scars on legs, buttocks, armpits, bikini areas including along the bikini line, etc.
