Hip Osteoarthritis
Symptoms of hip osteoarthritis often begin gradually, however they can be provoked by trauma. Hip osteoarthritis can cause changes in the quality of cartilage, ligaments and bone surfaces within the joint. This can, but does not always lead to pain, stiffness and muscle weakness.
Research supports the use of specific exercises to improve symptoms and hip function. Physiotherapists at ALO Physiotherapy assess which structures are affected and identify the most effective form of treatment.
Symptoms include:
Stiffness with hip movement
Pain with weight bearing
Pain following inactivity
Further information
Factors which make hip osteoarthritis more likely:
Previous hip injury or fracture
Genetics
Sedentary lifestyle
Rehabilitation
Physiotherapists at ALO Physiotherapy design specific exercise programmes, precisely aligned to the stage of the osteoarthritis and specific problems the person is facing.
Rehabilitative exercises are likely to include:
movements to improve range of motion and reduce stiffness
exercises to strengthen the main supporting muscles of the hip
balance and co-ordination exercises
exercises to improve specific activities which have become difficult
Treatments which may be used by Physiotherapists at ALO:
Rehabilitative exercises
Manual Therapy
Acupuncture
Electrotherapy
Clinical Massage Therapy
If you are having surgical treatment, then your physiotherapist at ALO can provide specific rehabilitation before and after surgery.
