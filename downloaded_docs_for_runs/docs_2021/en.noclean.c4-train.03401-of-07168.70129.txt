Do you have scars on you that are bothersome to you? Not that anyone has said anything about them just that it sits in the back of your mind how unattractive that it looks on you? They may be scars from when you were a child, or you may have just recently gotten a scar from something. Do you ever wonder is there anything out there that will take this blemish off of my body! Well the answer to this question is yes there are creams that will remove your scar. If not they will at least lighten it up so that it is not as noticeable to others. Below is a list of different creams that remove scars you can try and see how they work out for you.
Best Creams For Removing Scars
If the scar is not that deep and dark you can try rubbing coco butter lotion on the scar. This may help you reduce the appearance of the scar.
You can try to use LacSal Cream in the morning and rub it all over the scar. Then at night try and use TriReduction P&R with retinol.
Super Cop and Super CP Serum has hydroxy acids in them which help with the removal or lightening of scars. Rub this on the scar in the evening time then when you wake up you can wash it off with warm soapy water. Repeat this each night until you see a difference.
STM Scar and Stretchmarks Cream uses Peptides and Emu Oil. This is a cream that reduces scars and marks from weight loss, pregnancy, childbirth or surgery.
Bio skin repair gets the skin's regenerative process going. It also reduces scars and keloids. It helps to accelerate removal of damaged proteins in the skin. This will stop the itching from the scar you have so you do not make it worse if you try to itch it.
Vitamin E creams are great for removing scars. You can find vitamin E creams in just about any drug store. If you have small scarring or a fresh scar rub this on it frequently through out the day.
As I have said above these may not work for all of you. If they do not then you may want to contact a dermatologist to find out other solutions that may work for you. I really hope that you find a perfect cream to help remove your unwanted scars.
