Rated Tylenol for Osteoarthritis Report
I have osteoarthritis in my hands that gets painful at times. Tylenol products really help alleviate my pain a lot, and Tylenol PM works great at night.

Rated Tylenol for Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) Report
Ineffective for fibromyalgia. Generally, not very good at treating other types of pain as well. Can be hard on liver if taken chronically. Why do doctors and hospitals give out this drug like candy? A sugar pill would suffice and be gentler on your liver.

Rated Tylenol for Pain Report
I find that, for pain, Tylenol is utterly useless. I used to use it for my children when they were babies concurrently with Ibuprofin, for relief of high fevers, but I don't even keep it in the house anymore. And who needs liver damage from something utterly useless?

Rated Tylenol for Insomnia Report
Knocks you out I have become a chronic insomniac in the last two years and have found that paracetamol (tylenol) is very useful for 'knocking you out' when it's 3am and your sleeping pill has failed. It is very good at deadening an over-active brain and is also very good at relaxing your muscles when you are very tense and can't sleep for that reason too. The only concern I have is the reputed liver damage that even regular doses of paracetamol can cause with longterm use. Still, I'll takes my chances. This is a very useful drug-- and not just for headaches. I am practically a patron of GlaxoSmithKline what with all the empty packets I have lying on my bedroom floor.

Rated Tylenol for Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.) Report
Buyer BEWARE One of the most common side effect to acetaminophen is headache. I had noticed that acetaminophen never helped my headaches so I did not use it; however, it was not until it was part of a pain medicine that I received following knee surgery that I discovered that acetaminophen actually gave me a headache. My knee would be killing me, I'd take the drug, my knee would feel better, and my head would start killing me. I looked acetaminophen up and discovered the common side affect. Unfortunately for me, I'm allergic to aspirin and both of these pain killers are a common ingredient in most pain killers prescribed by doctors.

Rated Tylenol for Migraine Report
Aura Relief When I get migraine it only affects my vision, with little or no pain. I do notice increased tension on one side of my face or top of my head during an episode. Mainly, I notice the aura of flashing lights in a circular field and a blind spot in the middle of my vision and get no other symptoms other than to feel woozy, light headed and sleepy just before an attack of this kind. There may of may not be other sympoms just before the Aura starts. Lack of sleep and stress are major factors. If I get one while driving I have to pull over or have tylenol handy to ward off the aura and ensuing lack of vision. This usually helps. Two tablets is sufficient but, if I take Tylenol too often for other reasons it does lose effectiveness for this kind of headache to some degree, though not totally. I've tried Ibuprofen with similar good results. Never actually tried the Excedrine formula for this as I am sensitive to caffeine and don't like to take acetaminophen too much as I get side effects for that also. I like Ibuprofen even less than Tylenol as it has more side effects for me. A couple of side effects I had with the Ibuprofen are fast heartbeat, sleeplessness; probably due to the higher blood pressure, hoarseness, stiff neck and possibly other symptoms I can't recall now. Also, I can, I prefer to take generic or store brands of acetaminophen, as the cost of Tylenol is sometimes prohibitive, depending on my work status.

Rated Tylenol for Degenerative disc disease Report
How much is 2 much I am wanting to know if 2000mg. (4 pills each at 500mg) is too much or dangerous. I suffer from degenerative disc disease (DDD) and horrible migraines. Taking this dose helps a lot, but the normal dose does not.

Rated Tylenol for Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.) Report
Did nothing for me. Paracetamol never did anything to me. Sometimes I would notice a small relief in pain, but that only lasted for half an hour so I assume it's just the placebo effect.
