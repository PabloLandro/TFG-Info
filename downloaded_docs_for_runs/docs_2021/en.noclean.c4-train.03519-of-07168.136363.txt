3. How to Use Essential Oils for Colds and Flu?
Essential oils for colds and flu relief can be used in many different ways, many are applied externally due to high levels of toxicity although a few can be ingested. Here are some of the different ways to use essential oils at home:
3.1) Steam Inhalation
Steam inhalation is one of the most effective ways to introduce essential oils for colds and flu treatment to your body. To do this you first need to add some drops of essential oil in a bowl of boiling water. Then cover your head over the bowl with a towel with eyes closed. Try to inhale as much as you can of the rising steam. It is ok to take breaks at regular intervals when the heat becomes too intense but not too often or you will miss most of the rising steam.

This method allows the steamy oil to enter the respiratory tract and organs relieving you of the cold and flu viruses and their symptoms over time.
3.2) Quick Inhalation
This method is similar to steam inhalation, but instead of using boiling water and steam, just add some few drops of oil on a piece of cloth or a tissue and inhale the scent as you move around. Moving around will ensure that you get the full benefits of this method as you are forced to breath more deeply as you move around. As in steam inhalation, breathing in the oils will help clear phlegm from the nose and lungs

3.4) Beverages
Essential oils for colds or flu treatment can also be taken orally with tea or other drinks. Be sure to check the toxicity levels, reactions or allergens before ingesting them.

Stir and consume while it is hot to get maximum benefits. In this way, the medicinal drink clears the phlegm from the nose and lung whilst soothing the throat.
3.5) Direct Application
Another way to use essential oils for colds and flu treatment is to directly apply it on the skin.
