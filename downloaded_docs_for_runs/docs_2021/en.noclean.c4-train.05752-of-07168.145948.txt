Product Description
Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Pro Support For Achilles Tendonitis
The Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Pro Achilles tendon is for the relief of chronic Achilles pain. If you desire a support for acute pain, please select the original AchilloTrain Support. The pro version features Bauerfeind's visco-elastic pad technology that encompasses the Achilles tendon from mid-calf down to the heel which provides an extra level support and protection. This soft insert has proprioceptive stimulating nubs on the inside to gently massage while supporting, compressing and protecting the Achilles tendon. As you move and walk the massaging action stimulates good blood flow to the area to help bring the healing properties of the blood to the area so that the injured tendon can be repaired. The second thing that happens is that the massaging action helps to reduce the edema and swelling in the area.
The AchilloTrain supports are anatomically knitted to provide an excellent, comfortable fit. The stretchable, breathable knitted fabric is easy to put on and take off and comfortable enough to wear all day. The AchilloTrain Pro comes with two shock absorbing heel lifts that can assist in the healing process.
The AchilloTrain Pro support acts like a &quo;friction massage&quo; that helps accelerate the healing process and helps reduce edema. The simultaneous proprioceptive stimulation of the nerve endings in the muscle improves muscular control. The sensimotor quality is positively influenced and the neuro-myonal (nerve-muscle) system supported. This leads to synchronization of muscle activities.
VitalHuman.com feels that the Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Pro is a good choice if you suffer from chronic Achilles tendon pain.
AchilloTrain Pro systematically counteracts irritation to the Achilles tendon through support and compression
The support promotes muscular stabilization whilst a shaped insert (pad) with two wings and nubs massages the muscle-tendon transition
A groove running down the middle of the pad improves the drainage of edemas
Mobility is eased and assisted
If your measurement falls between 2 sizes, choose the smaller size.
