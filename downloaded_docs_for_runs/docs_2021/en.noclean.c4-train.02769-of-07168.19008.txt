How Much Sunshine Is Healthy For You?
Published on July 26, 2017 August 7, 2017 by mariadorfnerLeave a comment
We’ve all heard sunshine is good for your health.
How Much Sunshine Is Healthy?
Turns out, it’s 15 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen 3 times a week.
How Much Sunshine Is Not Healthy?
More than 15 minutes of sun without sunscreen and you’ll end up with premature aging.
Dr. Melissa Piliang (pronounced Pill-ee-ang) of Cleveland Clinic says areas that should be covered at ALL times include:
FACE
CHEST
BACK
HANDS
SHE REMINDS US YOU CAN STILL DEVELOP SKIN CANCER ON TINY EXPOSED AREAS.

“Face, chest, back of hands are places too – that you can get a lot of sun just running and out of stores, to and from your car, to your mailbox; those kinds of situations.” [:10]
What Does 15 Minutes of Healthy Sunlight Do?
It activates Vitamin D in your body. After activation, it functions as a hormone. The active form of Vitamin D is called D3 or cholecalciferol.
Vitamin D is vital for mental health, age-related cognitive decline, mood, cardiovascular health and strong bones. D3 supports calcium absorption and your immune system.
You get vitamin D3 from foods such as mushrooms, orange juice fortified with calcium/D, milk, fortified soy products, fish or supplements.
What If You Can’t Avoid Sun More Than 15 Min.?
If you need to be exposed to the sun more than 15 minutes Dr. Piliang says to use sunscreen liberally. Everyone should make sun protection a part of their everyday routine, even while running errands –not just when you go to the beach or pool.
SHE SAYS THE BEST PROTECTION ARE SPRAY-ON SUNSCREENS OR A VARIETY OF LOTIONS AND MAKEUPS THAT CONTAIN S-P-F TO PROTECT SKIN.
DR. PILIANG SAYS KEEP LOTION HANDY SO YOU DON’T FORGET.

“For people who are worried about sun exposure on their head, a hat is helpful. And actually a hat is very helpful for everyone because it protects the face, the head, and the top of the ears.” [:15]
ACCORDING TO THE U-S CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION,
SKIN CANCER IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES AND MEN, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIGHTER SKIN. [:11]
If you see new moles or ones that change shape make sure to get them checked.
Again, people with exposed scalps should always use sunscreen there or wear a hat.
See a dermatologist if you have any concerns.
You can now safely say, “Good Morning, Sunshine!” 15 min. 3x’s a week.
THEN, IT’S “HELLO SUNSCREEN!” 😀
YOU CAN PREVENT SKIN CANCER BY TAKING THESE PRECAUTIONS.

Don’t forget to protect your EYES too!
Most of us think to pack the sunscreen when heading outdoors into the sun, but we might not always remember to grab a pair of shades.
According to Reecha Kampani, M.D., an ophthalmologist at Cleveland Clinic, putting on sunglasses is more than a fashion statement.
She says protecting eyes from ultraviolet rays is just as important as using sunscreen to protect the skin.
”UV protection is good for all kinds of structures of the eye, like the eyelids, the cornea, conjunctiva, the lenses and retina tissue itself,” says Dr. Kampani. ”You can get damage and changes of the eye with exposure to UV light, so protection is very important.”
Dr. Kampani says it is actually possible to get a sunburn on the eyelids and while rare, if exposed to too much UV light, the cornea, which is the clear tissue over the eye, can get a thermal burn, which can be very painful.
“Long-term exposure to UV light can lead to the formation of cataracts or macular degeneration.”
Dr. Kampani recommends wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat even on moderately sunny or overcast days, to make sure eyes are protected.
Wrap-around sunglasses are best if heading out in the sun all day, as they can keep light from coming in through the top and the sides of the glasses.
The good news is that people dont have to spend a fortune to keep their eyes protected.
Dr. Kampani says buying discounted sunglasses is fine, but its a good idea to replace inexpensive glasses yearly.
”If you’re buying lenses that are at more discounted places, thats fine, said Dr. Kampani. A lot of times they still do have full protection, but you have to keep in mind that it could be something thats more temporary, like a spray-on coating, that wont last as long.”
Dr. Kampani says it’s also a good idea to keep in mind that artificial UV light, like the kind that is found in tanning beds, is just as bad for the eyes as it is for the skin.
Remember, when you’re outdoors or out in the field as we say in TV wear sunglasses OR a hat to protect your peeps!
Stay healthy!

Breakthrough: First Biologic Treatment for Eczema
Published on July 24, 2017 by mariadorfnerLeave a comment
An estimated 300,000 people suffer from Atopic Dermatitis, the most common form of Eczema.
They are most in need of new treatment options.
Eczema is a chronic inflammatory disease with symptoms often appearing as a rash on the skin.
It’s characterized by rashes often covering much of the body.
It can include intense, persistent itching and skin dryness, cracking, redness, crusting, and oozing.
Itch is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients and can be debilitating.
Now, the FDA has just approved the first targeted biologic therapy for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.
It’s called Dupixent and it will be available later this week to U.S. patients suffering from this chronic and debilitating form of eczema.
The Dupixent® (dupilumab) Injection is the first and only biologic medicine approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable.
“People with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis cope with intense, sometimes unbearable symptoms that can impact them for most of their lives,” says Julie Block, President and Chief Executive Officer, National Eczema Association.
“To date, there have been few options available to treat people with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who have uncontrolled disease. That’s why today’s approval of Dupixent is so important for our community. Now we have a treatment that is expected to help address patients suffering from this devastating disease.”
Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that is designed to specifically inhibit overactive signaling of two key proteins, IL-4 and IL-13, which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in AD.
It comes in a pre-filled syringe and can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection every other week after an initial loading dose.
And it can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.
WHO IS DUPIXENT BEST SUITED FOR?
Adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. It is not known if Dupixent is safe and effective in children.
“Dupixent is the result of years of tireless research by our scientists into the underlying causes of allergic and atopic diseases. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent was shown to help clear the skin and manage the intense itch caused by the disease,” says George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Founding Scientist, President, and Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron.
“Today’s approval would not be possible without the dedication of the clinical investigators and the participation of the patients who took part in the global LIBERTY AD clinical program.”
Dupixent was evaluated by the FDA with Priority Review, which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in safety or efficacy in treating serious conditions.
“We strive to transform scientific innovation into therapeutic solutions that make a meaningful difference to people’s lives,”says Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., CEO, Sanofi.
“The approval of Dupixent offers new hope for adults with moderate-to-severe AD in the United States, and we look forward to working with regulatory authorities around the world to bring this important new medicine to patients globally.”
This follows the FDA’s 2014 Breakthrough Therapy designation for Dupixent for inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD.
Breakthrough Therapy designation was created by the FDA to expedite the development and review of drugs developed for serious or life-threatening conditions.
Dupixent represents the first time this designation was granted for a dermatological disease, other than in dermatologic cancers.
Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, and Regeneron will market Dupixent in the United States.
WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS?
Dupixent is expected to be available to patients and providers in the U.S. later this week.
WHAT DOES IT COST?
The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) of Dupixent in the United States is $37,000 annually.
Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as WAC pricing does not reflect discounts, rebates or patient assistance programs.
Analysts say the drug could become a blockbuster therapy that could one day bring in more than $3 billion in annual sales.
SHOULD ANYONE NOT USE DUPIXENT AT ALL?
It should not be used in patients allergic to dupilumab or any of the ingredients in Dupixent.
WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS TO USING DUPIXENT?
The most common adverse events that were noted to be greater than or equal to one percent with Dupixent treatment included injection site reactions, eye and eye lid inflammation including redness, swelling, and itching, and cold sores in the mouth or on the lips.
In December 2016, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review Sanofi’s and Regeneron’s marketing authorization application (MAA) for Dupixent for adults with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe AD.
ANY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS?
Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including:
Allergic reactions. Stop using Dupixent and go to the nearest hospital emergency room if you get any of the following symptoms: fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, joint pain, or skin rash.
Eye problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in vision.
WHEN SHOULD PEOPLE CONTACT A DOCTOR IF THEY EXPERIENCE SIDE EFFECTS?
People should tell their healthcare provider if they have any side effect that bothers them or that does not go away.
These are not all the possible side effects of Dupixent. Doctors can provide medical advice about side effects. They should also report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
ANYTHING ELSE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW?
Use Dupixent exactly as prescribed.
If your healthcare provider decides that you or a caregiver can give Dupixent injections, you or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Dupixent.
Do not try to inject Dupixent until you have been shown the right way by your healthcare provider.
Please click here for the full Prescribing Information.
Patient information is available here.
ARE ANY ADDITIONAL STUDIES TAKING PLACE?
Dupilumab Program Overview
Dupilumab is currently being evaluated in a comprehensive development program for Atopic Dermatitis (AD) that includes studies in children with severe AD (6 months to 11 years of age) and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD (12 to 17 years of age).
In October 2016, the FDA granted dupilumab Breakthrough Therapy designation for both populations. These potential uses are investigational and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated nor confirmed by any regulatory authority.
Dupilumab is also being studied in other inflammatory diseases that are believed to be driven by IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines, including persistent uncontrolled asthma (Phase 3, results expected later this year), nasal polyposis (Phase 3) and eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 2).
These potential uses are investigational and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.
WHERE CAN PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT CLINICAL TRIALS TAKING PLACE?
For more information on dupilumab clinical trials please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.
IS THERE ANYONE THAT SHOULDN’T USE IT?
Do not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in Dupixent®.
ANY OTHER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?
People should tell their healthcare provider about their medical conditions BEFORE using Dupixent, including if they:
have eye problems
have a parasitic (helminth) infection
have asthma
are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should not receive a “live vaccine” if you are treated with Dupixent.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Dupixent will harm your unborn baby.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether Dupixent passes into your breast milk.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.
If you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine without talking to your healthcare provider.
ANYTHING ELSE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW?
Sanofi and Regeneron recognize Dupixent can only help those uncontrolled moderate-to-severe AD patients prescribed the medicine if they can both access the medicine and use it properly.
Therefore, the companies have launched Dupixent MyWay™, a comprehensive and specialized program that provides support and services to patients throughout every step of the treatment process.
Dupixent MyWay™ will help eligible patients who are uninsured, lack coverage, or need assistance with their out-of-pocket costs.
Additionally, Dupixent MyWay™ offers personalized support from registered nurses and other specialists who are available 24/7 to speak with patients and help them navigate the complex insurance process.
For more information, please call 1-844-Dupixent (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.Dupixent.com
