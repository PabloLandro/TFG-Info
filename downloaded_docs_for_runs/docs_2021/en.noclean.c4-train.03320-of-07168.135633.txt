What is asthma?
The asthma is an inflammatory condition of the bronchi. During an asthma attack the lining of the bronchi becomes inflamed and the airways become clogged by excess mucus. Which causes the characteristic symptoms of the disease: wheezing -exhalation becomes especially difficult-tension in the chest, cough-dry or with phlegm-and shortness of breath. It is a chronic disease that usually starts in childhood with an allergy, but it can appear at any age.
Symptoms of Alarm: -Crisis or Asthma Attack-
Sweating
Breathing difficulty
Rapid pulse and anxiety.
Decreased mental alertness
Lips and face bluish.
The severity and frequency of symptoms vary among the people affected, depending on the physical activity they perform, the time of day or environmental / climatic factors.
The symptoms of asthma attack often cause:
Insomnia.
Fatigue.
Daytime fatigue
Decrease in activity
Nowadays, with an adequate treatment, asthmatic people can achieve total control of the disease, living a normal life, without presenting symptoms or with very few.
How can Yoga help patients with asthma
From the perspective of Yoga, many people – not just asthmatics – breathe functionally and inefficiently. By improving breathing patterns increases the supply of oxygen to tissues, induces muscle relaxation and reduce stress levels; which is healthy for everyone – especially for a person with asthma.
Ancestral Yogic techniques recommended for asthma:
# 1 .- Nasal Cleaning Technique – Jala Neti or Neti Kriya -: It consists of rinsing the nostrils with a saline solution.
Preparation: Use a quarter of a teaspoon of non-iodized salt for each 230 grams of warm water (not hot). In this way you get a salinity similar to that of tears.
Procedure: With the head tilted to one side, pour the liquid from the lota or pear in the nasal orifice that was above. The liquid passes through that hole and exits through the bottom one. Keep your mouth open while doing this – respire or not. You can repeat once or twice on each side – every day, even more than once. Next, clean your nose gently to expel excess fluid. (McCall, 2010)
Surely you will feel that you can breathe more easily. This technique allows to reduce the impact of air pollution, eliminate allergens, viruses and toxins before the system absorbs them.
The Jala Neti is especially useful to reduce the symptoms of asthma, sinusitis, colds and nasal allergies.
# 2 .- Learn to Enjoy the Air: It is highly recommended to take an air bath every day, since there are many vital and healthy properties of this natural agent. There is no need to fear the air, you have to love it. While you enjoy the pure air in some open space, you can mentally repeat:
“Today I am from Mother Nature, who gives me this pure air to take advantage of in order to give me health and strength, in it I breathe health, strength and energy, I enjoy the sensation of the air that heaves me and I notice its beneficial effects. -I’m from Nature and I enjoy your gifts. ” (Yogi Ramacharaka, 1969)
It will also be essential to keep the whole house well ventilated, especially the room intended for sleeping.
Yoga therapy is an effective tool in the treatment of bronchial asthma. As the experience of yoga therapists shows, yoga exercises help to achieve a tangible improvement in the state. It is important that yogaterapy contributes to the preservation of the patient’s own compensatory capabilities and helps to stop medication. Let’s list the main practices on which the emphasis should be placed in the therapy of bronchial asthma.
Very important are sukshma vyayama, in which emphasis is placed on the development of the shoulder girdle. With asthma, hypertension of muscles associated with lung function can be observed: trapezoidal, belt, anterior dentate, ladder, spinal rectifier. When these muscles are tense, the movement of the ribs and the entire chest is broken, respectively, the position of the head and shoulder girdle can change. Because of this, the bronchi are drained and earlier the expiratory closure of the bronchi takes place, as a result of which ventilation in the lower parts of the lungs is significantly weakened. It is important to give joint exercises at the very beginning of the exercises, which include the work of the muscular, articular and ligament apparatus of the shoulder girdle.
Sukshma Vyayama helps to get rid of muscle tension, redistribute muscle tone, improve the performance of respiratory muscles and, as a result, optimize the ventilation of the lungs. Moreover, dynamic practices aimed at working out the shoulder girdle help normalize the interaction of the musculoskeletal system, the central nervous system and the bronchial tree.
Practices using forced breathing – kapalabhati and bhastrika are useful immediately for several reasons. First, the pressure drops in the airways contribute to the excretion of mucus. Secondly, frequent breathing activates the tone of the sympathetic nervous system, which helps the faster flow of anti-inflammatory processes in the bronchi.
Of course, in severe forms of bronchial asthma, bhastrika and kapalabhati should be developed gradually, beginning with small cycles and mild options, since rapid and rapid breathing can trigger an attack of asthma.
From asanas, the most important are the deflections: they help activate sympathetic and shape the muscle tone that promotes the therapy of bronchial asthma.
Full breathing is also a very important and effective practice. Full yoga breathing contributes to the restoration of the normal participation of the diaphragm in the respiratory process and, moreover, gives the patient the awareness that he can control his own breathing, which is very important from a psychological point of view.
The breathing of ujayi helps to more evenly include all the respiratory muscles in the breathing process, promotes a smoother cleansing of the airways from the exhaust air, prevents the collapse of small bronchial tubes during exhalation.
The practice of vibrating techniques helps to facilitate the excretion of mucus. For this, you can sing vowel sounds in combination with vibrational gymnastics: tapping the chest with brushes, fingertips and fists.
Pay attention to such shatkarms as neti and vamana-dhauti. Normal nasal breathing is very important, as stimulation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract will promote natural expansion of the bronchi and bronchioles. To normalize nasal breathing, use jala-neti and sutra-neti, as well as kapalabhati (also, incidentally, refer to shatkarmas) and bhastriku, which have already been mentioned above.
Vamana-dhauti can significantly reduce the frequency and duration of asthma attacks. This is due to the fact that vomiting changes the activity of the nuclei of the respiratory, cough center and affects the vagus nerve – the main nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system.
Relaxation techniques will also have a salutary effect: they will help you get rid of anxiety, fear of another bout. It is important to remember that therapy of bronchial asthma, especially at the initial stages, is aimed at maintaining a sympathetic tone, so shavasana should not be long: 5-7 minutes will be enough. You can also put something (a folded blanket, support block) under your back in the thoracic region.
READ Course Silva Method
With the systematic implementation of the above practices, the state of the patient with bronchial asthma in most cases is significantly improved. The patient enters into a stable remission, attacks appear less and less, doses of drugs are reduced.
