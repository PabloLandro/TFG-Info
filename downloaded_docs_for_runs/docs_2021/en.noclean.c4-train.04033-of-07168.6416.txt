Red Wine, Green Tea and Dark Chocolate: Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid May Be Important For Dementia Patients
Red Wine, Green Tea and Dark Chocolate
Welcome
Who says we have to suffer...to live a healthy happy vibrant life?
Red wine and dark chocolate... might seem decadent...but these guilty pleasures also might help us live longer...and healthier lives. Red wine and dark chocolate definitely improve an evening..but they also contain resveratrol..which lowers blood sugar. Red wine is a great source of catechins..which boost protective HDL cholesterol. Green tea? Protects your brain..helps you live longer..and soothes your spirit.
Red Wine, Green Tea and Dark Chocolate, the blog, is about living the good life...a life we create with our thoughts and our choices...and having fun the whole while!
I say lets make the thoughts good ones..and let the choices be healthy...exciting...and delicious! Bon Appetit!

Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid May Be Important For Dementia Patients
If you have a loved one who suffers with Dementia or Alzheimer's Disease supplemental B-12 and folic acid is inexpensive and may be helpful. For the rest of us, supplemental B-12 and folic acid not only protect our blood vessels from being damaged by elevated homocysteine, but may protect our cognitive processes as we age...
In a retrospective study involving 32 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 12 vascular dementia (VaD) patients, 83 dementia due to other causes (DOC) patients, and 127 controls, results indicate that AD and VaD patients may benefit from vitamin B12 and folate supplementation. In AD, VaD, and DOC patients, the levels of vitamin B(12), and folate were significantly lower, compared with controls. Thus, the authors of this study conclude, "Vitamin B(12) and folate were significantly low in both AD and VaD patients. Hence, B vitamin supplementation should be considered as possible targets for the therapeutic intervention in dementia."
Vitamin B(12) and folate represent modifiable risk factors for dementia. Deficient or insufficient levels may increase the risk of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) as their deficiency can increase the homocysteine level due to slowed methylation reaction. Homocysteine elevation has a neurotoxic effect that could lead to neurologic disturbances.

About Me
Jolie Root
All day long tea drinking, medical journalist, radio host and health educator living the good life...I'm passionate about cooking and sharing recipes. On my radio program "Food for Thought" I love to share tips for living a healthy life. If I'm not at my desk...I'll likely be found in the kitchen. If it is growing season I'll be in my garden..or if I'm working I'm probably jetting around teaching or attending conferences. On the very best days I'm on a horse somewhere...or on a boat...or in the mountains along a river loving nature. My message is simple: embrace prevention, eat well... mostly fruits and vegetables with a few ounces daily of high quality proteins (Think Mediterranean Diet) Embrace daily exercise and evidence based supplements like fish oils and vitamin D. And be kind... to yourself and others.

About Life...
"Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming - WOW---What A Ride!"
