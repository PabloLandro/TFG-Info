Exercise Is Essential for Osteoarthritis – The Many Benefits of Physical Activity
by Tim Drevna, July 18, 2018
You may have heard the phrase "exercise is medicine." This may seem like a paradox, but for people with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), many high-quality research studies show that exercise therapy is very helpful in decreasing pain and improving joint motion. Physical activity and exercise also help prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and many other health conditions. In fact, the right amount of physical activity has been shown to avert 35 health conditions and treat 26 chronic health conditions.
If you have hip and knee OA, you might not be getting enough physical activity and exercise throughout the day to stay healthy. A commentary published in the June 2018 issue of JOSPT highlights the importance of learning about the benefits of physical activity and exercise for improving your OA pain and preventing other chronic health conditions that often develop in those diagnosed with hip or knee OA.
