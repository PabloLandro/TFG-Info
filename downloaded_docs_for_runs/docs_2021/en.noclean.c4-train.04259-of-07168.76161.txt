Imitrex review by 44 year old female patient
Rating
Overall rating:
Effectiveness: Considerably Effective
Side effects: Mild Side Effects
Treatment Info
Condition / reason: migraine
Dosage & duration: 100mg taken 3-6/month for the period of 5 years
Other conditions: peri-menopause
Other drugs taken: nsaids
Reported Results
Benefits: the only complete relief from one sided headache and nausea
Side effects: slight fatigue occasional tachycardia
Comments: I was prescribed 100mg dosage pills, which are about the same price ($15/pill) as 50 mg. Taking a whole pill gave me relief but also a light headed sensation and odd heartbeat. I bit the pills in two to take approx. 50mg. Gradually my system became inured to it's effects and I had to take the whole pill, also occasionally it just doesn't work anymore. I have long lasting recurring headaches and have always been worried about overuse and rebound headaches, but so far, so good.

Condition / reason: migrain
Dosage & duration: 50mg taken when a migraine was coming on for the period of 10 years
Other conditions: arthritis
Other drugs taken: diclofenac sodium
Reported Results
Benefits: As soon as I felt a migraine coming on, I would feel very tired and feel dizzy at first and then the headache would come a little later. As soon as I could feel the headache I would take one tablet and within half an hour to an hour the headache would go and I would feel a lot better but still a little odd, a not quite 'here' feeling
Side effects: I don't think I have any side effects as such but I usually feel a little odd and very tired after a migraine but not sure if that is the after effects of the migraine or a side effect of taking Imigran. Before I was given these by my doctor my migrains lasted for 3 days with severe headache and nausea.
Comments: My doctor told me to take one as you feel a migraine coming on, if it does not work it is not worth taking another one but this rarely happens. If the headache goes but comes back I can take another one, I tend to do this if the attack is servere, I might need to take two or even three over two or three days but generally I find one tablets works. I have been taking it for approx 10 years or so.
Imitrex review by 59 year old female patient

Overall rating:
Effectiveness: Highly Effective
Side effects: Mild Side Effects
Treatment Info
Condition / reason: Migraine Headaches
Dosage & duration: 50 miligrams (dosage frequency: as needed, as often as 10-16 per a month) for the period of 1994 to present
Other conditions: none
Other drugs taken: none
Reported Results
Benefits: Within 30 minutes for injections to 2 hours for caplets I was pain free and functional. I had gone camping and run out of Imitrex. I was in pain for about 14 hours when I was taken to a little emergency clinic. They gave me an injection of 50 miligrams and in about 15 minutes I was pain free and feeling normal.
Side effects: Sometimes a little queasiness if taken on an empty stomach. Sometimes a little fatigue and a feeling of slight slowness.
Comments: My insurance only covers 9 pills every 28 days, so my physician prescribes 100 miligram caplets and I cut them in half to give more dosages. The caplets work well if the migraine is caught early. I most often wake up with the migraine starting and will take my pill and lie back down with a cold cloth or ice pack for 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how advanced the pain is. If I catch it really early the pain stops progressing and I feel well with in 30 minutes to an hour. If the maigraine has progressed too far the caplets don't work and I use a self injection of the 50 miligram dosage which works within 30 to 60 minutes without much side effect. If I take the Imitrex by mistake for a headache that is not a migraine I get queasy and tight in the stomach and feel hung over.

Other drugs taken: none
Reported Results
Benefits: I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription. Imitrex just isn't right for me. I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat. On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE! It comes 9 to a package. The packaging is a tri-fold "booklet" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet. It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded. I like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse. Definitely going back to Axert!
Side effects: flushing, tingling, prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness and pounding heartbeat.
Comments: Take 1 tablet by mouth. Max 2 tabs per 24 hours.

Benefits: I am so thankful for Imetrex. I have severe migraine headaches at leat 2 to 3 times a month. Before taking Imetrex my headaches would last 3 to 4 days. With Imetrex I can take the pill and my headache is gone within the hour. I have no side effects from the taking this medicine.

Comments: You can only take this medicine while not driving. You have to be able to go into a dark room and be able to lay for at least and hour and half. After that you are able to go back to normal living.

Condition / reason: Migraines
Dosage & duration: 100mg tablet taken 9 pills per month for the period of 9 times per month
Other conditions: Severe Depression and Mood Swing Disorder
Other drugs taken: Wellbutrin, Actonel, Valtrex
Reported Results
Benefits: Improved my quality of life and was able to maintain a job for longer period of time. I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to!
Side effects: Usually a feel of tiredness 10 to 12 hours after initial dose which can last up to 24 hours. Taking one dose of the pill has less effects of tiredness then taking the 6mg shot or taking them both within a 24hr period.
Comments: After over the counter medications failed to relieve headache pain I could tell if the headache was triggering a migraine and at that time take the imitrex pill and the migraine would be totally gone within 30 minutes. If the migraine was to strong with nausea symptoms and the pill didn't work, I would then take a imitrex 6mg shot for almost instant relief including nausea. Very rarely will the imitrex not work and then I have to go to emergency room.

Treatment Info
Condition / reason: migraine
Dosage & duration: 50mg taken as needed - 9 per month, more or less for the period of since its inception
Other conditions: none
Other drugs taken: premarin--very small dosage
Reported Results
Benefits: I had my first migraine at age 10 and suffered for almost 60 years. Then Imitrex--a miracle! Imitrex, finally, gave me my life back. As I get older and am now retired (72) and have less stress, I use the stat dose once or never during the year. The 50mg tablet usually returns me to normal within an hour. A "generic" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin, an anti-inflammatory, which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However, Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage, not wanting to pay the high cost, which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent. Now I'm worried, having to pay the entire cost myself, which is impossible. It's a horrible dilemma. I can't pay for it and they won't. What now?
Side effects: I have had no side effect at all, and I have been taking Imitrex since it came on the market.
Comments: I don't know what you mean by "details."

Benefits: Amazing results with minimal side effects. I suffered from severe headaches for years before finally consulting with a neurologist. Imitrex was life changing because I no longer worried about getting a migraine, which in turn reduced the number I was getting!
Side effects: Tingling in the back of my head and hands. Warm, strange feeling when running hands under water. All last for a short time and are well worth the relief.
Comments: Very simple - Take one pill when I felt like a migraine was coming on.

Comments: Sometimes it makes me feel really weird for awhile afterwards, but it is worth it to calm the pounding in my head. I've had migraines since kindergarten and only recently discovered Imitrex. I never knew there was actually a pill that would take away a migraine. I think they cause rebound headaches, and they're ridiculously expensive, but it's more than worth it in the moment.

Comments: I have had migraines since I was 9 years old. Through JR high I would finish a bottle of aspirin in a week and a half. About every 3 or 4 days they were horrible with nausea , cold pack on my head, stay out of the light. About 9 years ago I developed cluster migraines. They last all day, nite for 4-5 months. I was introduced to imitex in 2005. THANK GOD!!! They have been increasing in cost terribly. I went through sinus aerials, allergy tests, bio feed back. etc. Nothing helped. I thought I would take my life when these clusters started. Not only could I not function but I had to sleep sitting up. Lying dowm made them worse. I have no side effects. But the imitrex is not working as well and I take aleve with it. Treximet is not strong enough.

Reported Results
Benefits: If I have a classical migraine, I cannot function without taking an Imitrex. Imitrex takes the edge off the pain, takes away the feeling of nausea and I am able to work on the computer, which I otherwise could not do with a migraine. The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex.
Side effects: I usually feel really tired and depressed the next day after haven taken Imitrex. I feel the drug depresses all systems. It takes off the edge of the pain, but still leaves a dull feeling in the head.
Comments: I take an imitrex within an hour of onset of a migraine headache. However, I do not take more than one Imitrex per day. Also, I usually do not take it two days in a row, if I don't have to, as the drug makes me feel very tired and depressed the next day.

Other conditions: none
Other drugs taken: none
Reported Results
Benefits: I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting. This has been extremely beneficial to me. I have gotten my life back. I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days. I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain. I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed. Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine. I felt very unreliable, which is not me. I am a very responsible person.
Side effects: I have never had any negative side effects from Imitrex.
Comments: I take half of a tablet at the first sign that a migraine is starting. Usually within 45-60 minutes the beginning symptoms of my migraine are gone. Once in awhile, at this point (60 minutes after I have taken half of a tablet) the symptoms are not noticeable different, so I will take another half of a tablet.

Side effects: I was often tired after a severe headache. Otherwise, I didn't notice too many side effects.
Comments: I built up an immunity to the effects of Imitrex. I took them more often and needed to take more of them. I was eventually taking nearly 3 per day. It was extremely expensive, and the bigger issue is that such a high dosage isn't good long term. It was hell breaking the addiction!

Benefits: my migraines would always leave after taking imitrex or sumatriptan and then if taken at night i could go back to sleep and sleep through the night and wake feeling just fine.
Side effects: I found that my blood veins would stick out all down my arms and hands during the next days after the treatment and that these veins would be very painful. there was an ache throughout my arms and sometimes in my legs due to this sumatriptan.
Comments: the optimum time for the shot is at bedtime and this is when I would take the shot and immediately lie down. my heart would race just after taking the shot and i would feel pain shooting through my body. but i have always found that the headace left EXCEPT if i had the shots too close together in that this seemed to stir up the headache for some reason.

Reported Results
Benefits: Imitrex was the miracle drug for me at first. Suffered with migraines since the age of 7 and never got relief except through ER shot of stadol/phenergen starting at age 27. So when doc gave me imitrex shot the first time I thought I found my miracle. It does get rid of the pain completely. I have no complaint about that. I used to only get migraines once or twice a month.
Side effects: A bit tired feeling...sort of lathargic or weak feeling. Here is the bad for me. Since taking imitrex, the frequency of migraines have increased. I got rebound from this drug everytime I use it. It'ts totally ridiculous to find a drug that gets rid of the pain but I cannot use it anymore due to it's effect on frequency. I've tried all the other triptans and only imitrex has worked for me but I can no longer take it.
Comments: Again about the rebound effect. Some doctors refuse to admit that this drug causes rebound headaches but for me it did. I took nothing else...no OTC drugs or anything else for the headach. ONLY the imitrex. When I realized what was happening I stopped taking drug and just suffer through as I used to. That's the bad...the good is frequency of mograines are much less.

Benefits: My migraine intensed but then subsided within 2 hours of taking this medication.
Side effects: When you receive this medication it comes with a patient information pamphlet giving each side effect for the drug and i experienced every side effect there was. At first I experienced heat flushes, then slight muscle spasms, 45 minutes into this drug's effect I experienced a tightness in my neck. This scared me because i thought i was having an intense allergic reaction to the drug. Then, there was a lot of pressure in my head so i then took an Aleve and that pretty much eased everything out. I will never take this medication again.

Reported Results
Benefits: none
Side effects: Within 30 minutes of taking my first dose of imitrex (on Christmas eve) when I felt the onset of my migraine, I began to feel a heavy, cramping feeling in my muscles like I had slept the wrong way. Then my back began to ache and my joints began to cramp up and throb. My chest felt heavy and I had trouble breathing and remembering to breath. My throat and neck hurt so back and it felt like i had strained it or pulled a muscle. My train of thought was messed up and I could not concentrate or form full comprehensive sentences. There was nothing I could do so I just waited it out, towards the end (nearly 4 hours later) I tried eating and my salivary glands went crazy! I felt like I was drinking and eating scalding hot food, it was crazy! I will NEVER take that again. I called my doctor and she moved me immediately to MAXALT, IT IS GREAT, I LOVE IT. I have other allergies so it is no surprise to me that I had a reaction, but the severity was shocking. Don't settle for a medication that makes you feel only half good.
Comments: Took when then on set of a migraine was felt.

Other conditions: Hypothyroidism
Other drugs taken: Synthroid, Cytomel
Reported Results
Benefits: Since my hypothyroidism is being better treated I rarely get a migraine anymore. I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too.
Side effects: Side effects for me include: Heaviness in my limbs, muscle aches, tight feeling in head, flushing, increased heart rate, drowsiness.
Comments: Take 100 mg at first indication of migraine. May repeat dosage after 2 hours if pain isn't relieved. Thereafter, only 1 may be taken in a 24 hour period.
