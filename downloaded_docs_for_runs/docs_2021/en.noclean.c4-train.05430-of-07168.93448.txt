How To Treat Wrinkles Using A Skin Care Cream That Works
You may be shocked to learn that doctors consider anyone over 35 to be “of advanced age.” What makes matters worse is that this “old-age” classification also applies to your skin, but, don’t despair, there are things you can do to help you deal with the aging process.
First, you need to get your brain to realize the importance of early prevention and treatment of aging skin. For as obvious as it may sound, skin is always aging. So, establishing a good skin care routine is crucial if what you want is to maintain your skin youthful and as wrinkle-free as possible.
As an adolescent you should acquire the habit of daily cleansing. Washing your face with the appropriate products twice a day and following up with toner and moisturizer is a basic skin care routine that will do your skin well. As you age, you can start adding different products to minimize the effects of time.
If you are accustomed to producing repeated facial gestures such as frowning or pouting then you may begin to notice face and eye wrinkles even when your peers still have smooth skin. If this is the case, it is advisable to begin using anti wrinkle treatments as early as your mid and late twenties. If your skin is still in good condition, you may be able to postpone the use of the products until your mid thirties.
When you hit your thirties, start exfoliating more often to help increase cell turnover. Exfoliate twice a week (more if you have oily skin) to get the best results. You might also consider investing in a good wrinkle cream for your face.
As you get older, make sure that the products you purchase are gentle enough for your skin. And don’t worry; there are plenty of products out there capable of treating mature skin.
Anti wrinkle creams are a vital part of your aging skin care routine. The best wrinkle cream should include ingredients such as retinol and hyaluronic acid along with soothing ingredients such as liquorice extract that can help alleviate inflammation in older skin.
Apply your wrinkle cream during the night-time so that you do not expose the product to direct sunlight. This is suggested because certain ingredients will be deactivated by sunlight. During the daytime you should use a moisturizer that contains some sort of sun protection to help minimize possible sun damage.
Eliminating and avoiding bad habits can also contribute to a healthier looking skin. Bad habits such as smoking and sun bathing should be avoided. You need to understand. Tanning is nothing more than voluntary sun damage while smoking leads to thinner and more vulnerable skin.
Establishing a regular aging skin care routine early on by use of effective skin care creams will help you maintain healthy and youthful skin.
How To Find The Right Skin Care Cream For Your Scars
Skin care products abound. There are face care creams for different types of skin as well as every skin problem imaginable. One of the most common problems among skin types is oily skin and acne. These skin problems can greatly benefit from finding the right skin care cream, but so can other conditions such as scars.
Scars are an integral part of the bodies healing process. When your skin is subject to infection or suffers from a lesion your body goes into “automatic-rescue-mode”. It responds to the emergency by producing inflammation to repair the breach and expel the infection.
However, the problem with this rescue drill is that the body is incapable of discriminating between healthy and diseased cells. So, to replace the break in the skin or to replace the cells that have been destroyed, a scar is formed.
Scars Treated With Effective Scar Cream
As with any skin care product, a good skin care cream for scars must contain certain ingredients to make it effective, here is a look at a few of the must-have ingredients for acne creams.
One of these key ingredients is retinol (Vitamin A). This substance is important because it promotes the regeneration of skin cells and the reparation of damaged tissues.
Rose hip seed oil is a product that contains high levels of Vitamin A. In addition, it also has Vitamin C, omega-6 and omega-3. This is a safe bet if what you want is a potent treatment for scars.
Another beneficial ingredient is Helix aspersa muller extract, which comes from a garden snail. Its regenerative properties allow it to be a great help in treating facial scars and stretch marks.
The serum obtained from the secretion of this tiny creature is a wonderful addition to any product that treats scars like stretch marks creams. Its molecules, structures and cells are very similar to that of human skin, making it a highly compatible match. It also offers antioxidant properties that make the best choice among skin care ingredients.
Due to a process known as hydroxylation, Helix aspersa muller extract helps clear out dead material and open the vascular system allowing the skin cells to regenerate. It also rebuilds collagen and elastin in the scarred areas. This is great news especially for people with facial scars.
Another important component in scar treatment creams are AHAs or alpha hydroxyl acids. These acids are usually derived from food products, for example, glycolic acid extracted from sugar cane, lactic acid extracted from sour milk, and citric acid which is extracted from citrus fruits.
The best thing about this group of acids is their molecular size is so small that they easily penetrate into the dermal layers of the skin helping promote the formation of new stratum corneum.
The daily use of skin care products and stretch marks treatment creams that contain any or all of these ingredients can help eliminate unsightly scar tissue.
