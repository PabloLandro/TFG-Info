Hey there just wondering I there's a cure for scars from psoriasis ? I've been using tenovate cream it's completely cleared it up after 10years of living with this horrible skin problem so now I'm just left with what looks like pigmentation ? White patches I'm naturally tanned olive skinned but it's crazy how it's got rid of the psoriasis. Which is great but now they look like huge scars!! I'm still using this cream have been since 3weeks ago, everyday once a day instructions said to use it three times daily but I found results within 3days of just using it once daily so that's my question and would really love for some answers ??? Thankyou very much

First of all, before you start spending a bunch of money on expensive designer scar creams, you should research what you're actually buyer. Most of these scar removal products are just a cocktail of moisturizers, Vitamin E, and maybe some "antioxidants" or other unproven fillers. When it comes down to it, these products are usually overpriced junk that don't do anything to actually get rid of scars. For instance, Vitamin E has not been proven effective for the treatment of scars. In fact it has shown to worsen scarring in some studies. Any positive effects you may see from these products are likely from the massaging of the area daily.
Here are some simple tips that can help reduce scarring and won't cost you an arm and a leg:
Sunscreen - During the healing stage, your scar is very sensitive to ultraviolet light. It can easily burn and become hyperpigmented and discolored. This makes the scar very red and ultimately much more noticeable. Once this damage has been done, it's a real pain to get rid of. Do yourself a favor and keep it covered.
Exfoliation - Exfoliating the top layers of the scar can help to flatten and smooth the affected area. Don't overdo this as you can irritate the skin and make your scar more noticeable. There are many natural acids that can do this gently. For instance, lemon juice is often touted as a natural bleach for scars. While this is somewhat true, its main function is to exfoliate the skin which helps flatten it out. This makes it a helpful natural product for getting rid of scars.
There are many simple and natural products and techniques just like these that can dramatically reduce the visibility of many scars. Don't always fall for the common myths when it comes to natural scar treatment. Most of the well known natural treatments are ineffective. Never apply any topical product to the skin until you know it works, and more importantly, why it works. Most common scar products and remedies are not scientifically backed in any way and in some cases can cause irritation and worsen scars. With the right combination of natural treatments and scar removal methods, you can reduce or eliminate scarring in many cases. No matter how old your scar is or how you got it, you can improve the appearance without expensive and costly procedures.

Hi. I am a 16 year old girl, I suffered this disease since I was 13. In my 3 years of suffering, I still don't know how to cure this thing. I usually likes to join pageant since I was a kid and when this Psoriasis came into my life, it ruined my skin and made my confidence low. Now, I cannot wear shorts or trendy clothes, being on trend is very important for us teenagers. I DON'T WANT THIS PSORIASIS RUIN MY TEENAGER LIFE.

Moisturizing my skin, most esp the affected areas, really helped for me. And comparing the scars on my calves to the ones on my arms, the latter are lighter.
I guess it's because they get exposed to the sun w/c is a natural source for Vitamin D & UV w/c are known to be beneficial for psoriasis patients.
I wear pants all the time coz of the scars on my legs - it's just a personal choice. But I've read of psoriasis patients wearing shorts or going to beach just like any other person. But of course they get stared at. You can't really let go of that one.
I have drank Barley before. Try googling about it. It has helped w/ the plaques & scars around my back & some around my stomach, I guess. Even my dance friends have noticed that some of my plaques & scars vanished. I stopped tho coz it was a bit expensive. But I sure do want to save up & try it again. I was on Barley for a month & 2 weeks I think but I already saw changes after a week or so of drinking it.
