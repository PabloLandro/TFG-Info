Are You Taking Vitamin D3?
It is not always practical to get your vitamin D from sunshine, and quite difficult to get adequate amounts from your diet so for many people, a vitamin D3 supplement is a great way to ensure adequate levels of this important protector are always available in your bloodstream. There is a vast body of science showing the many health benefits of Vitamin D–
Maintains Your Calcium Balance
Maintenance of blood calcium levels within a narrow range is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system, as well as for bone growth, and maintenance of bone density.
Aids Your Cell Differentiation
Cellular differentiation results in the specialization of cells for specific functions in your body. While cellular proliferation is essential for growth and wound healing, uncontrolled proliferation of cells with mutations may lead to diseases like cancer.
Boosts Your Immunity
Vitamin D is a potent immune system modulator that may enhance your immunity and inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases such as, Parkinson’s Disease and MS.
Has a Role in Insulin Secretion
The active form of vitamin D plays a role in insulin secretion under conditions of increased insulin demand.
Blood Pressure Regulation
Adequate vitamin D levels may be important for decreasing the risk of high blood pressure.
Vitamin D and Mood
Higher dosages of Vitamin D have been shown to help relieve symptoms of SAD (seasonal affective disorder) such as depression and lethargy.
See your doctor about having your Vitamin D levels checked.
How much Vitamin D is recommended?
Vitamin D Council recommended amounts Based on the body’s indicated daily vitamin D usage, Vitamin D Council recommends the following amounts of supplemental vitamin D3 per day in the absence of proper sun exposure.
Healthy children under 1 year – 1,000 IU.
Healthy children over 1 year – 1,000 IU per every 25 lbs of body weight.
Healthy adults and adolescents – at least 5,000 IU.
Pregnant and lactating mothers – at least 6,000 IU.
Stop at one of our 3 locations or visit our website to pick up some Vitamin D today!

Are You Feeling a Bit Stressed Out?
We have the perfect thing for you! If you haven’t tried L-theanine, you’re missing out on one of nature’s most effective anti-anxiety remedies that is safe to use without unwanted side effects! You’ll feel calmer but you won’t be tired or foggy-headed! In fact, it helps you to think more clearly.
Read all about it, then come and get it!
L-theanine and Relaxation
Research on human volunteers has demonstrated that L-theanine creates a sense of relaxation approximately 30-40 minutes after you take it. L-theanine directly stimulates the production of alpha brain waves, creating a state of deep relaxation and mental alertness similar to what is achieved through meditation.
L-theanine and Depression
L-theanine has a significant effect on the release or reduction of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, resulting in improved memory and learning ability. L-theanine may also influence emotions due to its effects on the increased release of dopamine. Dopamine is a vital neurotransmitter. Too little or too much can cause wide-ranging problems from mood disorders to Parkinson’s disease. Your body produces it in sufficient quantities, but sometimes lifestyle factors interfere and your brain might need a little help. When your body’s level of dopamine is on target, you are happy. You can process pleasure, think clearly, you are motivated and have the desire to accomplish things.
L-theanine and Stress and Anxiety
Stress and anxiety are debilitating conditions that upset the balance of our hormones leading to a loss of our well-being, performance, and even lifespan. Stress impairs the immune system, leaving us vulnerable to opportunistic infections, and can cause depression. People under stress can mitigate many of the harmful effects of stress with L-theanine.
L-theanine Does Not Cause Drowsiness
One of the greatest benefits of L-theanine is that you can use it without becoming sedated in the process. L-theanine doesn’t make one drowsy, nor does it promote sleep because this amino acid does not produce theta waves in the brain. It is in many sleep formulas though, to promote relaxation so that you can fall asleep more easily. It helps quiet the mind.
L-theanine is most effective in the range of 100-200 mg on an empty stomach, with the effect being felt within 30 minutes and lasting for 8-10 hours. FDA recommends a maximum dose of 1200 mg daily, although the reason for this limit is not clear, due to its well documented safety.
BE READY for all the stress being thrown your way! Stop in to Baums and try a sample of L-Theanine and enjoy your day! Don’t forget Baums brand L-theanine is 20% off this month!

Stay calm throughout the holidays with GABA
What is GABA?
GABA (Gamma amino butyric acid) is one of the non-essential amino acids that is synthesized in the brain from another amino acid, Glutamic acid. In the brain it acts as a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger that transmits signals from one cell to another) that works efficiently for calming your mood and reducing anxiety. It also plays an important role in improving brain function. This amino acid not only shows soothing effects on the brain but also slows down the heart rate and regulates breathing. It also acts as a sleep inducing agent. In your brain, if the level of GABA declines you will become anxious and uneasy. GABA can help you to relax. Reduced secretion of GABA in the brain may also lead to a number of neurological problems such as sleep disorders and epilepsy/seizures.
GABA has the ability to reduce the over stimulation of brain cells, inducing relaxation and relieving nervous tension.
Health benefits of GABA
Anti-Stress agent
During a stressful situation, it can help the brain function by blocking the stress related messages that are reaching the brain, hence it can be useful in decreasing emotional stress and hypertension. GABA can also be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of hopelessness.
GABA supplementation has shown to have positive calming effects there by reducing stress and aggravation.
Your Brain’s Natural Calming Agent:
GABA is the natural calming agent in the brain that helps to promote a good nights sleep as well as improving sleep quality. GABA is also effective in reducing mood swings in females during the menstrual cycle and helpful for easing depression.
Stimulating growth Hormone secretion
GABA has been used to enhance the secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary gland (master gland of the body that affects most of the hormones). Since human growth hormone is involved in fat metabolism, its deficiency causes accumulation of fat around the hips and waist. Another problem associated with a low level of growth hormone is reduced thinking capability. In these conditions GABA indirectly improves physical and mental performance as well as decreases body fat by increasing the level of growth hormone.
Functions in different health problems
This amino acid can suppress the activity of brain cells so it may be effective in treatment of certain over stimulated brain disorders such as attention deficit disorder and epilepsy.
Deficiencies in GABA can also lead to:
Anxiety symptoms
Irritability
Headaches
Hypertension
Lower sex drive
Depression
Increase your GABA
The best way to get GABA is through supplementation. It can be taken in its pure amino acid form or can produced in the brain by L-Theanine. While it is possible to increase the body’s GABA supply through food sources, usually this is not enough to see any positive effects.
Which GABA supplement is the best?
Many companies offer GABA supplements, but which one is the best? Many of these products contain too much or too little GABA, require too many pills, are too expensive, or are of poor quality.
Natural Factors PharmaGABA supplies 100mg of pure GABA in a delicious chewable wafer. The product was formulated by Dr. Micheal Murray, one of the world’s leading authorities on natural medicine.
Baum’s Natural Foods carries Natural Factors products including PharmaGABA. Visit one of our three locations and find out more about PharmaGABA today!
