Athlete's Foot Treatment
Informed patients are healthy patients. It's important to become familiar with your foot or ankle condition to ensure quick recovery and proper treatment. Out staff is dedicated to providing you with numerous forms of self-education including our blog, patient education library, and links to notable podiatric organizations like the American Podiatric Medical Association and more!
At The Plateau Foot & Ankle Clinic we believe that providing educational material gives you a solid base from which to make better informed decisions about your health. Dr. Howard Schaengold provides excellent comprehensive medical & surgical care for all foot and ankle problems.
Some of the most common conditions that we treat include:
• Bunions
• Diabetic Foot Problems
• Fungal & Ingrown Toenails
• Heel Pain
• Sports Injuries
• Neuromas
Our specialties include surgery, sports medicine, heel pain, and bunion treatment. If you have questions or concerns please contact our office. Our information is always up-to-date and our assistance is readily available.
Simply learning about your foot or ankle condition and performing preventative maneuvers does not substitute for proper consultation and examination by Dr. Schaengold. Let an experienced leader in podiatric care treat your feet. Make an appointment with our Sammamish office by calling 425.868.3338 today! You may also request an appointment online.
If untreated, skin blisters and cracks caused by Athlete's Foot can cause serious bacterial infections. The treatment of Athlete's Foot depends on the type and extent of the fungal infection, so it is important to consult our practice before choosing a therapy.
Athlete's Foot can usually be treated with antifungal creams. Re-infection is common, so it is important to continue the therapy as prescribed, even if the fungus appears to have gone away. Lasting cases of Athlete's Foot may require foot soaks before applying antifungal creams. Severe infections that appear suddenly (acute) usually respond well to treatment. Toenail infections that develop with Athlete's Foot tend to be more difficult to cure than fungal skin infections.
