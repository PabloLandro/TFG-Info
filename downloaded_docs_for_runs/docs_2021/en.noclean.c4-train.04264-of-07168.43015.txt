Don’t let heel pain keep you from enjoying life. Find out what you can do about it now!
Heel pain is an all-too-common problem that many people deal with everyday, but it doesn’t make the issue any less important. Not sure what is to blame for your discomfort? Then it’s time you turned to our Houston podiatrists, Dr. Mark Moss and Dr. Hina Hassan, to find out.
There are many causes of heel pain including,
Ruptured Achilles tendon
Bursitis
Heel spur
Osteomyelitis
Peripheral neuropathy
Rheumatoid arthritis
Stress fracture
However, the two main causes of heel pain are plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis. Here are the differences between these two common foot issues:
Plantar fasciitis
This condition is the result of inflamed plantar fascia, the thick band of tissue that runs from the bone of the heel to the tip of the foot. If this tissue is stretched too much it can cause inflammation.
Symptoms: You may notice pain under the foot that is more intense when you first start moving in the morning. As you move around, you may experience a lessening of your symptoms that may later flare up after physical activity or after standing for long periods of time.
Treatment: Most cases of plantar fasciitis can be treated through conservative at-home measures, but it’s important that you see your Houston foot doctors at the first sign of pain to make sure that your heel pain is the result of plantar fasciitis and not another condition.
Common treatments include:
Icing
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Bracing or splinting
Rest
Avoiding high-impact physical activities
If these treatments don’t reduce your pain you may need to consider other options including:
Prescription pain medications
Electrical stimulation
Surgery (Rare)
Achilles tendinitis
This condition affects the Achilles tendon, which connects the back of the foot to the calf. Achilles tendinitis typically develops from overuse or through a sudden increase in either the intensity or duration of physical activity. As a result, microtears occur within the tendon that causes it to weaken and hurt.
Symptoms: A slight pain above the heel that you may notice most when walking or running. There may also be swelling and limited range of motion when you flex your foot.
Treatment: Fortunately, there are many ways to treat Achilles tendinitis including:
Avoiding certain strenuous physical activities
Stretching and strengthening exercises
Physical therapy
Icing the foot
Elevating the foot to reduce swelling
Wearing a compressive brace
Taking anti-inflammatory medication
Steroidal injections
If you want to get to the bottom of your heel pain then it’s time you turned to Coastal Foot & Ankle Associates in Houston, TX. Don’t let foot pain keep you from the things you love.
