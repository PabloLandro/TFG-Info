What is Imitrex Used For?
Imitrex (Sumatriptan) is prescribed to treat migraines. It aids in relieving headache, pain, and additional migraine symptoms. Imitrex (Sumatriptan) is classified as a triptan. It works on a neurotransmitter, serotonin, that generates the narrowing of blood vessels within the brain. It can also ease the pain by working on certain nerves within the brain.
How is Imitrex Used
Read the Patient Information Leaflet before you start taking Imitrex and whenever you order a refill. If you have any questions, ask your health care professional. Take this medication as directed by your doctor. Imitrex is administered usually by 1 spray into one nostril. Blow your nose prior to administering this medication. Keep your head facing forward, close one nostril using your finger. Place the nozzle of the device into the open nostril and breathe in press down. Take away the bottle from your nose, and breathe normally in through the nose and out through the mouth.
If your symptoms do not improve, do not increase your doses before speaking with your health care professional. Do not exceed doses of more than 40 milligrams in 24 hours.
Speak with your physician if you need to make changes to your dosage or if you are having persisting symptoms.
