Actively Serving Through Life's Journey
Hospice care is a loving, personally tailored approach to end of life care. At Active Hospice we believe in providing end of life care with the comfort and dignity that you deserve. We always strive to promote the well-being and maximum independence of our patients. Active Hospice provides palliative comfort care. Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and accurate assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.
Hospice care is provided by an interdisciplinary team working towards providing emotional, social, spiritual and physical
support to patients and their significant others. Active Hospice provides a team of nurses, social workers, certified nursing
assistants, chaplain services, volunteers and therapists to better serve our patients. We pledge to lead by example in the
community by placing patient care where is belongs, above profit! We always strive to promote the well-being and
maximum independence of our patients, and above all, we love those we serve.
Active's 360º Care Program
Active Hospice is designed to not only offer support and care for our patients, but also for their caregivers. Many family members and friends give countless hours, energy, time, and love caring for a loved one living with a life-limiting illness. These selfless acts of service take an emotional and physical toll on caregivers everywhere. Our goal is to provide services and resources to not only provide comfort and dignity to our patients, but help and support to their loving caregivers. We call this the Active 360º Care Program.

Alternative Therapy
Music Therapy

Music Therapy
Active’s 360º Care Program understands the power of music. Personalized music has a way of bringing out the best in all of us. It has the ability to brighten our mood and better connect us to our memories, tender moments and experiences. We believe in offering the powerful benefits of personalized music.
Connecting our patients with their favorite music can vastly improve quality of life regardless of their cognitive or physical status. It is especially powerful for those that are lonely, isolated, depressed, or facing serious illness or disease. Personalized music is no cure, but it may well be the best therapy currently available to relieve those suffering from depression and loneliness. It can relieve boredom, empower choice, enable memory, and provide avenues for genuine communication with loved ones and caregivers.
• Beloved music helps to reduce depression and anxiety and can also help relieve moderate pain.
• Musical favorites tap deep memories, often improving quality of life and restoring identity.
• Participants are happier, more social and receptive to care and family visits.
• Personalized music can help to reduce reliance on anti-psychotic, anti-depressant and pain medications.
What Do We Do?
We work with our patients and their loved ones to learn about their musical preferences. We strive to learn the music that each individual loves. With this knowledge and teamwork we create tailored playlists for each resident to help them unlock
what the heart never forgets!

Bereavement
Bereavement
VIEW THIS PROGRAM
Bereavement
Bereavement is the natural time period for grieving and mourning after the passing of a loved one. Grieving is a normal reaction to the feeling of loss. Individuals often have feelings of grief as a mental, physical, social or emotional reaction to the passing of a loved one. Individuals may experience feelings of sadness, guilt, anxiety, despair, pain, anger, etc. These feelings can lead to physical reactions that can be hard to cope with, physical reactions such as: difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, physical problems with pain, illness, fatigue, etc.
At Active we know that bereavement is different for each individual’s journey. There is no “one size fits all” approach to helping close family and friends cope with the passing of a loved one they cherish. Some individuals just need someone to listen and a shoulder to cry on, while others may need grief counseling or therapy to work through their grieving process.
Active’s bereavement program is designed to help each individual through their unique journey of grievance and healing. Our bereavement program focuses on:
• Supporting and guiding family members as they come to terms with their grief and begin to move forward. Creating a relationship of trust where they are safe to express their feelings and thoughts, and work together with healthy coping mechanisms.
• Counseling and therapy sessions as needed.
• Providing support to families as they problem-solve around adjustment issues.
• Helping to guide and direct families through different decision making processes.
• Identifying social and spiritual concerns that are unique to each family.
• Reaching out in different ways to express understanding, sympathy, and love.
• Assisting family members and friends to adapt to an environment without their loved one, while finding the path that each individual takes to remembering and cherishing memories of their loved one.
Our bereavement program is tailored to offer support and sympathy to families for up to 13 months following the loss of a loved one. As part of Active’s 360º Care program we also provide monthly support group sessions at our Active Hospice location. These support groups offer families and friends the time and environment to talk about their loved one, and share memories that are close to their heart. Sharing these experiences helps others in the community who are facing similar situations.
Who pays for Hospice?
