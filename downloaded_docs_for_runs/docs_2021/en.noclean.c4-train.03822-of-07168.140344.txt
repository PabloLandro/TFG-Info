Nairn Healthcare - Spring 2019 Newsletter
Staffing
Nairn Healthcare is delighted to announce that Dr Amy Carter has joined the partnership. Dr Carter has been with the Practice since 2012. We have also welcomed our new ST3 doctor, Dr John Kilbride to the Practice. Dr Kilbride is now available for bookable appointments. We will also be welcoming new FY2 doctor, Dr Daniel Carolan, to the Practice at the start of April along with new Practice Nurse, Sue Littlemore. Sue has previously worked with NHS England and specialises in asthma and diabetes.
We will be saying goodbye to Practice Nurse, Joan Fraser, at the end of March. Joan has been with Nairn Healthcare for over 2 years and will be leaving us for a post in Culloden. Dr Nada Reza has also finished her placement with us and will be departing at the start of April. We wish both Joan and Dr Reza all the best for the future.
Bowel Screening
April is Bowel Cancer Awareness month. Bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in Scotland but it is treatable and curable especially if diagnosed early. Taking part in bowel cancer screening is the best way to get diagnosed early. It could save your life!
If you are aged between 50-74, the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme will invite you for screening every 2 years. A kit will be sent to your home address where it is to be completed and returned to the screening centre based in Dundee. 1 in 20 over 50s will get bowel cancer at some point in their lives, screening aims to find bowel cancer at an early stage and if the cancer is detected early enough, there is a 90% chance of treating the disease successfully.
Screening saves lives but at the moment, in some areas of the UK, only a third of those who receive a test in the post complete it. Thousands of people are missing out on the best way to detect bowel cancer early when it is easier to treat and there is a greater chance of survival.
For more information call the helpline on 0800 0121 833 or visit www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/screening.
Annual recalls
Nairn Healthcare would like to encourage all patients with a mobile phone to provide us with their number. Nairn Healthcare now provides 2-way texting for appointments. If you have booked an appointment 2 working days in advance, we will text you and remind you of said appointment and if you wish to cancel, you just have to reply to the text.
We have also started recalling patients for their annual reviews (asthma, diabetic etc) by text message. It is really beneficial to both the Practice and the patient to have the up-to-date mobile number on record. If you don’t own a mobile phone, please don’t worry as a letter will be sent out to you as previous.
Tick information
Winter is now officially over and we are all looking forward to summer and getting out in the countryside and gardens.
However, the country undergrowth from spring until autumn is covered in tiny ticks which may carry bacteria and can transfer to people when the tick attaches itself. If the tick is removed properly and correctly, there is no risk to health but there is a risk of developing Lyme disease if this is not done correctly.
A symptom of Lyme disease is a red skin rash which can be cured with a simple antibiotic. If the rash
goes unnoticed, it can result in joint pain or nerve problems which may require stronger antibiotics.
If you find a tick on yourself or your child, wait until you get home and calmly remove the tick with a tick removal tool which is designed to get underneath the tick and lift it off safely. Don’t attempt to remove it with your fingers. Using fingers or tweezers risk squeezing the tick and actually injecting the Lyme disease bacteria into your blood.
DO NOT USE VASELINE, CIGARETTES OR ALCOHOL
For more information, please pick up the Tick Information Guide from reception or read online at http://www.nairnhealthcaregroup.co.uk/website/S55041/files/tick%20information%20sheet.pdf

Prevent Suicide Highland App
On average, two people die by suicide every day in Scotland and is the main cause of death among young people. Suicide affects all ages, genders and cultures. If you feel suicidal, please don’t hide it. Talk to someone you trust or phone a helpline.
There is an app available called Prevent Suicide Highland. This is available from App Stores free of charge and gives information about suicide, on how to help others and help lines available.
The app also has information for those struggling with drugs and alcohol, mental health issues, victims of sexual or domestic abuse and those who wish for help with bereavement. There is also information for the LGBT community who feel they need some added support.
This app has also been recommended by our local Community Mental Health Team.
