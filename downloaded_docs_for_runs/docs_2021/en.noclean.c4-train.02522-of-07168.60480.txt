Nutrients are important in arthritis care! Arthritis is not a 'natural part of aging'. Over 100 forms are preventable and potentially curable. Providing the body with the correct nutrients to help this process is a significant step in the right direction in achieving this objective. Pharmaceutical medicines should be a last resort if you suffer from arthritis. This is because of their real and serious side effects. Arthrit-Eze from Xtend Life is a completely natural arthritis supplement and does not contain any pharmaceutical ingredients. It offers potential relief and rejuvenation for all forms of arthritis, safely, naturally and without side effects. You'll find ingredients in Arthrit-Eze that would be rare to find in another natural arthritis formula... mainly because of cost and difficulties of formulations. Some examples are SAMe, Cetyl Myristoleate, Celery Extract and Phellodendron Bark. Learn more about this natural arthritis formula...
What is septic arthritis (infectious arthritis)?
Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or pyogenic arthritis, is an infection in the joint (synovial) fluid and joint tissues. The infection usually reaches the joint(s) though the bloodstream, although some joints may become infected due to an injection, surgery, or injury. Infectious arthritis can occur in any age group, including newborns and children. In adults, it usually affects the wrists or one of the patient's weight-bearing joints--most often the knee--although about 20% of adult
patients have symptoms in more than one joint. Multiple joint infection is common in children and typically involves the shoulders, knees, and hips. The most common joint affected by infection is the knee. Small joints, such as those in fingers and toes, are more likely to become infected after a viral infection or direct injury, such as a bite. Among intravenous drug users, joints such as those in the spine or sternum (breastbone) may be involved. People who already have rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disease are more likely to develop infectious arthritis. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency because of the damage it causes to bone as well as cartilage, and its potential for creating septic shock, which is a potentially fatal condition.
Septic arthritis is uncommon from age 3 to adolescence, at which time the incidence increases again (appearing as gonococcal arthritis in females with cervical gonorrhea). Children with septic arthritis are more likely than adults to be infected with group B streptococcus and Haemophilus influenza. Acute septic arthritis tends to be caused by organisms such as staphylococcus, streptococcus (pneumoniae) and group B streptococcus while chronic septic arthritis (which occurs less frequently) is caused by organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans. The knee and the hip are the most commonly infected joints. Risk factors include patients diagnosed with chronic rheumatoid arthritis, certain systemic infections, certain types of cancer, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IV drug abusers and alcoholics, and patients with artificial (prosthetic) joints. Patients with recent joint injuries or surgery, or patients receiving medications injected directly into a joint are also at a greater risk for developing septic arthritis. Typically, women and male homosexuals are at greater risk for septic arthritis than are male heterosexuals.
