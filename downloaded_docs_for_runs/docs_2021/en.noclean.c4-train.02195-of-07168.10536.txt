Summary
Zinc is a nutritionally essential mineral needed for catalytic, structural, and regulatory functions in the body. (More information)
Severe zinc deficiency is a rare, genetic or acquired condition. Dietary zinc deficiency, often called marginal zinc deficiency, is quite common in the developing world, affecting an estimated 2 billion people. (More information)
The RDA for adult men and women is 11 mg/day and 8 mg/day of zinc, respectively. (More information)
Zinc deficiency can cause impaired growth and development in children, pregnancy complications, and immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections. (More information)
Zinc supplementation has been studied as a possible treatment for the common cold, age-related macular degeneration, diabetes mellitus, and HIV/AIDS. (More information)
Zinc bioavailability is relatively high in meat, eggs, and seafood; zinc is less bioavailable from whole grains and legumes due to the inhibitory effects of phytic acid on absorption of the mineral. (More information)
Long-term consumption of zinc in excess of the tolerable upper intake level (40 mg/day for adults) can result in copper deficiency. (More information)
Zinc is an essential trace element for all forms of life. The significance of zinc in human nutrition and public health was recognized relatively recently. Clinical zinc deficiency in humans was first described in 1961, when the consumption of diets with low zinc bioavailability due to high phytic acid content (see Food sources) was associated with "adolescent nutritional dwarfism" in the Middle East (1). Since then, zinc insufficiency has been recognized by a number of experts as an important public health issue, especially in developing countries (2).
Function
Numerous aspects of cellular metabolism are zinc-dependent. Zinc plays important roles in growth and development, the immune response, neurological function, and reproduction. On the cellular level, the function of zinc can be divided into three categories: (1) catalytic, (2) structural, and (3) regulatory (3).
Catalytic role
Over 300 different enzymes depend on zinc for their ability to catalyze vital chemical reactions. Zinc-dependent enzymes can be found in all known classes of enzymes (4).
Structural role
Zinc plays an important role in the structure of proteins and cell membranes. A finger-like structure, known as a zinc finger motif, stabilizes the structure of a number of proteins. For example, copper provides the catalytic activity for the antioxidant enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), while zinc plays a critical structural role (5, 6). The structure and function of cell membranes are also affected by zinc. Loss of zinc from biological membranes increases their susceptibility to oxidative damage and impairs their function (7).
Regulatory role
Zinc finger proteins have been found to regulate gene expression by acting as transcription factors (binding to DNA and influencing the transcription of specific genes). Zinc also plays a role in cell signaling and has been found to influence hormone release and nerve impulse transmission. Zinc has been found to play a role in apoptosis (gene-directed cell death), a critical cellular regulatory process with implications for growth and development, as well as a number of chronic diseases (8).
Nutrient interactions
Copper
Taking large quantities of zinc (50 mg/day or more) over a period of weeks can interfere with copper bioavailability. High intake of zinc induces the intestinal synthesis of a copper-binding protein called metallothionein. Metallothionein traps copper within intestinal cells and prevents its systemic absorption (see the separate article on Copper). More typical intakes of zinc do not affect copper absorption (6), and high copper intake is unlikely to affect zinc absorption unless zinc intakes are already very low (103).
Iron
Supplemental (38-65 mg/day of elemental iron) but not dietary levels of iron may decrease zinc absorption (9). This interaction is of concern in the management of iron supplementation during pregnancy and lactation and has led some experts to recommend zinc supplementation for pregnant and lactating women taking more than 60 mg/day of elemental iron (10, 11).
Calcium
High levels of dietary calcium impair zinc absorption in animals, but it is uncertain whether this occurs in humans. One study showed that increasing the calcium intake of postmenopausal women by 890 mg/day in the form of milk or calcium phosphate (total calcium intake, 1,360 mg/day) reduced zinc absorption and zinc balance in postmenopausal women (12), However, another study found that increasing the calcium intake of adolescent girls by 1,000 mg/day in the form of calcium citrate malate (total calcium intake, 1,667 mg/day) did not affect zinc absorption or balance (13). Calcium in combination with phytic acid or phytate might affect zinc absorption, which would be particularly relevant to individuals who very frequently consume tortillas made with lime (i.e., calcium oxide). A study in 10 healthy women (age range, 21-47 years) found that high intake of dietary calcium (~1,800 mg/day) did not further impair zinc absorption of a high-phytate diet (14). For more information on phytic acid, see Food sources below.
Folate
The bioavailability of dietary folate is increased by the action of a zinc-dependent enzyme, suggesting a possible interaction between zinc and folic acid. In the past, some studies found low zinc intake decreased folate absorption, while other studies found folic acid supplementation impaired zinc utilization in individuals with marginal zinc status (5, 6). However, a more recent study reported that supplementation with a relatively high dose of folic acid (800 μg/day) for 25 days did not alter zinc status in a group of students being fed low-zinc diets (3.5 mg/day); level of zinc intake did not impair folate utilization in this study (15).
Vitamin A
Zinc and vitamin A interact in several ways. Zinc is a component of retinol-binding protein, a protein necessary for transporting vitamin A in the blood. Zinc is also required for the enzyme that converts retinol (vitamin A) to retinal. This latter form of vitamin A is necessary for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a protein in the eye that absorbs light and thus is involved in dark adaptation. Zinc deficiency is associated with decreased release of vitamin A from the liver, which may contribute to symptoms of night blindness that are seen with zinc deficiency (16, 17).
Deficiency
Severe zinc deficiency
Much of what is known about severe zinc deficiency was derived from the study of individuals born with acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder resulting from the impaired uptake and transport of zinc. The symptoms of severe zinc deficiency include the slowing or cessation of growth and development, delayed sexual maturation, characteristic skin rashes, chronic and severe diarrhea, immune system deficiencies, impaired wound healing, diminished appetite, impaired taste sensation, night blindness, swelling and clouding of the corneas, and behavioral disturbances. Before the cause of acrodermatitis enteropathica was known, patients typically died in infancy. Oral zinc therapy results in the complete remission of symptoms, though it must be maintained indefinitely in individuals with the genetic disorder (6, 18). Although dietary zinc deficiency is unlikely to cause severe zinc deficiency in individuals without a genetic disorder, zinc malabsorption or conditions of increased zinc loss, such as severe burns or prolonged diarrhea, may also result in severe zinc deficiency. Severe zinc deficiency has also been reported in individuals undergoing total parenteral nutrition without zinc, in those who abuse alcohol, and in those who are taking certain medications like penicillamine (see Drug interactions below) (19).
Marginal zinc deficiency
It is now recognized that milder zinc deficiency contributes to a number of health problems, especially common in children who live in developing countries. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide are affected by dietary zinc deficiency (20). The lack of a sensitive and specific indicator of marginal zinc deficiency hinders the scientific study of its health implications (21). However, controlled trials of moderate zinc supplementation have demonstrated that marginal zinc deficiency contributes to impaired physical and neuropsychological development and increased susceptibility to life-threatening infections in young children (18). In fact, zinc deficiency has been estimated to cause more than 450,000 deaths in children under the age of 5 annually, comprising 4.4% of global childhood deaths (22). For a more detailed discussion of the relationship of zinc deficiency to health problems, see Disease Prevention.
Individuals at risk of zinc deficiency (6, 19, 23, 24):
Premature and low-birth-weight infants
Older breast-fed infants and toddlers with inadequate intake of zinc-rich complementary foods
Children and adolescents
Pregnant and lactating (breast-feeding) women, especially adolescents
Patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (intravenous feedings)
Malnourished individuals, including those with protein-energy malnutrition and anorexia nervosa
Individuals with severe or persistent diarrhea
Individuals with malabsorption syndromes, including celiac disease and short bowel syndrome
Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
Alcoholics and those with alcoholic liver disease who have increased urinary zinc excretion and low liver zinc levels
Individuals with chronic renal disease
Individuals with sickle cell anemia
Individuals who use medications that decrease intestinal zinc absorption, increases zinc excretion, or impair zinc utilization (see Drug interactions below)
Older adults (65 years and older)
Strict vegetarians: The requirement for dietary zinc may be as much as 50% greater for strict vegetarians whose major food staples are grains and legumes, because high levels of phytic acid in these foods reduce zinc absorption (5) (see Food sources).
Biomarkers of zinc status
Currently, there is not a sensitive and specific biomarker to detect zinc deficiency in humans. Low plasma or serum zinc levels are typically used as a biomarker of zinc status in populations and in intervention studies, but measuring blood concentration of zinc has a number of limitations, including lack of sensitivity to detect marginal zinc deficiency, depression in response to inflammation, and diurnal variation (24, 25).
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
The US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for zinc is listed by gender and age group in Table 1. Infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women are at increased risk of zinc deficiency. Since a sensitive indicator of zinc nutritional status is not readily available, the RDA for zinc is based on a number of different indicators of zinc nutritional status and represents the daily intake likely to prevent deficiency in nearly all individuals in a specific age and gender group (5).

Prevention of Diseases or Conditions Related to Zinc Deficiency
Impaired growth and development
Growth retardation
Significant delays in linear growth and weight gain, known as growth retardation or failure to thrive, are common features of mild zinc deficiency in children. In the 1970s and 1980s, several randomized, placebo-controlled studies of zinc supplementation in young children with significant growth delays were conducted in Denver, Colorado. Modest zinc supplementation (5.7 mg/day) resulted in increased growth rates compared to placebo (26). More recently, a number of larger studies in developing countries observed similar results with modest zinc supplementation. Meta-analyses of growth data from zinc intervention trials have confirmed the widespread occurrence of growth-limiting zinc deficiency in young children, especially in developing countries (27-29). Although the exact mechanism for the growth-limiting effects of zinc deficiency are not known, research indicates that zinc availability affects cell-signaling systems that coordinate the response to the growth-regulating hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (30).
Delayed neurological and behavioral development in young children
Low maternal zinc nutritional status has been associated with diminished attention in newborn infants and poorer motor function at six months of age. Maternal zinc supplementation has been associated with improved motor development in very low-birth-weight infants, more vigorous activity in Indian infants and toddlers, and more functional activity in Guatemalan infants and toddlers (31). Additionally, zinc supplementation in children was associated with better neuropsychological functioning (e.g., attention) in Chinese first grade students, but this was observed only when zinc was provided with other micronutrients (32). Two other studies failed to find an association between zinc supplementation and measures of attention in children diagnosed with growth retardation (33). Although some initial studies suggested that zinc deficiency may depress cognitive development in young children, a 2012 Cochrane review of 13 clinical trials of zinc supplementation in infants and children found no evidence that zinc supplementation improves mental or motor development (34).
Impaired immune system function
Adequate zinc intake is essential in maintaining the integrity of the immune system (35), specifically for normal development and function of cells that mediate both innate (neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells) and adaptive (B-cells and T-cells) immune responses (36, 37). Moreover, zinc plays a structural role in the antioxidant enzyme, CuZnSOD (see above). Zinc deficiency adversely affects a number of immune functions, resulting in decreased production of certain cytokines; reduced activation of zinc-dependent enzymes and transcription factors; and decreased activity of thymulin, a zinc-dependent thymic hormone important for T-cell function (38). Consequently, zinc-deficient individuals are known to experience increased susceptibility to a variety of infectious agents (39).
Increased susceptibility to infectious disease in children
Diarrhea: It is estimated that diarrheal diseases result in the deaths of over 1.8 million children under five years of age in developing countries annually (40). The adverse effects of zinc deficiency on immune system function are likely to increase the susceptibility of children to infectious diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea contributes to zinc deficiency and malnutrition. Research indicates that zinc deficiency may also potentiate the effects of toxins produced by diarrhea-causing bacteria like E. coli (41). Zinc supplementation in combination with oral rehydration therapy has been shown to significantly reduce the duration and severity of acute and persistent childhood diarrhea and to increase survival in a number of randomized controlled trials (42, 43). A 2007 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that zinc supplementation reduces the frequency, severity, and duration of diarrheal episodes in children under five years of age (44). More recent meta-analyses have found beneficial effects of zinc supplementation were limited to children older than 6 (45) or 12 months (28). The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund currently recommend zinc supplementation as part of the treatment for diarrheal diseases in young children (46).
Pneumonia: Zinc supplementation may also reduce the incidence of lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. A pooled analysis of a number of studies in developing countries demonstrated a substantial reduction in the prevalence of pneumonia in children supplemented with zinc (47). Two meta-analyses have found that zinc supplementation reduces the incidence of pneumonia or respiratory tract illnesses in children under five years of age (44, 48). However, it is not clear whether supplemental zinc, in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, is beneficial in the treatment of pneumonia (49, 50).
Malaria: Some studies have indicated that zinc supplementation may reduce the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria in children (33). A placebo-controlled trial in preschool-aged children in Papua New Guinea found that zinc supplementation reduced the frequency of health center attendance due to Plasmodium falciparum malaria by 38% (51). Additionally, the number of malaria episodes accompanied by high blood levels of this malaria-causing parasite was reduced by 68%, suggesting that zinc supplementation may be of benefit in preventing more severe episodes of malaria. However, a six-month trial in more than 700 West African children did not find the frequency or severity of malaria episodes caused by P. falciparum to be different in children supplemented with zinc compared to those given a placebo (52). Additionally, a randomized controlled trial reported that zinc supplementation did not benefit preschool-aged children with acute, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (53). Further, a randomized controlled trial in over 42,000 children aged one to 48 months found that zinc supplementation did not significantly reduce mortality associated with malaria and other infections (54). Due to conflicting reports, it is not yet clear whether zinc supplementation has utility in preventing or treating childhood malaria (28).
Immune response in the elderly
Age-related declines in immune function are similar to those associated with zinc deficiency, and the elderly are vulnerable to mild zinc deficiency (55). However, the results of zinc supplementation trials on immune function in the elderly have been mixed. Certain aspects of immune function in the elderly have been found to improve with zinc supplementation (56). For example, a randomized placebo-controlled study in men and women over 65 years of age found that a zinc supplement of 25 mg/day for three months increased levels of some circulating immune cells (i.e., CD4 T-cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes) compared to placebo (57). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 49 older adults (aged 55-87 years), 35% of which were considered zinc deficient, found that zinc supplementation of 45 mg/day for 12 months reduced the incidence of infection and ex vivo markers of inflammation (TNF-α) and oxidative stress (MDA + HAE, 8-OHdG) (58). However, other studies have reported zinc supplementation does not improve parameters of immune function (56), indicating that more research is required before any recommendations can be made regarding zinc and immune system response in the elderly.
Pregnancy complications
It has been estimated that 82% of pregnant women worldwide are likely to have inadequate zinc intakes. Poor maternal zinc nutritional status has been associated with a number of adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including low birth weight, premature delivery, labor and delivery complications, and congenital anomalies (59). However, results of maternal zinc supplementation trials in the US and developing countries have been mixed (31). Although some studies have found maternal zinc supplementation increases birth weight and decreases the likelihood of premature delivery, two placebo-controlled studies in Peruvian and Bangladeshi women found that zinc supplementation did not affect the incidence of low birth weight or premature delivery (60, 61). Supplementation studies designed to examine the effect of zinc supplementation on labor and delivery complications have also generated mixed results, though few have been conducted in zinc-deficient populations (31). A recent systematic review of 20 randomized controlled trials found that zinc supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a 14% reduction in premature deliveries; the lower incidence of preterm births was observed mainly in low-income women (62). This analysis, however, did not find zinc supplementation to benefit other indicators of maternal or infant health (62).
Disease Treatment
Common cold
Zinc lozenges
The use of zinc lozenges within 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms, and continued every two to three hours while awake until symptoms resolve, has been advocated for reducing the duration of the common cold. At least 10 controlled trials of zinc gluconate lozenges for the treatment of common colds in adults have been published. Five studies found that zinc lozenges reduced the duration of cold symptoms, whereas five studies found no difference between zinc lozenges and placebo lozenges with respect to the duration or severity of cold symptoms. A meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials on the use of zinc gluconate lozenges in colds found that evidence for their effectiveness in reducing the duration of common colds was still lacking (63). Two clinical trials examined the effect of zinc acetate lozenges on cold symptoms. While one of the trials found that zinc acetate lozenges (12.8 mg of zinc per lozenge) taken every 2-3 hours while awake reduced the duration of overall cold symptoms (4.5 vs. 8.1 days) compared to placebo (64), the other study found that zinc acetate lozenges were no different from placebo in reducing the duration or severity of cold symptoms (65).
Despite numerous well-controlled trials, the efficacy of zinc lozenges in treating common cold symptoms remains questionable. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 trials reported that zinc supplementation in the form of lozenges or syrup shortened the duration of cold symptoms, but there was significant heterogeneity (inconsistent effects across the included studies) for the primary outcomes (66). Moreover, another review found that beneficial effects on cold duration were seen in trials that provided more than 75 mg/day of zinc but not in trials that employed lower doses (67). In trials that used high-dose (>75 mg/day) zinc acetate, a 42% reduction in cold duration was observed (67). Inconsistent findings among trials may in part be due to different amounts of zinc released from various forms used in the lozenges (e.g., zinc acetate, zinc gluconate) (67, 68).
The physiological basis for a beneficial effect of high-dose zinc supplementation on cold symptoms is not well understood. Taking zinc lozenges every two to three hours while awake often results in daily zinc intakes well above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 40 mg/day (see Safety). Short-term use of zinc lozenges (e.g., less than five days) has not resulted in serious side effects. Bad taste and nausea were the most frequent adverse effects in therapeutic trials (66). Use of zinc lozenges for prolonged periods (e.g., 6-8 weeks) is likely to result in copper deficiency. For this reason, some experts have recommended that a person who does not show clear evidence of improvement of cold symptoms after three to five days of zinc lozenge use seek medical evaluation (64).
Intranasal zinc (zinc nasal gels and nasal sprays)
Intranasal zinc preparations, designed to be applied directly to the nasal epithelium (cells lining the nasal passages), are also marketed as over-the-counter cold remedies. While two placebo-controlled trials found that intranasal zinc gluconate modestly shortened the duration of cold symptoms (69, 70), three other placebo-controlled studies found intranasal zinc to be of no benefit (71-73). In the most rigorously controlled of these studies, intranasal zinc gluconate did not affect the severity or duration of cold symptoms in volunteers inoculated with rhinovirus, a common cause of colds (71). Of serious concern are several case reports of individuals experiencing loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) after using intranasal zinc as a cold remedy (74). Since zinc-associated anosmia may be irreversible, intranasal zinc preparations should be avoided.
Age-related macular degeneration
A leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 65 in the US is a degenerative disease of the macula, known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The macula is the portion of the retina in the back of the eye involved with central vision. Zinc is hypothesized to play a role in the development of AMD for several reasons: (1) zinc is found at high concentrations in the part of the retina affected by AMD, (2) retinal zinc content has been shown to decline with age, and (3) the activities of some zinc-dependent retinal enzymes have been shown to decline with age. However, scientific evidence that zinc intake is associated with the development or progression of AMD is limited. Observational studies have not demonstrated clear associations between dietary zinc intake and the incidence of AMD (75-79). A randomized controlled trial provoked interest when it found that 200 mg/day of zinc sulfate (81 mg/day of elemental zinc) over two years reduced the loss of vision in patients with AMD (80). However, a later trial using the same dose and duration found no beneficial effect in patients with a more advanced form of AMD in one eye (81). A large randomized controlled trial of daily supplementation with antioxidants (500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, and 15 mg of β-carotene) and high-dose zinc (80 mg of zinc and 2 mg of copper), the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), found that the antioxidant combination plus high-dose zinc, and high-dose zinc alone, both significantly reduced the risk of advanced macular degeneration compared to placebo in individuals with signs of moderate to severe macular degeneration in at least one eye (82). AREDS2, a five-year trial, recently found that lowering the dose of zinc (25 mg vs. 80 mg) in the formulation had no effect on AMD progression (83). Data from smaller trials have generally not observed a protective effect of vitamin and mineral supplementation on AMD (84, 85). Recently, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 74 AMD patients reported that supplementation with 50 mg/day of zinc monocysteine for six months improved measures of macular function, including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and photorecovery (86). The AREDS formulation containing antioxidants, zinc, and copper (82) is currently the standard of care for AMD patients (87); further randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the effects of single-nutrient zinc supplementation in the treatment of AMD.
Diabetes mellitus
Moderate zinc deficiency may be relatively common in individuals with diabetes mellitus (34). Increased loss of zinc by frequent urination appears to contribute to the marginal zinc nutritional status that has been observed in diabetics (88). Although supplementation with zinc reportedly improves immune function in diabetics, zinc supplementation of 50 mg/day adversely affected control of blood glucose in insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetics in one study (89). In another study, supplementation of type 2 diabetics with 30 mg/day of zinc for six months reduced a non-specific measure of oxidative stress (plasma TBARS) without significantly affecting blood glucose control (90). More recently, a placebo-controlled study in 40 men with type 2 diabetes found that high-dose zinc supplementation (240 mg/day) for three months did not improve measures of oxidative stress or vascular function, but the men in this study had normal zinc levels (91). Presently, the influence of zinc on glucose metabolism requires further study before high-dose zinc supplementation can be advocated for diabetics (6). It seems prudent for diabetic patients to meet the RDA for zinc (see RDA above).
HIV/AIDS
Sufficient zinc is essential in maintaining immune system function, and HIV-infected individuals are particularly susceptible to zinc deficiency. In HIV-infected patients, low serum levels of zinc have been associated with a more advanced stage of the disease and also with increased mortality (92, 93). In one of the few zinc supplementation studies conducted in AIDS patients, 45 mg/day of zinc for one month resulted in a decreased incidence in opportunistic infections compared to placebo (94). A placebo-controlled trial in 231 HIV-positive adults with low plasma levels of zinc (<0.75 mg/l) found that zinc supplementation (15 mg/day for men and 12 mg/day for women) for 18 months reduced the incidence of immunological failure (defined by a CD4+ count <200 cells/mm3) by 76% and the rate of diarrhea by 60% (95).
However, the HIV virus also requires zinc, and excessive zinc intake may stimulate the progression of HIV infection. For example, one observational study of HIV-infected men reported increased dietary zinc intake to be associated with more rapid disease progression; any intake of zinc supplements in this observational study was associated with poorer survival (96). A recent systematic review of six randomized controlled trials, including 1,009 participants, concluded that zinc supplementation was safe and efficacious in reducing opportunistic infections in adults and that more research is needed to evaluate the effects of zinc supplementation in pregnant women and children (97).
Sources
Food sources
Shellfish, beef, and other red meats are rich sources of zinc; nuts and legumes are relatively good plant sources of zinc. Zinc bioavailability (the fraction of zinc retained and used by the body) is relatively high in meat, eggs, and seafood because of the relative absence of compounds that inhibit zinc absorption and the presence of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) that improve zinc absorption. The zinc in whole-grain products and plant proteins is less bioavailable due to their relatively high content of phytic acid, a compound that inhibits zinc absorption (6). The enzymatic action of yeast reduces the level of phytic acid in foods; therefore, leavened whole-grain breads have more bioavailable zinc than unleavened whole-grain breads. National dietary surveys in the US estimate that average dietary zinc intake is 9 mg/day for adult women and 13 mg/day for adult men (5). The zinc content of some relatively zinc-rich foods is listed in milligrams (mg) in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search the USDA food composition database (98).

Supplements
A number of zinc supplements are commercially available, including zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, zinc picolinate, and zinc sulfate. Zinc picolinate has been promoted as a more absorbable form of zinc, but there are few data to support this idea in humans. Limited work in animals suggests that increased intestinal absorption of zinc picolinate may be offset by increased elimination (5).
Safety
Toxicity
Acute toxicity
Isolated outbreaks of acute zinc toxicity have occurred as a result of the consumption of food or beverages contaminated with zinc released from galvanized containers. Signs of acute zinc toxicity are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Single doses of 225 to 450 mg of zinc usually induce vomiting. Milder gastrointestinal distress has been reported at doses of 50 to 150 mg/day of supplemental zinc. Metal fume fever has been reported after the inhalation of zinc oxide fumes. Specifically, profuse sweating, weakness, and rapid breathing may develop within eight hours of zinc oxide inhalation and persist 12-24 hours after exposure is terminated (5, 6).
Adverse effects
The major consequence of long-term consumption of excessive zinc is copper deficiency. Total zinc intakes of 60 mg/day (50 mg supplemental and 10 mg dietary zinc) have been found to result in signs of copper deficiency. Copper deficiency has also been reported following chronic use of excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture creams (>2 tubes per week containing 17-34 mg/g of zinc; 99). In order to prevent copper deficiency, the US Food and Nutrition Board set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults at 40 mg/day, including dietary and supplemental zinc (5; Table 3).
Table 3. Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for Zinc
Age Group
UL (mg/day)
Infants 0-6 months 4
Infants 7-12 months 5
Children 1-3 years 7
Children 4-8 years 12
Children 9-13 years 23
Adolescents 14-18 years 34
Adults 19 years and older 40
Intranasal zinc
Intranasal zinc is known to cause a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) in laboratory animals (100), and there have been several case reports of individuals who developed anosmia after using intranasal zinc gluconate (75). Since zinc-associated anosmia may be irreversible, zinc nasal gels and sprays should be avoided.
Drug interactions
Concomitant administration of zinc supplements and certain medications, including tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics as well as bisphosphonates, may decrease absorption of both zinc and the medication, potentially reducing drug efficacy (101). Taking zinc supplements and these antibiotics at least two hours apart should prevent this interaction (102). Additionally, the therapeutic use of metal-chelating (binding) agents, such as penicillamine (used to treat copper overload in Wilson's disease) and diethylenetriamine pentaacetate or DTPA (used to treat iron overload), has resulted in severe zinc deficiency. Anticonvulsant drugs, especially sodium valproate, may also precipitate zinc deficiency. Prolonged use of diuretics may increase urinary zinc excretion, resulting in increased loss of zinc. Further, the tuberculosis medication, ethambutol, has metal-chelating properties and has been shown to increase zinc loss in rats (6).
Linus Pauling Institute Recommendation
The RDA for zinc (8 mg/day for adult women and 11 mg/day for adult men) appears sufficient to prevent deficiency in most individuals, but the lack of sensitive indicators of zinc nutritional status in humans makes it difficult to determine the level of zinc intake most likely to promote optimum health. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement containing 100% of the daily values (DV) of most nutrients will generally provide 15 mg/day of zinc.
Older adults (>50 years)
Although the requirement for zinc is not known to be higher for older adults, their average zinc intake tends to be considerably less than the RDA. A reduced capacity to absorb zinc, increased likelihood of disease states that alter zinc utilization, and increased use of drugs that increase zinc excretion may all contribute to an increased risk of mild zinc deficiency in older adults. Because the consequences of mild zinc deficiency, such as impaired immune system function, are particularly relevant to the health of older adults, they should pay particular attention to maintaining adequate zinc intake.
