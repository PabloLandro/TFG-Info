Description
What is Minoxidil 2%-10% Topical Solution Tugain¬Æ
Tugain¬Æ 10/5/2 contains minoxidil that is used as a topical treatment for androgenic alopecia in men, or male pattern baldness, to help prevent further hair loss and promote the growth of new hair. Tugain is used to stabilize hair loss in men and induce re-growth of hair in areas where the hair is thinning, but should not be used for frontal baldness or receding hairline. Tugain 10% is most effective where hair loss has just started or is recent and there are smaller areas of hair loss of the vertex. Tugain 10% cannot cure baldness but can prevent the progression of hair loss in the frontal areas of the scalp as well as the vertex area. Tugain 10 is not suitable for use by women with female pattern baldness.
How does Minoxidil 2%-10% Topical Solution Tugain¬Æ work
Tugain solution contains minoxidil, which is a vasodilator (dilates or widens blood vessels) and is thought to directly stimulate hair follicles to grow by increasing blood flow in the scalp and enhancing cell proliferation in hair follicles that were in resting phase. Another possible mechanism is that minoxidil in Tugain prolongs the active growth phase of hair (anagen) and increases the size of the hair follicle, which prevents hair growth entering the resting phase (telogen) too early. Hair loss is due to shrinking hair follicles that gradually produce smaller and thinner hairs, which eventually do not emerge from the follicle. The longer hair follicles are inactive the harder it is for them to respond and begin new growth.
Side effects of Tugain¬Æ Minoxidil 2%-10% Topical Solution
The most commonly reported side effects when taking Tugain are local irritation at the site of application including redness, dry skin, itching, burning sensation, scalp flaking, and rash. Hair color or texture may be altered with increased hair loss at first, as old hairs make way for new hairs, also contact of Tugain 10 with other areas such as the forehead may cause hypertrichosis or unwanted hair growth.
