Minoxidil 5
Written by Rylee Newton
Many people turn to Minoxidil 5 for hair loss treatment and prevention. This medication is available in many different locations, often without a prescription. You can get Minoxidil shampoo from your doctor, or you can shop online for Minoxidil shampoo or topical gel if you want to find the lowest price around. Cost is an important consideration when you consider most hair loss prevention programs require a long-term commitment.
When it comes to thinning hair many people look for a miracle cure. Unfortunately there is no known cure for alopecia or male pattern baldness. You can find a number of different products, including Minoxidil 5 that can significantly reduce the rate of hair loss in men. Thinning hair in men is inherited, which means different products work differently for everyone.
Results From Minoxidil 5
Minoxidil 5 should be applied twice a day if you want to see results. Many men saw results from this product in as little as two months. If you are taking Minoxidil to cure thinning hair, it's important to be consistent in your administration of the product. It's always a good idea to check with your doctor to see if he or she thinks this is a good treatment for your particular case.
Many doctors and pharmacists suggest you discontinue the use of this product if you don't see results within four months of use. While this product doesn't work for everyone, many people have seen an increase in hair growth when they use Minoxidil. According to one of the manufacturers of Minoxidil, if you stop using this product you can expect the hair loss process to begin again.
