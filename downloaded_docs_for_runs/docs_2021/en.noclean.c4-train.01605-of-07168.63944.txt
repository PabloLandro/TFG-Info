Product Description
100% Natural & Organic Vitamin E Oil
We all want skin that glows with health and vitality and we all want to make the healthiest choices possible — no matter our age or skin type. Your 100% Natural & Organic Vitamin E Oil makes it possible.
In fact, your 100% Natural & Organic Vitamin E Oil (d-alpha tocopherol) contains twice the vitamin power as the synthetic version which means it’s twice as powerful and works twice as fast finally giving you the skincare results you’ve been looking for AND in record time!
Vitamin E truly is a skin-overhauling powerhouse and the primary ingredient in your oil. Imagine that — skincare that makes you look good and is actually good for you.
Do You Consider Yourself a Healthy Person?
What’s more, the benefits of Vitamin E go way beyond skin deep! Research suggests that Vitamin E also helps your immune system and keeps blood vessels healthy.
What’s not to love!?
What Vitamin E Oil will do for you...
Healthy skin is beautiful skin and 100% Natural & Organic Vitamin E Oil really packs a punch. Here are just a few of the benefits Vitamin E oil delivers:
Prevents aging
Reduces wrinkles & fine lines
Lightens dark spots and under-eye circles
Naturally hydrates and heals damaged skin while preventing future damage
Repairs stretch marks and acne/surgical scars
Promotes collagen & elastin to keep skin looking young
Your Vitamin E Oil is especially unique because it’s made with 100% Natural Vitamin E Oil and infused with additional healing and calming oils like organic jojoba, organic avocado, organic rice bran, organic palmarosa and organic lavender.
It’s non-sticky, soybean, alcohol and paraben free, and it’s aromatherapeutic (in your choice of scented or unscented).
Why choose Health Priority Natural Products?
‘Natural’ beauty products are a dime a dozen but their health claims easily go up in smoke. Not Health Priority Natural Products. Your proprietary, 100% Natural & Organic oil blend contains no cheap fillers or carriers and provides your body with holistic health benefits each time you apply.
In other words, we help you slather your way to better overall health - from the blood vessels up!
Plus, you can apply with confidence because every Health Priority Natural Product is made with the freshest, most natural ingredients available and always:
Organic
Non genetically or synthetically modified
Cruelty free
Carefully crafted in small batches by hand – direct from sunny San Diego
We like to refer to our products as “healthy skincare on a mission” because we have three simple goals:
Do no harm. Not only do our products help you look your best, they’re actually good for you. Plus, you’ll have the peace of mind that comes from knowing your skin is free of harmful chemicals or dangerous preservatives.
Give back. Our passion extends well beyond wellness. That’s why a portion of every purchase goes to Pencils of Promise – a non-profit organization building quality schools in developing countries.
Empower women. We also support micro-funding organizations (like Kiva) that provide small business loans to women around the world. Your purchase will help to break the cycle of poverty – and we think that’s truly beautiful!
Put your oil to good use - The simple skincare plan for healthy skin
Twice a day, simply wash with our 100% Natural Vitamin E Facial Cleanser and then use your toner as usual.
Follow with your 100% Natural & Organic Vitamin E Oil.
Next use our Natural & Organic Vitamin E Eye Cream to smooth fine lines & reduce puffiness.
Don't forget our Natural & Organic Vitamin E Moisturizer with SPF30 or our no SPF Vitamin E Moisturizer.
Be sure to use our 100% Natural Vitamin E Exfoliating Scrub 2–3 times per week for best results.
You’ll love the luxurious, non-sticky formula and you should notice visible results within 30 days.

4.0 out of 5 starsGood stuff, 100% real E oil and other essential oils
January 1, 2016
Size: 1 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: ScentedVerified Purchase
Have been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a difference in under eye darkness. I'm a guy so I'm not used to doing face stuff 2 times a day like the label recommends, I'm sure if I did I'd have better results. The only reasons for only 4 stars is 1. This stuff is expensive 2. I haven't used it long enough to warrant 5 stars and because of the price I can't justify $40 for a small bottle of oil yet. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again because they company has contacted me via email 3 times now checking up on my use of it. I was very reluctant to buy this, but after buying other $5-$10 bottles at stores and researching the ingredient and finding out that it is mostly a blend of synthetic vitimin E oil I went with this one because it's legit, real, pure 100% vitimin E and I don't want to put crap on my face that could cause an allergic reaction like the cheap crap does. I would recommend to anyone vs spending $60 on the "it works" stuff, which I probably fine and does work, I just went with this one because it's not just for one thing...I can use on scars, dark under eyes, my wife can use for similar stuff too. So, I'll update to 5 stars after I see some more results. I hope others find my review helpful, if so click the button! Thanks!!

5.0 out of 5 starsLiquid happiness for your skin.
July 21, 2016
Size: 0.5 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: UnscentedVerified Purchase
As a licensed Esthetician, I am always testing product out to find quality brands and formulas. Vitamin E has always been a part of my skin care regimen for hydration and to maintain skin tone evenness as well as assist in the gracing of aging to prevent or minimize fine lines from developing over time. This product took the top spot as my new favorite Vita E. I have been using it for over 1 year now and have not found anything I feel could replace it just yet. The use it two ways:
1. Mix it in the morning (after a fresh washed and toned face) with my moisturizer and SPF. I add 3 drops to the mixture. Anymore and my face looks shiner than I like. Factor in the generally an SPF generally leaves you a bit shinny as it is.
2. At night after washing and toning my skin. I use a dropper full to gently massage into my décolleté (upper chest near collar bone and neck line), my neck and all over my face, in an upward motion. Then I go to sleep and allow the Vita E to rejuvenate and repair my skins damage from the day.
This is liquid happiness for your skin. Please let me know if you have questions. I'd be happy to assist.

5.0 out of 5 starsI'm in love with this product
August 7, 2016
Size: 0.5 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: ScentedVerified Purchase
I'm in love with this product! I add 2 drops to a bit of aloe vera gel and it makes a wonderful moisturizer for both face and body. I've noticed a definite lessening of the fine lines around my eyes, and my skin is left feeling soft and refreshed. Plus a little goes a long way, so even if the bottle is small, it's going to last me a while. I'm very, very pleased! The photos were taken about 6 weeks apart.

5.0 out of 5 starsBEST SOLUTION FOR CYSTIC ACNE
December 23, 2015
Size: 0.5 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: ScentedVerified Purchase
I've been fighting acne for 16 years now (31 years old currently). I have a condition called hashimoto's disorder which causes cystic acne to pop on my face. It's very painful and extremely embarrassing as I thought my acne would disappear when I entered my 20's. I actually had the worst break out in my life a few months ago when I started researching natural ways of decreasing the size of cystic acne. I tried everything to no avail. I always keep my hair on my face to hide the bumps and mainly the scars that the acne has left of the years but when I went to my hairdresser whom pulled my hair back, she told me to try some vitamin E oil on my face. I got on amazon and searched for vitamin E oil and read the reviews. The reviews for this oil seemed to stand out but I was a little hesitant because of the price and the idea that I had already tried so much. I ordered this product, it shipped very fast and I tried it the first night. I woke up in the morning and was amazed at the results. ONE DAY results...absolutely amazing. I've been using the product for a little under a month now and I get less breakouts, they aren't nearly as severe when I do get them, and my scars are improving so much. I'm wearing less and less makeup and even my fiance has noticed the difference in my face. This is the first time I've ever written a review for anything and this was well deserved...thank you Health Priority Natural Products.

November 6, 2018
Size: 1 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: ScentedVerified Purchase
This is the second time I bought this product. I loved it the first time. But this time, not only the packaging is different, the expiration date is Dec 2018 !!! The last one I bought its expiration date is in 2019. The brand 'Healthy Priority" is no longer prominent on the label and you can hardly find it. I wonder if they are not able to keep up the good work. I got this product last month and have been wanting to return it but as some of you may understand how it could be a chore to pack it and find a UPS store to return it. I cannot trust them anymore....

4.0 out of 5 starsthis vitamin E oil works wonderfully, but it is very expensive
February 19, 2018
Size: 0.5 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: ScentedVerified Purchase
this vitamin E oil works wonderfully, but it is very expensive. I started out with 0.5 oz and that didn't last me the whole month. Then i bought the 1 oz bottle, and that last me over 2 months and a half. I apply this to my entire face twice a day everyday religiously. Since this is oil, a very thin layer is more effective because it dries and is absorbed to your skin quicker. Plus u dont want your face to be too oily, it may spread the acne bacteria to other spots on your face. This is super expensive and I will be more than happy to switch brand if I can find something as good but cheaper.

5.0 out of 5 starsLove it!!
March 28, 2017
Size: 0.5 Fl. Oz (1 Count)Color: UnscentedVerified Purchase
Great quality...I normally cannot even use lotion on my face without my pores becoming clogged and it causing me to break out. I had 3 very deeply dry spots on my face that would not heal despite me using lotion (and breaking out with acne on top of the dry spots). They were becoming so bad they almost looked like burns and were painful. I started using the oil on the spots at night and within two weeks they were completely healed. No break outs and no issues. After 3 months of struggling, my oily skin loves it. I don't understand it but I'm happy!!
