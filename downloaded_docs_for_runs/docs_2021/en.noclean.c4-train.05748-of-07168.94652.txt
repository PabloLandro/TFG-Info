Product Description
Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Support For Relief of Achilles Tendonitis
The Bauerfeind AchilloTrain Achilles tendon support is great for helping relieve acute Achilles tendon pain and swelling associated with Achilles tendon disorders from mild strains to partial ruptures. The AchilloTrain support can provide a comfortable solution as it features a breathable knitted fabric that is so comfortable on your skin. The support features a specially designed visco-elastic pad over the Achilles tendon to not only provide support, but it gently massages the region as you move and walk to help increase the bodies healing response by stimulating good blood flow to the region that brings all the powerful healing properties in the blood to the area. This massaging activity also assists in reducing swelling and edema. The AchilloTrain includes a removable heel lift to take pressure off of the Achilles tendon and a second, separate heel lift to ensure leg length equality.
The AchilloTrain is an active support, meaning that it doesn't restrict movement of the joint, but provides compression as support and therapeutic massaging action of the inserts. The AchilloTrain offers active support for the relief of Achilles tendon pain.
The new knitted brace concept provides stretch, breathability and moisture dissipation for effective compression and excellent wearing comfort. The profile of the massaging insert runs alongside the Achilles tendon to produce uniform application of pressure and a local massage effect during movement which improves metabolism locally and reduces edema. This assists proprioception and improves coordination and muscle control.
If you require an Achilles support for chronic Achilles tendonitis, pain or swelling, select the AchilloTrain Pro.
Comes in 5 sizes, 3 colors and left and right sides. See size guide for proper fitting instructions.
