Medications can help relieve arthritis pain and allow arthritis sufferers to become less limited in physical activity. One of the most common over-the-counter medications used to treat arthritis is Tylenol Arthritis. As with all medications, you should be aware of their ingredients before using them. Here are the ingredients in Tylenol Arthritis.
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen is the main ingredient in every Tylenol brand, including Tylenol Arthritis. This ingredient is a fever reducer and pain reliever. According to Drugs.com, acetaminophen inhibits chemical signals related to pain in the brain, but does not reduced swelling associated with arthritis. Therefore, Tylenol may help decrease pain, but will not reduce swelling in an arthritic joint. Use caution in taking the proper dosages of acetaminophen. You cannot take more than 4,000 mg in a day or you may cause severe liver damage. Tylenol Arthritis has 650 mg of acetaminophen in each caplet or gel tab, you can only take one 650 mg tablet every four hours.
Inactive Ingredients
Tylenol Arthritis has a host of inactive ingredients that make up a caplet or gel tab. An inactive ingredient will not have an effect on your symptoms. Instead, these ingredients make the caplet easy to swallow and aid in digestion and absorption of acetaminophen. According to Tylenol.com each caplet has carnauba wax, corn starch, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, powdered cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium starch glycolate, titanium dioxide and triacetin. The inactive ingredients in gel tabs are Butylparaben, castor oil, corn starch, edetate calcium disodium, FD&C Blue #1 aluminum lake, FD&C Blue #2 aluminum lake, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, powdered cellulose, pregelatinized starch, shellac, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide. If you have an allergy to any of these substances, consult your doctor before taking Tylenol Arthritis.
Drug Interactions
The ingredients in Tylenol Arthritis can affect current medications that you are taking. According to Drugs.com, acetaminophen can increase the risk of bleeding when using anticoagulants such as Coumadin. In addition, acetaminophen and isoniazid used together can increase the risk of liver damage. Always check with your doctor before starting any new medication, because it may interfere with medications you may already be taking.
