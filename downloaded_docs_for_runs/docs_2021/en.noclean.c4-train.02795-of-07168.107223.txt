Sinus Congestion (Holistic)
About This Condition
Breathe freely again by clearing blocked passageways and easing sinus pressure. According to research or other evidence, the following self-care steps may be helpful.
Wipe out irritants
Keep your environment free of irritants and allergens that can trigger sinus congestion, such as dust, mold, smoke, chemical fumes, and animal dander
Steam clean with aromatic oils
Use steam inhalation with eucalyptus oil or products containing menthol to reduce nasal stuffiness
Try nasal irrigation
Prepare a warm, salt-water solution in a special ceramic pot known as a "neti lota" pot and pour it through your nose to relieve your sinuses
Uncover food allergies
Work with a knowledgeable practitioner to find out if food allergens may contribute to your sinus congestion
Get a checkup
Visit your doctor to find out if your sinus congestion may be caused by an infection, inhalant allergy, or other treatable medical condition
About
About This Condition
Sinus congestion (also called nasal congestion or rhinitis) involves blockage of one or more of the four pairs of sinus passageways in the skull.
The blockage may result from inflammation and swelling of the nasal tissues, obstruction by one of the small bones of the nose (deviated septum), or from secretion of mucus. It may be acute or chronic. Acute sinus congestion is most often caused by the common cold. Sinus congestion caused by the common cold is not discussed here. Chronic sinus congestion often results from environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke, food allergens, inhaled allergens, or foreign bodies in the nose.
Sinus congestion leads to impaired flow of fluids in the sinuses, which predisposes people to bacterial infections that can cause sinusitis. At least two serious disorders have been associated with chronic nasal congestion: chronic lymphocytic leukemia and HIV.1, 2 For this reason, chronic nasal congestion lasting three months or more should be evaluated by a medical professional.
Symptoms
Sinus congestion typically causes symptoms of pressure, tenderness, or pain in the area above the eyebrows (frontal sinus) and above the upper, side teeth (maxillary sinus). Other symptoms include nasal stuffiness sometimes accompanied by a thick yellow or green discharge, postnasal drip, bad breath, and an irritating dry cough.
Healthy Lifestyle Tips
The most common cause of nasal congestion is allergy to inhalants, such as pollen, molds, dust mites, trees, or animal dander. Exposure to various chemicals in the home or workplace may also contribute to allergic rhinitis. Indoor and outdoor air pollution may also be a factor in susceptible people. Smoking and secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke have been implicated in chronic nasal congestion3 and the prevalence of chronic rhinitis among men has been shown to increase with increasing cigarette consumption.4 People exposed to chlorine, such as lifeguards and swimmers, may also be at risk of developing nasal congestion.5
Careful evaluation by an allergist or other healthcare professional may help identify factors contributing to nasal congestion. Sometimes strict avoidance of the triggering agents (e.g., thoroughly vacuuming house dust or using dust covers on the mattresses) may provide relief. Where complete avoidance of irritants is not possible, desensitization techniques (immunotherapy [allergy shots]) may be helpful.
Nasal irrigation with warm water or saline may be helpful for reducing symptoms of sinus congestion, although steam inhalations appear to be less useful. In a study of people suffering from the common cold, steam inhalation did not improve sinus congestion any better than placebo.6 In a similar controlled study, irrigation of the nasal passages with heated water or saline, decreased nasal secretions, although inhalation of water vapor did not.7
Holistic Options
Acupuncture may be useful for decreasing chronic sinus congestion. In one clinical study, most participants experienced at least temporary relief after acupuncture needles were inserted alongside the nose.8
Eating Right
The right diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life. For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips.
Recommendation
Why
Uncover food allergies
Work with a knowledgeable practitioner to find out if food allergens may contribute to your sinus congestion.
Food allergy appears to play an important role in many cases of rhinitis, which is related to sinus congestion. In a study of children under one year of age with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, 91% had a significant improvement in symptoms while following an allergy-elimination diet. In the experience of one group of doctors, food allergy was the most common cause of chronic rhinitis. Two other researchers have found food allergy to be a contributing factor to allergic rhinitis in 25% and 39% of cases, respectively. Food allergies are best identified by means of an allergy-elimination diet, which should be supervised by a doctor.
Supplements
What Are Star Ratings?
Our proprietary "Star-Rating" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people.
For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being.
3 StarsReliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit.
2 StarsContradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit.
1 StarFor an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support.

Eucalyptus
Refer to label instructions
Eucalyptus oil is often used in a steam inhalation to help clear nasal and sinus congestion.
Caution: Do not use eucalyptus oil internally without supervision by a healthcare professional. As little as 3.5 ml of the oil taken internally has proven fatal.
Eucalyptus oil is often used in a steam inhalation to help clear nasal and sinus congestion. Eucalyptus oil is said to function in a fashion similar to that of menthol by acting on receptors in the nasal mucous membranes, leading to a reduction in the symptoms of nasal stuffiness.
