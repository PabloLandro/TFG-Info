Q: Does vitamin E improve scars?
A: No, it does not improve scars and may cause skin irritation
Our expert: Dr Phillip Artemi

Have your say
What's your experience of scars and skin blemishes?
Conditions of Use
Whether it's acne pock marks, stretch marks after pregnancy, or the legacy of a burn, wound or surgery, few of us like scars on our skin.
And there's no shortage of remedies that claim to make scars smaller, thinner and less noticeable. One of the most popular is vitamin E, which is found in many skin creams. But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?
No, says Dr Phillip Artemi, a Sydney dermatologist and Honorary Secretary of the Australasian College of Dermatologists.
Despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars, he says.
"People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think 'oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' but it's not," Artemi says.
It's just that as your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.
A proven scientific fact
It's true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.
But it doesn't automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form, Artemi says.
In fact, several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases vitamin E caused a common skin irritation, known as contact dermatitis.
Dermatologists now consider it "a proven scientific fact" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Artemi says.
Other treatments
So if vitamin E won't help scars, is there anything that will?
The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also "nonsense", he says.
While initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise.
"People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars," Artemi says.
However, using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring.
Special dressings  known as silicon dressings  are good at trapping moisture, as are silicon gel or gel sheets.
"They've certainly been proven to work well to trap moisture but you could probably achieve the same thing with a good smear of Vaseline or any dressing that prevents air reaching the wound."
Such dressings should only be used on clean wounds where there is low risk of infection and they are most likely to be helpful in the first 12 weeks or so, although it varies between individuals. In some people, they may make no difference while others might need to use them for six months.
After that, the scar naturally fades to its "end point" over about a year. From then on, only treatments available from a dermatologist may be helpful.
"With some scars that are a bit red and purple, we can use lasers to reduce the colour and if the scar is very thick, we can use cortisone injections to soften and flatten it. They're the two treatments we find most effective."
For acne scars, thick lumps may be treated with injections, while a type of laser treatment  known as profractional ablative lasers  can help reduce "pock marks" or holes left in the skin.
Depending on your skin type and the degree of scarring, the laser can bring a 30 to 60 per cent improvement.
And yes, picking and squeezing your pimples, or picking at the scab of a healing wound, can make scars worse.
Problem scars
But some people will have worse than usual scars despite doing all the right things.
Scars are more of an issue for people:
who are Asian or who have dark skin  it's not just their skin colour but other biochemical differences including the fact cells that make collagen are over-reactive.
aged between 10 and 30  especially those who don't have a genetic tendency for skin that heals well.
who have a wound on certain parts of their body eg the upper trunk, around the ear lobes or jaw line, or where movement puts extra tension on the scar.
But whether your scar is at the good or bad end of the scale, the evidence suggests spending your hard-earned cash on vitamin E won't make a jot of difference.
"You're just wasting your money," Artemi says.
Dr Phillip Artemi is a dermatologist in private practice and Honorary Secretary of the Australasian College of Dermatologists. He spoke to Cathy Johnson.
