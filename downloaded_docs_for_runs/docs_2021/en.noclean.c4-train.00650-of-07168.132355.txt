5 Ways That Can Help You Deal With Menstrual Cramps
Posted on December 16, 2017
For a number of females, period cramps are an expected part of getting their menstrual cycle. Few people are can manage to do the daily events despite of the pain, whereas others are required to stay in bed for a day or two until the cramps fade away.
The following is the information on relieving your menstrual pain and stopping them from being as painful in the future.
Use a hot water bottle or heating pad:
When your womb (i.e. a muscle) contracts to release lining, cramps are caused. When heat is functional, muscle pain always feels better, and the uterus is no exception.
Lie down and place a heating pad or a hot water bottle around your stomach.
Taking a warm bath or shower also gives you heat to ease the pain.
Drink herbal tea:
When you drink warm fluid, it can help ease your muscles, and some herbs are known to relieve cramps efficiently. Make a pot of tea with one of the following herbs:
Cramp bark, a potent herb that is known to lower uterine muscle contractions
Raspberry leaf, relaxes the uterus
Get a massage:
Kneading the muscles in your lower back and abdomen can go a long way toward easing the pain of cramps. Have a partner work or use a self-massaging tool on these areas for you. If you are in the mood of splurge, hire a masseuse for professional job.
Get regular exercise:
Females who incorporate regular exercise into their routines have less severe cramps than females who don’t exercise. Think adding exercise to your life in one of the following ways:
Walk or bike to work. Biking or walking can take less time than other modes of transportation and the light exercise it entails add up a lot over time.
Start jogging or swimming a few times a week. Swimming or jogging keep your muscles toned and give your body a strong, healthy foundation that keeps cramps at bay.
Join a team sport. Soccer, basketball softball, and volleyball get you moving many times a week.
Avoid substances that make cramps worse:
You might have noticed that your cramps are more painful during menstruation when you are drink too much of coffee. The reason is caffeine results on the rigorousness and period of muscle cramps, as do salt and alcohol. Avoid consuming the following ingredients, particularly as your period approaches:
Beer, liquor, wine, and other drinks containing alcohol
Coffee, caffeinated tea and soda
Salty food such as canned soups, chips and fast food
Consider having contraception:
For people with serious menstrual cramps and other menstruation-related symptoms, consuming oral contraceptives can help ease the pain. The hormones in the birth control pills results into the uterine lining to thin, ensuing in lesser uterine contractions and less serious cramps. Consider the following options:
Loette contraceptive pills and many other are popular method. A tablet having a particular amount of progesterone, estrogen or both is consumed daily until the cycle ends, when the period arrives.
Injectable birth controls have the same hormones, and are managed in the form of a shot periodically.
IUDs, or Intra-uterine devices, are implemented inside the cervix. The device releases progesterone and estrogen hormones.

What Is The Difference Between Emergency Contraceptive Pill And Abortion Pill?
Posted on November 3, 2017
Often the general public don’t know much about the difference between emergency contraception [EC] and abortion pills and frequently confuse them with each other. The main conceptual difference between the two is the emergency contraception is for “prevention of pregnancy” and meanwhile abortion tablets are for “termination of an already existing pregnancy”. Often the general public don’t know much about the difference between emergency contraception [EC] and abortion pills and frequently confuse them with each other. The main conceptual difference between the two is the emergency contraception is for “prevention of pregnancy” and meanwhile abortion tablets are for “termination of an already existing pregnancy”.
What is medical abortion?
Medical abortion is termination of an early pregnancy [ one that is not matured past the initial 10 weeks of gestation]. It is done by the use of Mifepristone and Misoprostol tablets. Mifepristone taken first, is used with Misoprostol pills which is taken 24-48 hours later. Mifepristone is also called by other names such as brands – Mifeprex or RU-486. In the meantime, Misoprostol also has another brand named Cytolog.
What is Emergency Contraception?
Women use emergency contraception as means of preventing pregnancy. EC are especially useful in case of unexpected and unprotected intercourse, birth control failure or in circumstances of sexual assault. Emergency contraceptive like Plan B pills reduced the risk of pregnancy if taken within 3 days [ 72 hours] of unprotected intercourse.
The difference between abortion pills and emergency contraceptive pills
1. Usage and efficacy
• Abortion Pill – The FDA recommended regimen for medical abortion is to take 1 pill of Mifepristone [ 200 mg] and then take 4 pills of Misoprostol [ 800 mcg total] 24-48 hours later. The Misoprostol pills are put 2×2 in each cheek pouches and then kept to be dissolved for 30 minutes before swallowing the residue left.
Evidence says Mifepristone and Misoprostol combination when used right is 96-98% effective without any complications.
• Emergency Contraceptive Pill – The FDA approved usage of morning after pill, i.e. EC is to take it within three days of unprotected intercourse. The sooner you take the pill the better it is as the efficacy of this pills drop dramatically as time passes. It is the most effective when taken within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse. Man women even buy Plan B online and have it delivered overnight.
2. Mechanism
• Abortion Pill – Mifepristone is an anti-progesterone agent which blocks the necessary hormones needed to support the uterine lining that supports the pregnancy. In the absence of the hormone this uterine lining is broken and the embryo faces detachment. Meanwhile Misoprostol is an ecbolic agent and causes uterine contractions which help the detached embryonic tissues to be ejected through vaginal discharge.
• Emergency Contraceptive pill – Depending upon the time of your cycle when they are taken, the EC pill may delay ovulation, inhibit with the sperm travel through tubes, interfere with the fertilization process to prevent pregnancy.
3. Safety
• Abortion pill – Millions of women worldwide buy abortion pills online and have the pregnancy termination at home. As per statistics, the maternal mortality rate is much higher in childbirth than abortion or miscarriage.
• Emergency Contraceptive pill – There is no evidence based contraindications for EC pills. They do not induce an abortion nor do they effect the developing embryo.
4. Cost
• Abortion pill – The average cost of abortion pills is about $350 to $800, given if you have insurance or not. Therefore, many women get abortion pills online for cheaper deal.
• Emergency Contraceptive pill – The EC pill generally costs $10 to $77 [ per pill], this is why many buy online as Plan B cost is mostly sold at 10 pills at $50, i.e. [$5 per pill] on web pharmacies.

Other Medical Benefits for Birth Control Pills
Posted on October 12, 2017
Everyone is aware that birth control medicines can prevent pregnancy. However, the tablet can have other benefits, as well. Around more than half of the females who buy ovral online (birth control pill) do so for reasons other than preventing pregnancy, according to some studies.
Makes periods more regular:
With the medicine, you will know when you have your period. With traditional contraceptive tablets, you will take 3 weeks of hormone-containing active tablets, followed by one week of inactive pills. You will get your menstrual cycle the week you take the inactive tablets.
With a type called extended-cycle, you take active medicines for a longer amount of time. Nearly all often you will take 3 months of active medicines prior to taking a break. That means you have your menstrual period only 3-4 times a year.
Makes them lighter, too:
Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) affects about 10% of reproductive-age women. If it’s not treated, it can lead to anemia. The tablet lowers your blood loss by thinning the lining of your uterus.
Stops Menstrual Migraines:
60% of females who get migraines relate the timing of them with their period. Consuming extended-cycle birth control medicines stops hormonal ups and downs.
Helps your skin:
Every female make male sex hormones, just in much smaller amounts than men do. Few females, though, make more than others that can result in acne and excessive hair growth. Along with other things, the medicine slows the creation of male hormones. Therefore, a number of females have fewer breakouts and less undesired body or facial hair.
Ease endometriosis:
In this condition, tissue regular inside the womb grows outside of it. It results into painful, heavy periods. Consuming Ovral L contraceptive pill can assist ease the symptoms by thinning out the uterine lining. In the case of extended-cycle pills, blocking your period from taking place every month.
Lowers risks of some cancers:
Females that have taken the pill for 5 years or longer have a 50% reduction in the risk of developing ovarian cancer, which benefit continues even after stopping the medicine.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS):
This condition that is brought on by hormonal imbalance causes irregular menstrual cycle, excess body hair, acne, infertility, and ovarian cysts- every symptom, which can be helped by contraceptive medicines. The ovral tablet lowers testosterone levels and controls when you menstruate.
An analysis of 36 studies found that for each 5 years, which a woman takes contraceptive tablets, her risk of endometrial cancer diminishes by nearly a quarter. The advantage continued even more than 30 years after the females ceased taking the medicines.

Preventing Pregnancy When a Condom Breaks
Posted on June 30, 2017
Although you don’t have a risk of getting pregnant every time you engage in intercourse, you can conceive even after having unprotected intercourse, just one time. Condom splitting can lead to a higher risk of pregnancy as well as contracting sexually transmitted disease. Your risk of conceiving also depends upon what day you are on during your monthly period cycle- with some days being a much higher risk than the rest [like the days when you are in mid-cycle].
Nevertheless, whether you missed your birth control pills or the condom broke [in short had unprotected intercourse], you still have a chance of preventing pregnancy.
Immediate action
Immediately go to a doctor and get prescription for Plan B emergency contraceptive pill. Since time is the essence in preventing unwanted pregnancy, it is necessary that you immediately head out to access medication. It must be noted that pregnancy prevention in the initial 24 hours is the most effective.
Do not douche
Many have this misconception, that douching after unprotected intercourse many stop pregnancy from happening. This is not true. Douching not only has no effect on preventing unwanted pregnancy however is generally advised against by healthcare professionals.
Douching also changes the yeast/ bacterial state of the reproductive tract which results to increased risk of infections.
Taking Plan B
You can even buy Plan B online and have it delivered overnight. It is a hormone based emergency birth control which is available in the US and Canada, but you can order it from anywhere online. It is to be taken within 72 hours, i.e. 3 days of having unprotected intercourse.
The hormones in Plan B pill are called progestin or levonorgestrel. In many countries you do not need a prescription for Plan B, and therefore can access it from a medical provider or from local drugstores. The emergency birth control is not covered by most insurance plans.
Follow the instructions on the pack carefully. Whether you take Plan B or a regular birth control pill like Ovral, there is certain of using them for optimal efficacy in preventing pregnancy.
Take Plan B as instructed. Plan B has two pills. One pill out of the pack is to be taken within 72 hours and the other one is taken 12 hours after taking the first pill. Since both the pills are identical, you need not be concerned over which pill to take first.
The sooner you take Plan B after unprotected intercourse, the more effective it is in preventing pregnancy. If you take Plan B within 24 hours of intercourse, the chances of successful prevention are 95%, however this efficacy rate reduces dramatically once that time limit has passed.
Expect side effects
Like every medication, taking Plan B too may result in some side-effects, such as – nausea, abdominal pain, headache, hot flashes, heavier or lighter menses etc. These side effects are tolerable and can easily be managed by medicines.
Make sure you start doubling up on birth control methods, if one form of contraception doesn’t work.

What Diet Should Be Followed After Taking Abortion Pills?
Posted on March 24, 2017
Abortion drains the body of some essential nutrients. Following an abortion, it is very crucial for a female to take care of her body. This helps her to recover quickly from the abortion procedure. Reading about the MTP kit online suggests that taking care of what she is eating is the best way to maintain her health. It is thus important to follow an appropriate diet plan and daily routine after a woman has undergone a termination of pregnancy. Reduced vitamin and iron levels caused by heavy bleeding can have an adverse effect on the body. To replenish these vital components in your body, it is important to include a sufficient amount of the following in your diet.
Protein:
Protein is a strict necessity in your diet. Pregnancy termination makes the body feeble, that time you need protein in a large amount. So, a protein-rich diet will facilitate you to reach that level of strength rapidly. This nutrient is known to help in the wear and tear of our body. Moreover, many components of the blood are made up of it. So, all that is lost through blood loss or other changes during an abortion, is made-up for by an increased intake of proteins.
They must include cottage cheese, bananas, peas, carrots, almonds, green leafy vegetables, fish, baked beans, avocado, eggs, and such type of protein rich food in your diet. You can also go for protein-rich supplements.
Go for digestible food:
If you eat heavy or oily food after taking abortion pills, then you may face severe stomach ache later on. In order to avoid such type of physical pain, you must go for food that can be digested easily by the body. A woman can include bitter melon, edible radish, oranges, hawthorn, and other such vegetables and fruits. Avoid having oily junk foods, carbonated beverages or other eatables that can cause harm to your body.
Include vitamins and mineral-rich nutritional diet:
You can include these in your daily diet after pregnancy termination procedures in the form of eggs, fish, meat, liver, soybean, tender chicken, dates, lotus seeds, fresh fruits, milk, vegetables, and others. Such nutritional diet will make sure you sustain a strong immune system thus helping you recover faster from the effects of pregnancy termination. Do not add extra spices when you cook the aforementioned food items, because it may cause dietary troubles requiring immediate medical attention. It is hence better to shun spicy food.
Intake of water should be increased:
Following pregnancy termination, the common issues, which are faced by most of the women resulting in loss of water from the body, are sweating and diarrhea. These issues can lead to dehydration; thus, it is really vital to increase your intake of water to at least 8-12 glasses daily. This habit will ensure that you are not going to be a victim of dehydration and constipation as well.
Non-vegetarian foods:
Non-vegetarian food in your diet can also act as a great protein supplement. You can have beef, chicken, tuna, fish, shellfish, peas, cooked dry beans, and other. These foods are very high in protein and will aid your recovery greatly.
Low-fat products:
As mentioned above, foods which are difficult to digest will have an adverse effect on your body, thus going for low diet will assist you to heal faster and in a better way. You must only include low-fat varieties when it comes to dairy products like low-fat milk. This will supply your daily requirement of proteins, vitamins, and calcium. The everyday intake of low-fat dairy products will keep you strong and healthy.
Although following a healthy diet is important, there are also other precautions that need to be taken. This includes avoiding sexual intercourse until complete recovery, refraining from the use of swimming pools or bathtubs and giving a halt to heavy workout sessions.
Also, be informed that the female hormones are set back to their normal states soon after a complete abortion procedure. Along with keeping away from intercourse use birth control like the Loette contraceptive pill. These pills stabilize the hormonal levels in the body to prevent ovulation. Online birth control pills are available in packages with the exact number of pills to be taken in a single regimen and can be very helpful in preventing another unwanted pregnancy.
