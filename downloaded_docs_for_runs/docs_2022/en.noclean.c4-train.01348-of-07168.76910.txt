4 Simple Ways to Avoid Falling for Cancer Hoaxes
Published by CTOAM on April 9, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Recently, Donald Trump, President of the United States, suggested that the noise from windmills causes cancer. Here at CTOAM, we believe in giving you all the information you need to make educated choices about cancer prevention and cancer care. So here are some simple tips to help you separate fact from fiction! 1. Think Critically When you come across a claim about cancer, the first thing to do is to think critically about it. This means using your common sense and rational brain to figure out if it seems reasonable or not. For starters, just ask some basic questions about the claim and the person (or organization) behind it. For example, when President Trump flippantly mentions that windmill noise causes cancer, you might want to...

Eat to Beat Cancer with Nutraceuticals
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many cancers are profoundly impacted by diet and lifestyle behaviours. For some cancers, preventative actions – like a nutraceutical diet or targeted exercise program – have been shown to reduce the chance of cancer developing by 80%+. What Are Nutraceuticals? Nutraceuticals are parts of foods or supplements that have a proven role in regulating the genes and processes involved in cancer. Each week, new studies emerge that demonstrate the positive impact of nutraceuticals in cancer treatment and prevention. At CTOAM, we have seen remarkable results in our clients after just one week on a nutraceutical diet. But don’t just take our word for it – convince yourself by reading the many peer-reviewed scientific journals, studies, and research-based articles on this subject, and see for yourself. Science-Based Nutrition...

Did You Inherit Cancer Causing Gene Mutations?
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many of us have had a blood relative with cancer. If you inherited certain causing genetic mutations, it can increase your chances of developing cancer as well. Two Types of Inherited Mutations There are two types of inherited mutations that could affect you for cancer. 1. Germline Inherited: These are inherited through the family germline, affecting many generations. They’re relatively rare, connected with causing 10 -15% of cancers. 2. Somatic Inherited: In contrast, the other type of inherited mutation is only present in that person – and not their family. So, with this kind, there is no previous family history of cancer. Most cancers are caused by this type of inheritance. Inherited Mutations with NO Family History This type of inherited mutation occurs when the...

Supposed “Cure” for Cancer is Unlikely – But Precision Oncology Brings Hope
Published by CTOAM on February 1, 2019 1 Comment
A news story broke the other day, claiming that a team of Israeli scientists had found a complete cure for cancer that would be available within a year. Sounds incredible, right? There’s only one problem: anytime you see something that claims to be a cure for cancer, you should always approach it with skepticism. The idea of a ‘complete cure for cancer’ is fundamentally problematic when you understand what cancer actually is. Science Based Medicine explains: “Cancer is not one disease, but a category including many related diseases. Different cancers involve different tissues, different mutations, and different behaviors and features. While some treatments are effective against a variety of cancers, there is no one treatment effective against all cancers (let alone a cure for all...

What NOT to Say to a Cancer Patient | Newsletter Issue 9
Published by CTOAM on December 17, 2018 | Share your thoughts
You can either love or dread spending time with your family over the holidays, but one thing is certain: if someone in your family has cancer, other people may struggle with what to say or how to handle their own emotions in the situation. Susan Silk is a clinical psychologist who developed something called the Ring Theory – a simple template for how to act around people in a crisis situation. Her Ring Theory can help cancer patients and caregivers have a better understanding of how to navigate their emotional needs. This can come in particularly handy at Christmas! → Feel More Supported with These Resources Check out Issue 9 of the CTOAM newsletter to learn about how the Ring Theory can help you and your loved ones.

What is the Ring Theory for Cancer Patients?
Published by CTOAM on December 16, 2018 | Share your thoughts
How to Support a Loved One with Cancer The inspiration for the Ring Theory began when psychologist Susan Silk had breast cancer. She underwent surgery for it, and during her recovery in the hospital, Susan found that she didn’t feel like having visitors. This is a common feeling for many cancer patients – they’re exhausted by treatment or the emotional toll, and simply don’t have energy to give to others. But Susan quickly learned that her friends didn’t necessarily understand this. When she tried explaining to a colleague, who had come to visit, that she just wasn’t in the mood, it didn’t go well: her colleague responded to Susan by saying, “This isn’t about you!” Meaning that, Susan’s needs were a lower priority that those...

How to Prevent Cancer by Starving It | Anti-Angiogenic Foods for Cancer
Published by CTOAM on November 28, 2018 1 Comment
Eating more anti-angiogenic foods for cancer is an excellent way to help prevent cancer, as well as enhance your cancer treatment and prevention of recurrence. In his fascinating TED Talk, Dr. William Li explains how we can use certain foods to starve cancer cells from ever growing into something harmful. How Angiogenesis Affects Cancer Let’s first get a few things clear about cancer and angiogenesis. Most cancers are preventable. As many as 95% of cancers are related to lifestyle and environment. Your habits (such as smoking), diet (red meat and processed meats, especially), alcohol, and environment (pollution and exposure to carcinogenic chemicals) all affect your risk of cancer. Many cancers are caused by diet. Around 30-35% of cancers are caused by lifestyle and environment. Eating certain...
