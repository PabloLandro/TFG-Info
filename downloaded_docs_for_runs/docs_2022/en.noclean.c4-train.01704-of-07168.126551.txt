Pay Close Attention to Product Ingredients
You may not be aware of it, but there are many bleaching products in the market that contain ingredients with potentially harmful side effects.
One such ingredient is Hydroquinone which has been found to cause painful skin irritation, redness, appearance of rashes, dryness and cracking. The FDA has labeled Hydroquinone as carcinogenic, mutagenic, clastogenic and immunotoxic.
All you need to know is that those terms sound like bad news for your skin and overall health! As much as possible products that contain Hydroquinone should be avoided. It has already been banned in Japan, Europe and Australia.
Other ingredients you should watch out for include:
• Mercury
• Parabens
• Steroids
Always make sure products fully disclose ingredients on their label. It would be wise to avoid products that do not include a label. Natural alternatives are available and we would encourage you to use these instead.

What is anal bleaching?
It is a procedure where bleaching cream is applied in and around the anal area to remove blemishes, dark discolorations and create a more even skin tone.
People who sought this type of treatment were not aware that bleaching could have painful consequences particularly if it included the ingredient Hydroquinone.
Safer options
A safer option would be the use of intimate area whitening creams that are specifically formulated for this purpose. These days, manufacturers use natural ingredients to produce these creams which do not result in discomfort and unwanted side effects.
The best products are those that can be safely used in the most intimate areas of the body and not just the anus.
