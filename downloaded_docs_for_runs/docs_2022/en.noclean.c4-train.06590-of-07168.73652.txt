If you have decided to lose weight, you may have used several common methods already, such as working out often, eating the right foods, going on a certain type of diet, taking weight loss supplements, and even undergoing surgery. However, a new popular method that people are and have been using for weight loss is drinking certain liquids, namely water green tea, black coffee, vegetable juice, lemonade, and berry juice. Combining these drinks with a balanced, healthy, and nutritious diet has been proven to lead to quick weight loss. Certain liquids can help with weight loss by increasing your metabolism, cleansing your digestive tract and ridding your body of toxins that contribute to weight gain, and cutting down on cravings for unhealthy foods. By replacing high sugar drinks such as energy drinks and soft drinks with these healthy and wholesome alternatives, you can lose weight quickly and keep it off better.

In this article, we will list the top five drinks that will not only help you lose weight, but will detox your body as well.
1. Water
Water is at the top of the list for many reasons. It has been the single best choice for effective weight for decades, and is good for your overall health. Whether it is sparkling water or still water, this should be your first choice for weight loss. There are several reasons why drinking water for weight loss is important; when you lose a lot of weight, your body may quickly become dehydrated. You will need to drink an adequate amount of water, as being dehydrated can slow down the fat burning process. In order to burn calories, the body needs enough water to be able to function properly. The fat burning process will also produce toxins that the water will flush out of your system. As far as exercise, water helps the muscles contract, which assists in maintaining good muscle tone. Water also rises your muscle stamina by increasing your blood volume and your oxygen supply.
Make sure you have water with every meal; the water will fill you up quickly and reduce the chance of constipation. The amount of water you need depends on your activity level, weight, and your environment’s temperature and humidity. If you already consume plenty of water rich foods such as fruits and vegetable, you can reduce your water intake. Don’t drink too much water as this can cause your body to dilute your sodium and potassium electrolytes and cause damage to your heart, brain, and muscle function.
2. Green Tea
Green tea has been used for centuries to keep people awake, but there are also weight loss benefits in green tea as well. Green tea is full of antioxidants and studies have proven that green tea helps speed up your metabolism and control your weight. The main compound in green tea is epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG, a powerful antioxidant that helps causes weight loss, fight heart disease and prevent cancer. Green also contains a large amount of polyphenols that are known as catechins. Catechins will trigger weight loss by stimulating your body to decrease body fat and burn calories, and they also have antiviral, anti inflammatory and anticancer properties. The amount of catechin content in the green tea depends on the steeping time and amount of green tea used. It is usually recommended that you drink at least four cups of green tea a day for weight loss benefits.
3. Black Coffee
A cup of coffee in the morning can help jump start your weight loss by giving you a boost of caffeine, which will suppress your hunger. Black coffee has also been proven to stimulate thermogenesis, a process that heats your body and increases metabolism. However, make sure you avoid adding sugars, creamers, or whole milk to your coffee; use skim milk instead. Adding ingredients such as creamers can reverse the effect of the coffee and actually cause you to gain weight.
Black coffee contains stimulants that are known to mobilize fat tissue and increase metabolism. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant and will send signals to the fat cells to tell them to break down the fat. It also has an appetite reducing effect. Black coffee is great for initial weight loss, but as your body gets used to the effects it will eventually stop working.
4. Vegetable Juice
Vegetable juice is a quick and excellent way to get the important nutrients and fiber that your body needs for weight loss. You can use vegetable juice in your favorite meal or you can drink it straight. The vegetable juice will keep you fuller for a longer period of time, and is the perfect way to get all of your vegetable servings in a day. Try to find a low sodium variety.
5. Berry Juice
Much like vegetable juice, berry juice is a great way to consume fruit. Berries are very rich in antioxidants and can aid in weight loss by increasing fiber, removing toxins from your body, and lowering your cravings for sugar. Berry juice acts as a detox above all, and is a perfect way to start your weight loss plan.
