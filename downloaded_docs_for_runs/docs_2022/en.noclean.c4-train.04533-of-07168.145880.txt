Report: Mobile Phones Don't Cause Cancer
by Bryan M. Wolfe
October 21, 2011
In recent years, reports have surfaced that claim long-term use of cell phones could cause cancer. Now, a new study led by the Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Denmark refutes that opinion, according to the BBC. In total, 358,403 people with cell phones were studied over an 18-year period. Of those, 356 developed brain cancer, while another 846 acquired cancers of the central nervous system. These numbers, however, were in line with similar incidence rates among those without cell phones. In other words, the report concluded that cell phones didn't cause cancer. According to Professor Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics at Royal Berkshire hospital:
"The findings clearly reveal that there is no additional overall risk of developing a cancer in the brain although there does seem to be some minor, and not statistically significant, variations in the type of cancer."
Despite the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) still warns that mobile phone use “could still be carcinogenic.” As such they put cell phones in the same category as coffee, “meaning a link (to developing cancer) could not be ruled out but could not be proved either.” What do you think?
