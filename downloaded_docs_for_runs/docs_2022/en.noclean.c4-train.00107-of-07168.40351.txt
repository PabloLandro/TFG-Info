What is Grapefruit?
Grapefruit is a citrus fruit. People use the fruit, oil from the peel, and extracts from the seed as medicine. Grapefruit seed extract is processed from grapefruit seeds and pulp obtained as a byproduct from grapefruit juice production. Vegetable glycerin is added to the final product to reduce acidity and bitterness.
Grapefruit juice is used for asthma, high cholesterol, "hardening of the arteries" (atherosclerosis), cancer, improving levels of red blood cells, a skin disease called psoriasis, and for weight loss and obesity. It is also used to reduce stomach complaints in people with eczema (atopic dermatitis).
Grapefruit seed extract is taken by mouth for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections including yeast infections.
Grapefruit oil is applied to the skin for tired muscles, hair growth, toning the skin, and for acne and oily skin. It is also used for the common cold, flu (influenza), and swine flu.
Grapefruit seed extract is applied to the skin as a facial cleanser, first-aid treatment, remedy for mild skin irritations, and as a vaginal douche for vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis). It is also used as an ear or nasal rinse for preventing and treating infections; as a gargle for sore throats; in a shampoo to treat lice; as a dental rinse for preventing gingivitis and promoting healthy gums; and as a breath freshener.
Some people inhale grapefruit vapors to help the body retain water, for headache, stress, and depression. Grapefruit seed extract vapor has also been inhaled for the treatment of lung infections.
In food and beverages, grapefruit is consumed as a fruit, juice, and is used as a flavoring component.
In manufacturing, grapefruit oil and seed extract are used as a fragrance component in soaps and cosmetics; and as a household cleaner for fruits, vegetables, meats, kitchen surfaces, dishes, and others.
In agriculture, grapefruit seed extract is used to kill bacteria and fungus, fight mold growth, kill parasites in animal feeds, preserve food and disinfect water.
It's important to remember that drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented. The chemistry of the grapefruit varies by the species, the growing conditions, and the process used to extract the juice. Before adding grapefruit to your diet or your list of natural medicines, check with your healthcare provider if you take medications.
Insufficient Evidence to Rate Effectiveness for...
Asthma. Some research shows that eating vitamin C-rich citrus fruits, including grapefruit and others, might improve lung function in people with asthma. But other studies have not shown this benefit.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research shows that a grapefruit seed extract (ParaMicrocidin, Allergy Research Group) can decrease constipation, gas, and stomach discomfort in people with eczema. This benefit may be due to the effect of grapefruit on intestinal bacteria.
High cholesterol. Early research suggest that taking grapefruit pectin daily for 16 weeks decreases total cholesterol and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad") cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL or "good") cholesterol compared to baseline.
High blood fats called triglycerides. Eating one grapefruit per day appears to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in people with high triglyceride levels.
Lice. Early research shows that applying a shampoo containing grapefruit extract (Licatack shampoo) to the hair of children for 10-20 minutes kills lice. Applying the shampoo again 10 days later helps remove any remaining nits (91417).
Weight loss. Early research suggests that eating fresh grapefruit daily increases weight loss in overweight people.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).
Preventing cancer.
Psoriasis.
Muscle tiredness.
Promoting hair growth.
Toning the skin.
Reducing acne and oily skin.
Treating headaches.
Stress.
Depression.
Infections.
Digestive complaints in people with eczema.
Yeast infections (as a vaginal douche).
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of grapefruit for these uses.
How does Grapefruit work?
Grapefruit is a source of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, pectin, and other nutrients. Some components might have antioxidant effects that might help protect cells from damage or reduce cholesterol.
It is not clear how the oil might work for medicinal uses.
Are there safety concerns?
Grapefruit is LIKELY SAFE in the amounts normally used as food and POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for medicinal purposes.
Grapefruit is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in high amounts. If you take any medications, check with your healthcare provider before adding grapefruit to your diet or using it as a medicine. Grapefruit interacts with a long list of medications (see "Are there any interactions with medications?" below).
Special Precautions & Warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of grapefruit during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Breast cancer: There is concern about the safety of drinking excessive amounts of grapefruit juice. Some research suggests that postmenopausal women who consume a quart or more of grapefruit juice every day have a 25% to 30% increased chance of developing breast cancer. Grapefruit juice decreases how estrogen is broken down in the body and might increase estrogen levels in the body. More research is needed to confirm these findings. Until more is known, avoid drinking excessive amounts of grapefruit juice, especially if you have breast cancer or are at higher than usual risk for developing breast cancer.
Diseases of the heart muscle: Consuming grapefruit juice might increase the potential for abnormal heart rhythm. People with these diseases should consume grapefruit juice in moderation.
Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions: Consuming large amounts of grapefruit might increase hormone levels and therefore increase the risk of hormone sensitive conditions. Women with hormone sensitive conditions should avoid grapefruit.
