Are Cell Phones and WiFi Signals Toxic, Particularly to Children?

Earlier this year, GOOP, “a weekly lifestyle publication, curated by Gwyneth Paltrow,” published a blog, “Are Cell Phones and WiFi Signals Toxic?” The blog explores the staggering health detriments that can result from the significantly increased smartphone and WiFi exposure our world has experienced in recent years. With the accounts of three leading experts in the scientific community, GOOP reveals to its readers that not only are cell phone and WiFi signals harmful to adults, they are ever more harmful to children and their development.
The human body is electrified; a necessity to send out sensory messages throughout the body and ultimately keeps your heart pumping and brain and body functioning. However, body electricity is completely different from the electromagnetic frequencies we expose ourselves to daily and this is where the problems begin. Consistent “low level emissions” from cell phones and WiFi effect the blood brain barrier and can contribute to developing malignant brain tumours and other forms of cancer in the body. This risk is significantly heightened the earlier an individual is exposed to high levels of wireless radiation – i.e. our children.
The fact of the matter is that children are exposed to the toxicity from smartphones and WiFi nearly everywhere they go. It’s become the norm for children to have their own smartphones, tablets and other gadgets in school, after school, and weekend fun, but this wireless exposure is not limited to set usage times. These days, most classrooms are equipped with WiFi that emits at high levels from large routers often in the classrooms directly above the students heads. These commercial routers emit wireless radiation all day, every day, so even when they’re not on their smartphones or tablets, children are being exposed. This type of exposure is termed as involuntary. Schools boards cross Canada point to Health Canada and the flawed Safety Code 6.

The best steps to take to reduce voluntary wireless exposure at home is to take the time to assess what you can change. Try to replace anything wireless in your home (computer mouse, keyboard, etc.) with wired ones. Make a conscious effort to turn off the WiFi on your wireless devices by setting them to airplane mode when not in use or turning them off completely. You can also show your children how to do this with their own devices and ask they do so every time they’re finished using their gadgets. By making a conscious effort to remove or turn your WiFi off around your home when not in use and demonstrating to your children to avoid wireless exposure as much as possible, you can significantly reduce the effects of cell phone and wireless toxicity.

Canadians for Safe Technology is committed to educating Canadians and their policy makers about the dangers of the exposures to unsafe levels of radiation from technology, and to build healthier communities together.
