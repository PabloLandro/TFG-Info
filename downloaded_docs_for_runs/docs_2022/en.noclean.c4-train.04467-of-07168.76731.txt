Tangy Citrusy Non-Grapefruit Juice
Grapefruit is a super-healthy food… but it has a bit of a dark side.
It can interfere with the metabolism of medications!
This interaction happens with dozens of medications and, unfortunately, can lead to unwanted side effects.
If you’re not taking any medications, then you don’t have to worry. But if you are, it may be prudent to hold off on the grapefruit until you double-check with your doctor or pharmacist if your medication is one of the affected ones.
If you love grapefruit juice, you’re going to love my latest recipe. It’s a tangy and citrus-y juice, without the grapefruit.
Recipe
Serves 2
2 cups pineapple, peeled & chopped
1 cup cucumber, washed & chopped
1 lemon, peeled
Instructions
Juice pineapple, cucumber and lemon.
Serve over ice & enjoy!
Tip: Top with fresh mint leaves.
