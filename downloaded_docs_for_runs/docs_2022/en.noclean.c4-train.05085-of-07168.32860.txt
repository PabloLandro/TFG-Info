If you feel weak and sick to your stomach, chills or flu, drink ginger tea. It is also one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of seasickness.
Spicy, gnarled root is often used in the kitchen, but also as a medicine. 500 years is used as a seasoning for various dishes and is famous for the fact that it can reduce nausea, cramps and other digestive disorders.
If you feel weak and sick to my stomach, chills or flu, drink ginger tea. It is also one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of seasickness.
Chemical compounds that give ginger spicy flavor reduce stomach cramps, neutralize digestive acids and inhibit the “vomiting center” in the brain. Doctors often recommend it for the treatment of nausea because it does not cause drowsiness like most anti-nausea medication. In some cases, it is used even in people who have nausea caused by chemotherapy.
If you have problems with nausea while driving or sailing, take ginger before departure, because it will help prevent the onset of nausea. Half an hour before the time, eat a piece of fresh ginger or take it in the form of pills or powder, and then you can stay on the road without the fear that you will have problems with nausea and vomiting.
Ginger can also reduce the symptoms of migraine headaches, relieve pain of arthritis, reduce blood clots, reduce cholesterol, relieve menstrual cramps and reduce cold symptoms.
