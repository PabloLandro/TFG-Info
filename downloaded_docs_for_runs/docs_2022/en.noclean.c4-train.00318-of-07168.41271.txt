Health Benefits
Collagen is responsible for your skin’s elasticity. A high abundance of collagen is why young skin remains taut and smooth. However, as we age collagen production becomes disrupted and your skin loses some of its natural elasticity and firmness. This may result in wrinkles and fine lines. Caruso’s Super Collagen Builder supports the production of collagen in your body and helps improve the health of your hair, skin and nails. This delicious tasting formula contains a number of active ingredients including Astaxanthin, Silicon, Vitamin C, Biotin and French Marine Pine Bark. Together, these ingredients support your hair, skin and nails, helping to maintain their health and appearance.
Caruso’s Super Collagen Builder is indicated for:
• Enhancing collagen and elastin production
• Improving skin elasticity
• Stronger, healthier hair
• Thicker, stronger nails
Who would use Caruso’s Super Collagen Builder:
• Those wishing to improve hair, skin and nail health
• Those who want to improve the strength and appearance of their skin
• Those who have brittle, weak and splitting nails
