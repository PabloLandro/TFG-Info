In brief: Fish oil for brain
The omega 3 fatty acids must be from fish rather than from plant source in order to benefit brain health.
Take ~1200mg epa/day + ~1000mg dha /day must be taken with food or drink that has fat in it, in order to absorb the fish oil....Otherwise you will be flushing your omega3 fish oil down the toilet without having absorbed it.
