Brain Cancer & Cell Phones
Ethics compelled us to ensure that all reasonable people have access to the basic scientific facts. Your cell phone is a microwave transmitter and it should bear a cancer warning! Microwave energy oscillates at millions to billions of cycles per second. The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry reports that these frequencies cause cancer and other diseases by interfering with cellular DNA and its repair mechanisms. Brain cancer and cell phone risk is real. Microwave promotes rapid cell aging. Italian scientists have recently demonstrated that cell phone radiation makes cancerous cells grow aggressively. Cordless phones marked 900 megahertz or 2.4 gigahertz emit the same dangerous microwave radiation as cell phones.

This is a major wake-up call to those addicted to their mobile phones, a few years from now, you might be dying from cancer thanks to your mobile.
