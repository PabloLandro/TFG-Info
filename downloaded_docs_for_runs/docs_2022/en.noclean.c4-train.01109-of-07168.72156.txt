(NaturalNews) The results of the decade-long Interphone study on cell phone safety are that heavy cell phone use increases the risk of developing brain tumors later in life. The study, which focused on three types of brain cancer and tumors of the parotid gland, found a significant increase in cancer after a decade or more of cell phone use. When a cell phone tower connects with a cell phone, electromagnetic radiation is created. When the cell phone is held against the ear, this radiation penetrates the brain, particularly in children. According to the Daily Telegraph in London, the World Health Organization (WHO) will soon publish the results of the Interphone study, which was conducted in 12 countries by the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC).
Head researcher Dr. Elisabeth Cardis told the Telegraph, “In the absence of definitive results and in the light of a number of studies which, though limited, suggest a possible effect of radio frequency radiation, precautions are important. I am therefore globally in agreement with the idea of restricting the use by children, though I would not go as far as banning mobile phones as they can be a very important tool, not only in emergencies, but also maintaining contact between children and their parents and thus playing a reassurance role. Means to reduce our exposure (use of hands-free kits and moderating our use of phones) are also interesting.”
These results from the Interphone study follow closely on research published in the Oct 13 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which reviewed existing research on the association between cell phones and brain tumors. It found that when just the well-done studies were included, there was an 18% increased risk of brain tumors in cell phone users, and that they tended to occur on the side of the head that the cell phone was used most.
In the United States, which did not participate in the Interphone study, there are 270 million cell phones in use. Senator Tom Harkin, now head of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has promised to probe more deeply into the question of a link between cell phones and brain cancer. There’s no argument that cell phones emit an electromagnetic field, a form of microwave radiation, that enters the brain when the cell phone is held against the ear, and there’s good research showing that the field does affect brain function.
Although research has not shown that short term cell phone use causes cancer, a large population study from Sweden has shown that people who use cell phones for more than ten years on the same side of the head have a 40% higher risk of certain types of brain tumors. The Interphone study adds to this evidence. Cell phone users can distance the brain from electromagnetic fields by using the speaker phone function, a headset, or by texting.
