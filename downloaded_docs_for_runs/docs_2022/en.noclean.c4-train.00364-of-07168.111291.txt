Natural Remedies For Basal Cell Carcinoma – Do They Work?
June 20, 2018 // by Earth Clinic Creative Team// 7 Comments
Although basal cell carcinoma is considered “non-life threatening” by the medical industry, any type of cancer poses a significant threat to your health and well-being. If you have been diagnosed with any type of cancer you should look for holistic treatment options that effectively manage your symptoms as well as your condition and include necessary medical supervision. Some natural remedies for BCC include apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and baking soda.
What Is a Basal Cell Carcinoma?
Basal cell carcinoma is a fairly common form of skin cancer. This type of cancer begins in your basal cells – the cells within the skin that generate new skin cells as the old ones die. The condition most commonly manifests as a waxy bump on your skin; however, it can take other forms. The condition also commonly bleeds repeatedly and scabs over.
What Causes This Type of Skin Cancer?
Basal cell carcinoma often occurs on the head and neck as it is most common on areas that are frequently exposed to the sun. The underlying cause, however, is a mutation in your basal cells, causing them to multiply rapidly and continue growing rather than dying and falling off like normal. Risk factors that contribute to the condition include chronic sun exposure, radiation, fair skin, personal or family history of skin cancer, exposure to arsenic, and a regimen of immune-suppressing drugs.
Do I Need Medical Treatment?
While basal cell carcinoma is a relatively mild form of skin cancer that is unlikely to metastasize or cause secondary health concerns, medical supervision is advised for any type of cancer. A qualified professional can help you determine the severity of your condition and suggest an appropriate course of treatment.
Can I Treat Skin Cancer Naturally?
Fortunately, basal cell carcinoma is a cancer that can respond relatively well to natural remedies. Treatment options such as apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and baking soda help eradicate the cancerous cells while options such as vitamin E and vitamin C help to heal the damaged skin.
1. Apple Cider Vinegar
Apple cider vinegar is nutrient rich, containing potassium and a variety of beneficial enzymes. These nutrients help your body regenerate soft tissue. ACV also aids in alkalizing the body, so your system is capable of naturally fighting cancer. You can effectively implement this treatment as both a topical application and oral supplement. Swab the affected area with ACV daily, or for more intensive treatment, soak a cotton pad with ACV and leave it on the affected area until dry. In addition to this, drink a tonic of 1-2 tablespoons of ACV diluted in 8 ounces of distilled water at least once a day.
2. Hydrogen Peroxide
You can use hydrogen peroxide to treat cancer via oxygenation. Peroxide naturally breaks down into its component parts – one being oxygen. This additional oxygen creates an environment unsuitable for the cancer cells, so the cells naturally die off. To apply this treatment, soak a cotton swab in hydrogen peroxide and rub the cancerous growth with it until the area is saturated and turns white. (It will sting.) After this application, place a hydrogen peroxide soaked cotton pad over the area and allow it to dry. Apply this treatment once a day.
3. Baking Soda
Baking soda treats cancer by alkalizing your body. This change in pH helps reverse the growth of cancerous cells and heals your body. To implement this treatment, mix baking soda with either water or coconut oil to form a paste. Apply the paste to the affected area and allow it to dry. Complete this treatment at least 1-2 times daily.
In addition to eliminating cancer cells, you will also need to support new cell growth. You can do this using vitamin E or C and aloe. Continue reading below for more details and recommendations from our contributors!

Coconut Oil and Baking Soda + Apple Cider Vinegar
Lodi L. from Australia
February 2, 2019 at 3:37 am
Greeting from Australia and my heartfelt thanks to those who were willing to share their experience of using natural treatment for basal cell carcinoma.
Very happy to add my experience of using VCO/BS during the day and ACV morning and night. This is my story so far.
22 years ago I had 2 bcc’s removed from my face (eyelid and chin). At the same time I was advised to also remove some precancerous tissue from my eyebrows and just above it. I decided against that. Lately I had noticed many small red blobs appearing on my forehead and saw dermatologist who immediately diagnosed spreading bcc’s.
Advised chemo/radiation with possible surgery backup. I’m female, aged 75 and all through my life I have used natural remedies and not taking any pharma drugs.
After doing a lot of research, including checking out feedback from earth clinic contributors, I decided for treatment with paste of Virgin Coconut Oil and Baking Soda half/half during the day, and a compress of half strength Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) am and pm for an hour.
Oh my, after first application the extent of BCC spread and became clear. From my left brow it had spread all over my forehead and down to both my temples. Also a spot on the bridge of my nose. The stinging pain was intense, almost unbearable and this continued for about a week.
I’m on day 8 now and still applying twice a day, the VCO and BS, and the pain has decreased somewhat, at least it is more tolerable.
Initially my face was very inflamed and swollen and looked terribly alarming to my kids, who are not into natural therapies and wanted to take me to emergency.
By day 4 my skin had a sandy feel to it and I realised this was the early beginning of crust forming. At no time did my skin bleed and right now I see how the outer edges are slowly diminishing.
When I apply half strength ACV compress I need to protect my eyes with 3 layers of cotton pads to prevent ACV leaking into my eyes and for the same reason I am not able to treat my nose with acv. I realise that it may take another couple of weeks to know how successful or not this treatment has been. I hope that my sharing can assist others in making their decisions. Wishing good health to you all.

HI LODI L.,,, being from Australia, I would assume you are aware of Curaderm. If not research.

Thanks ORH, and yes I have done my research on Curaderm and decided against it because the affected area is so large and I need to be ever so careful around my eyes. Will first see how this works, I doubt that I can get all of it in only one treatment series, maybe for spot treatment later on I will reconsider again. Thanks for your reply.

LODI L,,,,,,,,,,,, youngun, the farmers in Australia cured their cow’s eye cancer with the the Devil’s fruit (eggplant) That’s how Curaderm got started. Nope, you do exactly what you think is needed.

Apple Cider Vinegar
Cm from Ct

I am VERY fair and spent many summers from age 8-20 burning on the MA, CT & RI coast in the USA and also lived in Sydney Australia in my 20's. First skin cancers started showing up in my 30's. I have had basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and Actinic Keratoses. I have had Mohs Surgery, Excisional Surgery, Curettage and Electrodesiccation, Cryosurger and Photodynamic Therapy and also used a topical ointment (basically topical chemo). ALL have come back…yes even Mohs! The topical was the worst, for me.
Since they all have come back I really didn't want to do any of the "proper" treatments from the dermatologist anymore as they have failed me. Thank heavens for the internet. I started to do some research on natural or alternative ways to treat skin cancers. I tried organic apple cider vinegar with the mother and had good results.
Kind of hurts, cancer falls off, leaves a hole, then red mark. You can research treating skin cancers and pre-skin cancers with ACV. Best of luck and love to you all

Hi Cm – I’m also in CT & wondering what you did to the hole once the scab fell off? I’m there now, with hole in side of my nose where I began treating the growth with ascorbic acid on tiny bit of cotton & covered with bandaid….then switched to ACV when researching & in 2 days I’m at the point where the dried cotton pulled off the scab last nite & left a hole that looks like it was scooped out so I think whatever the growth was, it’s gone. There is a white, raised rim around the hole. For now, I’m using raw organic honey in the hole & covering with a bandaid. I’m very nervous and the hole is a bit deep. Years ago, I healed a puncture wound on my shin with raw honey and it did a great job as it also draws out infection. But I’l like to know what you did and how long the hole took to turn red and fill in, if it even did fill in? Tks!

Hi CT,
I’m so glad to hear that what you used on your BCC appears to have worked for you. I’ve been dealing with a BCC also since about 2 yrs., ago. Mine is taking some time since I’m one of those people who was born with dark moles on their skin. I’ve had two right next to my lips for yrs., non-BCC type. I was told because of the tendency for my skin type to have dark moles, plus the fact I spent lots of time in the sun also, hence mine developed on my face just to right side of lower part of my nose. Been using basically the ACV with coconut oil for now.
I went in for a biopsy over 1.5 yrs. ago, and derm wanted to schedule me for Moh’s, followed by plastic surgery.
As you can imagine, I started looking all over the internet for something alternative and had already been on earthclinic’s great site.
Anyway, as a result of that biopsy, of course the BCC had that uneven quality about it after the derm did his thing to get a sample.
After treating it at first with only ACV, I went on to add the coconut oil. Then I also tried the vitamin c crystals mixed w/coconut oil.
It did the usual bleeding, scabbing, (sorry for the detailed explanation), but I feel if we zero in on this info., it really helps people going through this. Exactly as you’ve described, that it left yours w/a hole, w/this white raised rim around the hole, exactly what I’ve had over the last year or so. Of course, I’ve often become rather frustrated w/the whole process, and truth be told kind of slacked off. During these phases, I noticed the BCC kind of closed up, or wasn’t responding anymore to the particular remedy I was using at that moment.
In any case, this rim you’ve mentioned, I’m so glad someone mentioned this. Does the rim feel rather puffy to the touch, almost like a blister of sorts? Have you considered using some vitamin e oil for healing of the skin and scarring. Vitamin e is really good for this. Another thing that is very good for calming of the skin now in your case would also be aloe vera in gel form. Just slather it on. You see by using remedies such as the ACV, or the bicarbonate soda, these all irritate the skin. So my guess is after that phase we must put some soothing, calming remedies on it. O.K., I hope I don’t sound as if I’m just rambling. Keep up the good work!
