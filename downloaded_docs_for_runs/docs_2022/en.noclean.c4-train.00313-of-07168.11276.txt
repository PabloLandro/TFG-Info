Secondhand Exposure to Cell Phone Radiation: An Emerging Public Health Problem?

Many people are unaware that they are exposed to cell phone radiation when their cell phones are in standby mode. This occurs because their cell phone contacts the nearest cell tower periodically to update its location.
In a moving vehicle, cell phones in standby mode contact cell towers more frequently. Thus, exposure to cell phone radiation from one’s cell phone is greater in transit.
Two Swiss researchers, Damiano Urbinello and Martin Roosli, set out to measure personal cell phone radiation exposure during car, bus and train trips when one’s own phone was in standby mode.
Their study just published in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology identified a source of cell phone radiation that may constitute a public health problem. Namely, secondhand exposure to cell phone radiation from other people’s cell phones can be considerable while traveling on buses and trains (1).
During bus or train trips, individuals may be exposed to considerable amounts of cell phone radiation from other people’s cell phones. Buses and railroad cars act like “”Faraday cages”” that reflect much of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by cell phones throughout the vehicles’ interiors. Thus, all passengers, including infants and pregnant women as well as those without cell phones, may be exposed to considerable levels of cell phone radiation emitted by others’ phones.
As for car trips, the results of the study suggest that exposure to cell phone radiation from one’s own phone in standby mode is relatively low compared to overall exposures during public transit. Nonetheless, those who are concerned about their exposure to cell phone radiation should turn off their phones during car trips, or at the very least, avoid using their phones for calls.
● “”The study indicates that own uplink exposure during car driving can be considerably reduced (about a fraction of 100) when turning off ones own mobile phone in order to prevent it from location updates.”” (1)
The researchers found that GSM, the 2G carrier system in Europe which is used in the U.S. for voice communication by AT&T and T-Mobile, is particularly problematic compared to UMTS, a 3G carrier system used for data transmission. The researchers did not test CDMA which in the U.S. is used by Verizon and Sprint for voice calls. Other research has found that GSM emits 13 to 28 times more radiation on average than CDMA during phone calls. No published studies have examined exposures from LTE, the 4G carrier system now in widespread use in this country.
● “”GSM levels in the reference scenario during bus and train rides were about 100 times higher than those during car rides. As a consequence of this high background exposure in trains, due to the use of other people’s mobile phone in a closed area intensified by the Faraday cage effect, the relative contribution of the location update from ones own mobile phone is small”” (1)
The study also reported that smart phones, including the iPhone 4 and the Blackberry Bold 8800, which can operate on four radiofrequency bands emit more radiation during standby mode than classic phones, like the Nokia 2600, which operate on two bands.
Earlier this year, a study was published that examined cell phones in standby mode while stationary. Kjell Mild and his colleagues from Sweden found that under these conditions cell phones contacted the cell towers only once every two to five hours. They concluded that exposure to cell phone radiation in this situation “”can be considered negligible.”” (2)
These studies should be replicated in the U.S. as well as in other countries since every cell phone carrier system operates differently.
In the meantime it is advisable to keep cell phone use in moving vehicles to a minimum as low level exposures to cell phone radiation have been associated with deleterious effects in humans.
To protect us from the health risks associated with cell phones and related devices (e.g., cordless phones, Wi-Fi, wireless Smart Meters and security systems, and cell towers), we need research independent of industry to develop biologically-based standards and safer technologies. A nickel a month from each cell phone subscription would suffice to fund a comprehensive program of research. Since the average cell phone subscription costs more than $47.00 per month, this tiny fee constitutes a prudent investment in our health and our children’s health.

We have been seeing a torrent of changes in the way that people, governments and legal bodies have been approaching the issue of cell phone radiation.
We recently reported a groundbreaking court case in Italy that ruled in favor of a man who claimed he developed a brain tumor as a result of excessive phone use for his work.
Another high profile occurrence was a recent study that was released which indicated a negative affect on unborn fetuses from phone radiation.
These are only a few of the changes that are going on worldwide, but in the last week a radical development occurred and it has turned the unlikely town of Pembroke Pines, FL into the new battleground for cell phone radiation awareness.
Inspired by a resident’s cancer survival story, Pembroke Pines passed what’s thought to be the first resolution in the state to warn residents about the possibility of cellphone radiation causing cancer.
Pembroke Pines resident Jimmy Gonzalez had a cancerous brain tumor removed from the area above Gonzalez’ left ear the same place where he held his cellphone for hours a day while working as an attorney. Just a year earlier, surgeons removed a tumor from his left hand, in between his index finger and middle finger.
The resolution encourages all residents to keep their cellphone at least one-inch away from their bodies, and to use a wired headset or speakerphone and to send messages by text or email. The resolution also encourages residents to stay informed about the latest scientific reports about cellphone radiation.
Pines plans to send the resolution, passed at its most recent meeting, to agencies across the state including the governor’s office, the Florida League of Cities and the Florida Legislature to encourage other cities and school boards to adopt a similar resolution to protect Floridians.
Does this sound familiar? That is because these are suggestions we have been promoting for quite sometimes. Simple and easy to follow tips that will help you limit the dangers of exposure to phone radiation.
We all know that smartphones are a huge part of our lives, and most of us are not willing to give them up. With tawkon for Android you don’t have to. You can talk all you want and tawkon will alert you when radiation levels spike, and suggest ways to lessen your exposure.
Do you think this is a harbinger of things to come? Will more towns, cities and states all over the country begin to adopt similar requirements?
What are your thoughts?

Traditionally, parotid gland tumors have been very rare. And they’ve generally shown up in people after the age of 50.
Not so anymore. According to a study done by a research group in Israel, there has been a sharp increase in these types of malignant tumors and most of them are occurring with people under the age of 20. Cell phone radiation is the suspected culprit.
What is the Parotid Gland?
The parotid gland is a type of salivary gland in the cheek the one closest to where most people hold a cell phone.
What’s important is that the new data from the Israeli study show no similar increases in the two other major types of salivary glands the submandibular and sublingual glands that are further away from where a phone is generally held.
The study, headed by R. Czerninzki of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem at Hadassah school of Dental Medicine, reported a significant increase in incidence of parotid gland tumors over last 30 years. Finding a four-fold increase in parotid gland cancers from 1970-2006, they found the steepest increase happened after 2001.
US Senate Hearing on Cell Phone Radiation
In 2008, Dr. Siegal Sadetzki, principal investigator of another study on cell phone radiation testified in a US senate hearing that cell phones were identified as a contributor to salivary gland tumors. In his report, he stated that risk of getting a parotid tumor on same side of head used for speaking on cell phone increases by:
34% if you are regular cell phone user & have used a cell phone for 5 yrs
49% if you have spoken on phone for more than 266.3 hours during your lifetime
58% if you’ve had more than about 5500 calls in your lifetime
Parotid gland tumors are not the only tumors being linked to cell phones.

Is There a Connection Between Autism Electromagnetic Radiation?

Research has established a potential link between autism and fetal/neonatal exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation. Based on epidemiological data, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recent evidence indicates the incidence of ASD to be roughly 1 per 110 children.
Some data suggest a possible correlation between autism incidence an environmental toxin known as radio frequency (RF) radiation. This is a biologically active substance. It is known that human exposure to RF radiation has increased during the past 20 years. It is suggested that fetal or neo-natal exposures to RF radiation may be associated with an increased incidence of autism.
Dr. George Louis Carlo PhD studied risks associated with cell phones funded by a government grant. The results he obtained initially indicated no correlations, however, by 1999, Dr. Carlo had obtained significantly more evidence pointing to a risk to DNA, eye cancers, and brain tumors.
At this time he developed a theory that low frequency cell phone signals are harmful to the functioning of cells. What can result of this impaired functioning is that cells which normally move wastes and toxins out of the body started to protect themselves and this cellular movement stopped. Without the ability to move wastes outside cells results in a buildup of toxins. Dr. Carlo’s hypothesis suggests that autistic children are less able to process heavy metals, so these remain in their bodies and cause neurological damage, including autism.
Further research conducted by Dr. Carlo along with Tamara Mariea and published in the Journal of the Australian College of Nutrition and Environmental Medicine in November 2007, demonstrated the positive effects that autistic children could experience in an Electromagnetic-free (EM-free) clinic. This was a trial with 20 autistic children, involving spending at least four hours, 2-3 times a week, in the EM-free clinic. In three months, analyses showed that heavy metals were beginning to be excreted by the children.
Food for Thought:
• The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sets standards for the amount of radio frequency that can be emitted by a cell phone based on the size and structure of a man’s head.
• Radio-frequency signals can reach deeper into children’s head because their skulls are thinner and their brains contain more fluid.
• In 2004, standards relaxed and roughly doubled the amount of radio frequency that could reach an adult brain and quadrupled that reaching a child’s.
• A child’s brain doubles in size during the first two years of life and keeps on developing until their early 20s.
Although it is impossible to pinpoint one single cause of autism or one single barrier to an autistic child’s successful recovery, we are continuing to take steps forwards in identifying contributing factors. It is definitely reasonable to agree with researchers who believe that the increase in exposure to EMR from all of the wireless devices in our lives in combination with environmental and genetic factors is creating the perfect storm to increase the incidence of autism.

Health fears over mobile phone masts have resurfaced after a study revealed powerful new transmitters could cause headaches and nausea.
People living up to two miles from third-generation transmitters suffered bad reactions, including tingling sensations, radiation experts discovered.
Experts are calling on European politicians to press for an inquiry into the potential risks posed by the new generation of mobile phones.
Thousands of the masts have already been installed across Britain as the industry gears up for the 3G market.
A total of 35,000 will be needed to cover the country.
The technology allows users to make video calls and download clips, such as films and Premiership football action, to their 3G phones.
But the study could set back its growth in Britain, where concerns over mobile phone masts are increasing.
Opponents have fought plans to put up masts close to their homes, while schools have come under pressure to remove them from buildings.
Campaigner Karen Barrett, who has spent three years fighting masts in Winchester, Hampshire, said: ‘A lot of new masts will be built for 3G, so it’s important we get to grips with potential problems early.’
The Dutch study compared the impact of radiation from base stations used for the current mobile network with that of base stations used for new 3G networks.
It concluded: ‘If the test group was exposed to 3G base station signals there was a significant impact.
‘They felt tingling sensations, got headaches and felt nauseous.’
However, there was no negative reaction to signals from traditional mobile networks. Both types of transmitter increased functions such as memory and response times.
Phone operators hit back, denying there are health problems.
The GSM Association, an organisation representing mobile phone firms, said: ‘As the effects are small, it is unclear whether they have any health significance.’
Sony Ericsson said there was no scientific evidence of any health problems.

There is a growing concern about the amount of radiation from mobile phones and the type of damage to those who continuously emitted by the phones. Survey on adverse health effects of radiation from mobile phones is increasing, but the analysis were associated with fresh vertigo, salivary gland tumors, brain tumors, headaches and behavioral problems.
More terrible is that many mobile topPhones from reputable manufacturers are considered as the maximum intensity of radiation, according to the Environmental Working Group.
Blackberry Bold 9700, Droid, Nexus HTC Touch Google and LG Chocolate mobile phones are to be avoided some light for you, because all four of these phones are actually closer to the top of the “radio frequency radiation protection limits” set forward from ‘Federal Communications Commission “in claims compliance with the EEC. OnOn the other hand, Blackberry Storm, Samsung and Sanyo Katana II rugby, the lowest rate of discharge radiation.
However, each cell has a certain amount of radiation discharged in the long run can lead to serious health problems. Now-say-a life without a cell phone seems to be very unfeasible. There are several factors that the experts who help the radiation exposure can be recommended to a higher level guard.
Make it a practice to useEar to ear all the time because they do not produce radiation and mobile phones.
Try to talk less and listen more, because according to experts, talking cell phones produce more radiation than the listening time.
Another important tip is to send text messages more often instead of talking, because when you create a text message on your cell phone consumes less energy because less radiationproduced.
Avoid it, if it’s a weak signal, because a stronger signal to take the phone to release significant amounts of radiation.
If you can not live without a cell phone, try to make less use to reduce their harmful effects.

NEW DELHI: Talking on the cellphone may possibly lead to a malignant form of brain cancer, the World Health Organization has said. A study done by an arm of the world body has classified radiation coming out of cellphones alongside gasoline engine exhaust, lead and DDT as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is under WHO, however, said there wasn’t enough evidence yet to conclusively link mobile phone use with cancer.
“The WHO/IARC has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer, associated with wireless phone use,” it said.
“This does not mean the link has been firmly established,” said IARC’s chief of the monograph programme, Dr Kurt Straif, speaking to TOI from Lyon, France. “But there is reason for concern.”
The group, consisting of 31 scientists from 14 countries, examined “hundreds of epidemiological studies” on cellphone use to see what the long-term health effects might be after exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer’s monograph programme, which consists of 31 scientists, said that they reviewed the data from hundreds of studies on effects of cellphone radiation, and believe mobile phone usage is limited to a risk of glioma and acoustis neuroma (a benign but life-threatening tumor).
They did not have enough data to conclude that it could cause any other forms of cancer.
“After going through hundreds of studies, we concluded that there is just a possibility of a link between high cellphone use and brain cancer, not a certainty. We also don’t know how much radiation exposure can be termed harmful,” Straif said. One of the studies the researchers looked at said that those who had spent 1,600 hours of active call time over 10 years — around 30 minutes a day — could be at highest risk.
“But, what was considered a long talk time a few years back is considered low usage now. So there is no clear picture,” he added. According to Dr Straif, it is now left to governments and organizations like WHO to come out with recommendations based on evidence provided by IARC.
“There are some easy ways to reduce exposure, one of them being encouraging emailing or texting, rather than talking on the cell phone, which emanates the high risk. However recommendations have to be made by governments, not IARC which is a research organisation,” Dr Straif said. In 2000, IARC had put “extremely low frequency magnetic field radiation” emanating from overhead power lines in the 2B category.
What led IARC to work on cellphones was the increasing number of people using the device. With an estimated five billion cellphone subscriptions worldwide, concerns have been growing regarding the possible health hazards posed by radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.
IARC working group chairman Dr Jonathan Samet said, “The evidence, while still accumulating, is strong enough to support a 2B classification. The conclusion means that there could be some risk, and therefore we need to keep a close watch for a link between cellphones and cancer risk.”
Christopher Wild, ARC director, said, “It is important that additional research be conducted into the long term use of mobile phones. Pending such information, it is important to take pragmatic measures to reduce exposure such as hands free devices or texting.” The assessment on cellphones comes after similar work was done on solar radiation and ionizing radiation (X-rays and gamma rays). The report summarizing the main conclusions of the IARC working group’s work on radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RFD) will be published in the July 1 issue of the British medical journal, Lancet Oncology.
India, meanwhile, is also embarking on its very own largescale cellphone study. To be spearheaded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the five-year-long study is to be conducted by JNU’s School of Environmental Sciences and the departments of obstetrics and gynecology, neurology and biochemistry of AIIMS.

A Council of Europe committee examined evidence that the technologies have “potentially harmful” effects on humans, and concluded that immediate action was required to protect children.
In a report, the committee said it was crucial to avoid repeating the mistakes made when public health officials were slow to recognise the dangers of asbestos, tobacco smoking and lead in petrol.
The report also highlighted the potential health risks of cordless telephones and baby monitors, which rely on similar technology and are widely used in British homes.
Fears have been raised that electromagnetic radiation emitted by wireless devices can cause cancers and affect the developing brain.
The findings were seized on by campaigners who oppose the spread of wireless devices.
The committee concluded that member states should:
• Set thresholds for levels of long-term exposure to microwaves of the type emitted by mobile phones;
• Introduce clear labelling on products indicating the presence of electromagnetic fields and any health risks associated with use;
• Ban all mobile phones and wireless networks in classrooms and schools;
• Run information campaigns aimed at children and young adults about the risks to human health;
• Step up research on less-dangerous types of antennae and mobile phones.
The conclusions contradict advice from the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health, which says exposure to electromagnetic fields poses little or no risk to human health.

This health e-letter is about a very popular modern device:the cell phone. Unfortunately, cell phones do emit electromagnetic radiation. There has been much debate recently in health news circles about the effects of this radiation on human health. The problem with radiation is that it is made up of subatomic particles. These particles move at a very high speeds, sometimes as much as 100,000 miles per second! Because of these tremendous speeds, radiation can penetrate deep inside your body, damaging your cells.
When a radiation particle collides violently with atoms or molecules in your cells, these cells may die. If the cells survive the impact, they may begin to grow in a mutated form. And in fact, this is just what a recent study has found when it comes to sperm cells. Researchers conducted an animal trial involving rats exposed to cell phone radiation. The rats were exposed to mobile phone frequencies for two hours a day for 35 days.
The research team found there was a significant decrease in protein kinase C (an enzyme involved in controlling the function of other proteins) and total sperm count after exposure to the mobile phone radiation. They also found that there was an increase in sperm cell death. They concluded that the study results suggest a reduction in protein kinase activity may be related to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under microwave field exposure.

A decrease in sperm count and an increase in cell death due to mobile radiation exposure may lead to infertility. So what can you do? Cell phones are clearly here to stay and most of us enjoy the incredible convenience these mobile devices offer. Here are five tips to reduce your exposure to electromagnetic waves from your cell phone: Don’t talk; text. Phones emit higher amounts of radiation when a call is being made. Keep calls short when speaking on the phone. Keep cell phones away from your body: Even keeping a cell phone an inch away from your head can significantly reduce the amount of radiation you will absorb.
Check your phone: Cell phones are unique and emit varying levels of electromagnetic radiation, some higher than others. Go hands-free: Using a headset or talking on speaker phone can drastically reduce the amount of radiation you absorb. Avoid using cell phones in weak-signal areas: Cell phones emit the most radiation when they have a weak signal, because the phone is working harder to get a signal to the tower. Protect children: Many experts say children should have very limited use of cell phones because their brains are still developing and can absorb more radiation or be susceptible to risks.

Cell Phones Radiaton & Koobi “Can Cause” Brain Cancer? Part 1

An announcement last month from the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO/IARC) that they have classified radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields, such as those from mobile/cell phones, as possibly cancer-causing in humans has garnered apprehension particularly in Africa where the use of cell phones is the highest in the world.
Despite modern era of information overdose and associated abuse, there are some organizations that, in the minds of public health professionals in particular and the general public in general, have an aura of authenticity. The World Health Organization (WHO) is one such organization. When the WHO comes up with a report that associates cancer to mobile phone usage, there is bound to be worldwide excitement. And for good reason. There is an estimated five billion mobile phone connections around the world. If mobile phones do indeed cause cancer, it is something to be actually worried about.
But what did the IARC actually say and what does it mean?
It was reported that 31 scientists from 14 countries met in Lyon, France, to pore over hundreds of previous scientific articles to assess the potential carcinogenic hazards from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. The IARC Monograph Working Group, as the researchers are called, discussed and evaluated the available literature and concluded that the data was inadequate to draw conclusions for cancers other than glioma, a rare malignant type of brain cancer that strikes three to five people per 100,000 in population.
For gliomas, however, the scientists found some evidence, though limited of carcinogenicity, meaning that a positive association between mobile phone use and cancer had been found, but that chance and bias could not be ruled out for this connection. The scientists did not specify the level of risk, but one previous study of mobile phone use showed a 40% increased risk for gliomas in the highest category of heavy mobile phone users (which was classified as 30 minutes per day of use over a 10-year period). The scientists found these results to be compelling enough to give radiofrequency electromagnetic fields a 2B classification as an agent that might cause cancer.
To better understand the issue let’s take a look at the classification. The IARC Monographs scale is as follows: Group 1: Carcinogenic to humans; Group 2A: Probably carcinogenic to humans; Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans; Group 3: Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans; Group 4: Probably not carcinogenic to humans.
The radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation falls into category 2B, the same category as such innocuous potential cancer-causing agents such as coffee, talcum powder, naphthalene, dry cleaning and pickled vegetables. But also in the 2B category are more threatening agents such as DDT and gasoline (diesel, petrol and probably Kerosene), and its fumes.
Pickling causes cancer? Pickling, also known as brining or corning is the process of preserving food by fermentation in brine (a solution of salt in water) to produce lactic acid or marinating, and storing it in an acid solution, usually vinegar (acetic acid). The resulting food is called a pickle. This procedure gives the food a salty or sour taste.
Fellow, Ghanaians and Africans, did you read the above paragraph well and do you now get what I am driving at? Pickling is the method we use to prepare Koobi, Kako, one-man thousand, Osamini, Momone, Kosohwe, etc., etc. Secondly, in my village, everybody, from the new born child to grandmothers bathed themselves in talcum powder after every bath, which occurs every day. Maame Nkra (the Accra lady) who supplied my mother with these items was a favorite visitor to our house.
Your Lord/Ladyships of Africa, before, you start insulting me with all those invectives about Koobi and cancer or before you start saying “Oh dear, something else to worry about”, please I want to assure you that you are not alone. I am with you. When I saw the items listed in group 2B, I called my family in Otwereso and Ayirebi to ask them to go for check up. My uncle pleaded with me to go to the hospital to see a Psychiatric to check my head or to come home. It looks like I have been away for too long, it is affected my brains.
I am not done yet. Of the 32 things beginning with the letter C including cell phones that are possibly carcinogenic to humans, include coffee, carpentry, coconut oil in shampoo and carrageen, a thickener found in instant-pudding mixes. In Ghana, pudding includes, rice water, banku, Ga kome, kooko, kose, cake, akple’, achaka, and kpekple’. Hey, I am just the messenger so save your insult for the scientists. But you’ll be happy to know that living in Chorkor, or Chiana Paga are not on the list, yet. I did not also find Courts and Choo lorry on the list. The Ghanaian courts are not on the list probably because they are only carcinogen to the NDC government. I leave this part to the experts in food.
So is mobile phone use and all these other items innocuous or threatening? The word in the classification “possibly” can go either way. It is like the classic example of the half-filled glass; you see what you want to see. The 2B category is used when there is limited (or inadequate) evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient (or less than sufficient) evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. This essentially means that while it can be concluded that such items can cause cancer in animals used to conduct the experiments, nothing can be conclusively said about the effect on humans.
“Given the potential consequences for public health of this classification and findings, it is important that additional research be conducted into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones,” says IARC director Christopher Wild. “Pending the availability of such information, it is important to take pragmatic measures to reduce exposure such as hands-free devices or texting.” Translation: we don’t know if mobile phone use causes cancer, but there’s certainly a compelling case to go hands-free when possible.
What is in this for Africa? Many more people in Africa use mobile phones than in any part of the world, a new report by the International Telecommunications Union has said. By the end of 2008, Africa had 246 million mobile subscriptions and over the past five years the continent’s mobile phone use has increased at an annual rate of 65 percent – twice the global average, whiles mobile penetration has risen from just five percent in 2003 to well over 30 percent.
Cell phones have become the only practical way to connect to friends, family, and business associates. On a continent where bad roads, seasonal flooding that washes away bridges, poor transportation systems, rolling blackouts, undrinkable water, and fetid mounds of refuse remain the stuff of everyday existence, wireless telecommunications services stand out as a rare, perhaps unique, technological success story. Tens of millions of ordinary Africans carry cell phones today, something not even the richest of them could have possessed barely a decade ago. And every month, millions more dial in to the 21st century, with profound implications for African economies and societies. Mbarika and Mbarika quote the United Nations as reporting that sub-Saharan Africa – with 34 of the 50 poorest countries on Earth is the world’s fastest-growing wireless market.
Africa is going wireless for a very simple reason: The United Nation reports that in most sub-Saharan countries not even 1 percent of the population have landline-connected telephones. That compares with more than 10 lines per 100 people in Latin America and more than 64 per 100 in the United States. Even Mongolians have twice as many land lines per person than us.
Indeed, Tokyo and New York City each have more fixed-line telephones than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. These numbers are even more daunting when you consider that fixed lines tend to be concentrated in capital cities, leaving rural communities totally bereft. Also, fixed lines are difficult to operate and can take years to install even if thieves will not cut the copper wires and tend them to rings, chains and other ornaments, whiles you only need to buy a handset and prepaid cell phone calling card to get a wireless line.
