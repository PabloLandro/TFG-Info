It is likely not an exaggeration to say that almost every other garage or home today will have a blue can of WD-40® on hand. The product, as some have claimed, is more popular than the iPod.
If you don’t already know, founder of Rocket Chemical Company Norm Larsen is considered the original founder of WD-40®.
In 1953, Rocket Chemical was then just a fledgling company with a staff of three when they set out to create a line of rust-prevention solvents and degreasers for use in the aerospace industry. In a small lab in San Diego, California, USA, they hit the ‘eureka!’ moment on the 40th try, hence the name WD-40®, which stands for Water Displacement perfected on the 40th try.
The product was first used by Convair, an aerospace contractor, to protect the outer skin of the Atlas Missile from rust and corrosion. But then Larsen made an aerosol spray version and the first debuted on shore shelves in San Diego in 1958.
The product worked so well — still does in fact — that it is now regarded a handy essential in almost every household, over 60 years since it was first created, with over 2,000 uses for the product discovered by end-consumers.
Interestingly, as the product’s popularity spread over the years, some funny stories have been circulated about it. Here’re some funny ones that have reached myth status:
Myth: Our secret formula isn’t such a secret
Fact: Nah-uh. Over 60 years on, the formulation of the WD-40® Multi-Use product is still a trade secret. So all the wild claims out there alleging the “secret sauce” isn’t so secret anymore isn’t true.
Myth: WD-40® contains fish oil
Fact: Countless customers have shared over the years that they caught some of their biggest fish ever after using WD-40® to protect their fish hooks and lures. Some assumed this product contain fish oil as it apperas to attract fish. But sorry folks, that’s not true.
**Note: While WD-40® can be used to help protect fishing equipment from rust and corrosion, we don’t recommend using it to attract fish.**
Myth: WD-40® Multi-Use Product is not really a lubricant
Fact: Actually, while the “WD” in WD-40® stands for Water Displacement, the product is a unique, special blend of lubricants.
The product’s formulation also contains anti-corrosion agents and ingredients for penetration, water displacement and soil removal.
Myth: WD-40® Multi-Use Product shouldn’t be used on bike chains
Fact: Though WD-40® Multi-Use Product is not a grease, it is formulated with strong lubricating oils and other ingredients. So it is a terrific product to use for bike maintenance.
It also does not attract dirt or moisture to metal surfaces. So do use it on bikes and just be sure to wipe off any excess of the spray before riding.
Myth: WD-40® cures arthritis!
Fact: Nope. NO WAY. The WD-40® Company does not recommend the use of WD-40® for medical purposes, and knows no reason why it would be deemed effective for arthritis pain relief. The product contains petroleum distillates and should be handled with the same precaution for any product containing this type of material.
