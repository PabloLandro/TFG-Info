Salt Lamps: Positive Benefits Of Negative Ions
April 3, 2017 happyholistichealth	Leave a comment
Benefits Of Salt Lamps
Salt lamps are beautiful. They create a soft gentle ambience in any room; make marvelous night lights for children; plus they lift our spirits. But salt lamps also play an important role in maintaining your health. Significantly, Himalayan salt lamp benefits include their ability to counteract the negative effects of indoor electromagnetic (EM) radiation.
Spending too long indoors can leave you feeling sleepy, head-achey, inattentive and generally unwell. But it’s not simply the lack of fresh air that leaves you feeling so low. Science shows it’s due to the excessive positive ions in the air in our homes, workplaces and schools. These harmful positive ions are largely created by the electronic devices and synthetic substances surrounding us.
Although you can’t see EM radiation it’s believed to have serious long-term health effects. With over two thousand studies supporting the toxic impact, it’s known that being constantly exposed to EM radiation increases stress, causes fatigue and compromises your immune system.
Positive vs Negative Ions
Positive and negative ions are charged particles in the air. Each is produced in particular circumstances and each affects us in opposite ways. Strangely, negative ions are not the “bad guys”, as that honour goes to the positive ions.
Beneficial Negative Ions
Beneficial negative ions form around water, especially if it’s moving – oceans, rivers, waterfalls, thunderstorms, lush gardens and even the shower. In these places they can exist in quantities up to 100,000 per cubic centimetre. But in some offices and homes the levels can sit at just a few hundred per cubic centimetre and sometimes, as low as zero. These are the environments that cause unhealthy symptoms and illness.
Negative ions affect the levels of serotonin we produce and leave us feeling happier. They also positively affect how our body functions, reduce pain and improve many illnesses.
Negative ions have a purifying effect on the air. They neutralize extra positive ions and help re-balance our environments to benefit our health.
Besides watery environments the air around Himalayan salt lamps contains higher numbers of negative ions.
Harmful Positive Ions
Positive ions are found where there are lots of electronic devices, synthetic materials or toxins like cigarette smoke. They have a detrimental effect on our health and feelings of wellbeing. In excess they affect body functions and leave us feeling tired, sick and depressed. They’re found in alarming levels in our indoor environments wherever there is a concentration of electronic equipment.
Negative Health Effect of Positive Ions
When you hang out in places of high positive ionic activity it’s not simply your mood and sense of wellbeing that’s affected. Excess positive ions impair many body functions including the brain, and suppress the immune system.
Symptoms include:
headaches
fatigue
irritability
poor concentration
depression
lack of energy
anxiety
nausea
vertigo
breathing difficulty and asthma
dry throat.
Chronic exposure can cause cancer, reduce immunity and contribute to many other chronic diseases including Alzheimer’s, heart disease and dementia.
Once in the body positive ions can become free radicals which destroy cells, lead to premature aging and cause illnesses like cancer.

Negative Ions & Health
Way back in 1910 a Japanese study found that arthritis sufferers endured increased pain when weather changes cause positive ions in the atmosphere to increase. (cold fronts and low pressure systems, and positive ion winds).
There have been a number of studies that have found negative ions have measurable health benefits. One was conducted by Dr Kornblueh from the University of Pennsylvania found they can sedate and relieve pain, helping with illnesses such as depression and arthritis. It also found positively ionised air led to headaches, dizziness and mucous membrane irritation.
Himalayan Salt Lamp Benefits

Salt lamps provide their health-giving benefits when they’re warm so they must be lit up. Although there are no studies into Himalayan salt lamp benefits there are many others that show the benefits of salt therapy in general.
Salt Lamps Create Healthier Environments
We’re swimming in a pool of electromagnetic radiation. With wi-fi, mobile phone, TV, computers, bluetooth, and a myriad of electrical gadgets we cannot escape its impact. This makes the benefits offered by salt lamps even more valuable.
Spending time in nature, especially around running water is an awesome way to increase your exposure to negative ions. But you can’t always do that, so Himalayan salt lamps help reduce harmful electrosmog when you’re stuck indoors.
Anything we can do to reduce the negative effect on our health as we live surrounded by this electrosmog helps protect our immune system, and maintain our wellness.
Become aware of your surroundings.
Move children away from electronic hotspots particularly when they’re trying to study
Sit outside in the garden or take a walk beside fast flowing water whenever possible
Place plants around your home
Install a few Himalayan crystal salt lamps to counteract the harmful effects of wi-fi and other positive ion producers
Place all electronic devices away from your body while you sleep, preferably in another room.
We can’t completely avoid dangerous levels of positive ions while we live in a modern society. But we can take steps to reduce the impact on our health and wellness using simple practices and objects. Becoming proactive by simply introducing indoor plants, water fountains and Himalayan salt lamps benefits us and helps counteract the damage.
