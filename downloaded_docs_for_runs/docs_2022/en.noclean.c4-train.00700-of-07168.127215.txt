Squats are done by weight trainers, sports stars and others looking for a good leg workout. Some people think squats can injure your knees, while others maintain that the exercise is perfectly safe. The case against squats is accompanied by little hard evidence, while there is abundant research stating that squats are safe as long as you take proper precautions.
Effects of Squats
A squat is when you move your body into a sitting position without a chair. During a deep squat, the buttocks dip behind the knees and behind the calves. This can be done while holding weights or without. Proponents of squats say that squats tone your legs and buttock areas and improve your performance in sports. Those on the anti-squat side say that squats can cause collateral ligament laxity, or the loosing of knee ligaments due to strain put on the knees while the squat is performed.
The Klein Study
The beginning of the anti-squat movement was started by one study. In 1961, Dr. Karl Klein of the University of Texas published a study that said squats can be a dangerous exercise. In the study, Klein stated that squats loosened the knee joint by stretching the ligaments. He came to this conclusion by testing weightlifters who do squats and college students who do not. He measured knee injury using a machine he created that slipped over the leg. As Klein pressed on each side of the knee, the machine's gauge would measure collateral ligament laxity. Since Klein's study, there has been very little proof that squats are bad for the knees if done properly under the supervision of a trained professional.
Pro-Squat Studies
Though there have been no more studies to prove that squats are dangerous, there have been studies that prove that they are safe. For example, a study published by "American Journal of Sports Medicine" states that power lifters who do squats did not have significant change in the laxity of their knee ligaments. A study published in "British Journal of Sports Medicine" found that not only do squats not harm the knees, the exercise may increase an athlete's performance.
Safety with Caution
The National Strength and Conditioning Association released a statement declaring squats safe for healthy individuals, as long as you follow some guidelines. Squats need to be performed properly and under the supervision of a trained professional to avoid knee injury. Also, squats can cause injury if they used in conjunction with improper form, excessive training or fatigue-related problems; stop exercising and consult a professional if you feel pain in your knee joint.
