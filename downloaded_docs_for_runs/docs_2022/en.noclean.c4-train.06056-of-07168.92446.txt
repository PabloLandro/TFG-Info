Can liposuction reverse diabetes and lower blood pressure.?
Dr. Robert True Dr. True
6 doctors agreed:
Weight loss is key: Liposuction per se is not a weight loss procedure. It is well documented that adequate weight loss, when you're overweight, can result in a reversal of diabetes and can lower blood pressure. I see many of my patients who are on my HCG true diet lose 20-30 pounds of fat and significantly decrease their meds for these problems. Some don't even need the meds after the weight loss. ...Read more

Can eating bananas help to lower high blood pressure?
Dr. Sergio Schabelman Dr. Schabelman
No: Bananas are high in potassium and may be good for cramping (if they are related to low potassium) they may have a very minimal and indirect effect in BP and they are not part of the management/ treatment of hbp and neither is garlic, another myth. If you do have hbp you need to be under medical supervision to have the best chance of avoiding the complications of hypertension. ...Read more

Can eating more whole-grain foods help lower my blood pressure?
Dr. Sheldon Sheps Dr. Sheps
It might: Eating more whole-grain foods on a regular basis may help reduce your chance of developing high blood pressure (hypertension). Whole grains are grains that include the entire grain kernel — they haven't had their bran and germ removed by refining. Whole-grain foods are a rich source of healthy nutrients, including fiber, potassium, magnesium, folate, (folic acid) iron and selenium. Eating more whole-grain foods offers many health benefits that can work together to help reduce your risk of high blood pressure by: Aiding in weight control, since whole-grain foods can make you feel full longer, Increasing your intake of potassium, which is linked to lower blood pressure, Decreasing your risk of insulin resistance, Reducing damage to your blood vessels. If you already have high blood pressure, eating more whole-grain foods might help lower your blood pressure and possibly reduce your need for blood pressure medication. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet both suggest including whole grains as part of a healthy diet. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as part of an overall healthy diet, adults should eat at least 85 grams of whole-grain foods a day — that's about 3 ounces, or the equivalent of three slices of whole-wheat bread. ...Read more
