Mosquito-Borne Diseases from Travel
Is this your child's symptom?
Tropical diseases spread by mosquitoes
Includes malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, chikungunya fever and Zika virus
Your child has no symptoms of tropical disease. If your child has symptoms, use other guides. These diseases start with high fevers.
Tropical diseases occur in people who travel to or live in high-risk countries. These mainly are developing countries near the Equator. You may have traveled to a high-risk country recently.
West Nile Virus is not included in this guide. See the Mosquito Bite guide.
If NOT, try one of these:
Animal or Human Bite
Diarrhea Diseases From Travel
Ebola Exposure
Fever
Headache
Leg Pain
Mosquito Bite
Rash or Redness - Widespread
How Tropical Mosquito-Borne Diseases are Detected by this Symptom Checker
These diseases can't be diagnosed over the phone. But, they can be suspected based on their symptoms. They are then referred to a medical setting where a diagnosis can be made.
Malaria will be picked up by the Fever guide. High fevers, prolonged fever and shaking chills will refer the child to be seen. The Headache or Leg Pain guides will also work. Reason: Malaria can also cause severe headache or muscle pain.
Yellow fever will be picked up by the Fever guide. High fevers, prolonged fever and shaking chills will refer the child to be seen. The Headache or Leg Pain guides will also work. Reason: Yellow fever can also cause severe headache or muscle pains.
Dengue fever will be picked up by the Fever guide. High fevers, prolonged fever and shaking chills will refer the child to be seen. The Headache or Leg Pain guides will also work. Reason: Dengue fever can also cause severe headache, joint pain or muscle pains.
Chikungunya fever will be picked up by the Fever guide. High fevers, prolonged fever and shaking chills will refer the child to be seen. The Arm Pain or Leg Pain guides will also work. Reason: Joint pains in the hands and feet are common. So are muscle pains.
Zika virus infection will be picked up by the Fever or Rash care guides.
Travel to a high risk country should raise the concern. However, common diseases that cause fever (such as colds) also must be ruled out. They occur more commonly in these countries than the serious diseases. But, severe symptoms or symptoms that last too long make us think about these other diseases.
World-wide Causes of Death in Children Under Age 5
6.3 million children under the age of 5 died in 2013 worldwide.
These 5 infections account for over 50% of all early child deaths:
Pneumonia and other respiratory diseases 19%
Diarrhea disease 18%
Malaria 8%
Measles 4%
HIV/AIDS 3%
Poor nutrition is a factor in over half who die older than one month of age.
Over 80% of deaths occur in Africa and Southern Asia. India accounts for 21% of under-five deaths.
More than half are due to diseases that we could prevent or treat.
Resource: WHO report, September 2014
Tropical Countries
Countries in the tropics are near the Equator. They have hot and humid climates.
The tropics are also defined as regions without a cold season.
Many diseases in these countries are spread by an insect bite.
In the tropics, insects never hibernate. They are present in large numbers year round.
Other diseases here are spread by germs that multiply in warm water. The water in the tropics usually stays warm.
Tropical diseases occur in people who live in or travel to high-risk countries.
Climate change is a factor that has allowed these diseases to spread.
Preventing Mosquito Bites During Travel
Wear long pants, a long-sleeved short and a hat.
Avoid being outside when the bugs are most active. Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Limit your child's outdoor play at these times. The mosquito that transmits Zika is also active during the day.
Get rid of any standing water. Reason: it's where mosquitoes lay their eggs.
Keep bugs out of the home by fixing any broken screens.
If exposed to outside air, use bed nets to protect you during sleep.
To prevent mosquito bites, use insect repellents that have DEET. These products work well to protect you from bites. Read the label before using.
Preventing Bites - Use DEET on Skin and Permethrin on Clothing
DEET is a good mosquito repellent. It also repels ticks and other bugs.
The AAP approves DEET use for children more than 2 months old. Use 30% DEET or less. Use 30% DEET if you need 6 hours of protection. Use 10% DEET if you only need protection for 2 hours.
Don't put DEET on the hands if your child sucks their thumb or fingers. Reason: prevent DEET from being swallowed.
Warn older children who apply their own DEET to use less. A total of 3 or 4 drops can protect the whole body.
Put on exposed areas of skin. Do not use near eyes or mouth. Don't use on skin that is covered by clothing. Don't put DEET on sunburns or rashes. Reason: DEET can be easily absorbed in these areas.
Wash it off with soap and water when your child comes indoors.
Caution: DEET can harm clothing made of man-made fibers. It can also harm plastics (eye glasses) and leather. DEET can be used on cotton clothing.
Permethrin products can be applied to all types of clothing.
See Mosquito Bite care guide for more info on how to prevent bites.

Zika Virus Questions
What You Should Know About Zika Virus:
Zika is a viral disease spread by the bite of mosquitoes.
A major outbreak was reported in Brazil in May 2015. It then spread through the Americas and the Caribbean.
Zika Virus Symptoms:
80% of infections have no clinical symptoms.
Mild illness: 20% of infections. Symptoms include fever, pink rash, joint pains, headache, body aches and red eyes. These symptoms last 3 to 6 days and go away without any treatment. Severe symptoms are not common.
Birth Defects and Zika Virus:
A pregnant woman who gets a Zika infection can pass the virus to her baby. The baby may develop a severe birth defect called microcephaly. It causes babies to be born with a small head and brain damage. Eye defects have also been reported.
The risk of microcephaly is 1-5% depending on the time of pregnancy. The first 3 months of pregnancy carries the greatest risk of causing this birth defect.
Pregnant women who get Zika within 2 weeks of delivery can pass it to the newborn. The newborn will be ill, but not have birth defects.
Babies who get Zika from a bite have the same mild symptoms as others. They cannot develop microcephaly after they are born.
Cause:
Spread is usually from mosquito to human.
The virus is carried by an infected mosquito. The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a human infected with Zika. The virus is passed on to healthy humans in spit from a bite.
Pregnant women can pass the virus to their baby.
Breastfeeding: it is not passed in breastmilk. Continue to breastfeed (CDC).
Sexual intercourse: it can be transmitted through sex. If their partner is pregnant, males who have been in high-risk areas should use condoms. Use these until the baby is delivered. If a man or woman travels to a Zika risk area, use condoms. Avoid pregnancy for 8 weeks.
Time Period to Get Sick:
The time from the bite to symptoms is 3 days to 2 weeks.
Tests and Treatment:
Blood tests are needed to diagnose Zika virus.
When do you need to get a blood test? Any pregnant woman who has recently traveled to or lives in a high-risk area for Zika virus. See CDC website. Blood tests are mainly available at CDC and some state public health labs. If you need a blood test, talk to your obstetrician (OB doctor).
There are no anti-viral drugs for treating it. Treat the symptoms with increased fluids and pain medicine.
What to Expect:
If symptoms occur, they usually last less than 1 week.
How to Prevent:
Use insect repellents such as DEET.
Bed nets can help protect you at night during sleep.
There is no vaccine to prevent it.
Countries with Zika Virus:
Current outbreak South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. Also in isolated areas of Africa and Asia.
Until July 2016, mosquito transfer of Zika virus in the US did not occur. The disease only occurred in travelers coming back into the US. In 2016, there were more than 4,000 US cases associated with travel to high-risk countries.
In August 2016, a small outbreak transmitted by local mosquitoes began in Florida. Predictions are that it will eventually occur in several southern US states.
For up-to-date information and current high-risk areas, see the CDC website: Zika Virus.
