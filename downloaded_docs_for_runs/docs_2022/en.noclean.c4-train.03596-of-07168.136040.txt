ESSENTIAL OIL BLENDING CHART, to understand basic blending ratios.
Storage: ﻿Always keep tightly sealed in a cool, dark place. Heat, oxygen, and light degrade the product.
General Usage: ﻿We recommend doing a patch test before using an essential oil for the first time. Do not use essential oils on sensitive areas of the skin & keep away from eyes. If any negative reaction occurs, DO NOT RINSE WITH WATER, but rather dilute the area immediately by applying any vegetable oil /carrier oil (coconut, olive oil, etc) to the affected area.
Please avoid the use of essential oils with babies. Before using essential oils with children, ensure each oil is age appropriate and is used responsibly. Many authors have different opinions on this subject, so we suggest you research multiple sources.
General Precautions: Keep out of reach of children. Avoid contact with eyes. In general, when using essential oils, use caution when dealing with epilepsy & asthma. We highly recommend caution using essential oils during pregnancy. Avoid the use of essential oils in the first trimester.
Specific Oil Precautions: ﻿Can be sensitizing to skin if using old or oxidized oils. Low risk of phototoxicity. Maximum topical dilution: 4%. If applied to the skin above this dilution ration, avoid skin exposure to sunlight or tanning beds for 12 hours.
A side effect of grapefruit is that it may increase the potency of drugs or medications by blocking the actions of the enzymes that break down medications in the body. Does the essential oil interfere with the metabolism of medications as well? It's important to understand the chemistry behind this. Grapefruit juice contains considerable amounts of furanocoumarin derivatives (bergapten, bergamottin, and dihydroxybergamottin) and flavonoids which significantly interfere with enzymes that metabolize medications. Although Grapefruit essential oil contains bergapten, bergamottin, and epoxybergamottin (flavonoids are not present in the oil) they occur in very small amounts and are weak inhibitors of enzymes. It is therefore unlikely that grapefruit oil will interfere with these enzymes responsible for metabolizing medications, however it is worth noting & discussing with your healthcare practitioner if planning on using grapefruit regularly & for therapeutic purposes along with drugs/medications such as anesthetics, anti-epileptics, proton-pump inhibitors, immune modulators, blood sugar or diabetic medications, blood-pressure medications, antidepressants, antipsychotics, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, antihistamines, antibiotics, etc.
*Though we have provided the aforementioned precautions, they may not be comprehensive and therefore it is each individuals responsibility to research any oils they choose to use. Kolya Naturals ( owned and operated as part of Optimum Health Choices Inc. &/or Optimum Naturals Inc. ) is not responsible for any adverse reactions that may be experienced by using these essential oils.
