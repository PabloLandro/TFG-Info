Skin Tags
Skin tags are non-cancerous skin colored, tan or brown lesions usually raised above the skin surface. They are normally found where skin rubs with skin, like the neck, eyelids, armpits, groin and upper chest.
They can become irritating and even unpleasant to look at for some people but can easily be removed with a snipping or laser procedure.

FAQ’s – Skin Tag Removal
What are skin tags?
Skin tags are invariably benign – non cancerous – tumors of the skin which cause no symptoms.
Are skin tags caused by a virus or contagious?
No. Skin tags are not due to infections and can not be passed to other people.
Will removing a skin tag cause more to grow?
There is no evidence that removing skin tags will cause more to grow. You can develop new skin tags especially in areas repeatedly rubbed or scratched, as may happen with clothing, jewelry, or when shaving.
How should I treat a large skin tag?
Large skin tags should be treated in a medical office because the lesion may have a blood vessels at the center. This size skin tag could bleed profusely which can be cauterized or blocked off.
