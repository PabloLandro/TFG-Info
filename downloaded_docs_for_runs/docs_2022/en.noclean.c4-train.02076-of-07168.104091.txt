Himalayan Salt Lamps: Hippy-Dippy Woo Woo or Do They Really Work?

With the growing trend of natural healing in society, you have probably heard about or seen a Himalayan Salt Lamp. Unless you have been living under a rock, of course, no pun intended. They are popping up everywhere, including major department store retailers. With the growing fascination comes some fantastical and questionable claims associated with them.
What I haven‚Äôt questioned is that I actually feel better with them dispersed throughout my home. That would explain why I own ten‚Äîranging in size and weight from 5 to 100 pounds.
Himalayan Salt Lamps Provide More Than Just Beauty to Your Home
The pinkish-orange color all aglow and natural crystal shape is certainly aesthetically pleasing. They provide beauty to any home but they also afford us with so much more than just good looks‚Äîthe ability to improve our wellbeing.
If you are seeking to achieve the feeling of relaxation, Himalayan Salt Lamps provide soothing lighting that create a tranquil vibe. Their essence can certainly transform a room. Due to their calming color they are able to set the tone and change your mood (mood lighting).
For this reason salt lamps have been used as a form of color therapy by practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine to treat mental and stress disorders such as headaches (migraine) and insomnia.
According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology nutritionist Richard J. Wurtman, research has shown that individual colors influence respiration rates, blood pressure, along with biorhythms and brain activity. Due to these findings, color is used as a treatment for a wide-range of illness and disease.
What is a Himalayan Salt Lamp?
Genuine Himalayan Salt Lamps are hand chiseled solid blocks of crystallized salt. Inside the hollowed out middle is a small light bulb. The heat and light generated from the bulb are said to be necessary to receive the benefits from the lamp.
How do Himalayan Salt Lamps Work?
Himalayan salt lamps purify air through the power of hygroscopy, a claim which has scientific merit. This means that they attract water molecules from the surrounding environment, then absorb those molecules along with any foreign particles into the salt crystal. From the heat produced by the lightbulb, the same water then evaporates back into the air. The trapped particles such as dust, pollen, mold, mildew, pet dander, smoke, bacteria and viruses remain on the salt. They will not become airborne again.
Once a month it is a good idea to turn off your lamp. Let it cool and gently wipe it with a damp cloth to clean away trapped particles. Otherwise, leave your lamp on and let it work.
Himalayan Salt Lamps Reduce Electromagnetic Radiation
We are living in an electronic age. As such we are inundated with ‚Äòelectrosmog‚Äô generated by our large televisions, computers, cell phones, microwaves and other appliances.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that electronic smog is ‚Äúone of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences‚Äù and references the International Agency for Research on Cancer as classifying electromagnetic fields produced by cell phones as possibly carcinogenic to humans.
Constant and long-term electromagnetic (EM) radiation exposure can cause chronic fatigue, increased stress levels and decreases the body‚Äôs immune response.
Our homes are filled with positively charged ions. To reduce the potential danger from our electrical devices, we suggest close proximity placement of a Himalayan Salt Lamp to your electronic equipment.
Are Himalayan Salt Lamps New Age Nonsense or Beneficial to Health?
If you are considering purchasing a Himalayan Salt Lamp, I encourage you to seek out a trusted or verified retailer. There are many substitutes (fakes) on the market. These pseudo lamps will not provide the same benefits. You want pure, food grade Himalayan salt.
I also want to make it perfectly clear that Himalayan Salt Lamps are not New Age nonsense. There have been many claims to their usage in connection with health benefits. Some of the claims may have merit but these benefits still require research and scientific substantiated documentation as to their effectiveness.
Having said that, there is no disputing that buying multiple Himalayan salt lamps and placing them strategically within your dwelling is like bringing a bit of nature indoors.
You can relate this to the practice of Grounding/Earthing. You go outside to balance your being with that of Mother Nature. To absorb the negative ions of the Earth and release the build up of positive ions. The longer you stay outside, the better you feel.
The same principle applies with Himalayan Salt Lamps. If you are expecting miraculous and massive amounts of improvement to your well-being by the purchase of just one lamp placed obscurely that you seldom turn on, well then, sorry.
These lamps offer a limited amount of benefit and a limited range of emittance. So, the more you have in any one room, the better.
Until science catches up with supporting evidence, the full range of benefits remain to be seen. What we know for sure is that if nothing else, they provide a statement of beauty to any room and radiate a ubiquitous sense of peace.
So is it Hippy-Dippy Woo Woo or Not?
The best way to find out is to try it for yourself and see what they do for you. I love them but if you are not happy, you can send them my way.

I can understand that. Do you turn it off when you leave home? We haven‚Äôt had a problem with ours since they are low voltage.

When I first got it years ago, I was leaving it on‚Ä¶. Then I kinda became uncomfortable leaving it in all the time, so I started turning it on and off. Then Bc it wasn‚Äôt heating up as much, I thought it wasn‚Äôt getting the full benefit of the light. Eventually I stopped using it. Also, it‚Äôs invisible‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs not something that is tangible to really realize if there truly are benefits.

Just because science has yet to demonstrate its full range of benefits doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist. I think of it like Wi-Fi. It is invisible but it causes waves in the air, which have the effect of providing internet. Personally I think there is more going on at the molecular and atomic level with the salt lamps but we just don‚Äôt have the data to support it.

Exactly. Wifi we know works. After all, you and I are chatting. üòé
I didn‚Äôt even feel a difference in energy in the room. It didn‚Äôt feel clearer.. Or heavy. Anything. Ya know how you walk in a room and you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù. I never experienced anything different. Not that it‚Äôs supposed to but if I had. I would have used more effort.

It would be very helpful if you could/would share with me your thoughts on the best way to heal/treat COPD. I will be forced to do something I would consider radical because I have come to the place where I am always out of breath I consider anything that is mainstream Western medicine to be radical. I would appreciate any help you can give me on this

Teresa,
As our disclaimer states, we are not licensed medical doctors. If you have been diagnosed with COPD by a physician then you should follow your physician‚Äôs protocol. But, we are not opposed to trying alternatives such as the Himalayan salt lamp in conjunction with traditional medical care but not as a replacement for it.
We are sending you are love and light.
Blessings,
Kaylee and Kamaira

I never thought to purchase these. Perhaps a few for my Georgia house would be perfect for the staging effect, as I will be selling the house. (Gives me a reason to purchase and use later. )

Evelyn,
Some have more of an orange color. Some appear to have more of a pink shade.
Purchase according to personal preference. Whichever one you are drawn to, that makes the difference.

Kaylee

I love mine. My son and his girl friend gave it to me when I visited them in Santa Barbara. We had a wonderful evening in the Salt Caves meditating. Try visiting the Salt Caves on line, http://www.saltcavesb.com. You will recognize one of the pictures in this article. Yes, even the ceiling is filled with Himalayan Salt. Enjoy

This bollocks shows no benefits. There is no scientific evidence for it‚Äôs positive ions doing anything like clearing away ‚Äúelectric smog‚Äù. Electric smog? More like Electric Boogaloo to me! Also, this salt is from a mine in the Punjab region of Pakistan called the Khewra Salt Mine, 160 MILES AWAY FROM the Himalayas. So you aren‚Äôt even locationally accurate

Hi Odessa,
Thank you for your comment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), electronic smog is ‚Äúone of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences.‚Äù
There have been many claims to the health benefits of using Himalayan salt lamps. Some of the claims may have merit but these benefits still require research and scientific substantiated documentation as to their effectiveness.
The Punjab region of Pakistan is located rather close to the base of the Himalayan Mountains and since it is the closest significant natural landmark, I assume that is the origin of the name.
Sincerely,
Kamaira

I have 3 lamps, one in the bedroom, one in the living room and one in the kitchen. I never turn them off. My newest one in the kitchen is a bowl with chunks of salt in the bowl, it is beautiful. I love them and for me they are warm and soothing. I guess you have to believe they are doing what they‚Äùre supposed to be doing. Just enjoy them.
