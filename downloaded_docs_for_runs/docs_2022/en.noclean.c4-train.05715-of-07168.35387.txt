Hemorrhoids Affecting Your Life? These Tips Can Help You Reduce The Appearance Of Them
Posted byadmin February 19, 2019
Hemorrhoids is a painful condition caused by inflammation of veins in the anus. They can cause mild to severe discomfort, pain and in some cases infection. The subject of the causes, treatments and even general condition of hemorrhoids may be uncomfortable. Lack of understanding and proper treatment options leave the afflicted open to possibly worse conditions. Therefore, this information is important for you to consider and be informed of your conditions and how to go about treating it.
If you dislike the foods that are high in fiber, you can try a fiber supplement. There are many fiber supplements available to choose from. If you elect to go this route, you will need to consume eight glasses of water with these supplements. The fiber supplements will help to soften your stool.
If you have hemorrhoids, try to avoid lifting heavy objects. When you lift heavy objects, you are putting strain on your body. This is the equivalent of straining to have a bowel movement. Heavy lifting should be avoided at all costs when you have hemorrhoids. If you need heavy lifting done, consider asking someone for help.
You can reduce the amount of swelling and sharp, stinging pain by making and applying a sterilized ice pack or compress to the rectal and perineal areas. Wrap the compress in a thin, lint-free cloth to avoid additional irritation and apply it to the affected area for up to fifteen minutes at a time, as many times during the day as possible.
If you believe that you have hemorrhoids that aren’t going away with over the counter remedies, seek the advice of a doctor. Many treatments are now able to be performed in the office with minimal discomfort or needed follow up care. You can try an over the counter remedy first, but always follow up with your doctor.
You may get hemorrhoids just from heavy lifting. The stress it can produce on the entire body equals that experienced when you strain to move your bowels. If you get hemorrhoids regularly, avoid heavy lifting.
Do not use laxatives if you are constipated and have hemorrhoids. They were designed to assist with a singular bowel movement. If you have persistent problems moving your bowels, you should think about changing your diet, so it is easier for you to maintain regular bowel movements.
Eat foods high in fiber and drink lots of water to soften your stool. If your stool has been softened, there will be less strain during movements so that can help to stop hemorrhoids occurring. To get softer stool, try eating fruits such as papaya, watermelon, or grapes. If you want to add vegetables that do this then you might want to add in okra and cabbage as well. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to increase the effects.
Increasing the amount of fiber in your diet will work wonders with your hemorrhoids. The fiber will help you to avoid straining and constipation, which are primary factors in the development of hemorrhoids. Also, the high fiber diet will make your stool softer and easier to pass, reducing the pain associated with hemorrhoids. Some high fiber foods are fruits, vegetables, and bran.
To prevent hemorrhoids make sure you eat a high-fiber diet and drink plenty of water. Unnecessary strain when making a bowel movement is one of the leading causes of hemorrhoids. Including high-fiber foods in your diet will allow everything to pass along smoothly and prevent irritation to the intestinal walls and anus. Foods that are high in fiber include bran cereals, fruits and vegetables.
Don’t depend solely on some over the counter drugs such as laxatives. These are not a cure for constipation, and are meant to just be taken every once in awhile. Many times these types of drugs will help for one bowel movement, and then will end up leaving you more constipated after that.
If you have hemorrhoids, you will want to stay away from all spicy foods (chili, hot sauce). These types of foods are very irritating to any current hemorrhoids. It is also recommended to avoid coffee, beer, and all types of carbonated beverages. Until you are feeling better, the blander foods you can eat, the better off you will be.
Use petroleum jelly liberally. Applying petroleum jelly around your anus before you use the restroom can alleviate any pain you may experience from the passage of hard stools. It lubricates and soothes, saving you from experiencing pain and discomfort both during and after your restroom break by preventing inflammation of the hemorrhoids.
If you are experiencing pain and inflammation from your hemorrhoids, try to soak in a warm tub. Fill your tub with enough warm water to cover the area and lay back with your knees raised. The warm water will increase the blood flow to the anus and reduce the swelling. Do this a few times a day to help reduce the swelling.
The most effective way to prevent hemorrhoids is to make sure your stool is not hard. Having to push out hard stools will irritate your anus, and ultimately, cause hemorrhoids. Try to eat foods that contain a lot of fiber, such as vegetables, and purchase a stool softener if needed.
To reduce the swelling of a hemorrhoid, you may want to put an ice pack on the affected area. Not only will this reduce the swelling, it will also help to numb the area and reduce the amount of pain you are in. Leave the ice pack on the area for about 10 minutes.
Hemorrhoids can often get quite painful and easily disrupt your sleep, so a great way to alleviate this pain is to actually sleep on your stomach. This will ensure that no weight is on the buttocks and thus the swollen veins in your rectum will not become agitated or further inflamed from tossing and turning.
While hemorrhoids may be a common condition it is important that they be taken seriously. The very positioning of the swollen veins lends to issues with both treatment options and possible complications. Still, hemorrhoids can be addressed if you take the time to educate yourself fully on the condition.
