Fish oil is the oil or fat extracted from the tissue of a fish and is mostly obtained from tuna, herring, mackerel, and anchovies. The WHO recommends consuming at least 1 to 2 portions of fish oil supplements in a week because of their health benefits. Among the dietary supplements, fish oil is the most consumed one as it is very important for your health, especially if you have a heart disease.

These diseases can be caused due to many factors, and the best way to avoid them is by improving your diet. Including fish oil supplements in your diet can have the following benefits for your heart health:
Fish oil supplements can increase the level of good cholesterol (HDL) in the body and reduce the level of bad cholesterol (LDL). LDL is responsible for causing many types of heart diseases.
It also helps control blood pressure, though at a very gradual pace. It has an effect on regulating it.
Brain Health
Omega-3 fatty acid, which is found in fish oil supplements, has been found to cure mental problems such as ADHD and other developmental problems. According to research, children aged between 6 and 12 years and suffering from ADHD showed no improvements with the standard treatments for this condition. However, children who were given fish oil supplements were found to benefit greatly, and there were reduced symptoms of aggressiveness and restlessness in them. Fish oil supplements have also found to improve behavior and mental problems in children with ADHD.
Many people also suffer from omega-3 fatty acid deficiency which can cause serious health issues by increasing the risk of hypertension, heart stroke, depression, arthritis, joint pain, and skin diseases such as eczema, which can all be solved with fish oil.

Obesity can increase the risk of other diseases, and it is necessary to overcome this problem. Fish oil supplements can improve the body’s metabolism and composition and decrease the risk of other problems that are caused by obesity. If you are on a diet and thinking to lose weight, you must include fish oil supplements in your diet as it will help your body get in shape in a gradual and effective manner. Some studies also proved that the intake of omega-3 fatty acid reduces the waist-to-hip ratio and the waist circumference.
