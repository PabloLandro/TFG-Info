Are there health benefits?
Can you get ginger naturally from foods?
What are the risks?
Ginger grows in China, India, Africa, the Caribbean, and other warm climates. The root of the ginger plant is well known as a spice and flavoring. It's been a traditional remedy in many cultures for thousands of years.
Are there health benefits?
Ginger is a common folk treatment for upset stomach and nausea. There's evidence that it helps.
Ginger seems to aid digestion and saliva flow. Studies found that taking ginger could reduce nausea and vomiting in some pregnant women.
But pregnant women should be careful with ginger. Some experts worry that it could raise the risk of miscarriage, especially in high doses. It is not considered dangerous in less than 1500 mg, but check with your doctor.
Ginger seems to help with nausea caused by vertigo as well. There's mixed evidence about whether ginger helps with nausea caused by motion sickness, surgery, or chemotherapy.
Ginger does seem to help with painful periods. In one study, more than 60% of women felt that ginger lessened pain.
There's strong evidence that ginger may ease osteoarthritis pain. It may also help with:
Rheumatoid arthritis
Muscle and joint pain
Headache
But more research is needed to know for sure.
Lab and animal studies have found that ginger may, theoretically:
Lessen swelling
Lower blood sugar
Lower cholesterol
Protect against Alzheimer's disease
Prevent blood clotting
Clinical evidence shows evidence that ginger may be helpful in lowering blood sugar and blood pressure.
Some people apply ginger compresses to the skin for pain. We don't know if this works or not.
Optimal doses of ginger have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it very hard to set a standard dose. Ask your doctor for advice.
Can you get ginger naturally from foods?
Ginger is a common spice and added flavoring. Many people drink ginger teas or soft drinks.
What are the risks?
Side effects. In small doses, ginger has few side effects. High doses of ginger -- more than 5 grams a day -- increases the chances of side effects. Ginger on the skin may cause a rash. Consumption may cause:
Gas
Heartburn
Upset stomach
Mouth irritation
Continued
High doses of ginger -- more than 5 grams a day -- increase the chances of side effects. Ginger on the skin may cause a rash.
Risks. Ginger may raise the risk of bleeding. If you have a bleeding disorder, it may not be safe. Always tell your doctor about herbal medicines you take, including ginger
Interactions. If you take any medications regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using ginger supplements. They could interact with blood thinners and medications for diabetes and high blood pressure.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does regulate dietary supplements; however, it treats them like foods rather than medications. Unlike drug manufacturers, the makers of supplements don’t have to show their products are safe or effective before selling them on the market.
