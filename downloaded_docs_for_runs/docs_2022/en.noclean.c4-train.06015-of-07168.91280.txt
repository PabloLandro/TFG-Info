What is preconception, and why is that time important?
Preconception is the time in a woman’s life when she is not actively trying to prevent pregnancy. It’s important because it means a woman should take the steps toward living a healthy lifestyle before becoming pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Most of the time, when a woman becomes pregnant, she doesn’t know until she misses her next period, according to the CDC. So, choosing healthy lifestyle choices long before finding out she’s pregnant is the best for the baby’s growth and development.
Talk to your doctor for more information about preconception.

How can a couple prepare for conception?
Preconception health is different for everyone because each person has individual needs. Every couple, however, can prepare by choosing to live well, make healthy choices, feel positive about their life and be encouraging and supportive of each other, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The CDC describes preconception health as “a precious gift to babies,” and explains that by choosing to strive for a healthy weight, stop smoking, decrease stress, take the right vitamins and sleep well, couples are choosing to provide a healthy start to life for their babies.
A few ways the CDC recommends preparing for pregnancy include:
Avoid stressful and abusive environments
Care for current medical conditions and get them under control
Check with your doctor about the safety of any medications you take
Eat a healthy diet
Get mentally healthy so you can feel positive about your life
Get up-to-date on vaccinations
Learn your family health history
Quit smoking
Stop drinking alcohol
Take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily for at least a month before pregnancy to help with the baby’s brain and spine growth
Work toward and maintain a healthy weight
For more information about how couples can prepare for conception, talk with your doctor.

How do weight and age play into preconception?
Weight and age are important factors in preconception. Being overweight and being underweight both can cause ovulation problems. Maintaining a healthy weight helps improve your chances of getting pregnant and helps women to better manage weight gain while they are pregnant, according to WomensHealth.gov .
Age also plays an important role in preconception health, according to the National Institutes of Health . Becoming pregnant while still a teenager often causes the mother to develop high blood pressure and anemia (a lack of healthy red blood cells). There is also a higher risk of low birth weight and early labor.
Becoming pregnant for the first time after age 35 also increases pregnancy risks, according to WomensHealth.gov, including:
A cesarean delivery instead of a natural birth
Complications during delivery, including excessive bleeding during labor
Genetic disorders in the infant, such as Down syndrome
Labor that does not progress like it should
Long labor, lasting more than 20 hours
It is important to plan a visit with your doctor to talk about how your weight and your age could affect your pregnancy. Preconception is the best time to have this conversation so your doctor can help you prepare yourself to help your baby grow and develop in a healthy way during pregnancy.
Talk to your doctor also for more information the role of age and weight in preconception.

How important is it for a pregnant woman to get the flu vaccination?
It is very important for pregnant women to get the flu vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The flu is a serious illness, and it can cause serious problems to pregnant women, putting them at higher risk of hospitalization and even death, according to the CDC.
Getting such a severe illness while you’re pregnant also can be dangerous to your unborn baby, increasing the risk of premature labor and delivery, according to the CDC.
Getting a flu shot is the best protection for both you and your baby, according to the CDC. The flu shot causes your baby to make antibodies to help fight the flu. Those antibodies are passed on to your baby.
The antibodies a pregnant mother passes on to her unborn baby will help protect the baby for up to six months after the baby is born, according to the CDC. This is important because babies cannot get their own flu shots until they are 6 months old.
For more information about the importance of pregnant women getting flu shots, talk with your doctor.

What are ways a pregnant woman can care for herself if she does get the flu?
If you are pregnant and have flu-like symptoms, it’s important to call your doctor’s office right away, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The symptoms of the flu, especially a fever, can be dangerous to your growing baby.
In addition to calling your doctor, the CDC and U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommend the following:
Covering yourself with a blanket to help with chills
Drinking plenty of fluids, including broth, water, and sports drinks
Gargling with warm, salty water to help a sore throat
Getting a lot of rest
Putting cool wet washcloths on your forehead, arms, and legs to help ease fevers
Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) to lower your fever
Using a humidifier to make it easier to breathe
On a case-by-case basis, doctors can sometimes prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat the flu, according to the HHS.
The CDC and the HHS also advice pregnant women with the flu to call 911 right away to get emergency medical care if they have any of the following symptoms:
Breathing problems, shortness of breath
Chest or abdomen pain or pressure
Confusion
Decreased or no baby movement
High fever
Sudden dizziness
Vomiting that is severe or ongoing
Talk to your doctor to learn more about what to do if you are pregnant and have the flu.

When during pregnancy is a woman tested for gestational diabetes? How is the testing done?
All pregnant women are checked for gestational diabetes, according to The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
The screening is usually done between 24 weeks and 28 weeks of pregnancy but is sometimes done earlier for women who have risk factors that increase the chances of having gestational diabetes, according to ACOG.
The screening involves a couple of steps, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
First, you drink a sugary drink. An hour later, you have your blood drawn to check your blood sugar level. You do not need to fast for this test, and it can be done any time of day, according to the NIH.
If the level is higher than normal, you might have to have another, for which you will have to fast for at least eight hours before the test, according to the NIH.
Your blood sugar level will be checked before you start, then you will drink a sugary drink, according to the NIH. Your blood sugar will be checked again after one hour, two hours and maybe three hours to determine if your levels are again too high.
Talk to your doctor for more information about gestational diabetes screenings.

Who is at risk for developing gestational diabetes?
A variety of factors can increase your risk of having gestational diabetes, according to The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
You are more likely, according to ACOG, to develop gestational diabetes if you have the following risk factors:
close relative with diabetes
ethnicity – African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, Latina, or Pacific Islander
older than 25
overweight
polycystic ovary syndrome
prediabetes
previous gestational diabetes
previous stillbirth
very large baby

How does gestational diabetes affect your pregnancy?
If you have gestational diabetes and don’t treat it, it can be harmful to both you and your growing baby, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA).
Having gestational diabetes causes the pancreas to work extra hard to make insulin, but that insulin still doesn’t lower blood sugar levels the way it should, according to the ADA.
The extra blood sugar travels through the placenta and gives the baby high blood sugar, which makes the baby’s pancreas create too much insulin also, according to the ADA. The extra insulin makes the baby grow extra fat – a condition called macrosomia.
Macrosomia can cause health problems for the baby, including shoulder damage during birth, jaundice, low blood sugar at birth, breathing problems and increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, according to the ADA.
Having gestational diabetes also can affect you, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), by increasing your chances of:
cesarean delivery
depression
preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in your urine)
type 2 diabetes
Talk to your doctor for more information about how gestational diabetes affects your pregnancy.

How is gestational diabetes treated?
Treating gestational diabetes means working to keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range, according to National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Your doctor will help you to set the right range for you and can teach you to maintain it, according to the NIH, by
being physically active
eating right
taking insulin shots or other medication
Knowing what foods to eat, how much to each, and when to eat are all very important to controlling your blood sugar level, according to NIH.

What is CenteringPregnancy®?
Certified Nurse Midwife Jalana Lazar discusses what CenteringPregnancy is. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What is CenteringPregnancy?
Centering pregnancy is a group prenatal care program, so it's a different way of offering prenatal care to women.I think centering pregnancy fulfills a lot of different needs. One is that this group model of prenatal care allows women to form relationships with one another. Centering pregnancy is a group of women, usually 8 to 10 women, sometimes a few or sometimes more, but ideally a group of 8 to 10 women who have the same approximate due date within a month. They're going through all the parts of their pregnancy together, and that really gives them a social support that they might be lacking in other parts of their lives. It also means that they're getting the same information to make good choices in their pregnancy and healthy choices in their pregnancy, and as I mentioned before, we do have good research that centering pregnancy can help prevent prematurity, and that it increases patient satisfaction with prenatal care, and thus also their attendance to prenatal care.
CenteringPregnancy is prenatal care group approach that provides health assessments, interactive learning and community buildingfor mothers-to-be, according to the Ohio Department of Health (ODH).
Patients meet as a group throughout their pregnancy. Having others in the group to lean on who are having similar experiences can help pregnant women feel more comfortable, motivated, and empowered during pregnancy and after the baby’s birth, according to the ODH.
Talk to your doctor for more information about CenteringPregnancy.

What is the goal of CenteringPregnancy?
Certified Nurse Midwife Jalana Lazar discusses the goal of CenteringPregnancy. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What is the goal of CenteringPregnancy?
The goal of centering pregnancy is to offer prenatal care to women in a way that combines some of the routine physical assessment that you get in a standard prenatal care appointment with self-care and also a group component that builds relationships and also includes an educational component, teaching, where women learn from each other in a facilitated discussion.
The goal of CenteringPregnancy is to promote healthy behaviors for pregnant women during their pregnancy and after the birth of their child, according to the Ohio Department of Health (ODH).
CenteringPregnancy uses a group approach to provide health care, education, and support – including child care, snacks, and transportation. CenteringPregnancy provides a safe place for moms-to-be to share their feelings and questions with other women having similar experiences, according to the ODH.
The group setting helps the women build positive peer relationships, which encourages healthy choices while they are pregnant and provide support after birth, according to the ODH.
By promoting healthy behaviors during pregnancy and after birth, the ODH says that CenteringPregnancy strives to help:
Decrease the frequency of premature births
Increase birth weight
Improve patient and health care provider satisfaction

What are the benefits of CenteringPregnancy?
There are so many benefits to centering pregnancy, it's hard to focus on just a few. There have been some documented research benefits to centering pregnancy. Most importantly, patients report a higher degree of satisfaction with their prenatal care when they are in a centering pregnancy model, and we have also documented that there's a reduction in preterm birth to women who participate in the centering pregnancy model. It's about a 33 percent reduction in pre-term birth, which is really significant, especially given the impact that that can have on infant mortality statistics.
CenteringPregnancy has a variety of benefits. It is important because it provides a safe place for pregnant women to share their experiences with and relate to other women with similar experiences, according to the Ohio Department of Health (ODH).
The group health care setting can help provide positive peer encouragement and promotes health choices during pregnancy, according to the ODH.
Those healthy choices help achieve positive pregnancy goals among CenteringPregnancy patients, according to Premier Physician Network’ physicians, including a decrease the frequency of premature births and improved patient satisfaction with their prenatal care.

What makes a woman a good candidate for a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)?
Dr. Stephen Guy discusses what makes a woman a good candidate for a VBAC. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What makes a woman a good candidate for a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)?
A good candidate for a VBAC is someone who's has had one previous c-section. We can do a VBAC if they've had two c-sections, but nothing more than that. It's important that the previous cesarean section has been what we call a transverse incision on the uterus. It doesn't really matter which way the incision is made on the abdomen, but it's really what it was like on the uterus. The chance of uterine rupture is much less for the transverse incision than the vertical incision on the uterus.
The other person that would be a really good candidate for VBAC would be someone that has had, maybe, they had a c-section for breech, or they had a c-section for fetal distress. Something that would not repeat itself again in another pregnancy. I think those would the best candidates for VBAC.
A good candidate for a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) has had no more than two prior cesareans, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
It’s also important that a woman choosing a VBAC only has a low transverse incision below the navel (side-to-side) because they are at less risk of developing a ruptured uterus compared to a vertical (up and down) incisions, according to the ACOG.
Premier Health Specialists' (PPN) physicians say good candidates also would include people who had a C-section because their baby was breech or for fetal distress.
For more information about who makes a good candidate for VBAC, talk to your doctor.

What factors should be considered when making the decision to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)?
Dr. Stephen Guy discusses what factors a woman should consider when deciding whether to have a VBAC. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What factors should be considered when making the decision to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)?
Important factors to consider for VBAC would be that not more that two previous cesarean sections, that both the c-sections had had a low transverse incision in the uterus, and hopefully a situation where it's not a repeating indication for a c-section.
When deciding whether a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is right for them, women should consider a variety of factors.
Some factors that are more likely to make a VBAC successful, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Premier Health Specialists’ (PPN) physicians, include:
A previous successful vaginal delivery
No more than two previous cesareans
Not overdue for birth
Not considering induction
Transverse (side-to-side), not vertical, incision from a previous C-section

What factors might increase or decrease a woman’s ability to have a successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)?
Dr. Stephen Guy discusses which factors might increase or decrease a woman’s ability to have a successful VBAC. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What factors might increase or decrease a woman’s ability to have a successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)?
The factors that might increase the success of VBAC would be a mom who's already had a Vaginal delivery. Many moms might have a vaginal delivery and for whatever reason have a c-section on their second or third baby. If they've already had a successful vaginal delivery, their success for VBAC is going to be greater than someone who's never had a vaginal delivery. If there's a non-repeating indication, again, that if the first baby was breech, now this baby is head down, she's probably a good candidate for a VBAC.
It's also there are some variables that are related to a patient's age. The older we are, the less likely success. If you actually had a previous labor where you stopped dilating, or your baby stopped descending, then that decreases the chance of success. Maternal weight could have an indicator too that might decrease. The heavier you are, the more difficult it might be to have a successful VBAC.
A variety of factors can affect whether a woman is more or less likely to have a successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
Some of the factors, according to the ACOG and Premier Physician Network' (PPN) physicians, include:
Age of the mother – Younger mothers are at less risk of complications during a VBAC
Conditions of previous labor – A woman who had a prior labor that stopped dilating or had a baby stop descending has a decreased chance of a successful VBAC.
Maternal weight – The more a mother weighs, the more difficult a VBAC can be to complete.
A normal size baby – This will increase the likelihood of a successful VBAC, whereas a large baby might require a C-section.
A baby that is already head down – Having a baby facing the correct way will create less risk of VBAC complications.

What is placenta previa?
Dr. Bachman discusses placenta previa. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What is placenta previa?
Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta implants very low in the uterus and often covers, either partially or entirely, the cervix or the opening from the uterus to the outside.
Placenta previa can be a serious condition. It's important to let the patient know that they have a previa so that they're aware of things that they want to avoid. In particular, you put them on pelvic rest, limit the amount of physical activity. We don't want to put anybody on bedrest 'cause that can increase the risk for blood clot but just to be smart in terms of their activity and maybe modify the type of physical activities that they do to kind of decrease any stress in the cervical region or where that placenta is. The majority of placenta previas will resolve by the end of third trimester so it may make somebody a little anxious at the beginning to know that and when we're talking about restrictions, they get little uncomfortable thinking that there's a problem when in many cases, it turns out not to be a problem. But the biggest concern with this condition is the amount of bleeding that somebody could present with if that placenta starts to separate from the cervix.
Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta implants itself low in the uterus and either partially or completely covers the cervix, according to the American Pregnancy Association (APA).
Placenta previa affects about 1 in every 200 pregnant women, according to the APA.
With the placenta covering all or part of the cervix, a vaginal delivery can cause severe bleeding, so almost all women with placenta previa need a C-section, according to the National Institutes of Health [Link to http://nih.gov/ in a new window with off site icon and 3rd party content disclaimer] (NIH). Talk to your doctor for more information about placenta previa.

What puts a woman at increased risk for placenta previa?
Dr. Bachman discusses increased risk of placenta previa. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What puts a woman at increased risk for placenta previa?
There are multiple risk factors for placenta previa. There's a whole list of them, probably at least 10, but the most common ones are the more pregnancies you have, each subsequent pregnancy, you're at greater risk for placenta previa. If you've had prior uterine surgery, so women who've had a prior C-section, anybody who's had prior surgery to remove a fibroid, anything that interrupts or disrupts the endometrial lining. Women who've had recurrent miscarriages, even spontaneous losses, they're at increased risk for placenta previa. In today's day and age, with technology and advanced reproductive, or assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF, we are seeing increased risk of placenta previa in those pregnancies as well. Smoking is a huge risk factor for placenta previa, as well as cocaine use. I think those are probably the major risk factors or the major conditions we see associated with a risk for placenta previa.
Though there are a variety of risk factors that can increase a woman’s risk for placenta previa.
According to Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the following things can increase a woman’s risk for developing placenta previa:
Abnormally shaped uterus
In vitro fertilization
Pregnancy at an older age
Pregnancy with multiple children, such as twins or triplets
Prior miscarriages
Prior pregnancies
Prior uterine surgery, including C-section
Smoking
Use of cocaine
Placenta previa affects about 1 in every 200 pregnant women, according to the NIH.

What are the symptoms of placenta previa?
Dr. Bachman discusses symptoms of placenta previa. Click play to watch the video or read the transcript.
What are the symptoms of placenta previa?
Symptoms of placenta previa are typically bleeding, usually in the second and third trimester. Most women won't know they have a previa. It's found incidentally when they have their second trimester ultrasound. Typically, women will have a routine anatomy scan around 18 to 20 weeks, average is about 20 weeks. Often time, the placenta previa's diagnosed at that time. They notice the placenta's implanting lower by the cervix or covering the cervix. But the good news, the majority of those will become, or move out-of-the-way by late in the third trimester. So just because it's diagnosed incidentally on the ultrasound doesn't mean it's going to be there at the time of delivery. But most women will present, in terms of symptoms, will present second or third trimester with bleeding. Usually it's painless bleeding but bleeding itself from a previa will cause contractions, and so some women may present with contraction pain and possibly signs of preterm labor when in fact, it's actually a previa.
The most common symptom of placenta previa is sudden bleeding from the vagina, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Bleeding typically starts near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester, according to the NIH.
Some women also have cramps with this condition.
Bleeding from placenta previa can be severe and can be life threatening to both the baby and the mother, according to the NIH. Though the bleeding can stop on its own, it can also start again days or weeks later.
For some women, labor starts within days of the bleeding. Other women don’t bleed until after labor starts, according to the NIH.

What are the symptoms of a hernia following a C-section?
Though hernias after a C-section aren’t common, when they do happen it is because an organ or tissue bulges through the muscles that weakened when they were split vertically during the surgery, according to Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians.
The most common symptom of a hernia after a C-section is pain, and sometimes you’ll notice a small bulge in your abdomen.
However, other women have no symptoms, and the hernia is found during a medical exam or procedure.
For more information about symptoms of a hernia after a C-section, talk with your doctor.

What puts women at higher risk for getting a hernia after a C-section?
With most C-sections, the incision is on the lower abdomen and is made horizontally.
However, once inside, surgeons split the muscles vertically to get the baby out, according to Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians.
A hernia happens when part of an organ or internal tissue create a bulge though a weak area of muscle. It is usually in the abdomen. Though hernias after a C-section aren’t common, when they do happen it is because an organ or tissue bulges through the muscles that weakened when they were split during the surgery.

What is the hCG hormone, and what role does it play in testing for pregnancy?
hCG is a hormone made by the placenta when you’re pregnant. It starts to be made just after the embryo attaches to the uterine wall, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
When you’re pregnant, the hCG hormone increases very quickly. It typically doubles every 72 hours until it reaches its peak between eight and 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to the American Pregnancy Association (APA).
hCG levels are what register positive or negative on a pregnancy test – both with an at-home urine test and a blood test.
For more information about hCG and how it affects pregnancy tests, talk with your doctor.

What is the difference between a urine test and a blood test when testing for pregnancy?
At home, you can test for pregnancy using a urine stream or urine dip test stick. You have to read and follow the directions carefully for accurate results.
The test can detect levels of hCG in your body through your urine. It’s most accurate testing with your first morning urine, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
With a blood test for pregnancy, your hCG levels are measured to help determine exactly how old your fetus is.
Repeat blood tests can be done a couple days apart to see if your hCG numbers are increasing at the rate they should be or if intervention can help the pregnancy.

When should a woman be tested by her physician for pregnancy?
If you have missed your period and feel like you might be pregnant, but your home pregnancy test says otherwise, it’s time to visit your doctor for a follow up test. Your doctor can do a blood test that can be more accurate than a home test, and the results of the office test can shed some light on the home-test results, according to Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians.

How soon after giving birth can a woman become pregnant?
Many women believe they can’t get pregnant again shortly after giving birth, but that’s not the case, Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians say.
You can get pregnant again as soon as you ovulate, which for some women can be as soon as five weeks after childbirth.

How long should a woman wait before conceiving after giving birth?
Though women can get pregnant within a few weeks after giving birth, getting pregnant again that soon should not be a goal.
It’s recommended that you wait at least 12 months after giving birth to become pregnant again, according to Office of Women’s Health (HMS).
This waiting period gives your body the time it needs to fully recover from the birth of your baby and to prepare for another pregnancy.

But, this is a misconception. Though it’s often less likely for some women to conceive while breastfeeding, it is possible, according to Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians.
Some of us won’t ovulate or menstruate while we’re breastfeeding, but others will.
The best plan of action to avoid getting pregnant again sooner than your body might be ready is to practice safe sex. Because some kinds of birth control medication aren’t safe while you’re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor to decide what kind of birth control method is best for you.
For more information about conceiving while breastfeeding, talk with your doctor.
