Marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug in Australia. Now a doctor is using a combination of three medicines to help addicts regain their lives.
According to recent figures, Australia is in the grip of a marijuana epidemic. While it is often considered a 'harmless' drug, marijuana addiction can have disastrous consequences.
More than 5.5 million people aged14 and over have smoked dope in their lives. And 1.8 million Australians, the same number of people as the population of Brisbane, have smoked in the past year - some as young as 12.
Julia Norcott was a marijuana addict, lighting up a joint every day.
"The more you have, the more you want," Julia said. "It's habit forming and it becomes part of your lifestyle."
The qualified nurse first tried marijuana in her late teens and became hooked on the drug in her 20s. As a medical professional, she should have known better, but could not shake it.
A $20 per day habit quickly became $50, then $100 eventually she lost everything: house, car, job. It seemed there was no way out of the mess.
"I think marijuana for the long term chronic user can be very similar to someone that is a heroin addict," Julia said.
Dr Jon Currie is the only neurologist in Australia specialising in drug and alcohol addiction. He has come up with an Australian first treatment for marijuana addiction and says it is working.
"We treat this as a medical problem," Dr Currie said. "You have diabetes, you have asthma, you have an addiction."
Dr Currie first formulated his radical ideas in Israel. In 1997, he accompanied Today Tonight to investigate a radical Israeli heroin treatment using rapid detox and the drug naltrexone, a drug that blocked the terrible effects of heroin.
Back in Australia, Dr Jon Currie found the same addictive problems with marijuana and the same problem with quitting.
"There's a physical addiction and people who try to stop get irritable, angry, depressed, aggressive," he said. "And they might want to punch people, walls, wives, bosses."
"So most people who try to stop find it very, very difficult."
Dr Currie's solution combines three drugs normally used to treat other diseases.
"One of the drugs is used for craving to stop alcohol," he said. "One of the drugs is an antidepressant and the other is a very clever use of a drug that is normally used for epilepsy."
Julia is one of 300 dope addicts now using this special treatment. So far, 200 have gone clean and stayed clean after six months.
"I can say it's actually changed my life," Julia said. "The quality of life for me has improved incredibly."
The treatment was said to cost $5 per day.
"By the time you finish, it's about $250 for the cost of the medicines," Dr Currie explained.
By comparison, addicts could spend about $300 per week on marijuana.
The government is currently funding Dr Currie's research, making the tablets free for people who want to kick marijuana.
But today, 300,000 Australians will light up, equivalent to the population of Hobart or Canberra. Many do not realise they are addicted.
Dr Currie said he would not be able to cure everyone.
"No, there is always going to be a proportion of people who will want to smoke, who will want to use drugs, or for whom it is just tooo difficult," Dr Currie said.
"The aim is to get 80 per cent of people able to stop, 20 per cent of people with a problem that we can then help in other ways."

Interesting, it shows that mental addiction can be as troublesome as physical addiction. Norcott said it right when she said it becomes part of your lifestyle and the more you have the more you want. SWIM can vouch for that as well. Although i would say that most people have the will power to take care of their other responsiblities before pot.

When swim went to rehab, he learn that by changing portions of his lifestyle, he learn how to deal with life without dope.
But, to spend that kind of money daily just on weed is a bit too much. Must be some good stuff.

For SWIM weed balances him out. When he doesnt smoke during a day, he has much restless energy and usually ends up doing something stupid ot get himself into trouble, looking to fill his boredom. But when he smokes pot at some point during the day, he is friendlier to everyone, in an overall better mood, and doesnt have urges to do other things that would get him into legal trouble.
Staying out of jail is worth the ~$45 a day SWIM spends on weed. Its actually better for the good of the community that SWIM smokes everyday.
IHrtHalucingens, Jun 9, 2006
Swim smokes everyday, she gets shitty when she has been smoking then stops suddenly, it disappears in three days thou. iTs just one of those thing swim wants in her life. I can agree that it has a hold over swia slightly other things she does its always something she can go back to.

SWIM has met a lot of people like this. In his experience some of them honestly were too violent, reckless, or unpredictable before they started smoking, and in both SWIM's perspective and their own words weed works better for them than other antidepressants (which carry their own battery of side effects, many of which could be more deleterious than pot). SWIM thought this was an interesting article, and realizes that while marijuana can be addictive, he is worried that once pharmaceutical companies get a hold of this therapy, they're going to make a real push to get pot smokers on these "acceptable" substitutes and therapies, in the guise of human interest, but in reality for their own profit margins.

it's been proven countless times that marijuana is NOT physically addictive! it is MENTALLY addictive, the lifestyle and habit are addictive not the drug itself. no fancy pills can cure that kind of addiction, not even if they're pure thc.

$300 dollars bit excess thou, swim can make an 8th last 3-4 days. jeez and swia was worried about cancer... feel kinda silly now
Alicia, Jun 9, 2006
@ forthesevenlakes- Thats exaclty the way SWIM is. He has been prescribed many ssri's and such with no positive effects, they made him feel worse than before taking them. Pot has never failed to calm him down and make him a better part of society.
@Senor Gribson- Withdrawals from marijuana have been noted in cases. However they are very mild and are often symptoms of other everyday happenings. anything that physically changes your brain/bodily chemistry is going to have some sort of reprecusion. Although I do agree the mental addiction and the lifestyle created is much harder to overcome than the physical apsect, but it is there, no matter how insignificant.

Here's something SWIM found on another forum which seems pertinent to this discussion;
http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p020261.html
Does Marijuana Withdrawal Syndrome Exist?
The question of whether a clinically significant marijuana (cannabis) withdrawal syndrome exists remains controversial. In spite of the mounting clinical and preclinical evidence suggesting that such a syndrome exists (Beardsley et al., 1986; Budney et al., 2001; Holson et al., 1989; Huestis et al., 2001), the DSM-IV does not include marijuana withdrawal as a diagnostic category. The clinical syndrome has been characterized by restlessness, anorexia, irritability and insomnia that begin less than 24 hours after discontinuation of marijuana, peak in intensity on days 2 to 4, and last for seven to 10 days (Budney et al., 1999; Haney et al., 1999; Mendelson et al., 1984).
The question of whether this syndrome is clinically significant is important, not only because marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States (Johnston et al., 2001), but also because marijuana has been shown to produce dependence at rates comparable to other drugs of abuse (Kandel et al., 1997; Kessler et al., 1994) and because relapse rates among individuals seeking treatment for marijuana dependence are similar to those with other drugs of abuse (Budney et al., 1998; Stephens et al., 1993). Furthermore, many violent crimes are committed by individuals undergoing withdrawal from drugs of abuse, including marijuana (Kouri et al., 1997; Peters and Kearns, 1992). If a clinically significant marijuana withdrawal syndrome does exist, the omission of this syndrome from the DSM-IV might contribute to the perception that behavioral or pharmacological treatment regimens for marijuana dependence are not necessary.
We conducted two studies in our laboratory to determine whether abstinence from marijuana after long-term use results in withdrawal symptoms, to identify those symptoms and to quantify their severity (Kouri and Pope, 2000; Kouri et al., 1999). The first study focused specifically on whether abrupt discontinuation of marijuana following chronic use results in changes in aggressive behavior (Kouri et al., 1999). To measure aggressive behavior, we used the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). This computer test has been used to detect changes in aggressive responses following acute administration of a number of drugs, and its external validity has been demonstrated in a number of studies of male and female parolees with histories of violent behavior (Cherek and Lane, 1999; Cherek et al., 1996).
Subjects in our study were long-term heavy users of marijuana who reported a history of at least 5,000 separate episodes of marijuana use in their lifetime (the equivalent to smoking once per day for 13.7 years), were smoking at least once daily at the time of recruitment and met DSM-IV criteria for marijuana dependence without meeting criteria for a current Axis I disorder. Subjects were excluded if they reported that they had used another class of drugs more than 100 times in their lifetimes or had consumed more than five alcoholic drinks per day continuously for one month or more in their lifetimes.
The controls were composed of two groups: 1) individuals who had not smoked marijuana more than 50 times in their lives and had not smoked more than once per month in the last year and 2) individuals who had formerly smoked marijuana on a daily basis but who had not smoked more than once per week during the last three months. The rationale for using infrequent or former smokers rather than marijuana-naive subjects as controls was to minimize possible confounding variables that might differentiate individuals who had never tried marijuana from those who had. We based this decision on data from our laboratory demonstrating that heavy marijuana users do not differ from occasional users in a wide range of demographic and psychiatric measures (Kouri et al., 1995).
During the study, subjects were required to abstain from smoking marijuana and using any other drugs for 28 consecutive days. To verify abstinence, subjects had to come to the laboratory every day to provide supervised urine samples that we analyzed quantitatively for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolites. We measured aggressive responses with the PSAP on study days 0 (before abstinence), 1 (after 24 hours of abstinence), 3, 7 and 28.
Subjects were told they would be playing a computer game against an anonymous same-sex subject from the study. In fact, however, this second subject was actually a computer. During the course of each 20-minute computer session, subjects had the option of pressing one of two buttons on the PSAP response panel (labeled "A" or "B"). Pressing button A resulted in the accumulation of points that were exchanged for money at the end of the study. Pressing this button was defined as a non-aggressive response. By pressing button B, subjects could subtract points from the fictitious opponent. Points taken from the opponent, however, were not added to the subject's counter, and pressing button B was defined as an aggressive response. Aggressive responding was provoked by random subtractions of the subject's points, which were attributed to the fictitious opponent.
On study day 0 (before marijuana abstinence) and study day 1 (24 hours of marijuana abstinence), the current marijuana users did not differ from past heavy users or light users in the number of aggressive or non-aggressive responses they made. However, current marijuana users were significantly more aggressive on days 3 and 7 of marijuana abstinence compared to their pre-withdrawal levels of aggression and compared to the controls. By day 28, the number of aggressive responses from the current marijuana users was not different from their pre-withdrawal baseline levels or the controls (Figure).
These data demonstrate that abstinence from marijuana after chronic use is associated with increases in aggressive responding following provocation. Specifically, during the first week of abstinence, current marijuana users displayed levels of aggression that were significantly higher than before abstinence and higher than the levels displayed by matched controls.
Interestingly, the increases in aggressive responding followed a specific time course and then returned to pre-withdrawal levels after 28 days of abstinence. The transient nature of these changes is consistent with other reports of marijuana withdrawal.
The second study was designed to further characterize symptoms of marijuana withdrawal and to quantify their magnitude (Kouri and Pope, 2000). We used the same study entry criteria as in the first study and subjects were required to come to the laboratory every day to provide urine samples and to fill out a daily diary.
The items assessed in the daily diaries were: mood, appetite, sleep, anxiety, irritability, physical tension or agitation, physical symptoms, ability to concentrate, desire to use marijuana, and desire to resume using marijuana at the end of the study. The questions were presented on a 10-point Likert scale with the qualifiers "extremely low" at the zero end of the scale and "extremely high" at the 10-point end of the scale. We obtained pre-withdrawal baseline levels for all of the diary items via a personal interview with each subject before the beginning of the withdrawal period.
Thirty current marijuana users and 30 controls (16 former heavy users and 14 light users) participated in the study. Before the beginning of the abstinence period, the current marijuana users were not different from the former users or the light users on any of the items assessed in the diaries except for the ability to concentrate item. The current users reported a lower ability to concentrate than the controls. Interestingly, the former heavy users were not different from the light users on any of the diary scores during the course of the study. In contrast, the current users reported increases in irritability, anxiety, physical tension and physical symptoms, and decreases in mood and appetite starting on day 1 and peaking between days 7 and 10 of marijuana abstinence.
It is important to note that although, as a group, the current marijuana users experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms compared to the controls, only 60% of the subjects in the current users group reported a change in symptoms of at least three points in magnitude. The fact that 40% of subjects who had used marijuana regularly for an average of 22 years did not report experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms during abstinence might suggest that physical dependence on marijuana is not as strong as that observed with other drugs of abuse. This may be due, at least in part, to the long half-life of THC. However, many subjects reported that when trying to remain abstinent in the past, the presence of withdrawal symptoms had played an important role in their relapse. Thus, alleviation of abstinence symptoms may contribute to the maintenance of daily marijuana use in chronic users.
Another significant finding is that after 28 days of marijuana abstinence, all of the symptoms returned to pre-withdrawal levels except for irritability and physical tension. It is possible that these two symptoms remained slightly elevated because they represented a premorbid characteristic of the current users and were not a result of marijuana withdrawal. If this is the case, the fact that the former users did not have elevated scores on these two items may reflect a characteristic that potentially differentiates individuals with a history of heavy marijuana use who have successfully stopped from individuals who continue to smoke regularly.
Taken together, the data from these two studies provide further evidence of the existence of a marijuana withdrawal syndrome. An important aspect of both of our studies is that we used two control groups: 1) former heavy marijuana users and 2) individuals who had rarely smoked marijuana during their lives.
It is noteworthy that these control groups were indistinguishable from one another in diary scores or number of aggressive responses on the PSAP, whereas both were significantly distinguishable from the current marijuana users. This observation argues that the elevated diary scores and aggressive responses of the current marijuana users were attributable to marijuana withdrawal, rather than a mere history of marijuana use or some other aspect of subject selection or study design. Future studies should focus not on whether a marijuana withdrawal syndrome exists but rather on determining the clinical significance of this syndrome and the role withdrawal symptoms play in perpetuating marijuana use.

SWIM has hypothetically been using daily for about 20 years. SWIM does get cranky without it, but SWIM was moody and unpredicatable all the time without it before starting. SWIM once quit for a whole calandar year, and accomplised nothing during that year and came close to doing SWIM in. It was when SWIM was sinking a razor into SWIMs arm that SWIM though SWIM might smoke some before bleeding to death, and decided after that it was bipolar disorder that was causing SWIM problems, and that weed was an incredible mood stabilizer that allowed SWIM to function. SWIM dropped the razor, started smoking again, and has since finished several college degrees, has a good job, and smokes all the time when not working. SWIM has weed to thank for SWIMs life. Note SWIM has tried antidepressants, etc while abstaining but none worked. SWIM was just too steeped in mood swings and depression to get anything done, and wanted to die all the time.
SWIM has never had to spend huge amounts of money on the stuff, and weekly consumption has remained unchanged over the decades.
There will always be people that cannot function on a certain substance. These people need to stop. However, blanketing everyone under one category it wrong. SWIM would become a total violent fuckup without weed. Everyone around SWIM knows that, and some have seen it. It is medecine, and an essential medecine at that. It is also harmless in most ways. SWIM has combatted addiction with other substances (and won), but with cannabis, SWIM thinks that those who are very habitual are treating a problem, and it may be that this treatment is very appropriate. Who's to say the mood-swings were not the problem being suppressed.
The anti-seizure medication that the good doctor is using is probably neurontin or tegretol, and both have been used for bipolars. SWIM bets the antidepressant is buspar, since it makes smoking weed very unpleasant. SWIM also bets that his cure rate goes down fast over time. Temorarily treating people's permanent mental illnesses is not a good long term fix. However, he gets to become famous for his proprietary drug cocktail, and this necessitates making weed smoking into a scourge. This one quacks like a duck...

Hm, interesting. I believe marijuana can be addictive.
It's just been sort of phasing out of swims life gradually and without effort...and not really feeling like there's time or a necessity to smoke grass everyday. There is always some around swim's house though, and that is a bit of a security blanket of sorts.
White sugar is seriously my biggest addiction, and I am not being sarcastic. I get restless and pace around the house if I don't have sweets everyday. I will eat honey out of the jar if there's no cookies or candy around when I want it. It is nuts, I actually mentally struggle not to buy candy whenever I see it.

Swim considers herself addicted to marijuana, but doesn't consider it to be a horrible thing. As far as addictions to drugs go, it's probably the least destructive. Swim also uses marijuana for it's antidepressant properties and finds that she just enjoys life more when she is using cannabis. Swims's antidepressant medication which she is prescribed tends to give her a lot of excess nervous energy which bothers swim because she's a laid-back kind of a person and finds that cannabis helps relax her and give her a mood lift...the old "trippy" effects of marijuana have ceased for swim except when she is smoking some exceptional high-grade MJ for the first time... so even though swim smokes at various points during the day (mostly in the morning and in the evening), it doesn't make her stoned to the point where she can't function properly, it just makes her more carefree and see life's little problems as what they usually are: inconsequential. Swim didn't begin using marijuana regularly until about two years ago when she took a medical withdraw from college due to severe clinical depression (taking that withdrawal and taking care of my mental health literally saved my life). Directly after that she found that she had a wad of cash from a student loan and since no one was asking her to pay it back and she wasn't using for school, she spent the large majority on it on weed. After withdrawing from school in mid-October that year, she began taking zoloft, seeing a good psychologist, and smoking pot everyday. Usually it takes about 6months on average to recover from such a depression, but with this regimen (and simply living a stress-free lifestyle) her symptoms had virtually disappeared within about two months. She also found that the zoloft, while it has been her best treatment to date, tended to send her into a state of hypomania: lots of unnecessary spending, very very reckless behavior, and speeding (often over 120mph). The pot seemed to help calm her down and just make life more enjoyable in general. Swim also has chronic insomnia and weed helps her sleep...although, it rebounds something fierce when swim runs out of MJ, but this is typical.
Also, swim has an addictive personality. She finds that when she doesn't smoke cannabis, she ends up turning to alcohol which is much worse for swim and leaves her feeling sick in the morning and is just something she simply doesn't enjoy much on it's own (although alcohol and marijuana are nice on occasion, but usually swim just sticks with the marijuana). Swim believes that even if she were to give up marijuana (which she doesn't see as necessary) then eventually she would end up with an addiction to something more harmful.
I think that so long as a substance is making your life overall more enjoyable and not less and so long as it's not causing major harm to your health then use is absolutely fine.
But, I will say that spending $300 a week is detrimental and probably constitutes a harmful addiction simply because it causes problems financially. At swim's peak, she was spending about $100 a week. But, swim has tried to be more economical and now avoids buying the high-priced strains (unless it's just a rare treat) and as much as she hates it, she's just been sticking with schwag where she usually buys half an ounce (50 bucks) which lasts about a week and a half or two if swim can restrain herself enough
Also, swim no longer finds herself smoking to get really stoned. Once she's to the point of relaxation, she usually puts the pipe down. She also finds herself smoking habitually simply because she doesn't smoke anything else and likes the taste of marijuana smoke...so she sometimes ends up smoking just like it's tobacco or something in then being like "oops, I didn't mean to get stoned." But, this is just regarding day-to-day use and of course if it's a special occasion or if swim has just bought a big bag then there will be lots and lots of smoking to ensue.

What a load of bullshit. Anyone who compares a marijuana habit to a heroin addiction is absolutely stupid. Pot is non-addictive physically. There's absolutely no reason why one would have to spend every penny they earn on it. Someone who does this is a clown basically. If pot is becoming too expensive just buy less and deal with it.

i think you just hit the nail on the head
if you were getting thru $300AU a week you'd have to be smoking a fair few blunts or really big spliffs every day to get thru that quantity unless you were buying super-high grade uber-skunk and then if it was so good, you wouldnt be able to smoke that much of it

I agree with you and with nature_boy_liam. The fact that they would even THINK of comparing a marijuana addiction to a heroin addiction...
SWIM has seen people on the latter, and it's not pretty. He's also known a lot of people who smoke pot over the years, and many who smoke extremely large amounts. Now here's the thing, in the wide range of people he knows, he's only noticed an "addiction" in a few people, who generally:
Are quite easily suggestable
Are heavily over-using other drugs
And who's life-styling seems to be taking a downfall (whether before or after their over-use of drugs.)
Long story short, It's to the individual person as to whether they are "Addicted" to marijuana or any substance really...
"Mom, Dad... I have to tell you something... I'm addicted..."
"GOOD GOD! Where are the drugs? I'LL BURN THEM ALL"
"Drugs? Oh god no... I'm addicted to.... *deep sigh*... DRAGON BALL Z"
Seriously, some people can be addicted to things like Star Trek enough to adopt a "Klingon"-style life, I don't think they would physically become ill if you removed their head-ridges... ya know?
So, PRAY TELL Dr Currie, how many of these "weed addicts" have you run psychological tests on, and compared them to other weed users who say they could stop at a whim? :crazy

Im not as bad as people that go to those conventions, it seems they know all the lines, so obsessed with there character rolls they forget they even exist. Which although humorous is actually kinda sad.. speaking of sad cause im a trekke from what others say.
All true, star trek is very addictive.. uh-oh... Alicia says looking embarrassed. Oh well it could be home and away I suppose thats some consolidation . "Screw it im happy being a trekkee stoner.." she says looking around to see if anyone heard her. nuts to the boyo, its better then star-gate sg1

This looks like a clinic touting for business.
"There's a physical addiction and people who try to stop get irritable, angry, depressed, aggressive," he said. "And they might want to punch people, walls, wives, bosses."
"So most people who try to stop find it very, very difficult."

This just bad science. Maybe people should watch "Reefer Madness" instead.
The only way marijuana becomes addictive is when mixed withn tobacco.
enquirewithin, Jun 11, 2006
Swia has never hurt anyone when she has run out of weed, she maybe slighty irritable, obnoxious but after a day she becomes essentially normal.
Alicia, Jun 11, 2006
I agree with you Alicia.. and being a trekkie is NOT shameful at all! lol.. it's being a Trekkie to the point of going to the store in a Federation uniform and in a car you've outfitted to look like a shuttle... now THAT is just... weird...
But i like Star Trek too, the science is actually plausible (sp?) All the technology in that show has some science behind it It's awesome.
But back to weed addicts... THEY DON'T EXIST O_O The physical addicts anyway, lol
Peace Frog, Jun 11, 2006
Screw being addicted. I believe anyone can get off of anything....that's all mental. Everyone has a choice of doing something about a bad habit, or just letting it get worse. One day they could realise, I'm losing everything so SNAP should be clean from there, or atleast cut down.
