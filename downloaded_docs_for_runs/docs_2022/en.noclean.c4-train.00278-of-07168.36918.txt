(HealthAndFitnessTimes.com) Dietary supplements involving fish oil and also red yeast rice, combined with lifestyle modifications in diet along with exercise routines, will decrease cholesterol just as much as common cholesterol reducing drugs identified as statins, relating to a brand new study.
Yet the study’s head writer, David Becker, MD, cardiologist with Chestnut Hill Medical center and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, concentrates on the alternative method is certainly not for everybody.
“Statins continue to be the principal and most effective treatment for individuals having high cholesterol, particularly when you have coronary disease,” Becker explains. The investigation examined exclusively people having high cholesterol that did not to date have coronary disease.
“If you actually are an individual dead set in opposition to using a statin, the following might be an appealing option, presuming you will be ready to come up with the lifestyle modifications,” Becker states.
“This is actually one of the very first studies which have demonstrated there is in fact some hope here,” he claims, referring to the substitute strategy using dietary supplements rather than statins.
Discovering other possibilities to medication regarding reducing cholesterol can be important, he states, since studies indicate as numerous as 40% of individuals that receive a statin prescription are generally thought to take it for much less than a year.
Study Details
Becker in addition to his colleagues analyzed 74 individuals having high cholesterol. Fifty percent got the statin medication Zocor and the other fifty percent got fish oil as well as red yeast rice dietary supplements. These people had been followed for twelve weeks.
Red yeast rice is actually the supplement of yeast developed on rice and also contains various compounds which slow down creation of cholesterol within the body. Fish oil has been demonstrated to reduce the blood fats identified as triglycerides. The particular investigation had been financed by the state of Pennsylvania as well as released in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
The treatment group got 40 milligrams of Zocor every day and also got classic counseling in the type of handouts on eating habits and physical exercise.
The dietary supplement group got 3 fish oil pills two times every day. Additionally, individuals having an LDL cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL got 3.6 grams of red yeast rice every day, split into 2 dosages. If the preliminary LDL level had been 160 or less, these people took 2.4 grams of red yeast rice every day, split into 2 dosages.
The dietary supplement group additionally went to weekly group meetings and also had been educated about lifestyle modifications by a cardiologist as well as a dietitian. The group had been advised to stick to a revised Mediterranean diet plan, restricting fat ingestion to much less than 25% of everyday total calories, and also to work out for thirty to forty five minutes 5 to 6 instances per week.
Results
“We observed these individuals for a 3 month timeframe,” Becker states. At the study’s conclusion, the amounts of bad cholesterol had dropped almost the equivalent amount within each group. “The actual LDL dropped 42% inside the dietary supplement group and also 39% within the Zocor group,” Becker states.
The dietary supplement group additionally dropped an average of ten lbs in twelve weeks, yet there had been no sizeable weight reduction within the medication group. Triglyceride amounts, although on average normal within the two groups in the start, lessened by 29% within the dietary supplement group yet merely 9.3% within the medication group, a considerable variation, Becker states.
“This homeopathic, all-natural strategy within a group of individuals that do not possess recognized coronary disease and also who could make these types of demanding lifestyle modifications might end up being worth checking out in lengthier and also far better studies,” Becker explains.
Another Opinion
The actual investigation outcomes do not shock Robert Eckel, MD, previous president of the American Heart Association and also a professor of medicine with the University of Colorado, Denver. Red yeast rice operates in substantially the identical manner as a statin.
“Fish oils do not influence LDL cholesterol,” he states, yet just triglycerides. In addition to the participants’ triglyceride amounts, on average, had been normal, he states, and did not require reduction.
If an individual is attempting to reduce cholesterol, he states, the very first step is definitely to see a physician.
Downsides & Caveats
Becker recognizes disadvantages to dietary supplements over statins.
“Red yeast rice is actually an unregulated dietary supplement,” Becker states. He points out a current report where researchers discovered substantial distinctions within the volume of red yeast rice within various brands of dietary supplements.
In August 2007, the FDA cautioned against purchasing or even consuming certain red yeast rice items (Red Yeast Rice/Policosonal Complex by Swanson Healthcare Products, Inc., and Cholestrix) simply because they ”might include an unauthorized substance which might be dangerous.” FDA tests had discovered lovastatin, the active compound within Mevacor, a prescription medication intended for cholesterol lowering.
Red yeast rice marketed within the U.S. generally arrives in 600 milligram to 1,200 milligram dosages, with suggestions of using no more than 2,400 milligrams (2.4 grams) per day, the particular reduced dosage utilized within the research. Dosages greater than this raise the danger of side effects comparable to that of statin medicines, which includes muscle discomfort or perhaps tenderness, as well as possibly liver injury. Red yeast rice and also statins operate in the same way in the body; therefore they must not be used with each other, as this raises the possibility of side effects.
Regarding anybody that wishes to try the alternate method, Becker suggests speaking with their physician, getting all suggested blood checks to help to make certain the strategy is doing the job, and checking for possible side effects.
