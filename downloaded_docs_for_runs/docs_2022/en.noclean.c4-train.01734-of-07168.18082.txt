Morphine Addiction Recovery
Morphine is an extremely powerful opioid. While this medication helps people who are dealing with pain, it’s also a very potent, addictive drug. The reason people develop a morphine addiction is that the medication also releases dopamine. Unfortunately, this can cause you to develop a dependency to a very dangerous drug.
Developing a Morphine Addiction
Morphine addiction doesn’t happen to everyone the same way. It may be an immediate reaction, or it could develop slowly. Some people receive morphine when in the hospital and immediately begin to crave the medication. This can be due to a genetic predisposition or even a result of a reduction in stress. Most commonly, though, is that a person is on morphine for pain management and develops a dependency over time.
Morphine alters the way the brain operates because it releases so much dopamine. Over time, the brain stops creating this important chemical. In order to feel pleasure, the brain needs dopamine. As a result, people often begin abusing the medication for the dopamine release rather than just taking it for pain management.
The Progression of a Morphine Addiction
Individuals who start using morphine for something other than what the prescription recommends are abusing it. The mind tries justifying the use of more morphine by maximizing the pain users feel so they want more. Individuals in the early stages of morphine addiction may also begin going to multiple doctors or lying to their doctors as a way to get more or a higher dose. In some cases, they may also begin buying the drug illegally or stealing it from loved ones.
There are also those individuals who begin using morphine as an alternative substance to simply get high. Opioids are the biggest problem drug in the United States right now, which is partly due to ease of accessibility. Due to the lack of education of how addictive this drug is, people may give it to friends or family members. Others may be on the hunt to look for the drug as a way of escaping reality or to change how they feel.
Dependency and a Morphine Addiction
After long-term use of a drug like morphine, individuals’ minds and bodies begin depending on the substance. They often begin seeing that their lives are becoming unmanageable due to morphine addiction. The problem is that they can’t stop, or they’ll begin to get very sick, due to withdrawal. The symptoms of withdrawal happen because their bodies don’t know how to function without the medication.
Some common symptoms of withdrawal from morphine include:
Anxiety
Cold sweats
Aches and pains in the bones and joints
Nausea
Irritability
