When the vape pen is loaded, the user clicks the single button interface, which heats the coil inside the atomizer. Some vape pens have one temperature, others have multiple presets. Most vapor pens have click controls. For example, with many vape pens, five clicks powers the vaporizer pen on and three clicks toggles temperature. Holding the button down heats the vape pen. At that point, the vaporizer pen coil heats materials at a temperature beneath the point of combustion, creating smoother, smokeless hits. Vape pen heat up time is usually under a minute.
Although you play a large role in figuring out your ideal temperature, your type of dry herb and concentrate also matters. The chemicals inside these products vaporize at different temperatures and could possibly burn or ruin your product if your settings are too high. Burning your product completely negates the use of these non-combustible devices.

Major eliquid vape pen brands include Atmos and Vaporite. A vapor pen for eliquid is easier to operate than other ejuice vapes like mods.

E-cigarettes deliver nicotine through a liquid that is heated into vapor and inhaled, cutting out the cancer-causing tar of combustible cigarettes. But vaping liquids contain additives such as propylene glycol and glycerol that can form carcinogenic compounds when they are heated. Diacetyl, a chemical used to flavor some vape “juice,” has been linked to so-called popcorn lung, the scarring and obstruction of the lungs’ smallest airways. A study published in the journal Pediatrics in March found substantially increased levels of five carcinogenic compounds in the urine of teenagers who vape.
