Three Steps To Lower Cholesterol Levels
It seems like people are talking all about how to lower cholesterol naturally these days. Eat oatmeal, one study says. Exercise is another great way to help you lower your cholesterol levels, your doctor might say. Eat less red meat and more whole grains and veggies, lots of studies report.
While all of this leans in the right direction and all points toward a healthy overall lifestyle, it can be confusing, especially if you already work to do these things.
However, if you’re starting from scratch and have been told that you have high blood pressure and cholesterol and you need to at least reduce cholesterol levels, then you might want to consider getting a head start by following a few simple steps.
Lowering Cholesterol Tips
Cholesterol Health
1. Cholesterol Diet – One of the best ways to lower cholesterol naturally is to start eating right. Cut down on the amount of fast or processed foods you eat and incorporate more fruits and veggies.
Reduce the amount of red meat that you eat and lean more toward lean proteins, like chicken and fish. You should also eat plenty of whole grains and skip out on the white flour products such as white bread.
Remember, all things in moderation.
2. Exercise Is Important – Another great thing you can do to help lower your cholesterol naturally is to start exercising regularly. In other words, get out there and move your body a little bit. A half hour a day is a great start, but you should get your heart rate up for an hour for best results.
This means taking a long, brisk walk or doing some heavy duty cardio workouts and don’t forget your strength training. This is a wonderful way to keep your bones strong and muscle burns more calories than fat does. Exercise also helps keep your cholesterol levels down.
3. Cholesterol Lowering Supplements – Consider all natural supplements to help you lower your cholesterol naturally. The right homeopathic formulas can help you to stimulate the liver and kidneys, to help clean itself and keep you healthy. Plus, many of these natural formulas can help to balance out your blood sugar levels and help your body to work at it’s very best.
If your doctor has said that your have high blood pressure and cholesterol, it is time to consider fixing it. You may have been advised to take prescription medications to help you do this, but you can also help yourself to lower cholesterol naturally.
You’ll feel great, lose weight and be healthier overall, and when you add that up to all the other wonderful benefits of a total healthy lifestyle, you’ll be glad that you were working to naturally lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
