the Psychiatry Advisor take:
Another study, this time using Rhesus monkeys, has again found no link that vaccines may cause autism.
Researchers at several institutions, including the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, inoculated 79 male infant monkeys with a combination of vaccines, some with thimerosal and others without the preservative. Other monkeys received just a saline solution. Some people have posited that thimersoal may cause autism.
None of the monkeys developed any autism symptoms, the researchers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Brain autopsies were performed on some monkeys that were killed and no evidence of autism was found.
The idea that vaccines may lead to autism came from a now discredited study conducted years ago. Most scientists now believe than any connections between vaccines and autism are purely coincidental. Still, thimerosal has been largely eliminated from most vaccines to placate worried parents.
The researchers said that their results disprove the hypothesis that vaccines alone or with thimerosal are the cause of a rise in the number of children diagnosed with autism.

A team of researchers with affiliations to several institutions in the U.S., has conducted a study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, looking into the possibility of vaccines or the preservative thimerosal causing autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and has found no such link.
In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team describes their study using Rhesus monkeys and what they found as a result of their work.
For several years parents and citizen groups have claimed that vaccinations (and/or a preservative used to keep them fresh) given to infants and children causes ASDs , despite the lack of evidence.
