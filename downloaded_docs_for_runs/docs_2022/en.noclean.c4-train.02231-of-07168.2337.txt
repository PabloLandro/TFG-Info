Nothing Fishy About Fish Oil -Monday, January 28, 2019
Getting your proper intake of omega-3s can be tricky, especially if you’re not a lover of fish. One of the most important nutrients for health, it benefits overall wellness, including the heart, the immune system, brain health and more. However, much of the Western diet is lacking in omega-3s, replaced by the omega-6 fatty acids. An excess of omega-6s can cause inflammation, and can even lead to serious health risks.
Benefits from Top to Bottom
With American Heart Month coming up in February, it’s important to know that omega-3s are essential for good heart health. Several studies have demonstrated how people that eat a plentiful amount of fish have lower rates of heart risks. Fish oil also helps increase the good levels of cholesterol, also known as HDL. It can help reduce blood pressure and lower triglycerides.
It’s also a benefit for your mental health. The brain is made up of around 60% fat, which are mainly omega-3s. Research has shown that a proper amount of fish oil intake can prevent the onset of certain mental disorders. It’s also just handy for boosting normal brain function in general.
Weight management is a constant struggle for many, and fish oil can be a big help. Studies have shown that enough fish oil intake can help induce weight loss when in conjunction with dieting and exercise. Fish oil also has inflammatory properties, which helps out the immune system and general health.
The benefits are even more numerous, supporting healthy skin, early pregnancy, improving bone health, and even boosting your mood. But where best can you get your fill of omega-3s?
A Meal Rich in Omega-3s
Fish: A majority of fish oil comes from, you guessed it, fish. Foods such as salmon, mackerel and anchovies contain omega-3s, which makes up 30% of fish oil. It also contains important vitamins A and D, which helps boost the immune system and maintains healthy bone growth respectively. Mackerel specifically contains more than 3300 mg of omega-3s per serving, which is nearly 6 times the recommended daily dose for adults.
Nuts and Seeds: If fish isn’t part of your palate however, there are other foods to rely on. Walnuts are full of healthy fats which include omega-3s. They can go with nearly any meal, such as with fruits, in salads, or even baked into your favorite desserts. Flaxseeds are also a source for a specific omega-3 called alpha-linoleic acid or ALA, which the body cannot make on its own. They’re perfect for a breakfast meal, or can be blended into fruit smoothies. Cashew nuts are very flavorful, but more than that, they are full of omega-3s, making them a valuable snack.
Vegetables: Don’t be picky with your vegetables, because omega-3s are abound in them as well. Brussels sprouts may not be everyone’s most favorite, but it contains potent amounts of vitamin K and vitamin C, along with omega-3s. Spinach is another, and can be added most meals without affecting the flavor. Broccoli is also a big source of ALA, as well as being high in fiber, zinc and protein.
Oils: Adding certain oils to your meals can also help you reach your omega-3 goals. Canola oil is low in saturated fats and is very mild tasting. Other healthy oils include walnut oil, flaxseed oil and olive oil, which all have healthy servings of omega-3s.
Omega-3 Fish Oil: A Convenient Source of Helpful Fatty Acids
Despite the many health applications of fish oil, our diets don’t allow for much opportunity to have some. Omega-3 Fish Oil by GardaVita® can supply a high-quality source of omega-3s in easy-to-swallow softgels. They include two of the most important fatty acids, EPA and DHA. Get a convenient serving to help manage your overall health. There’s nothing fishy about good health!

Going Beyond the Numbers: Learn How You Can Support Good Cholesterol -Friday, October 3, 2014
Cholesterol has been a major focus of daily health for many years, especially when it comes to the heart. For a long time doctors and experts focused on a certain set of numbers based on LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels to assess heart health. But recent studies have shown that cholesterol management is more than just a numbers game.
A Change in Approach
Almost everyone who watches their cholesterol knows there are two different types: LDL, otherwise known as "bad cholesterol", and HDL, known as the "good cholesterol". According to the Mayo Clinic, acceptable ranges for LDL cholesterol consist of anything below 70 mg/dl while anything between 130 mg/dl and 159 mg/dl is borderline high. For the good HDL, the higher the number the better. Healthy ranges consist of anything between 40 mg/dl up to 60 mg/dl.
A recent report released by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, however, gave updated insight into how other potential risk factors—not just cholesterol numbers—play a role in determining your cholesterol health. Cholesterol numbers by themselves sometimes don't always tell the full tale as the same numerical values can bear different meanings for different people.
In order to give a more accurate evaluation, doctors and health experts looked at other factors such as genetics, age, physical activity levels, diet, and blood sugar levels to assess what type of daily support an individual may need. Any one of these factors can raise your risk of heart concerns, which is why it's important not to focus on a single aspect, but rather the big picture of your well-being.
Ways You Can Influence Your Cholesterol Numbers
There are several controllable factors that you can engage in to support not just your cholesterol number readings, but other aspects that go into your health. Diet, for instance, can play a crucial role. Studies have shown that legumes can positively influence your cholesterol numbers. Foods like beans, nuts, peas, and lentils can cut cholesterol by 5%, which, in turn, can cut your risk factors for other heart health concerns by 5%, making a world of difference.
There are also supplementation options for a more natural approach to supporting cholesterol. The clinically tested Bergamot fruit continues to show promise for cholesterol health as well as balancing blood sugar levels. Other ingredients such as folic acid, omega-3 fish oil, and flaxseed have also shown the ability to provide positive daily support when it comes to managing cholesterol.
Depending on your personal variables, exercise is another often-cited factor in influencing cholesterol health. You don't have to dedicate yourself to workouts to see a difference, but adding 30–40 minutes of moderate-intensity workouts three-to-four times a week can support healthy cholesterol and blood pressure ranges according to the American Heart Association.
Other lifestyle components include resisting more obvious bad habits such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol, as well as not monitoring stress levels as they can impact blood pressure and your overall heart health.
It's More Than Just About the Numbers
While many people measure their cholesterol strictly by the numbers, there's much more to it than figures on a piece of paper. Your overall lifestyle—depending on how healthy or unhealthy it is—indirectly affects your heart. However, no matter your age, weight, gender, or family history, it's never too late to enact positive changes starting today that can bear great health rewards tomorrow.
