The most common way HIV is transmitted is through the following body fluids:
Breast milk
Blood
Vaginal fluid
Semen
It should be noted that this virus CANNOT be transmitted through the following:
Urine
Fecal matter
Perspiration
Tears
Can HIV Be Transmitted through Sexual Intercourse?
Yes.
You may contract HIV if you have unprotected sex with someone who is infected with it.
This includes any of the following forms of sexual intercourse:
Oral sex
Anal sex
Vaginal sex
If you really have to have sex, then the most ideal way to do it is by using protection every time.
The most common and affordable way is through the use of a condom.
But other forms of protection such as a dental dam or some other latex sort of barrier will do. In addition, avoid activities that can result in bleeding such as “rough sex.”
If you are going to use lubrication with a condom, do not use an oil-based one.
Rather, go for water-based because the former can cause damage to latex condoms.
To decrease your risk of contracting HIV, you may also take a medication called “PrEP” which stands for “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” every day.
Please note that having sex with a person who has HIV doesn’t automatically mean you will contract the virus too.
However, the likelihood is very high particularly if your partner is not taking any effective medication for HIV.
Thus, using condoms and taking PrEP significantly lowers the risk.
It should be noted that HIV is NOT transmitted through any of the following acts:
Living day-to-day life with a person infected with HIV
Using sex toys that you alone use (not being shared with others)
Engaging in cyber sex (online sex)
Engaging in phone sex
Dry kissing
Fantasizing
Masturbation
Massaging
Cuddling
How is HIV Transmitted through Blood?
If the blood of someone with HIV gets in contact with you internally, you may contract the virus.
This can happen in the following examples:
Getting some blood splattered in your eyes
Blood transfusions
Accidental needle pricks
Getting body piercings or tattoos using unsterilized needles
Sharing needles used for intravenous drugs
It is NOT possible to get HIV through blood transmitted through mosquito bites and that of other insects.
Never share needles with anyone.
Make sure every syringe you are using is new and sealed.
Is HIV Hereditary?
Yes, it is possible for a baby inside the womb to get HIV if the mother is infected with HIV.
In addition, even if the virus wasn’t passed on to the baby during the pregnancy, the baby might still contract the virus through the mother’s breast milk.
The first few months of life of the baby is when he or she is at risk the most.
Thus, for any new moms who are infected with HIV, it is ideal that you bottle feed your babies with formula milk, not breast milk.
