Perilous Pairs: 5 Common Disorders with Addiction
There are common disorders that come with addiction. After all, addiction doesn’t come on its own. Worse than a thief in the night, it’s accompanied by its friends, feeding off on each other, with only destruction–and even death–in their wake.
You may not be fully aware of it, but there are certain health conditions that come in pairs. One condition often leads to the other, vice versa, or just occur together. For example, once you get diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease often follows. Allergies often come with asthma, and in the same vein, a cold often comes with cough and flu.
The same can be said when it comes to addiction. There are certain mental health disorders that accompany substance abuse, in what are collectively called co-occurring disorders. Read More

Spice Up Your Life? The Dangers of Synthetic Cannabinoids
Synthetic cannabinoids are so much different than natural ones. While they are called cannabinoids and found in herbal or liquid incense, they’re far from natural, or even from their counterparts, marijuana.
This is because synthetic cannabinoids are actually man-made and may affect the brain more powerfully than marijuana can. It is sprayed on dried, shredded plant material and are marketed as “fake weed” but is far from being safe, natural, or even legal. In fact, its effects can be more powerful and more dangerous, if not fatal.
Today, it’s sold in colorful packages and plastic bottles that make them seem herbal or natural. This is why they are attractive to many consumers, especially the young ones. They come in different names, such as “spice.” It’s also called K2, Joker, Black Mamba, Kronic, and Kush.
To give you more perspective on just how dangerous this drug can be, here’s a useful set of infographics:
If you know someone who is addicted to marijuana or synthetic cannabinoids like Spice, seek help. Call or text us at Bridges of Hope: 09175098826.

11 Ways to Spot a Drug Addict in Your Workplace
People who are addicted to drugs like shabu (methamphetamine), marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, and other substances are everywhere. It doesn’t matter what their economic status, educational background, location, age, job, or physical appearance. You can’t judge a drug addict by looks alone, nor by superficial stereotypes.
Addiction can come to anyone regardless of status, job, education, religion, or gender. And this is why it’s hard to see if someone you know is already addicted to drugs or a high-functioning addict. In fact, you may have someone in your workplace who is already a drug addict and is bringing grief to you or your organization. Read More

As a drug addict, I thought I had nothing to hope for. I was physically, emotionally, financially and spiritually messed up...It wasn't easy to change and give up the lifestyle that I was used to. Until I met and got to the place that helped me change my perception and that is Bridges of Hope. The facility helped me know and realize what I am, who I am as a daughter, a friend and a mother.
