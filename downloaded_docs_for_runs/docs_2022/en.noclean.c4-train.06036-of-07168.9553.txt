Basics
Description
Colorless, volatile liquid
Absorbed in 30–60 min
Metabolized by liver
Half-life 4–8 hr
Mechanism:
Inebriating
Nontoxic
Metabolites of formaldehyde and formic acid produce toxic effects.
Inhibits cytochrome oxidase.
Formic acid:
Determines degree of acidosis, visual symptoms, and mortality
Directly toxic to retinal and optic nerve tissue
Methanol metabolism:
Step 1: Methanol is converted to formaldehyde by liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.
Step 2: Formaldehyde is then rapidly converted by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid.
Step 3: Formic acid is degraded to carbon dioxide and water by folate-dependent mechanism.
Steps 1 and 3 are rate-limiting steps.
Etiology
Common sources of methanol:
Wood alcohol
Windshield washer fluid (> 60% cases)
Inhalational abuse of carburetor cleaners
