Post Operative Instructions
After Cosmetic Reconstruction
Remember that it will take time to adjust to the feel of your new bite. When the bite is altered or the position of the teeth is changed it takes several days for the brain to recognize the new position of your teeth or their thickness as normal. If you continue to detect any high spots or problems with your bite, call our office at St. Charles Office Phone Number 630-377-1010 so we can schedule an adjustment appointment. It is normal to experience some hot and cold sensitivity. The teeth require some time to heal after removal of tooth structure and will be sensitive in the interim. Your gums may also be sore for a few days. Warm salt water rinses (a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) three times a day will reduce pain and swelling. A mild pain medication (Advil, Tylenol, Ibuprofen (Motrin) every 3-4 hours) should ease any residual discomfort. Don’t be concerned if your speech is affected for the first few days. You’ll quickly adapt and be speaking normally. You may notice increased salivation. This is because your brain is responding to the new size and shape of your teeth. This should subside to normal in about a week. Daily brushing and flossing are a must for your new dental work. Daily plaque removal is critical for the long-term success of your new teeth, as are regular cleaning appointments. Any food that can crack, chip or damage a natural tooth can do the same to your new teeth. Avoid hard foods and substances (such as beer nuts, peanut brittle, ice, fingernails, or pencils) and sticky candies. Smoking will stain your new teeth. Minimize or avoid foods that stain such as coffee, red wine, tea and berries. If you engage in sports let us know so we can make a custom mouthguard. If you grind your teeth at night, wear the night guard we have provided for you. Adjusting to the look and feel of your new smile will take time. If you have any problems or concerns, please let us know. We always welcome your questions.
After Tooth Extraction
After tooth extraction, it’s important for a blood clot to form to stop the bleeding and begin the healing process. A 2×2 piece of gauze has been placed to control the bleeding. You should keep biting pressure on the gauze for at least one (1) hour. Slight bleeding or oozing from the extraction site is normal and if it persists, place another gauze pad and bite firmly for another 30 minutes. You may have to do this several times. If you are having a difficult time getting the bleeding to stop you may bite on a Lipton tea bag (wet, non-flavored/non-herbal) for one (1) hour. The tannic acid in the tea will aid in the clotting process. After the blood clot forms, it is important not to disturb or dislodge the clot as it aids healing. Do not rinse vigorously, suck through a straw, smoke, spit, or drink alcohol for 72 hours. These activities will dislodge or dissolve the clot and slow the healing process. You can maintain normal brushing and flossing habits, but be very gentle in the area of the extraction. Limit vigorous exercise for the next 24 hours as this will increase blood pressure and may cause more bleeding from the extraction site. After the tooth is extracted you may feel some pain and experience some swelling and bruising. For the first 24 hours an ice pack can be placed (20 minutes on, then 10 minutes off) or an unopened bag of frozen peas or corn applied to the area will keep swelling to a minimum. After the first 24 hours warm, moist heat is recommended. It is normal to experience discomfort in this area. Over the counter pain medications (ie: Advil, Tylenol, Asprin) will help this subside. The swelling usually subsides after 48 hours. Use any prescribed pain medication as directed. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection are gone. Drink lots of fluid and eat nutritious soft food on the day of the extraction. You can eat normally as soon as you are comfortable. After a few days you will feel fine and can resume your normal activities. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain, continued swelling for 2-3 days, or a reaction to the medication, call our office immediately at St. Charles Office Phone Number 630-377-1010 .
After Arestin
Arestin is a prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of gum disease after a deep cleaning procedure known as scaling and root planning. Arestin may also be placed after a three or four month periodontal cleaning appointment.
Arestin delivers antibiotics directly to the infected areas of your gums. This means
Arestin keeps working to kill bacteria long after you leave the dental chair.
To help Arestin fight the infection in your gums and achieve the best results, it is
important to follow the instructions listed below after treatment:
In the area(s) where the Arestin was applied wait 1 day after your treatment
before flossing. Please resume normal brushing and flossing all other areas today.
Avoid sticky, hard, chewy foods for one (1) week
Please don’t hesitate to call us if you should have any questions regarding your treatment.
It is important that we see you for your follow-up appointment that is scheduled.
At Home Whitening
You will bleach your teeth for a total of three (3) weeks:
Week One: Whiten Upper Teeth Only
Week Two: Whiten Upper and Lower Teeth
Week Three: Whiten Lower Teeth Only
Here are some recommendations for optimum results:
We recommend whitening TWICE a day for NO more than 15 mins each time.
Avoid Eating or drinking any citrus fruits or drinks, as well as red sauces. These may cause your teeth to become more sensitive.
Try to avoid tobacco, red wines, teas, and cola products as these will stain your teeth causing you not to achieve your optimum results.
Brush and floss your teeth prior to bleaching.
Place a dot of material in each tooth of your tray.
You may experience some side effects during usage, these include:
Sensitivity to cold
This should subside in 1- 3 days after finishing the process.
For extreme sensitivity load your tray with Sensitivity toothpaste and wear for at least five (5) mins.
The gum tissue in between your teeth turning white.
If this occurs, discontinue use for one to two days and decrease the amount of material you are using. Remember only a slight amount of material is needed in the tray to get results.
If you discontinue use for any reason, you will make up the time lost by adding it to the end of your bleaching regimen.
You should NOT whiten if you are pregnant or nursing.
Be sure to wipe any excess bleach from your gum tissue; if you have a lot of excess whitening materials, you have filled your tray too full. You should have enough material left from your initial kit to touch up your teeth in 6 months or when you feel they could be brightened up. You will only need to bleach two-three days. Not a full week. Touches up kits are available from our office.
If you experience any discomfort or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call our office.
Cementing of Crown Bridge Inlays and Onlays
When we place the permanent restoration, your bite may feel slightly different. This is normal and should adjust over the next few days.
It is not abnormal to experience some discomfort in the area. Warm salt- water rinses and over the counter pain medication (i.e.: Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin) will help this subside.
It is very important to maintain excellent brushing and flossing habits, since decay can occur around the edge of a restoration that is not properly kept clean.
Composite Fillings
Wait one (1) hour before eating, and be especially careful with chewing until the numbness wears off. This is especially important for children.
If possible, avoid chewing on the area for twenty-four hours. During that time, eat a soft diet and avoid sticky and hard foods.
The gum tissue or jaw along the area of the injection site may be sore for a few days. Warm salt- water rinses and over the counter pain medication (i.e.: Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin) will help this subside.
You may have extreme hot and cold sensitivity for about two (2) weeks. Less intense hot and cold sensitivity isn’t unusual for up to two (2) months. However, if extreme discomfort lingers, please call our office.
Invisalign
Today we have delivered the first series of three aligners. You will wear each aligner for a period of two (2) weeks.
You will wear your aligners 22hrs a day, except when eating, brushing and flossing everyday. To clean your aligner:
NO mouthwash containing alcohol, specifically, Listerine
NO soaking in hot water
NO denture cleaning solution, such as “Efferdent”
Lightly brush with regular toothpaste with no­ additives (tartar control, whitening)
You may experience some soreness and sensitivity. You can take over-the-counter pain medication (i.e.: Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin) to help this subside.
Your aligner may become loose fitting before the next appointment, if so you should still continue to wear it daily.
You should avoid drinking caramelized liquids (i.e.; soda, coffee, tea, iced coffee drinks etc.) during your treatment time.
If you have any question or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office
Porcelain Veneers
We have placed porcelain veneers on your teeth. These restorations were placed with the finest materials and techniques available today. However, you should be aware of the following information about your restorations:
As with natural teeth, avoid chewing excessively hard foods on veneered teeth (hard candy, ice, raw carrots, bones, etc.) because the porcelain material can be broken from the natural teeth under extreme forces.
We expect you will receive several years of service from these veneers. However, after watching veneers for many years, we have seen the following situations occur occasionally. They are unavoidable and may require restoration replacement.
Extreme force or trauma can break porcelain veneers just like natural teeth. Use care in sports or other traumatic situations. Do not bite extremely hard objects with just one tooth. Breakage usually requires remaking the restoration, but occasionally they can be repaired.
After a few years, some veneers may demonstrate slight stains at some locations around the edges.
The gum (gingival) may recede from veneers, displaying discolored tooth structure underneath. This usually takes place over several years and requires veneer replacement.
It is important that you visit us for regular six month exams and professional cleanings. Often problems that are developing with the veneers can be found at an early stage and repaired easily, while waiting for a longer time may require redoing the entire restoration
It is not abnormal to experience discomfort in this area. Warm salt- water rinses and over the counter pain medication (i.e.: Tylenol, Advil, Ibuprofen) will help this subside.
It is important that you maintain excellent brushing and flossing habits, since decay can occur around the edge of a veneer that is properly cleaned.
Removable Partial Dentures
We have done our best to provide you with well-fitted, functional, and esthetic artificial partial dentures. We feel confident that after a few weeks of becoming adjusted to the new partial dentures, you will have years of satisfaction and use from them.
Your new partial denture will feel strange when first placed in our mouth. Several days or even a few weeks will be required for you to feel accustomed to them. You may experience a few “sore spots” after wearing the partial for the first 24 hours. This is normal and why we have already scheduled a post- op adjustment appointment with your for tomorrow or the next day.
The new “bite” or occlusion will not feel comfortable for a period of days. This will also be adjusted at your first adjustment appointment. This is normal. Your “bite” will begin to feel normal in about one (1) week. You may have difficultly chewing and speaking at first. Practice chewing with softer foods to start. Practice your speaking by reading out loud to yourself.
Your partial denture can be cleaned easily by using a denture brush and mild toothpaste. A denture bath, soak and brush have been given to you so you may properly care for your new dentures. Please leave your partial denture out of your mouth at night to allow you tissues and outs a chance to rest. If they are out of your mouth, leave them soaking in water. It is not uncommon for the partial to feel snug when you first place it back in your mouth in the morning.
You should plan on seeing us every 3-6 months for a professional cleaning and evaluation of your oral tissues. We will inform you when relining of the partial is necessary.
We look forward to helping you adjust to and enjoy your new dentures.
Root canal Therapy
It is normal for you to have sensitivity to pressure and hot and/or cold, but if swelling occurs, call our office. Avoid chewing sticky or hard foods on the tooth.
You will have a temporary filling placed today. If a small amount of the temporary wears away, it is not a problem. However, if most of or the entire temporary filling falls out, please call our office.
When the root canal is finished, we will place a permanent crown and/or crown with a post and core on the posterior teeth. In most cases, anterior teeth will be restored with a tooth colored restoration. Because the blood supply is now gone from the tooth, the tooth becomes brittle and could fracture easily, therefore a crown is necessary.
It is not abnormal to experience discomfort in this area. Warm salt- water rinses and over the counter pain medication (i.e.: Tylenol, Advil, Ibuprofen) will help this subside.
It is important to maintain excellent brushing and flossing habits at all times.
Scaling and Root Planning
To achieve optimal results, follow the instructions below:
A warm salt-water rinse may be used to soothe your gum tissue as needed
1 cup warm water
1/8 teaspoon salt
Swish and spit out, repeat as needed
It is very important to practice meticulous homecare
Brush twice a day
Floss at least once a day
Use Chlorhexidine rinse every night.
Rinse with Listerine in the mornings for 30 seconds.
Do not use any tobacco products for 72 hours.
Avoid extreme hot or cold liquids for 72 hours.
If you experience any discomfort, using over-the-counter pain medication (such as Tylenol, Advil, or any Ibuprofen) will help this subside.
Avoid using Aspirin (it may increase bleeding).
Temporary Crowns or Bridges
You have just received a plastic/metal restoration that will serve you for a short period of time. A few comments about this temporary will be helpful to you.
CHEWING:
The temporary cement requires about one-half hour to set. Please do not chew during that period of time.
Temporary restorations are not strong. They may break or come off occasionally. If so, call us and we will replace them. If you are not where you can contact us, go to a pharmacy and get some FIXODENT paste denture adhesive. Replace the temporary on your tooth with some FIXODENT holding it in place. This denture adhesive will retain the temporary until you can see us. PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE THE TEMPORARY
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH BECAUSE THE TEETH WILL MOVE AND THE FINAL RESTORATION WILL NOT FIT!
Certain foods will stick to the temporary. This will not happen with the permanent restoration. Avoid eating sticky foods and chewing gum since they can dislodge the temporary.
COLOR: The color of the temporary does not resemble the final restoration in any way.
TOOTH SENSITIVITY: Temporary restorations may leak saliva or food into the tooth. Sensitivity to cold, hot, sweet, or pressure is normal. Soreness around the gum line can also be present. Warm salt-water rinses and over the counter pain medication (i.e.; Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin) will help this subside. This will NOT be the case with your permanent restoration.
HOME CARE: It is important to maintain excellent brushing and flossing habits. However, when flossing around the temporary, pull the floss straight out through the gum line- DO NOT PULL UP ON THE FLOSS, since this could dislodge the temporary.
Vivera Retainers
Today we have delivered to you four (4) sets of Vivera Retainers. You will begin
wearing one (1) set today. This first set of retainers will hopefully last you for at least one (1) year. The other three (3) sets can be placed in a safe storage area for your future use.
You will wear your retainers full time for the first four (4) months.
After the first four (4) months you will wear every night for one (1) year.
During the next one (1) to two (2) years you will wear your retainers every other
night.
After two (2) years you will wear your retainers two (2) nights per week, but not
consecutive nights. ie: Monday & Friday but not Monday & Tuesday.
It is important that you bring the retainers you are currently wearing to all of your dental appointments so we are able to check the fit and make any adjustments.
If at any time you have any questions, please contact our office.
