Carrots for Your Vision
One of the oldest myths regarding eye health is that carrots are good for your eyes. Is this true and what is the secret nutrients found in carrots that will help us keep our vision in tip-top shape?
Carrots are rich in beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is the orange pigment that is found not only in carrots but also in other orange colored vegetables such as sweet potatoes, mangoes, cantaloupes and even pumpkins. Beta-carotene’s true necessity in your body is its ability to absorb vitamin A.
Vitamin A is crucial to eye health because of its ability to help prevent cataracts and other general degeneration of the eyes. Vitamin A keeps the moisture in your eyes. Which without can lead to the swelling of eyelids, and corneal ulcers.
Carrots are also full of lutein, an antioxidant; this will help protect the retina through increasing the density in the macula and will help your eye stay healthier the older you grow.
So now we know, that eating carrots does in fact have incredible benefits to our eye health, and your mom was right all along. Just don’t eat to many or you may turn orange, but just for a little while.
