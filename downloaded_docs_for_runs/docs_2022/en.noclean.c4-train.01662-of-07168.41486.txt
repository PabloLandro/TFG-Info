Vitamin C (vitamin) for prevention of Common Cold in healthy Adults
Ineffective
Bottom Line
Prevention with Vitamin C supplement (Ascorbic acid tablets). 20 valid study conducted, with 9,017 individuals. Has no preventive effect. May speed up recovery by 8%. Seems safe.
EVIDENCE | REASONABLY TESTED
EFFECTIVENESS | NEGLIGIBLE BENEFITS
SAFETY | SAFE
Recommendations
Do not use this treatment:
It does not prevent cold symptoms, and it only slightly speeds up recovery. The treatment seems safe but pointless.
Doctors Say That
Any excess of Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) is evacuated from our body through the urine. This makes vitamin C pretty safe even in high dosages.

Vitamin C
Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and L-ascorbic acid, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement. As a supplement it is used to treat and prevent scurvy. Evidence does not support use in the general population for the prevention of the common cold. It may be taken by mouth or by injection. It is generally well tolerated. Vitamin C was discovered in 1912, isolated in 1928, and first made in 1933. (source)
