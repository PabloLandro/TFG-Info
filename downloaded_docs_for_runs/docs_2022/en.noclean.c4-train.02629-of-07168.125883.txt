Pregnancy Symptoms while Breastfeeding
Because you likely do not get your period while breastfeeding or they are irregular, you may not have pregnancy symptoms right away. It may take until you are six weeks pregnant and start getting nausea and vomiting that you realize something is going on and may be pregnant. This is the time to do a pregnancy test because it is possible to get pregnant while breastfeeding although it often takes three months after giving birth and breastfeeding before you can get pregnant again.

Can You Get Pregnant while on Birth Control?
Virtually no form of birth control is foolproof with the exception of a hysterectomy. If you take birth control pills, your chance of pregnancy is about 1 in 100, provided that you take the birth control regularly, miss no days, and use some other form of birth control when you are taking certain antibiotics. Depo-Provera is considered a better form of birth control with a rate of pregnancy of 1 out of 1000. A person might get pregnant while on Depo-Provera if you were pregnant at the time the Depo-Provera shot was given and the pregnancy test didn’t show you were pregnant before getting the first shot.
IUDs and hormonal IUDs like Mirena are even better when it comes to birth control, preventing pregnancy in less than one out of a thousand women who take it. Vasectomies and tubal ligations are also very successful, but the vas deferens in men and the fallopian tube in women can grow open again after the surgical procedure, resulting in patent tubes that can lead to a pregnancy. Condoms are not great methods of birth control because they can break, leaking sperm into the vaginal vault where they can travel up the fallopian tubes and fertilize an egg.
Can You Get Pregnant while Nursing?
Yes, you can get pregnant while nursing. Nursing protects a woman from ovulating and thus getting pregnant for a few months but, after about three months, there is a chance that the woman may ovulate again and get pregnant if she uses nursing as a sole form of birth control. They do make a mini pill that just contains synthetic progesterone, but this can decrease the amount of milk produced and can interfere with nursing. It is best to exclusively nurse and practice a barrier form of birth control, such as a condom or diaphragm while nursing if you really don’t want to get pregnant.
Can You Get Pregnant while on Mirena?
It is possible to get pregnant while on Mirena, but it is very uncommon. Mirena is an IUD that contains a synthetic progesterone. The IUD can prevent a pregnancy on its own, but the added effect of having synthetic progesterone in the IUD further prevents pregnancy. There is a higher than average risk of miscarriage in a woman who actually gets pregnant while on Mirena.
Can You Get Pregnant while on the Pill?
You can get pregnant on the pill at a rate of about one out of 100. The biggest problem with the pill is that you have to remember to take it every day or it becomes less effective. The pill is the most common form of birth control and is effective in the majority of cases when taken correctly.

Much of that depends on whether you decide to breastfeed. If you do, you can't use the pill until you stop. If you don't, your doctor will prescribe the pill for you at your 6 week checkup. Make sure you get a sample pack from him/her so you can start taking it once you get your period. You of course have many options when it comes to birth control besides the pill, but the pill is a good one. Good luck to you and your baby!
