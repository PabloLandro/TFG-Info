(NaturalNews) The internet abounds with advice about three popular alternate cancer cures: Oxygen, highly alkaline pH and the combination of baking soda and molasses. Though all three may help combat cancer, each is based on misconceptions.
The oxygen cancer cure
The oxygen cancer cure maintains that cancer cannot survive in the presence of high concentrations of oxygen. That belief dates back to the work of Nobel Laureate Otto Warburg in the 1920s. Though one frequently finds claims that "Warburg proved that cancer cannot survive in the presence of oxygen", that is not what Warburg actually found.
Warburg found that cancer thrived in a low oxygen environment and THAT led him to postulate that cancer might die off if exposed to higher levels of oxygen. However, as natural health authority Dr. Andrew Weil explains, "Dr. Warburg was wrong. Oxygen doesn't slow cancer growth - tumors grow rapidly in tissues well supplied with oxygenated blood."
Cancer cells do not form as a direct result of low oxygen. Cancer cells are formed as part of a body defense mechanism which results from prolonged cellular stress. As part of the process, cancer cells revert to a primitive form of respiration which uses glucose instead of oxygen.
Even though increased oxygen may not kill cancer cells, low oxygen levels can help create an unhealthy cellular terrain which is more susceptible to cancer. Healthy oxygenated blood is vital for a healthy body and immune system which can better battle cancer.
The alkaline cure
Another popular alternative cancer cure maintains that cancer can be cured if a person can elevate their body pH to 8.0 or above for four days. The "alkaline cancer cure" also maintains that cancer will not grow if the body's pH is maintained between 7.0 and 7.5.
In fact, cancer frequently gains a foothold and grows when pH is in or near the normal blood pH levels of 7.35 to 7.45. Typically, body pH drops to around 7.0 in the early stages of cancer and the pH continues to decline as the cancer progresses. Cancer cells convert glucose to lactic acid, which lowers pH. The more cancer cells, the more lactic acid and the lower the pH.
Without a doubt, a healthy alkaline diet can help defeat cancer since it provides important cancer-fighting and immune-boosting compounds as well as helps the body eliminate toxins. As the alkaline diet helps kill off cancer cells, the pH is naturally raised due to the alkalinity of the diet as well as lower production of lactic acid by fewer cancer cells.
The baking soda and molasses cure
Though there are reports of people beating cancer with a combination of baking soda and molasses (or maple syrup), the question is why is molasses or maple syrup needed? The answer usually given is that sugar-loving cancer cells are tricked into taking in the baking soda when they gobble up the molasses or maple syrup.
However, it is impossible to keep a combination of baking soda and molasses/maple syrup intact once it enters the digestive system. Even if the digestive system somehow failed to break the combination down, such a combination would be far too large to enter the bloodstream.
While it can be dicey, baking soda can be used to help defeat some cancers. However, there is no logical reason to include molasses or maple syrup - especially since cancer feeds on sugar.
It is probably worth noting that the man most often cited as an example of beating cancer with a baking soda and molasses combo also incorporated a healthy diet and breathing exercises as part of his protocol.
