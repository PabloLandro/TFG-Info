Can You Take Diovan And Consume Grapefruit?

Question
Asked by Robert G May
Can You Take Diovan And Consume Grapefruit?
Is it safe to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking Diovan?
Answer
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice interactions with prescribed medications are important to look for, especially if you eat a fair number per week.
These interactions occur because grapefruit contains chemicals that interfere with the way your liver metabolizes (or breaks down) drugs.
Diovan, or valsaartan, has a theoretical interaction with grapefruits. It has been suggested that eating grapefruits can decrease the anti-hypertensive (or, blood pressure lowing) effects of your medication.
I would suggest being moderate in your grapefruit ingestion, but certainly, you can enjoy these great citrus fruits. As always, be sure to follow with your doctor regularly about your blood pressure control!
