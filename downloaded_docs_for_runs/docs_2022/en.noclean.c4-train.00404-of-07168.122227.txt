The best thing about dry herb vape pens is that they are very concealable, can fit into your pocket, and fits easily in your hand. These devices allow you to vape on dry herbs for therapy, medical marijuana prescribed by a doctor, and even dry leaf tobacco. You can also find multi-purpose vape pens that, in addition to dry herbs, also allow you to vape e-juices and waxy concentrates (Like V2 Pro Series 3 ). These vape pens, however, are more expensive, so don’t buy a pen with features that you’ll never use.

I’ve got a decent collection of these tanks and a few mods as well now. Been vaping since June and love the reviews on this site the way they’re done. Love that you test most coils and let everyone know where the flavor sweet spot is.
Kandypens has a great reputation based on their wax pens. Only recently did they start making products for use with e-liquids. They have managed to develop one of the best refillable vape pens, which is why it is on the top of our list. Its 280 mAh battery comes with a lifetime warranty!
KandyPens offers a Lifetime Warranty on the life of the batteries of our products. If for any reason your battery stops working please contact our customer support department. Unfortunately, our atomizers are not covered by our lifetime warranty. Most atomizers will need to be replaced over time depending on usage.
The KandyPens Prism makes the best vape pens list because it delivers the goods. It is a proven performer. The only drawback is a light battery of 350 mAh. So you don’t get a long battery life, but you do get enough for a few sessions. The other side of that coin is that you get a real vape pen design. At only 10.5 cm tall and slender diameter, the Prism is inconspicuous and extremely stealthy!
Dry herbs have been used for centuries for meditation, relaxation and medicinal purposes. Certain flowers and herbs can be dried and crushed and then inserted into a vape pen that is capable of vaping them. The vape pen chamber will heat up the dry herbs which will release a vapor which can be inhaled. Certain flowers and herbs have different aromatherapy properties.

The SMOK Alien 220W TC is one of the first mods to feature a squeezable firing system. The device is stealthy for a dual 18650 device. It has a secure locking battery door and a bright OLED screen. The Alien displays all your vital information in a neat and organized fashion.
They are all great box mods, it all depends on what you need them for and how much money you are willing to pay. In my opinion I would go for the Sig 150W TC or the xCube II as they are a tad cheaper than the Snow Wolf.
The Series 3X is available in three different colors – gunmetal, red, and charcoal. Don’t let its minimalistic design confuse you; this is a top-notch dry herb vape pen, one of the best on the market. The flavor is spot on, and the buzz it delivers is pretty much unrivaled when it comes to portable loose leaf pens.
Hey I am new to vaping and I need the greatest vape pen ever. Money is not an issue, I am completely devoted to the sport. I’m not quite a JD Cowan (The greatest VapeGod ever), but I know my stuff. If anyone wants to get together and blow some smoke I am down. #VapeIsLife
In the most recent data, British health officials have found that vaping is at least 95% safer than smoking. They say it is the nicotine addicts, but smoking kills. For that reason alone, many people are making the switch. Vaping is not 100% safe but the name of the game is harm reduction.
These are the type of pens used to vaporize e-liquid, which is a liquid that contains nicotine, commonly referred to as an e-cigarette. They are not cigarettes! Many smokers have been switching over to vaping with vaporizer pens because they find that it satisfies their nicotine craving, and is a much healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes.
Joyetech is known for making some of the original classic vape pens. Now they’re back with a new one that incorporates the latest technology. The eGo AIO ECO is a mouth-to-lung vape pen. It uses 650 mAh battery with a special feature that extends its lifespan by almost double.

Made of medical grade stainless steel, the KandyPens Prism vape pen is designed to last. In fact, it comes with a limited lifetime warranty. You also get two advanced atomizers. A ceramic and dual quartz rod wrapped in titanium coils. Choose from four different temperature settings to personalize your session.
When the vape pen is loaded, the user clicks the single button interface, which heats the coil inside the atomizer. Some vape pens have one temperature, others have multiple presets. Most vapor pens have click controls. For example, with many vape pens, five clicks powers the vaporizer pen on and three clicks toggles temperature. Holding the button down heats the vape pen. At that point, the vaporizer pen coil heats materials at a temperature beneath the point of combustion, creating smoother, smokeless hits. Vape pen heat up time is usually under a minute.
The typical vape pen ranges from $30 to $100. But vapor pens can get cheaper or pricier depending on what you’re looking for. In the vaporizer world, price is pretty much indicative of quality. So the more you pay for a vaporizer pen, the more value you can expect. Keep in mind, cheaper vape pens may not hurt your wallet, but they might not last as long as a pricier vaporizer.
Also try the Wismec RX200. Its a 200W device with temp control takes 3 18650 batteries. it might look like a big mod but it fits in the hand perfect. i have small hands and it feels good. And the best part about this device is that its only round $50.
Vape pens function and also look nearly identical to an electronic cigarette. They really could pass as just an upscale ecig. Both contain a battery-powered atomizer that vaporizes material, but instead of nicotine, vape pens vaporize dry herbs, wax, and oils.
The most important factor, but also most difficult to figure out, is whether or not the pen is worth the price. Read the reviews to make sure that any vape pen is worth the investment you’re putting in. You want to make sure that it will have the effect you want and last for a long time. Look for companies that stand behind their product with a warranty.
Hey guys. I’m looking to do an upgrade. I have the iStick TC40W with an Atlantis V2. The battery life sucks and I’m just not getting quite the flavor out of the combo that I was told I would get. I’m looking for something a lot better, keeping short of rebuilding coils and dripping. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
We made sure to include the best starter vape pens in this list so that even beginners can pick one up confidently and run with it. That’s because there’s no steep learning curve and all that’s necessary is to load up the material, press the fire button, and inhale. Piece of cake, really.
Gypsy Tantrum – Watermelon, Strawberry and Kiwi topped with a touch of Cream Pinkie – Strawberry Frosted Yellow Cake Paladin – Crisp Apple, sweet Raspberry and ripe Blueberry topped with a hint of exotic Dragon Fruit. High Wire – We paired Watermelon and Honey Dew, drizzled it with Mango Puree and then topped it off with Fresh Strawberries.
That depends on your coil ohms and batteries actually, you can’t just say no duel 18650 would because if you have your ohms low enough you can get the watts high enough but it would increase amp draw so batteries would have to be high quality.
When choosing e-liquids, you have the option of different levels of nicotine strength, i.e., 0% up to 2.4% or even more. The freedom to choose nicotine level, a variety of flavors and ease of use are the factors that make e-liquid vape pens very popular.
