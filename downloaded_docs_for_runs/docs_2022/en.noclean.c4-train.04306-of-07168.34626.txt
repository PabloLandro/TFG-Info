Mens Marijuana Addiction Treatment Center
In the United States, people use weed more than any other illicit drug. Some states have even made recreational pot legal. These changes have led some to no longer associate this drug with consequences such as addiction. But finding a mens marijuana addiction treatment center is more important than ever.
The Reality of Weed Addiction
People refer to marijuana by many names. Aside from weed, these names include pot, Mary Jane, and grass. The drug comes from the cannabis plant, which grows different strains. The government lists it as a schedule I drug because it has a high potential for abuse.
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chemical in weed that produces the high that most people seek. They can smoke it or add it to foods for ingestion. However, it can cause side effects such as:
Breathing problems
Depression
Dizziness
Increased heart rate
Memory loss
Psychosis
Some people even develop lung infections. With repeated use, they can have trouble thinking, and some form of dependence can develop. At this point, their brains adapt to dependence on weed to function. Tolerance is a sign of dependence, which means that they have to use more and more marijuana to achieve the desired high.
A mens marijuana addiction treatment center is necessary to overcome this problem. Addiction develops when they begin to experience issues related to smoking weed but can’t stop using it. They continuously crave it and can become irritable and depressed when they don’t get it. The cravings can also cause physical symptoms such as stomach tightness.
With a marijuana addiction, using pot takes priority over going to work, school or even important family events. It also causes serious behavioral and mental health issues that disrupt people’s lives. However, withdrawal is a challenge even for those who want to stop using. Symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue make it difficult not to use again.
Care at a Mens Marijuana Addiction Treatment Center
Men can seek weed addiction treatment through a residential or outpatient program. In a residential setting, they stay at a rehab center and receive 24-hour supervision with medical care. An outpatient setting gives them the freedom to tend to their family, career or educational obligations. They only visit the facility for scheduled treatment.
Since not everyone responds the same to treatments, a mens marijuana addiction treatment center uses a variety of methods. It begins with a full mental and physical assessment to determine the level of care that men need. Then, the staff members can personalize their treatment plans according to those needs.
Detox is the first step in weed addiction treatment. The staff members help clients through marijuana withdrawal. Medications and holistic activities can reduce cravings and improve sleep, depression, and irritability. With this assistance, men can avoid using pot.
The Objectives of Weed Addiction Treatment
Building motivation is a primary goal for treating weed addiction. Working toward this objective begins during detox and continues into therapy. Men participate in one-on-one and group sessions that foster hope and social support. During this time, they recognize how to improve their lives and develop skills that help them with relapse prevention skills.
A mens marijuana addiction treatment center specifically adjusts its program to target the needs of men. It works to address the challenges and pressures that are unique to the gender.
For instance, many men are survivors of childhood sexual crimes. However, society as a whole puts pressure on them to be strong and contain their emotions. Because of that, a lot of men avoid asking for help because they feel undeserved guilt or shame. This and other stereotypes are the issues that a male-only program can help them deal with to achieve recovery.
