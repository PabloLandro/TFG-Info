Masking Tape Removal?
Anyone have a really good and hopefully quick way to remove OLD masking tape from stainless steel trim? Picked up a few pieces for my current project that has masking tape on it that is probably at least 30 years old and really HARD. Thinking of soaking it with a wet rag and keeping it wet for several days. Don't want to take a chance on scratching the stainless. Never ran across trim with masking tape on it this old before, usually a bit of brake clean and some rubbing with a cloth has worked for me in the past.

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
I think soaking it is a good idea. If that doesn't work well you can try using a heat gun.

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
WD -40 or any type of oil even vegetable oil will soften the glue

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
I would try wrapping it in cellophane after soaking it in a good penetrating fluid....NOT WD40! Leave it a week or so and test it.
The solvents should dissingrate the old tape enough to soften it to scrape it off with a plastic tool.
Don't worry too much about damaging the stainless as it can be polished and repaired easily as it's very durable and hard. Not at all like chrome.

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
That’s one of the things I love about SS it is solid metal not plated and you’ll probably want to have it polished to freshen it up when you’re done getting the tape off

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
Thanks for the replies, think I will wrap some water soaked rags around it and then cover that with some cellophane to keep the moisture in. See how that works after several days and then maybe try something a bit harsher. Will report back with how it works out.

all good suggestions, I use goo gone in the house, wd40 in the garage, and 3m at work for similar tasks..
key is dissolving the adhesive so it can be easily wiped clean without harsh mechanical scraping or rubbing..
for the naysayer on wd40 cleaning stainless, just google it, popular remedy for many ss applications..
I as well as many others I've worked with have used wd40 to clean our stainless steel tops, drawer guards and paint..
if it wasn't absolutely safe, we wouldn't be hosing down our $10,000+ tool boxes
this box is about 20 years old and still shines like new..been bathed in gallons of wd40 over the years

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
To the wd40 endorser, wd40 evaporates which would dry out while trying to soak the 30 year old mummified tape so that it would soften it enough to remove it.
Glad you like wd40 but it's not a cure all.

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
hmmm, the wd40 won't evaporate before dissolving the adhesive and it will soak through the dried up tape backing..
using wd40, goo gone, 3m adhesive remover, etc. is not a soak for days and come back to it, they all work fairly quickly..
let them soak a couple of minutes, gently wipe, rinse, repeat until it's all gone.. no need to leave any of it on there for days..
and while I agree, wd40 is not a cure all, but it is a great tool for cleaning stainless steel
it's also widely known with several articles published..

Using WD-40
WD-40 is a handy product known for making adhesive removal a breeze. Even better, it’s not only safe for stainless steel, but it will provide a beautiful polish!
so in conclusion, while it may not be your preference, it's not necessary to advise against it

Didn't realize WD40 had such a loyal following...didn't mean to offend, my sincere apologies to all.

Re: Masking Tape Removal?
I know a guy who uses WD-40 for arthritis. It may be a mental thing for him but he swears by it. Go figure?
