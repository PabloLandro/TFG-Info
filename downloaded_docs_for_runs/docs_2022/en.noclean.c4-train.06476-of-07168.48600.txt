Fish Oil
Fish oil is a natural health supplement taken as a source of omega 3 fats. It is mainly used to lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the body.
A lot of nootropic enthusiasts opt for this supplement for its benefits at a relatively affordable price. Fish oil is not made up of one single chemical. It has different elements that when combined become beneficial to our bodies.

What is Fish Oil
Fish oil is a popular term used to refer to two types of omega 3 fatty acids, mainly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). You can easily obtain these omega 3 fatty acids from animal products, phytoplankton and in fish.
Fish oil is highly recommended as a resource of omega 3 fats as it’s the most common source and it’s also cheap to buy.
This supplement can offer fantastic benefits, particularly when the ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are equal in the body.
You can get omega-6 fatty acids from eggs and red meat. To balance the ratio, you need to take a fish oil supplement.
Having the right ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids reduces your risk of diabetes, lowers lipid count, assures you of healthier blood vessels and decreases the risk of contracting different forms of cancer.
Furthermore, a proper ratio of these fatty acids can significantly lower your stress levels.
It’s important to note that fish oil can lessen triglyceride levels. Nonetheless, it can also increase cholesterol levels in the body. It is, therefore, important to take caution when using fish oil.
Supplements similar to fish oil include krill oil and flaxseed oil. These supplements contain both DHA and EPA fatty acids that decrease the risk of strokes and improve cardiovascular function.
Fish oil is available for sale online and in different retail stores. It’s available in capsule form.
Safe for adults use, fish oil improves blood flow to the brain, helps to reduce anxiety and promotes cardiovascular health among other benefits.

Editor’s Note
Users of fish oil praise the supplement for its ability to improve cardiovascular health. I appreciate the fact that fish oil is a natural supplement derived from different types of fish rather than manufactured.
A study conducted on mice showed that fish oil could alleviate symptoms of Parkinson’s disease when artificially induced.
I would gladly take fish oil every day thanks to its anti-inflammatory ability. My diet mainly consists of high fast carb and fats which promote inflammation in all parts of the body. I find fish oil beneficial as it corrects imbalances in my diet and leaves me feeling energized and with a great mood.
I am yet to notice any significant changes to my brain in any visible way. The truth is that I have not taken enough time to research and read more on fish oil and its impact on how my brain feels or operates.
I’m a little apprehensive of the effects I have been feeling such as belching and a mild skin rash.
Nonetheless, I am willing to take fish oil, and I am comfortable recommending it to others for its long term effects on my brain, muscle strength and cholesterol levels.
Fish Oil Reviews
There are countless reviews and support online from users who are fish oil enthusiasts. Although there are occasional complaints of stomach problems, muscle pains and bloating or users lacking any real effect from the use of fish oil, the positive response is a lot more.
Fish oil is embraced by top athletes in their respective sports. All have seen noticeable improvements.
Jessica Zelinka, an Olympic track and field athlete says:
“It tasted great and my 3- year-old daughter loves to take her omegas every morning.”
It’s common to notice reduced inflammation and increased focus when taking fish oil supplements.

Benefits and effects
Fish oil is a well-researched supplement, and the findings are quite conclusive. While the benefits may vary based on the scientific research carried out, it’s clearly an enhancement that has certain effects.
In one study, it was found that lower levels of omega-3s positively correlated with violent crime. Researchers suspected this had to do with proper development of the prefrontal cortex, which largely determines our judgment ability. There was also a lot of evidence that fish oil was neuroprotective – that it helped to curb disease and keep the brain running properly. In this study with mice, it was shown to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson’s disease when it was artificially induced.
Besides this research, there is plenty available – all showing the benefits of fish oil on our brains and even overall health.
Some of the renowned benefits include:
Cognitive function and improved mood
Anti-inflammation and neuroprotection
Bone health support
Weight loss
Cognitive function and improved mood
Research carried out suggests that fish oil enhances memory through increased cerebral oxygenation and increased blood flow to the brain. Additionally, fish oil can prevent cognitive decline.
Fish oil levels also support the levels of serotonin in the body which enhances one’s mood. Studies also carried out suggest that fish oil can help manage stress and depression.
Anti-inflammation and neuroprotection
Fish oil contains DHA, a type of fatty acid that acts as a precursor to NPDI, an anti-inflammatory component that works as a neuroprotective.
The brain experienced inflammation due to increased stress levels, high gluten in the diet and even consumption of excess sugar.
Fish oil has EPA which has vasodilatory effects and helps reduce inflammation.
Moreover, this supplement’s neuroprotective effects can mitigate early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. When DHA and EPA are paired with other components such as monophosphate, choline and uridine can significantly influence formation in the brain.
Bone Health Support
As you grow older, bones become weaker and begin to thin and this can lead to osteoporosis and in some cases, arthritis. Fortunately, you can curb the effects of old age by taking fish oil supplements.
Studies prove that intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids supports healthy bones. Getting a good ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is essential if you’re looking to maintain the right bone-mineral density.
Weight loss
The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition May 2007 issue published a study examining the effects of fish oil.
Australian researchers found out that combination of regular exercise and fish oil supplements can lower body fat while improving metabolic functionality and heart health.
The group that took the fish supplements had lowered triglycerides, improved blood flow and increased HDL cholesterol.
Another study had some volunteers consume 6 grams of fish oil each day for 3 weeks and consume the same diet.
The researchers concluded that fish oil was able to reduce body fat and produce energy from the use of fatty acids.

How It Works
Interestingly, the body does not produce its omega-3 fatty acids nor can it manufacture omega -3 fatty acids from outside sources of omega-6 fatty acids.
Fish oil works in various ways to significantly impact the brain. The supplement contains DHA and EPA fatty acids which promote blood flow and increased oxygenation to the brain.
These fatty acids are also responsible for preventing cognitive decline and enhancing one’s memory.
Fish oil also works by balancing the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids within the body. The balance of these fatty acids helps to reduce inflammation.
Most western diets are made up of a lot of omega-6 fatty acids which may contribute to a variety of health problems. Both fatty acids should be at a ratio of 1:1 to prevent inflammation.
The other fish oil mechanism of action is to produce compounds such as NPDI, which is found in DHA, a neuroprotective agent. This explains why fish oil may be helpful for heart-related conditions
more
Dosage
The dosage of fish oil depends on your goals for supplementation. The American Heart Association recommends 1000mg (1g) daily.
However, if you’re looking to take fish oil for general physical and cognitive health benefits, you can take a dosage of 250mg on a daily basis.
A starting dosage of 500 mg of EPA and 1000mg DHA is sufficient t for neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement, for related muscle pains and aches, a dosage of 6 mg is recommended.
Fish oil supplements should be taken with meals to avoid related burping.
Do not take in more supplements than what is recommended. Avoid taking fish oil supplements longer than it is recommended.
One point to note is that you shouldn’t be taking fish oil if you are on anticoagulant or blood thinning medications as the supplement has a tendency to have an easing effect on blood clotting. It may be wise to consult a medical professional to determine a dose that best suits you.
When taking fish oil supplements, avoid eating food high in cholesterol. Stay away from alcohol as it can increase triglycerides in your body and worsen your condition.
Fish oil supplements are among the easiest ones to find, being available in grocery store aisles, vitamin shops, and of course plenty of places online. Look in any of these places, and you’ll have no problem! The price is fairly inexpensive – you can get around 180 softgels (the usual form) for $10 in most venues, depending on the brand.
more
Side Effects
Fish oil users report few side effects. Most of the compounds in the fish oil capsule are mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
The side effects are mild and rare. The primary concern was mercury levels in fish based supplements.
However, researchers have allayed fears that most fish oil supplements are free from toxic levels of mercury. Non-predatory fish as sardines, cod liver and mackerel are considered good sources of fish oil.
Other unintended side effects of fish oil include mild skin rash, belching, back pain and an unpleasant taste in the mouth.
more
Stacking
Fish oil is already a potent nootropic on its own. Nonetheless, you can get additional benefits from the supplement by stacking with Noopept to make sure you have improved memory, mental clarity, less social anxiety and vocabulary recollection.
Stacking up fish oil, vitamin B12, vitamin E, uridine and CDP Choline works to repair dopamine receptors, giving you the ability to retain more information and reduce your anxiety levels.
For cognitive enhancement, try pairing tyrosine, fish oil, piracetam, carnitine, magnesium with choline. This combination reduces your over reliance on energy drinks and caffeine. Choline makes the stack more powerful by enhancing the effects of the fish oil.
If you’re looking to get some good dopamine going, try stacking up sulbutiamine, fish oil. Tyrosine, Vitamin C and Vitamin B6.
more
Alternatives
While fish oil is one of the best -known nootropics on the market, not everybody may be comfortable taking it because they follow a vegan diet. Some may find its taste unusual.
Here are some alternatives you may want to consider.
Krill oil
Krill oil contains omega-3 fatty acids in a double chain phospholipid structure. This makes them bioavailable compared with those found in fish oil.
Moreover, krill oil has Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant that improves bioavailability. Astaxanthin also protects the skin from ultraviolet light.
Flaxseed oil
Rich in ALA, a compound of omega-3 fats, flaxseed oil is a great alternative for vegans. You can even mix ground flaxseed with your cereal, yogurt or even oatmeal to get your recommended daily intake of ALA.
Canola oil
While it may not be as potent as flaxseed oil, canola oil gives you 11% of recommended ALA intake on a daily basis. It is important to note that canola oil is high in calories and you shouldn’t rely too heavily on it.

Closing Thoughts
Fish oil is a natural supplement that can significantly improve cognitive function as well as cardiovascular health for people of all ages while working to protect one against inflammation and stress related disorders.
Although it may take some time to see the effects of fish oil, it has proven beneficial to those in old age, athletes, students and even employees.
