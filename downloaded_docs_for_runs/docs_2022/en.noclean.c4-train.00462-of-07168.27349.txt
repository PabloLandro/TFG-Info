Course : MOC Part IV: Counseling for Inherited Cancer Risk
Inherited predisposition to cancer may be seen in approximately 5-10% of patients with cancer, particularly those involving breast and ovarian cancer, colon cancer, and uterine cancer. Genetic consultation for inherited cancer risk provides valuable information regarding potential risk of cancer development and the value of genetic testing. Persons found to have deleterious mutations in known cancer syndrome genes may benefit from risk reduction strategies, including prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, and/or increased cancer surveillance. Additionally, patients may benefit from a cancer risk assessment to provide tailored screening, even when a mutation in a known cancer syndrome gene cannot be identified.
