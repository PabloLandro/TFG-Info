Omega-3 Fish Oil, HDL Cholesterol, and Triglyceride Levels
Jul122015
Heart HealthOmega 3
Why was this study done?
Consuming fish on a regular basis has a positive benefit for cardiovascular health. It is thought that the reason for this relationship is that Omega-3 fish oils improve blood lipid (cholesterol, triglyceride) levels. This study was designed to investigate the relationship of differing doses of omega-3 fish oil (1, 3, 6 grams a day) on typical cardiovascular risk factors.
What did the study find?
The 1-gram/day dose did not alter EPA status significantly following 4 weeks of supplementation. The 3-gram/day dose was sufficient to alter EPA status, but only the 6-gram/day dose was able to significantly reduced triglycerides and increased HDL.
Effect of Low Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Plasma Fatty Acids and Lipids.
