Collagen is the most abundant protein in our body comprising 90% of our connective tissue and 90% of organic bone matrix. By age 21, our body’s collagen supply begins to decline1, which overtime is the source of joint and bone degradation that lead to arthritis, osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis. Science has shown that oral supplementation with collagen can prevent and reverse the effects of this collagen loss by supporting the rebuilding of our bones and joints. Additionally, collagen has proven benefits in alleviating joint pain and injuries associated with exercise and high impact activities. Clinical trials have shown daily supplementation with collagen can reduce joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation, improve mobility and flexibility, build bone matrix, and speed recovery from injury. Learn more about the uses of collagen for joint pain and collagen inflammation benefits below.
Collagen Benefits for Alleviating Arthritis and Osteoarthritis
Increasing collagen in your body through collagen protein supplementation can tackle the root cause of arthritis and osteoarthritis and may help alleviate its symptoms. The root cause of arthritis is inflammation, which triggers a more rapid breakdown of collagen in the extracellular matrix of joint cells. This rapid breakdown of collagen in the joints leads to joint pain, stiffness, and loss of flexibility. Supplementation with collagen has been clinically proven to reduce the painful symptoms of arthritis to help maintain quality of life as we age.
Reduces Joint Pain, Stiffness, and Inflammation
Supplement with collagen powder for joint health can really help! Many clinical studies have shown supplementation with collagen peptides leads to significant reductions in arthritis induced joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation. In one trial, patients receiving 5-7 grams of collagen hydrolysate daily for 1-6 months demonstrated a 70% response rate for significant or noticeable improvement in joint pain2. In another study, collagen proved 25% more effective in reducing osteoarthritis pain and stiffness compared to other anti-inflammatories such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate3.
Improves Mobility and Flexibility
Another benefit of collagen powder for joints is in improving mobility and flexibility. Studies of arthritis patients supplementing with collagen found that mobility in movements such as knee extension, walking, sitting, and standing improved greatly. Specifically, when measured on a functional index, joint and body flexibility improved and subjects were able to exercise longer before experiencing joint pain4.
Collagen Benefits for Activity and Sports Induced Joint Pain and Injuries
Improves Activity – Induced Joint Pain
High impact activities (e.g. running, skiing, HIIT), high intensity sports (e.g. basketball, tennis, soccer), as well as repetitive exercises (e.g. weight lifting, yoga, cycling), all exert stress on joints and can lead to damaged tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. In a study among healthy subjects who experienced activity-related joint pain, supplementation with collagen for joint pain resulted in improved joint function and flexibility after 120 days while exercising and increased duration of exercise before pain was experienced5.
Reduces Injury Recovery Time
Research shows collagen synthesis – the body’s production of new collagen molecules – is key to healing connective tissue injuries. Collagen synthesis is heightened for the first three weeks following injury in order to regenerate protein fibers. Type III collagen synthesis reaches maximum rates during the first week after injury in order to regenerate flexibility and plasticity of connective tissue. Type 1 collagen synthesis rates then increase during the next few weeks to strengthen the tissue. Supplementation with collagen hydrolysate ensures the body has a proper supply of both types of collagen to quickly and effectively heal damaged connective tissue6.
Collagen Builds Stronger Bones and Teeth
Collagen Builds Bone Matrix
90% of the organic component of our bones is comprised of collagen. Collagen fibers form the protein matrix in our bones while calcium is embedded within this matrix to provide rigidity. Studies show that as we age, our bones can lose 50% of their strength and have a 35% loss in elasticity as a result of collagen loss1. Any breakdown of bone collagen directly causes a loss of bone strength. Clinical research has also shown that daily supplementation with collagen peptides can increase bone mineral density, especially in calcium-deficient or osteopenic subjects7. Bone mineral density is key to preventing bone fractures.
Collagen Strengthens Teeth
Type III collagen is the main protein component of teeth8. Collagen loss with age can cause increased tooth sensitivity and decreased tooth strength. Collagen supplementation can help with building stronger teeth.

I had surgery on my c-5,6&7 also L-5,6&7. I am still having pain and muscle stiffness. Sometimes I still have difficulty walking. Will collagen help me. And does it help with nerve damage?
Thank you

Thanks for the question. It can take up to 3 months for someone to feel the full benefits of collagen supplementation. However, lots of people report decreased joint pain within a days or weeks. Good luck!
