For those aware of eNode Antennas, also known as MicroCells, there is a petition to Telus that people are welcome to sign. If you are new to the subject, these are very strong antennas placed on telephone poles close to homes. Some antennas are pointed directly at homes. For more information please see this page all about these antennas in various areas of southern BC and the Island. http://emrabc.ca/?page_id=7536

E-2141 (TELECOMMUNICATIONS)
42nd Parliament
Initiated by Richard Bernier from Drummondville, Quebec, on April 18, 2019, at 3:04 p.m. (EDT
https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-2141&fbclid=IwAR3vT6rEM20XYlnk_PCnX6qqy_pCSF3AxbiM71lBj3VGpHPegImqFnpdVQ4
The Petition is open for signature until August 16, 2019, at 3:04 p.m. (EDT)
PETITION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
Whereas:
Wi-Fi systems and 5G technology have very harmful effects on human, animal and environmental health;
Wi-Fi systems and 5G technology seem to be especially harmful to newborns, children, people who are ill and seniors;
5G technology is similar to, but worse than, the problems that have already been linked to early generations of telephones because it uses pulses of waves;
On January 1, 2019, 247 scientists in 42 countries recommended a moratorium on the deployment of 5G technology in the telecommunications sector;
A major study by the National Toxicology Program in the United States showed that rats exposed to waves developed cancers;
The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) opposes the installation of cellular towers and antennas on their firehalls for health reasons;
The precautionary principle is not implemented seriously or rigorously; and
Since 5G technology was deployed in New York City, a number of people and their pets have fallen ill.
We, the undersigned, concerned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the House of Commons to enact a moratorium, or temporary halt, on implementation of 5G communication technology across Canada until an independent House of Commons-mandated team of qualified researchers has proven that the dangers of 5G technology to human, animal and environmental health are in fact minimal and have no serious consequences.
Please publicize the U.S. National Toxicology Program results that wireless radiation causes DNA breakage and cancer

Please stop enabling enode antennas and microcells in our neighbourhoods. Your are contaminating our lives! Please STOP! and REMOVE ANY THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE!
YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION to do so FROM THE PEOPLE AFFECTED!
Be a leader for the industry in finding solutions to contamination of all the population with these dangerous devices.
