The Top 8 Health Benefits Of Ginger Tea

An old Indian proverb states “Everything good is found in ginger”. In Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, the ginger root has been used for many thousands of years for its powerful health benefits. A cup of tea brewed from fresh ginger root can help you with many conditions, while making for a very aromatic and enjoyable beverage. Here are just some of the numerous health benefits of ginger tea.
1. GINGER TEA RELIEVES NAUSEA AND STOMACH ACHES
Ginger tea has long been known as a very effective remedy for nausea and an upset stomach. When suffering from motion sickness or discomfort from travel, a nice cup of fresh ginger tea may be all that you need to calm your stomach down. Ginger’s ability to relieve nausea also makes it a great option for helping with morning sickness.
2. GINGER TEA IMPROVES BLOOD CIRCULATION
Ginger tea contains a host of valuable vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that all help to improve blood circulation throughout the body, supporting better overall health. Together with improved circulation, drinking ginger tea may also help to decrease the risk of cardiovascular issues. It is believed that ginger can prevent the clogging of arteries, which helps in preventing heart attack and stoke.
3. GINGER TEA HELPS WITH SORE MUSCLES
The underlying cause for painful, sore muscles is very often inflammation. Ginger has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that help it relieve these aches and pains. A study from 2010 published in The Journal of Pain confirmed the effectiveness of ginger in this regard. For the study, they had subjects engage in heavy weight-training to induce sore muscles, and then gave one test group real ginger and the other a placebo for comparison. The study found that those who took ginger found relief from their muscle pain, while those who received the placebo didn’t see any beneficial effect. As such, ginger tea can be looked at as a beneficial post-workout drink as well.
4. GINGER TEA HELPS WITH MENSTRUAL PAIN
Ginger can be a great natural remedy for women who suffer from menstrual cramping and pain. The renowned BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine published a study some years back where researchers examined 120 females dealing with painful menstrual cramps during their periods. Again, one group was given ginger while the other received a placebo. It was found that those women who received ginger experienced much less and shorter-lasting menstrual pain than the control group.
5. GINGER TEA CAN RELIEVE JOINT PAIN
Ginger has been found to be a powerful tool to help relieve joint pain from those suffering from arthritis. A highly concentrated ginger extract was compared to a placebo in 247 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The ginger reduced pain and stiffness in the knee joint by 40% over the placebo, leaving little doubt about its effectiveness for muscle and joint problems. To use ginger as a home remedy for your aching joints, you can drink ginger tea, but you can also make a tincture to concentrate its effects.
6. GINGER TEA HELPS WITH RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS
Ginger has powerful anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, which make it the ideal home remedy for the common cold. It is a great natural way to relieve symptoms such as a sore throat and congestion. Furthermore, ginger can be a prophylactic measure to prevent viruses and bacteria from causing respiratory illness. Likewise, ginger has been shown to be very effective with soothing breathing problems due to environmental allergies.
7. GINGER TEA CAN HELP WITH MIGRAINES AND STRESS
Stress can often be a primary reason for migraines and tension headaches. A hot cup of ginger tea may be just the right thing to help you calm down and get rid of stress. Migraine sufferers and those dealing with stress-related headaches often report that ginger helps them. And the best thing is, ginger does it with zero side effects and many other benefits!
8. GINGER TEA STIMULATES APPETITE
Ginger has long been applied as a digestive aid. It contains valuable compounds that stimulate hunger and can help the stomach recover from illness or nausea. Many times, all you need to do is drink a cup of fresh ginger tea to bring back your appetite.
In all, ginger tea presents valuable applications on the human body that have been lauded for millennia. The only way to find out what ginger tea can do for you is to try it for yourself!
