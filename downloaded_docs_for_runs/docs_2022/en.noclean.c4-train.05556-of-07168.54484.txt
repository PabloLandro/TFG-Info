Facts and Myths About Morphine Addiction
Morphine Facts/Myths / 25/02/2019 25/02/2019
There is a lot of misinformation surrounding morphine, which can cause harm to individuals dealing with addiction and others that simply want pain relief. You may be hesitant to take morphine, and for a good reason, but it is vital that you know the facts. Let’s look at some common debunked myths and introduce you to some morphine facts.
Myth: Morphine Automatically Causes Addictions
You are not likely to get addicted to morphine, which means becoming dependent on the drug itself. Many factors cause people to develop addictions, from genetics to childhood trauma. If you need relief from pain, you should be aware that tolerance builds up quickly in the body. It is not wise to stop taking morphine altogether if you have been taking it for more than two weeks, as this can cause symptoms of withdrawal.
Fact: Opium Used to be Smoked in the Late 1800s
It could be purchased legally and didn’t require a prescription, but it was banned from San Francisco in 1875 when pregnant women began smoking it. Even in its early days, opium was found to have a harmful effect on women, unborn children, and to cause problems in the lives of both individuals and families alike.
Myth: Taking Morphine will Cause it to Stop Working Later
This is simply not the way morphine works. You can use the drug to safely and effectively manage pain throughout the day. If the pain is not alleviated, your dose may need to be adjusted by your doctor.
Fact: Morphine Was Used to Replace Other Addictions
Morphine is derived from opium, and in the 1800s a German pharmacist discovered its properties. Once its effects were proven to the world, morphine came to become a substitute for addictions like alcohol and opium – the original wonder drug.
Myth: Morphine Has a Lot of Negative Side Effects
Opiates tend to cause symptoms like drowsiness, constipation, and nausea, but these symptoms often subside within a few days as you adjust to the drug. Any signs that do not go away can be treated, such as constipation.
Fact: Heroin Was Developed to Replace Morphine
The highly addictive drug heroin was made by scientists to fight the growing morphine epidemic. Although heroin is also made from opium, it was thought to be a good drug when used to wean users off morphine. It was then added to cough medicine and given to children to help with coughs and the common cold. However, scientists only created a new addiction.
