Omega-3 Fatty Acids

New research on omega-3 fatty acids, an oil produced by very cold water fish, show that in humans minimize the risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and the formation of cholesterol.
Omega-3 fatty acids is very important because it helps our arteries more elastic by reducing the risk of hardening of the arteries. On the other hand, if we eat foods rich in Omega 3, we have no chance to make cholesterol, which is generated by the intake of saturated fat.
Also, consumption of foods containing omega 3 fatty acids will help children to have greater visual acuity and best development of the retina and nervous system. For this reason, we recommend eating fish 2-3 times per week for pregnant women.
Omega-3 fatty acids are very important in the development and function of the central nervous system. Omega-3 fatty acids help decrease inflammation, and some omega-6 fatty acids tend to promote inflammation. The typical American diet tends to contain 14-25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids. The fatty acids affect cell feed and may have some effect on those affected cells or inflamed condition of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Better protected cells are less likely to become inflamed.
What fish contain higher content of Omega-3 fatty acids?
The coldwater fish and deep sea fish. Among the most common fish that can be mentioned are: tuna, mackerel, sardines, salmon, trout, smoothhound and threshing. Shellfish also contain Omega 3.
Fish are known to be the best source of Omega 3 fatty acids. Fish provide varying amounts of omega3 fatty acids in the form of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fish oil, on the other hand, contains ALA but also lots of EPA and DHA. Fish oil is a direct source of EPA and DHA, so the question of whether or not ALA can efficiently be converted to EPA and DHA becomes obsolete. However, only 30% of the cholesterol comes from food because 70% is produced by the body itself.
