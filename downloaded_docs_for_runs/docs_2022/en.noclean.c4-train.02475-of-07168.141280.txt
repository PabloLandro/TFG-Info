Parent Information
Berkley parents are very involved and our community cares – and that makes all the difference.
Our parents believe in an education which prepares our students with well-rounded opportunities and challenging experiences necessary for individuals to succeed in life. As one parent put it, Berkley provides “life-prep.” Related to that, the level of commitment and quality of our PTAs throughout the district is impressive with a focus on academic achievement and post-secondary education opportunities for all students.

Resources on Vaping
Resources On Vaping
Vaping has recently become a widespread problem at many middle schools and high schools across the region and nation. Below is some information and resources, provided by the Tri-Community Coalition, to help parents to have a better understanding of the problem and tips for prevention .
What is Vaping?
Vaping is inhaling a water vapor that is produced by a battery-powered electronic cigarette, commonly referred to as an e-cigarette. The device has a cartridge of fluid, e-liquid or e-juice, which often contains nicotine and/or flavoring. The liquid is heated and converted into a mist that people inhale or “vape.” Currently, vapes or e-cigarettes are most commonly used by teens and young adults, more common than smoking cigarettes.
The 2015 National Youth Tobacco Survey found that 16 percent of high school kids vape. That means vaping has surpassed cigarette use in teenagers. It’s important to learn the facts about vaping so you can educate your kids about the risks. With names that make them sound like candy—like “Mint Chocolate” and “Frozen Lime Drop”—many young people report that they have used vapes or e-cigarettes because they are curious to test out these new flavors for themselves. They also believe that they are less harmful or are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products.The American Academy of Pediatrics warns, “e-cigarettes are threatening to addict a new generation to nicotine.” The AAP recommends stricter laws to reduce minors from accessing e-cigarettes. They even recommend that the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, be increased to age 21 nationwide. Nicotine may be more harmful to adolescents than adults. Brain development continues through about age 25 and nicotine may harm the developing brain.Even e-cigarettes that don’t contain nicotine can be harmful. The surgeon general warns that e-cigarettes may contain other potentially harmful ingredients, including Volatile organic compounds;
Heavy metals such as nickel, lead, and tin;
Ultrafine particles that could be inhaled deep into the lungs; and
Flavorants such as diacetyl, a chemical that has been linked to lung disease.
E-cigarettes or vapes should be considered a gateway substance as they can also be used to deliver other drugs. A study published in the medical journal, Pediatrics, found that 1 in 5 high school students used e-cigarettes to vape concentrated THC extracted from marijuana, called hash oil. Vaping hash oil, which is analogous to “freebasing marijuana” causes an intense rapid high and increases the risk of addiction. It also increases the risk of severe side effects such as panic attacks and hallucinations.
Here are Some Important Key Points:
Long-term implications of vape/e-cigarette use including nicotine addiction are not known fully.
Many of the flavor water vapes are very high in nicotine.
The devices are very undetectable and often look like pens, highlighters or USB devices.
These devices are easy to purchase in local retail stores, online and from other students selling them at school.
Students are vaping at home, in cars, and at school, unaware of the harm, the addictive nature of the nicotine and in the chemicals that the flavored vape water is treated with.
Vapes/e-cigarettes are gateway delivery system of substances that can lead students to use traditional cigarettes, marijuana, etc.
Student perception and wanting to fit-in can mean that many more students are likely to try vaping than the data suggests.
Signs Your Teen is Vaping:
If you suspect your teen might be vaping, chances are your instincts are right. Check for: The scent. You might begin to smell bubble gum, candy, tropical or other flavored scents wafting through the room even if your teenager has nothing in his or her mouth at the time. Don’t worry. You’re not imagining things. This sweet-smelling aroma may be the after-effects of cloud vapor. Vaping e-juices come in nearly any flavor combination imaginable. And teens tend to prefer the sweeter vape products.
“Pens” that aren’t pens. E-cigarettes or vaporizers can look like many things; thumb drives, or pens, or like a stylus. If you spot something along these lines, take a closer look, and if there are holes on each end, you’ve probably got an e-cig or a vape on your hands.
Lots of bathroom breaks, closed-door time in their rooms (more than usual), looking for or asking for additional chargers (many vape devices require charging the batteries).
Copious sipping of liquids. One major ingredient in the vaporized liquid in e-cigs is propylene glycol, which is “hygroscopic” – meaning it attracts and holds water molecules from its environment, like the mouth. This can lead users to have a constant state of dry mouth, which can be alleviated by quaffing more drinks.
Nosebleeds. The water-holding effect of e-cig vapor can also dry out the nasal passages, leading to bloody noses.
Bloodshot eyes. There aren’t many physical signs that a teen is vaping, but bloodshot eyes can be a clue.
Irritability. If your teen is moodier than usual, it could be a sign of nicotine withdrawal.
Dry skin is another common side effect.
What Can Parents Do?
Talk to your teen about vaping and e-cigarettes.Your teen is likely to think e-cigarettes are much cooler than traditional cigarettes and your teen may insist you don’t know what you’re talking about since e-cigarettes probably weren’t around when you were young. But it’s important to hold conversations about the dangers of vaping. Most teens think e-cigarettes are harmless.Look for opportunities to bring up the subject of vaping naturally. Strike up a conversation when you see someone vaping or when you pass an e-cigarette shop. Get the conversation rolling by asking a question like, “Do kids at your school smoke e-cigarettes?” Here are some key talking points you might want to incorporate into your discussion:
Your brain is still developing until about age 25. Using nicotine as a teen could be harmful to your brain.
Using nicotine may make it harder for you to learn or to control your impulses.
Nicotine may cause you to become more easily addicted to harder drugs.
E-cigarettes that don’t contain nicotine still contain other harmful chemicals that are bad for your brain and your body.
Hold specific conversations about how to resist peer pressure so your teen has a plan for what they can say if offered an e-cigarette.
If your teen ever finds himself or herself in a situation where people are vaping, encourage them to excuse themselves from the situation.
Talk about the health risks of being a bystander, as well as the temptation s/he may experience to try it for him/herself.
To gain credibility, acknowledge the reasons your teen may want to vape—all his friends are doing it, vaping seems like the cool thing to do, the flavors are fun, etc. Then, discuss the downsides of doing it as well.
If your teen doubts that vaping is harmful, do some online research together. Look at credible websites like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and talk about the facts and studies.
Talk to other parents as well. If you suspect or have found evidence of vaping, chances are it is happening with their friends and you can find out what other parents are thinking and doing as well.
