Urinary Tract Infections in Men: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment
Though women are usually the ones plagued with irritating urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms, men can develop UTIs, too. And the older a man is, the greater his risk for getting one.

Twelve percent of men will experience symptoms of at least one UTI during their lives.

While urinary tract infections are common in women, with at least 40 to 60 percent of women developing a UTI during their lives, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, men are not immune to these often troublesome and potentially dangerous infections.
According to the Urology Care Foundation, 12 percent of men will have symptoms of at least one UTI during their lives. And while urinary tract infections are extremely rare in young men, the risk of infection increases as they age: UTIs become more common in men older than 50.
Women are at greater risk for urinary tract infections simply due to their anatomy: The bacteria that normally live in the pelvic region — and the major cause of this type of infection — don’t have to travel far to infect the bladder.
Conversely, the male anatomy can help keep this type of infection at bay. “The longer urethra in men makes it more difficult for bacteria to travel backward that far without being washed out or killed by the immune system,” explains Landon W. Trost, MD, a urologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
Factors That Put Men at Risk for UTIs
Besides age, there are additional factors that put you at a greater risk for getting a UTI if you're a man, including:
An enlarged prostate gland
Kidney stones
Diabetes
Bladder catheter insertion
Any health condition that affects the immune system
Recognizing UTI Symptoms in Men
Some people don’t have any symptoms with a urinary tract infection, which usually entails an inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) and can also involve an infection of the lower or upper urinary tract, and — in more serious cases — the kidneys. In addition, not every man, woman, or child who gets a UTI has typical UTI symptoms, but most do exhibit at least one or more signs of infection. And when men do get UTIs, their symptoms are generally not too different from those that women experience. Common UTI symptoms include:
Frequent urination
A strong, constant urge to urinate
Releasing only small amounts of urine at a time
Cloudy, bloody, or bad-smelling urine
Suprapubic (lower abdominal) pain
Burning or pain during urination
Any of these symptoms accompanied by lower back pain, fever, nausea, or chills could indicate a kidney infection — a serious problem that needs prompt treatment.
How UTIs in Men Are Diagnosed
A urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria (or, less commonly, a virus or even a fungus) enters the urinary tract. In fact, according to the National Kidney Foundation, one particular bacteria, E. coli, causes 80 to 90 percent of all UTI cases.
Diagnosing a urinary tract infection in men is initially the same as it is for women, consisting of a urine culture. But because a UTI in a man is by definition always considered complicated, according to Dr. Trost, additional testing is usually necessary to determine why he got a UTI.
“This typically includes not only a urinary culture to confirm an infection, but also a special study to evaluate how much urine he leaves behind after urinating, and an imaging study, such as a CT [computerized tomography] scan, to evaluate for kidney stones or other anatomic abnormalities that may be causing this,” he explains.
If a man has recurrent infections or infections with the same organism, or UTI-like symptoms without a positive urine culture, then further testing may be necessary.
Any man who suspects he may have a UTI should see his doctor right away so that he can begin treatment as soon as possible.
How Urinary Tract Infections Are Treated in Men
Whether an infection affects a man or a woman, the treatment is the same: a round of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and get rid of UTI symptoms. For an uncomplicated infection, a woman typically needs to take an antibiotic for one to three days. For men, a longer course of at least seven days of antibiotics is required, says Trost.
How to Prevent Urinary Tract Infections in Men
Younger men can’t do too much in terms of preventing a UTI, according to Trost. But older men can take a few steps to lower their risk. “One of the best defense mechanisms against UTIs is to completely empty the bladder every time you urinate,” says urologist Howard B. Goldman MD, professor and vice chair of quality and patient safety at the Glickman Urologic and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
It’s also important to drink lots of fluids, especially water, every day. If you already have a UTI, drinking plenty of fluids can help push the bacteria out of the urinary tract — and in some very mild UTI cases, that could be enough to treat it. But if you notice any of the signs of a UTI, it's still very important to head to your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment recommendation.
RELATED: Drinking More Water Leads to Fewer Urinary Tract Infections, Study Suggests
Without proper UTI treatment, the infection can quickly spread and become a serious — and sometimes even fatal — threat. So don't brush off symptoms like frequent urination or a burning sensation when you urinate, and don't assume that you can't get a UTI just because you're a man. It’s important that you get these symptoms checked out promptly, too.
