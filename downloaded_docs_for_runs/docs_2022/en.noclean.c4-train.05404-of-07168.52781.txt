What’s all the fuss about fish oil?
Thursday, 3 April 2014
Author - Good Health
What’s so special about fish oil? Well, where to start… For one, it’s rich in omega-3 fats - known as the ‘good’ type. We can't make these fats ourselves so we need to get them via our diet or supplementation. We asked our naturopaths why fish oil is so good for you, we didn’t expect number 4!
Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in these omega-3’s so if you’re not eating oily fish at least 3 times a week, you might want to consider taking a fish oil supplement. The main two omega-3s we get from fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA). There’s plenty of reasons why these are really important in your diet, so our naturopaths have listed 10 of the majors.
What can fish oil do for you?
1. It makes you smarter.
DHA is the primary building block of your brain. It helps your brain by improving mental performance, particularly in memory and learning. The brain is 60% fat and DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain. So, along with ‘eating your spinach for strength’ we recommend getting a good dose of your omega’s to grow those brain cells.
2. If you’re pregnant, your baby will be smarter too.
DHA is one of the critical nutrients and the primary building block required by the brain and the eyes during the early stages of development. In the first few weeks of embryonic development when the brain cell division is most active, a mother’s blood needs to feed the foetus with large amounts of DHA. A continual supply of DHA is needed right throughout the pregnancy, as there is also a rapid brain growth phase in the last trimester. This phase can determine an infants IQ.
If you’re breastfeeding…
DHA is the most predominant omega-3 fatty acid in breast milk. Even after birth, brain and eye development continues for the baby. Again, it is thought that babies with healthy DHA from their mother during pregnancy and breastfeeding will have better vision and a higher IQ than those with DHA deficiency.
3. Omega-3 reduces PMS and painful periods.
When symptoms involve pain and inflammation, ensuring your Omega-3 levels are optimal can reduce some of this suffering. It’s important to make a conscious effort to keep these levels in check so when that time of the month rolls around, you’ll experience less pain. It’s not ideal to take fish oil symptomatically as you would Paracetamol for pain, so ensure you’re supplementing regularly to maintain adequate levels.
4. It can help to improve your mood.
Low levels of DHA omega-3 have actually been linked with depression. If you have too much omega-6 and not enough omega-3 in your brain, changes in the brain membranes occur which increases the vulnerability to depression. Keeping up your omega-3 intake can improve your mood drastically.
5. It will maintain your eye health.
Much like the brain, the eyes require DHA for development and maintenance. Omega-3 can also help with dry eyes, night blindness and age-related Macular degeneration.
6. Give you great hair, skin and nails.
Dry skin, dandruff and brittle nails are all signs of essential fatty acid deficiency. Omega-3 is also useful in treating eczema and psoriasis and itchy skin.
7. It’s a great help for Arthritis.
Where there is pain and inflammation, fish oil can come to the rescue. It serves as a natural anti-inflammatory. You may need little or a lot depending on how deficient you are.
8. Lower your risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.
The EPA part of the fish oil helps to keep blood flowing properly and not getting too thick or sticky, which can lead to blood clots and other vascular disorders. It also reduces high blood pressure by helping to dilate the blood vessels of the arteries, which then helps your blood flow better.
9. Helps to lower unhealthy cholesterol levels and improve circulation.
Omega-3 helps reduce triglycerides and also improves the balance between LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol and HDL (‘good’) cholesterol.
10. It can also help with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Crohn’s and Ulcerative colitis are both conditions that involve chronic inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the small intestine or bowel. Fish oil helps to inhibit this inflammation and improve the surface of the bowel wall (which then also increases the absorption of nutrients), which is usually a problem with these conditions.
Omega 3 is a vital nutrient that is lacking in most peoples diets these days. Everyone needs it, from children to the elderly.
