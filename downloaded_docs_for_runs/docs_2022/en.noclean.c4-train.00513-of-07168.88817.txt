To ease joint/bone pain get a can of WD-40. Spray and then rub where the pain is. My husband worked at a Saw Mill for 10 years and always used WD-40 when his elbows and knees hurt. Works for arthritis too!

I wonder if WD-40 was used in the Wizard of Oz on the Tin Man for sore joints....

I've heard of this, I guess it's like using the solvent DMSO. I use it and it sometimes works.

MY great grandmother used this all the time. I remember that she always kept a can of it by her chair in the living room.

Dealing with pain can be the hardest part of having arthritis or a related condition, but you can learn to manage it and its impact on your life.

I sincerely hope the Tin Man doesn't wind up with kidney or liver problems/cancer from this idiotic idea.

WD-40 is fish oil based. Some say it works, some say it doesn't. It could be the massaging that helps the joint by increasing blood flow to the area. As for medical side effects, you can get it from anything. Just walking outside anymore, so don't knock it if you haven't tried it.

My friend's father died from colon cancer. His entire life he used WD40 on his pans when camping. It's not safe!

I'm not sure how one makes the leap from WD-40 on sore joints to colon cancer; I think the two things are most likely unrelated.
