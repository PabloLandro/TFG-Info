Marijuana and Addiction
1
The big question is, is it possible to smoke to much weed? There are many people, such as marijuana activists, that argue weed is a natural substance that is harmless. There are others that say it can still do damage to the body and become addictive. So, should someone who smokes too much marijuana go to rehab?
Marijuana and Addiction
In most states in the US, marijuana is illegal. It alters the mind and mood for most people that use it, and because of that, it is a drug. There are many other things besides drugs that people can become addicted to, like gambling.
There are almost 100 million Americans who have used Marijuana. It is the third most popular drug in America, below alcohol and tobacco. Although it is considered a drug, it is one of the lesser dangerous ones. “Around 50,000 people die each year from alcohol poisoning. Similarly, more than 400,000 deaths each year are attributed to tobacco smoking. By comparison, marijuana is nontoxic and cannot cause death by overdose.”
Do You Still Need Rehab?
There have been people that are diagnosed as marijuana addicts. The culture treats weeds differently than a drug that people can get addicted to. Many people would laugh at those that say they are weed addicts trying to seek help because it is not as hardcore as heroin, crack, or meth.
The people who are addicted to marijuana cannot function without it, which is not healthy. Not being able to stay sober is the meaning of addiction. People can still live normal lives, like have a job, but still be addicted to a substance.
Many people will go to smoking marijuana after treatment of another addiction. It is known to be harmless so it is okay to smoke? This is not recommended because it is still a drug and many people that smoke it will end up going back to their original drug that got them addicted.
If you know someone that cannot function without marijuana than you should talk to them about getting help. Call 1-800-New-Choice for immediate assistance!
