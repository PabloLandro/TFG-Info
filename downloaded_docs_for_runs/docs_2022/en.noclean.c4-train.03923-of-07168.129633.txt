Next Level Oil Pulling: Elevate Your Dental Health Game

Oil pulling, also known as “kavala” or “gundusha,” is an ancient Ayurvedic dental practice that in recent times, has gained recognition by healthcare practitioners, holistic physicians and biological dentists for its unique ability to not only reverse tooth decay and heal gum disease, but to also systemically support the immune system, cardiovascular system, and neurological health. Many holistic practitioners are discovering that our dental health may not just be an important piece to our health puzzle, but it may in fact be the very roots in which our wellness lays. Perhaps our health is deeply rooted in the health of our mouth. In Dr. Joseph Mercola‘s article on oil pulling, he further explains the connection between our dental and physical health: http://bit.ly/2jrC7ja
The practice involves swishing a tablespoon of oil in your mouth for around 10-20 minutes. Coconut oil can help to reverse tooth decay (pst, dental cavities, if shallow, are simple tooth infections that can be reversed). Coconut oil can also decrease inflammation which is helpful for those with receding gums. But the added systemic benefit of oil pulling boosts the immune system, which makes this practice especially useful during flu season.
If you want to elevate your oil pulling practice, try adding 2-3 drops of your favorite dental oil blend. I love using Watch Your Mouth or Just for Grins, but other oils, if intended to be taken internally, can also be used. If you want to use a single oils, use any of the oils I have used with our dental blends, but remember when you are working with single oils, to use with caution. Start with one drop and see how that feels before adding any more and if you are working with a very strong oil, you can even create a small jar of coconut oil pre-mixed with your oils to leave on the bathroom counter.
Now, go be wellness warriors my friends.
Be Well. xo
