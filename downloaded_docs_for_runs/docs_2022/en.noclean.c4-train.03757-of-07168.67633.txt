What Is The Correct Way To Turn My Button-Activated 510 Thread Battery On And Off?
April 15, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
Congratulations, you have just purchased your first button-activated 510 thread battery! Do you want to learn how to turn it on and off correctly without reading the manual? We have got you covered. Before we get started, remove any plastic wrapping that came with your product. If you are ready to proceed, here are the main steps to remember:
Steps To Follow
Step one: Press the button five times rapidly. It should be like click-click-click-click-click – five continuous clicks in a row.
Step two: If you perform the first step correctly, the border of the button will light up three times. When the light flashes, it indicates that your button vape pen battery is now activated.
Step three: Next, send power to the vape cartridge by pushing and holding the button. Your vape pen battery should produce a light again.
Step four: When you have finished using your battery, turn the battery off by simply clicking the button five times again, in the same rapid manner. To confirm that the battery is off, hold the button. If the light does not turn on, it indicates that your battery is completely switched off.
Voila! The process is very straightforward. You do not need to input any complex numeral codes. It is just a click, hold, and go!
Understanding Vape Pen Batteries
Most vape pens use four major components. They include the vaping material, the cartridge, the atomizer, and the battery. Batteries are designed to store and transfer power to the atomizer. These components usually comprise circuitry that controls the amount of power that is being transferred. You will be able to keep track of the power level via the LED screen. There may be features that enable voltage adjustments too. Once the atomizer receives adequate power, it can proceed to heat up the ceramic element or wire coil. The vaping material, e.g. oil, that is in the vape cartridge will then vaporize.
The great thing about vape pen batteries is that they can be used for several years without causing problems. In addition, they come in a great array of variable voltage styles. The most common options are between 3.3V and 4.8V. You should keep in mind that voltage numbers do not tell you whether it is a good product or not. It just indicates whether it is compatible with your vape cartridge. If you are new to vaping and want to start low before working your way up. Go for lower voltage batteries. They offer a lighter hit and purer vapor.
The 510 Advantage
510 thread batteries refer to a universal thread design. Due to the unmatched compatibility offered by 510 threads, the design has allowed many battery brands and cartridge brands to work well together. With that in mind, you will have an extremely easy time pairing components when you buy vape cartridges that feature 510 threads. In fact, a lot of vapers around the world love 510 threads. They keep vape pen products open-source and allow vapers to customize for the best possible vaping experiences.

Should I Stop Using 601 Thread Batteries And Switch To 510 Thread Batteries?
April 1, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
As a vaper, you have access to a wide range of options to create the best vaping experience for yourself. There are products such as dry herb vaporizers, mini vaporizers, wax atomizers, vape pens, e-liquids, and many more. So, you prefer using vape pens? These vaping devices have emerged as quite a popular choice among dry herb and e-liquid enthusiasts in the vaping community. A big jump from the basic e-cigarettes that took the world by storm during the early 2000s, vape pens offer exceptional convenience and portability while delivering superior power and customization.
To ensure you enjoy the stellar functionality that these devices have to offer, you will need a reliable source of power. One of those products is the Vertex Slim 510 Battery. Have you ever wondered what those numbers stand for? The number is a non-technical term that vape manufacturers use to describe the battery to tank connection that is being used. Another example is the 601 thread batteries.
What Are 510 Thread Batteries?
510 thread is usually used to describe all sorts of vape pen components. The term can be used to describe parts that are threaded and non-threaded. In the past, the term was considered proprietary to Joyetech. Today, the term is passed around freely between manufacturers. A great array of modern vape pen parts are all based on this 510 threading technology. 510 thread parts are usually 7 mm in diameter, features 10 threads, and each thread is 0.5 mm.
510 Thread Vs. 601 Thread
When it comes to 601 thread batteries, the six in front does not mean the battery features six threads. Oftentimes, these batteries only feature three threads and they are significantly thicker than their 510 counterparts. You should keep in mind that thread count is less important than thread thickness. If the threads are too thick, the vaper may encounter device incompatibility issues.
If you are using 510 thread batteries, you will find that it fits a lot of attachment options for dry herbs, wax, e-liquids, etc. This is a great advantage considering the fact that you may not change vaping devices on a regular basis. 601 thread batteries are still offered by some brands. However, they create issues where you can only buy extra add-ons from those specific brands. There is no “universal” factor. The only solution is to purchase a 601 to 510 adapter. The question is: Are you willing to go through the extra hassle?
510 Thread Batteries Make Life Easier!
As a vaper, you will want to enjoy what vaping has to offer. It is much better than you own a versatile vape pen battery from the get-go. This way, you never have to go through the frustration of buying the wrong attachments for your battery.
So, should you stop using 601 thread batteries and switch 510 thread batteries? Sure, why not. A great array of vaping products supports 510 threading too. They are convenient, easy to use, inexpensive, and extremely reliable.

Should I Buy A Vape Pen?
March 15, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
Vape pens made their way to the market to serve as a safer and better alternative of smoking tobacco cigarettes. For those of you who have not tried using one, you will surely wonder if buying this device will be worth it. You can get rid of all those doubts in your mind once you discover the benefits of using vape pens.
They are Versatile
Most vape pens are portable vaporizers, which mean you can easily transport them or carry them anywhere you want to go. Versatile as these pieces are, you can be sure that no one will get irritated once you use the device in a public place. You will not end up suffocating yourself too in case you decide to use them while being in a room. You can choose to use them while you are having your lunch break or when you are inside your vehicle.
They Provide A Pleasant Experience
Many of you do not want to give up smoking because of the pleasure that the experience brings. You also get the same experience when using vape pens. You do not even need to use too much herbs or materials to get that pleasurable experience.
They Are Not Harmful
Using vape pens, as mentioned, is an alternative to cigarette smoking. This means that you will lessen the chance of or totally eliminate the smoke that can be harmful to the lungs. With this device, you no longer have to worry about particulate matter getting into your lungs, thus reducing the chances of respiratory inflammation.
They Keep Herbs Potent
Imagine smoking a cigarette until all that is left is the butt. Did you ever notice the difference in the smell and strength that comes out of it? The pleasure can also diminish once you have finished smoking a stick. If you use a vape pen, you can be sure that the first hit offers the same strength as the last hit. The device is able to retain taste and potency over time since the herbs are not exposed to open air.
You Enjoy Rich Vapors When You Use One
When compared to the traditional way of smoking dry herbs, using a vape pen will mean you will be enjoying a good smoke. Smoking dry herbs in a bowl may have provided that pleasure the same way as smoking cigarette does. However, using this method may allow crumbling or carbonization to affect the taste. In vape pens, you are actually vaporizing the active ingredients of the herb that remains in the cartridge when drawing a hit.
It will Cost Less in Time
Some of you may back out from purchasing vape pens with the thought that you are paying more with your initial investment. Once you realize that these devices can be reused repeatedly, you will learn that the device pays for itself in no time. With proper care and handling, you do not need to replace the device regularly. Although buying cigarettes do not require you to pay hundreds of dollars for a box, you will spend more in time depending on the number of boxes you consume in a day.

How Will My Dry Herb Vaporizers Smell?
March 1, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
When you have been smoking cigarettes or tobacco in the past, you will surely be familiar with that distinct, strong smell that’s associated with it. As you decide to switch to a dry herb vaporizer, exposure to that aroma becomes more distinct yet will not result in health risks, the way exposure to cigarette smoking does. Wondering how exactly dry herb vaporizers smell?
Smoke Versus Vapor
Smoke is filled with particulate matter. This is the reason why it can stick to all sorts of surfaces that it reaches – from the walls to the carpets in your home to the clothes you wear. That smell can get stuck on a fabric or a surface for a long time.
When you are using vaporizers, you will notice that a distinct smell comes with it. While there is no smoke, you will get the smell from the e-liquid, dry herb, or whatever concentrate you decide to use with the device. The vapor, not the smoke, will make you smell the herb that you have placed inside the vaporizer.
Since the vaporizer produces vapor, you can expect it to dissipate quickly. The smell does not linger. It will not stick to the surface or a fabric for a long time. When you vape near an open window, you can expect the smell to be gone in no time. You can also use a fan to dissipate the smell.
Taking Precautions
As you use a vaporizer, you will notice that the smell is not as strong as the smell produced by tobacco. But of course, you want to make sure that the vapor will dissipate as fast as possible. There are precautions you can take, aside from opening the window and using a fan while vaping. Among them are:
Lowering the device’s temperature: Some dry herb vaporizers have the tendency to burn the material inside the oven. Some may also have problems maintaining the amount of temperature needed when vaping. Make sure then that you set the vaporizer at the lowest temperature possible, that is, without sacrificing the pleasure you want to gain from the experience.
Clean your vaporizer: A clean vaporizer will ensure that you can enjoy the most flavorful puffs without any strong smell coming out from it. Imagine not cleaning your device. This means that the residue can accumulate in the chamber. As you use the vaporizer the next time, without cleaning it, the leftover residue from your previous session gets stuck in it. This will come in contact with the new set of herbs you will use this time. The smell will become different than the smell you got from the previous session.
Try adding a stronger scent into your room: If you are vaping indoors, it will be good to use scented candles that can overpower the scent coming out from the device. You can also roast one head of garlic and place it inside the room. The bag of popcorn that you popped in the microwave oven will also help neutralize the smell.

How To Prevent Vaporizer Explosions
February 14, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
Vape usage has increased over the years. Despite that, a lot of users simply jump onto the bandwagon without being familiar with what they are getting into. What they do not know is that the lack of knowledge about vaping can increase the risk of an incident. One of which is the possibility of vaporizer explosions. How can you prevent this from happening?
Keep Your Battery Cover
At least, don’t lose it. You will need this to protect the batteries. Remember that exposed batteries can lead to an explosion. When left uncovered, the batteries can become damaged in the long run. The exposed battery can also come into contact with metal objects, like a metal key in your pocket. You should be wary of the grounding effect created by these components. Make sure that you do not carry leaking batteries inside your pocket as well to avoid an explosion.
Follow the Correct Battery Charging Instructions
Vaporizers are equipped with batteries. These batteries need to be charged. Since they are lithium-ion batteries, expect them to be stronger than those found in wireless devices. Holding a strong charge, you should never overcharge them, or else they can become dangerous items. That is why you are reminded to adhere to safe charging directions by considering the type of voltage used and the charge time itself.
There are vape pens that have USB charging ports in them. These can be connected to different types of charging plugs. Make sure you use the correct charging plug, specifically the one that came with the device. Original chargers will assure your device charges safely. You will never want a lower quality plug to put you at risk while charging your vaping device.
Practice Safe Charging Habits
Alongside following charging directions, you must also be familiar with safe charging habits. Make sure that your plugged vaping device is not left unattended. Never charge the device when you are sleeping, or when you are away running an errand. Make sure that the device has not been left charging for too long, even when you are using the correct plug. Never plug it into USB-capable devices like your computer or smart TV hub. Vaping device chargers are made to be plugged into a wall outlet.
Avoid Exposing the Device to Extreme Weather
Vape batteries were made to charge safely at a temperature ranging from 60 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. When exposed to extreme weather, hot or cold, these batteries can become damaged. Cheaper batteries will definitely damage the device as it becomes exposed to extreme weather or temperature conditions.
Always Buy Quality Vape
One of the most effective ways to prevent vaporizers from exploding is making sure you only buy higher quality vaporizers. Not only will these devices be a good investment, but they also charge properly while keeping the voltage at safe levels, that is, whenever you are charging or using them. They are also more enjoyable to use when compared to cheaper vapes. Remember, you will only get high-quality vapes if you search and do some research on the products yourself.

How To Do Dry Herb Vaping Right From The Get-Go
February 1, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
Vaporizing has become a popular alternative to smoking over the past few years. It does give you that enjoyable experience without harming your health, the way smoking regular cigarettes does. There many different types of vaping devices and one of the most popular options is dry herb vaporizers. They offer the advanced vaping technology. Whether you are new to the experience or not, these tips about vaping dry herbs will help you enjoy a pleasant vaping experience.
Go for Fresh Herbs All the Time
Fresh herbs are not just herbs that are freshly harvested. They actually refer to those herbs that have undergone a curing process or came from a high-quality bud. In the world of vaping, the experience will only be good if you choose high-quality, fresh herbs all the time. Using fresh herbs will help you achieve a higher moisture concentration when vaping. Make sure that the herb is not overly moist or wet to the touch. It should not be too dry either; you should not be able to crush it into a fine powder with the mere use of your fingers.
Set the Device to the Right Temperature
Temperature can affect the vaping experience. This is the reason why you should always set the device to the right temperature, whether you are using e-liquids or dry herbs. Generally, you must vape at a temperature setting between 180 and 210 degrees Celsius. You can also experiment and adjust the temperature settings if you want.
Pack Your Herbs Correctly
One of the critical aspects of achieving a great vaping experience lies with the way you pack your herbs inside the chamber. Some of you may overdo this part while others may commit the mistake of packing the chamber loosely. Over-packing the chamber can damage the device and may also affect the flow of vapor int the device.
You Must Grind Your Herbs Well
Grinding is important in dry vaping because it helps increase the surface area in the chamber. This allows the heat to penetrate the herb, which will then produce the flavorful vapor that you want. A nice, uniform grind for your herbs will help improve the experience. You can choose between manual and electric herb grinders. Make sure that you only grind the herb that is needed to fill the chamber of your device.
Inhale the Right Way
The right way to inhale your dry herbs is to do it slowly and lightly. Gentle, short drags will provide a better experience when vaping. Drawing hard, on the other hand, will mean sucking on the herb. Once the herb passes through the chamber and the mouthpiece, there is a tendency that your mouth will be filled with herbs and not the taste that you want to get from them. This can also affect the quality of vapor when you use the device, a result of cold air getting into the chamber. This makes the device work harder.
Clean and Store Your Vaping Device Properly
A part of the device’s user manual provides instructions on how to store and clean your device properly. You need to be familiar with these processes to make sure you can enjoy dry herb vaping all the time. This will also help increase the overall service lifespan of the product.

How To Buy My First Vape Pen
January 15, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
It is easy to be spoilt for choice when it comes to the vape pen market. With a wide range of styles, functions and uniquely designed devices to choose from, a new vaper will certainly feel lost. There are however a few tips that can come in handy for newbies. To save time and ensure you navigate the purchasing process with ease, consider the following tips:
Vaping Materials
What do you want to use in your vape pen? Your options include: dry herbs, e-liquids, wax, and more. It gets better with the fact that there are vape pens designed to handle both concentrates and dry materials at the same time. There are also atomizers and tanks which are ideal for vaping oils and e-liquids. They come complete with wicks and coils for heating.
Be sure to go for vape pens with chambers if you have a soft spot for legal concentrates. They heat up a different way and guarantee an invigorating vaping experience. Be keen though on the chamber design. it should be easy to clean as legal concentrates usually leave behind hard to clean residue.
Heating Methods
Your vape pen’s heating method matters a lot. For instance, vape pens that use convection heating method tend to be more ideal for vapers who love dry material or herbs. The concept behind how they work is simple. Heating occurs when the heat is transferred to the vape pen’s chamber without the vaping material coming in contact with the heating element. This ensures that the vaping material is not wasted. It also reduces combustion. Keep in mind that vape pens which use the convection heating method take time to heat up.
Then there is the conduction heating method, which is ideal for pens that use e-liquids and oils. With conduction, the vaping material has direct contact with the pen’s heating element. This means you can vape immediately. But it also means you can lose up to a third of what you are vaping as a result of increased combustion.
Battery Lifespan
Most if not all vape pens are powered by Lithium-Ion built-in batteries. The batteries can last for a few hours. There are alternatives, only that they are bigger in size. They last longer though with some lasting up to seven days before needing another recharge. Remember that output is also a vital factor to consider when it comes to battery life of your vape pen. This is especially important if you use your vape pen for e-liquids. Low resistance coils create more vapor and a richer flavor.
On the flipside, they use more power. In a nutshell, slim and discreet vape pens feature functional batteries that can last for just a few hours. Larger devices, on the other hand, feature stronger batteries that can last for days.
Functionality
This is yet another vital factor to consider when shopping for a vape pen. In other words, ease of use matters a lot not just for first-time vapers but also for their experienced peers. Always go for a vape pen that is simple to use. That is, you load the material, close the pen, press a button and start vaping! You can then advance over time to a device with more advanced features like programmable presets or temperature controls. Remember the more features a pen has, the more expensive it might be.

How Should I Pack My Dry Herb Vaporizer?
January 1, 2019 by DiscountVapePen
Many of us may think that dry herb vaporizers are no different with cigarettes, at least when puffing them. Yes, it is true that these devices are not difficult to use. You have to remember, however, that it will take time learning how you can use it to give you flavorful puffs all the time. The secret lies in knowing how to pack the dry herb vaporizer the right way.
What’s Up with an Improperly Packed Vaporizer?
You won’t know the right way of packing a dry herb vaporizer unless you know when you have improperly packed one. There are symptoms for that. One of those symptoms is you will notice that the herbs don’t seem to come in contact with each other. Also, you will notice that the device does not produce vapor as expected.
How you wish you can just increase the vaporizer temperature to get the puffing flavor and experience that you want! When you do so, you will be disgusted to find out later on that the oven is full of ash. The improperly packed vaporizer will give you the usual smoking experience, instead of vaping which should be the result of shifting to using this device.
Invest in a Dry Herb Grinder
This can be used so that the herbs will be grinded uniformly, and finely. When herbs are finely grinded, it will increase the herbs’ surface area. This will improve the heat transfer and will assure that heating is even all throughout. As a result, you can eliminate the scenario of having an unused material inside your vaporizer’s chamber.
Learning the Type of Vaporizer You are Using
One of the best ways to assure that you are packing your herbs properly is to learn what type you are using. There are conduction vaporizers. These ones have oven walls that heat the herb directly. They depend on the physical contact made between the oven walls and the herb, in order to reach the correct temperature when vaping.
There are also convection vaporizers. Unlike conduction vaporizers, these ones are not portable. They heat the herbs indirectly using a fan, one that blows hot air through the herbs. This hot air passes through the herbs before reaching the center of the oven.
Packing Different Types of Vaporizers
The goal of packing a conduction vaporizer is different when packing its convection counterpart. For conduction or portable vaporizers, you need to focus on assuring that there is physical contact in the oven. In the case of convection vaporizers, you must make sure that the materials are fitted in the open such that the airflow is not restricted when heating the herbs.
For conduction vaporizers, the herbs must be grinded as finely as possible. Grinding herbs to smaller particles will maximize the surface area. Sprinkle the ground herbs into the oven, making sure there are enough herbs for better physical contact. Apply little pressure to achieve this result. As for convection vaporizers, you do not need to grind the herbs as finely as possible. You can sprinkle the ground herbs into the oven without mounding them higher than the oven’s edge.

How Has Dry Herb Vaping Improved Over The Years?
December 1, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
The roots of dry herb vaping date back to the Herodotus in 500 BC. We have certainly come a long way from throwing hemp seeds on red-hot stones. If you are curious about the history of dry herb vaping and how it steadily evolved over the years, read on!
Conceptualization
About a thousand years ago, Northern India was home to the Hookah. It was a basic coconut shell concept that becomes more ornate and decorative when it was embraced by Turkish intellectuals. During the 1970s, the Tilt became popular in the United States. Tilt vaping kits reduced the percentage of tar by about 21 percent. Next, Bill Amato created the Shake and Vape during the 90s. It was a glass vaporizer that featured a glass bowl and a glass stem. The invention could heat up dry herb vaping materials without causing them to combust.
Mass Production
Storz and Bickel created the Volcano. It was a desktop convection vaporizer that featured a balloon bag system. As the product was the first mass-produced vaporizer, it was available in a wide range of styles. There was even one that resembled a pencil sharpener. Other vaping devices that were used during the 90s also featured a metal plate that was used for heating vaping materials and a glass dome. These products continued to be refined and enhanced until the desktop vaporizer market finally took off. Soon, manufacturers started conceptualizing a vaporizer that could fit in its owners’ pockets and be used while on the move.
The Age Of Portability
The early versions of portable vaporizers needed a lighter to serve as the source of ignition. The device was supposed to produce enough heat to facilitate vaporization. Manufacturers added new features, such as digital temperature controls, to ensure vaping ingredients successfully vaporize and not burn. However, this model did not take off commercially. The components made it too bulky to be portable, and the cost of making them was high. In 2006, a pocket-sized vaporizer was introduced into the market. Although it offered easy storage, it still shared several disadvantages from the past, including a high price tag and short battery life.
Vaping manufacturers did not give up. They were determined to provide customers with a product that could safely and conveniently satisfy their vaping needs. Some changes included heating coils replacing metal plates; battery power replacing traditional heating sources; and lightweight glass replacing ceramic bowls. The latter was designed to separate the vaping ingredients from the heating source. Today, you can find vaping devices that feature advanced temperature controls, reliable batteries, and much clearer LED displays.
No More Smoke
Modern vaping devices utilize lower temperatures to heat dry herbs and release a vapor that does not irritate the vaper’s skin, eyes, and throat. What’s more, it is relatively odorless. These vaporizers used two methods to transfer heat. Convection transferred heat through gases and liquids, while conduction transferred heat through solid materials.
Today: The Modern Age Of Dry Herb Vaping
As you can see, dry herb vaping technology has made herculean strides since the days of simple seeds, herbs, and hot stones. Today’s portable vaping devices no longer require external heat sources. They can extract active ingredients from dry herbs and transform them into safe vapors that can be inhaled.

How Do I Maintain My Dry Herb Vaporizer Pens?
November 1, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
If you want to get clean puffs that are rich in flavor each time you use your dry herb vaporizer pen, you must make sure that it is cleaned on a regular basis. Cleaning it does not only involve wiping it down, on the exterior. You will have to disassemble your dry herb vaporizer pens and clean each individual component. If you allow old herbs to leave residue inside the herb chamber, the taste of vapors during the next vaping session will be harsh. What’s more, they may damage the heating element or other important components of your dry herb vaporizer pen. This makes your device unsafe to use and hinder its performance.
How Often Should You Clean Your Dry Herb Vaporizer Pens?
It is a good idea to clean your dry herb vaporizer pen at least once a week. If you use your vaping device more often than others, you will of course need a more regular cleaning schedule. Although there are many different types of dry herb vaporizer pens on the market today, this post will discuss the recommended ways to clean a basic dry herb vape pen. Let’s find out more:
Disassemble
The cleaning process starts with disassembling your dry herb vaporizer pen. Most of these devices consist of a heating chamber, a mouthpiece, and a battery. When you clean your vape pen, each component requires your undivided attention. So, start familiarizing yourself with these parts and study every nook and cranny of their “anatomy.” This way, you can ensure a thorough clean.
Remove Excess Dry Herbs
Look in the heating chamber. Do you see any loose dry herbs in it? If the answer is yes, empty the chamber out. To do this, simply tap out the unwanted contents gently. Before you tap away, you should keep in mind that many dry herb vaporizer pens comprise a small screen in the heating chamber. This is something you do not want to lose! So, avoid tapping out the contents into a trash bin. Recommended alternatives include a shallow receptacle, a table, or an ashtray you do not mind sifting through.
Brushing
Take out the small cleaning brush that came with your dry herb vape pen to gently brush away any vaporized residue and remaining packed dry herb from the sides of the heating chamber. If you spot any clogged particles from the screen inside the chamber, remove them as well. You should avoid using water or rubbing alcohol for this step. These liquids can damage the device’s compact, internal wiring components. If your warming coil is damaged, the device will be useless.
Clear The Dirt
It is time to move on to the mouthpiece. You need to make sure it is clean on the inside. Use a Q-tip or dab tool to clean the insides. Next, use a cloth or cotton ball to wipe away any dirt from the outside. Certain mouthpieces can be rinsed with hot water or soaked in isopropyl alcohol. However, you should check your user’s manual first to make sure it is completely safe for your particular vaping device.
Battery Inspection
Another goal of cleaning your devices is to ensure clear and unobstructed battery connection points. Start inspecting the battery and wipe away any residue of dirt. That should do the trick.
Reassemble
You are almost done! The last step involves reassembling the dry herb vaporizer pen. Also, wipe down the outside one last time with a cotton cloth. You may dampen the cloth with rubbing alcohol or water. It is up to you.
Now, you are done. Enjoy vaping!

How Do I Keep My Dry Herb Vaporizer Chamber Clean?
October 15, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
A clean dry herb vaporizer will mean getting clean puffs every time you make use of it. In order to assure that the device is clean all the time, then you also have to clean every part found in it, the chamber included. The herb chamber is where the herbs are placed. That said, residues may be left after you use it. This can result in an unwanted taste for your vaporizer. At the worst, it can also damage the device’s heating elements and all other components inside it.
When Should You Clean the Chamber?
If you want your device to last longer, and you also desire to get flavorful puffs every time, you need to keep the chamber clean. Don’t worry. You don’t have to clean it every after use. Thorough cleaning once a week is enough to retain the taste you want from your herbs.
Disassembling the Vaporizer
The first step to cleaning your dry herb vaporizer chamber is to disassemble the device. Remove every part – the heating chamber, mouthpiece, battery, and all other parts that need cleaning. Make sure you are familiar with each part. This will help you know how to properly clean it and return it back in place later on.
Empty Out the Chamber
Any loose herb found inside it must be removed. You can do this by gently tapping the chamber until the residues are removed. Make sure that you only do this on the area where you can easily locate the small screen. This is that part of the heating chamber that you need but can be easily removed from it when tapping the pen.
Clean the Heating Chamber
Some vape pens come with a small cleaning brush which can be used to clean the heating chamber. If you cannot locate the one that comes with the pack you bought, you can use a Q-tip instead. Use this to remove any other vaporized residue from the chamber. You can also use this to remove particles that are clogging the screen. Never use water or rubbing alcohol when cleaning, as this can damage the wiring inside the device. The warming coil must stay intact during cleaning too.
Clean the Mouthpiece
It is also important to clean the mouthpiece to remove dirt and residue that may have accumulated over it. You can use either a Q-tip, a cloth, or cotton ball when doing so. It will be best to check your user’s manual to find out what you can do when cleaning this part of the pen. Make sure that you will clean the battery as well.
Reassemble the Vaporizer
When you are done with all these, you can reassemble the dry herb vaporizer pen. Wipe the outside using a clean cloth. From here, you are ready to enjoy flavorful puffs with your vaporizer once more.
Regardless of the brand you choose to buy, it is always important to follow the above-mentioned tips when cleaning your vape pen. Always consult the manual if you are unsure about how to do it right.

How Can I Avoid Wasting My Dry Herbs?
October 1, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
Since the inception of dry herb vaping in the late 90s, it has become a popular vaping method today. In the past, vapers had to use plugged machines. With today’s invention of increasingly portable vaping devices, dry herb vaping is far easier than before. However, some individuals who have been doing dry herb vaping still encounter several issues, such as unknowingly wasting their herbs. In this post, you will learn three important rules about vaping. Read on to find out how you should NOT use your dry herbs.
Avoid Combusting Your Dry Herbs
You should keep in mind that vaporizing and combustion are two different things. Some products are making claims that one of their selling points as a dry herb vaporizer is that they do not vaporize at all. They are combusting your dry herbs.
Now, if combustion occurs, it means that your dry herbs are directly exposed to the heating coil. In other words, your dry herbs are being ignited and burnt as if you were traditionally smoking. Heating coils are basically an open flame with a temperature that exceeds the 450 degrees Fahrenheit mark. You are just letting the precious dry herbs go to waste!
When you choose a dry herb vaporizer, you will want to prevent the direct contact issues from happening. You can create a barrier by adding a glass screen filter between your herbs and the heating. This promotes better vapor production.
Avoid Using Low-Quality Dry Herbs
Fresh dry herbs contain more moisture, which is needed for optimum vapor production. After all, vaping temperatures are above boiling point but do not surpass the point of combustion. You should not misunderstand that you need to wet your herbs. Dry herbs should not feel overly moist to the touch. When it comes to choosing dry herbs to vape, they should also not be overly dry. If you managed to crumble them into a powdery form, they are too dry to be vaporized. Now that you know that high-quality dry herbs are essential, you may want to know that you can also use cured herbs. These herbs contain the right amount of moisture.
Avoid Choosing the Wrong Temperature
Your dry herbs can release their chemicals and properly vaporize with the right amount of heat. If you exceed the recommended temperatures, you may end up burning your dry herbs. What is the recommended temperature range? It should be between 350 degrees Fahrenheit and 450 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, you can’t produce vapor if you are below the 350 marks and your herbs will ignite if it exceeds the 450 marks. You should keep in mind that different herbs possess different vaporization temperatures. You need to regulate the temperature to avoid burning your herbs or failing to vaporize them.
As you can see, the tips above are necessary for ensuring a pleasant dry herb vaping experience. No matter what dry herbs you may be vaporizing, make sure to keep these tips in mind. If you can include each of them in your list of mantras, each vaporizing session with an end in triumph!

Do You Need To Use A Quality Dry Herb Grinder?
September 15, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
Every vaper wants to get the best results from the dry herbs they are using. In order to maximize the hit quality, some vapers focus on getting herbs of the finest quality, the best possible dry herb vaporizer, and follow all the best practices pertaining to vaping.
However, there is a practice that is often overlooked. That is using a quality dry herb grinder. Dry herb grinders play one of the most important roles in optimizing your vaping experience. No matter how good your dry herbs are, you cannot achieve the desired results if they are not ground properly.
What is a Dry Herb Grinder?
Grinders are accessories designed to break up the leaves of dry herbs into smaller pieces. The grinding process has a dual positive effect on your vaping experience. Firstly, it allows the dry herbs to be completely vaporized so that no harshness will occur. Secondly, grinding increases the surface area of the herbs within your device’s chamber. This means that your herbs heat up more evenly and you can get more flavor with each draw.
Here is a quick summary of the benefits that quality dry herb grinders can provide:
Smooth vapor
More flavorful draws
Lowers the risk of combustion
Create bigger vapor clouds
Dry herbs get fully vaporized
How else does a grinder enhance the potential of your favorite dry herbs? Let’s go into the details:
Effective Segregation
Every dry herb has different parts that can be vaporized separately. If you do not have a good grinder, it will be difficult to segregate these parts. A good herb grinder should feature a pollen catcher, which is in the form of a mesh screen. It allows unwanted parts to sifted off from the herb during the grinding process. If you plan to save the pollen for later use, you can opt for three-chamber grinders that come with a pollen screen.
Ability to Maximize Dry Herbs
Dry herbs cost you money. It is natural for vapers to want to draw maximum performance from each gram of herb. A good grinder allows you to use those herbs effectively. When you grind your herbs into fine particles, you can get the desired vaping effect in just a few draws! By increasing the surface area of your herbs in the heating chamber, your device can produce more vapor per gram. At the end of your fulfilling vaping session, you use smaller amounts of herbs, save time, and conserve the battery lifespan of your dry herb vaporizer.
Ensuring Even Vaporization
Dry herbs, in a fine powdery form, are ideal for vaping. With a larger surface area, your herbs can absorb the heat of the heating chamber more evenly. This produces a more flavorful and thicker vapor. You can be sure to get a full taste with every draw. If you are a cloud chaser, finely ground herbs can produce huge clouds of vapor as they will be consistently heated.
Conclusion
There you go! If you are a vaping enthusiast, a quality dry herb grinder is a must-have addition to your arsenal. Today, you can choose between two-piece and four-piece grinders. What’s more, they are available in metal, wood, and acrylic finishes.

Can I Vape Dry Herb In Cold Weather?
September 1, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
What are your thoughts on cold weather? Do you get really sick during this time of year? Things are going to change this year because dry herb vaping in chilling weather conditions provides an array of benefits. Apart from getting a pleasant vaping experience, it can also soothe your throat, especially if you are feeling too congested.
Vaporizing Your Favorite Dry Herbs and Essential Oils
Essential oils can be added to water, food, and be applied topically. These oils are growing in popularity for an array of applications. Likewise, dry herb vapers have discovered that they can unlock the benefits of essential oils through their vaping devices. You should keep in mind that not all dry herb vaping devices are appropriate for vaping oils. You may need to get additional vaping accessories that allow you to vape essential oils.
Next, you should pay attention to the quality of your oils. You need to find pure and safe essential oils that are designed specifically for vaping. Oils that contain impurities can be harmful when they are inhaled and heated. Eucalyptus essential oil is a good choice for starters. The oil is often used as an antiseptic to treat colds, coughs, and sore throats.
Now, the technique of dry herb vaping with essential oils is slightly different from other vaping methods. During your usual dry herb vaping sessions, you might take a large draw and fill your lungs. When it comes to vaping with essential oils, you should take your time and do shallow draws. Why?
Well, the scent of essential oils is enough to awaken your senses. Hence, you do not need too much in your system. If you are trying to vape in cold weather for the first time, it is best not to dive in head first. It is safer to start with a few drops. Test the waters before you take in a larger draw.
Setting Up Your Dry Herb Vaporizer
If you vape dry herbs, you might already know that vaping in cold weather can be a hassle. To prevent your device from malfunctioning, here are some pointers to keep in mind when setting up your device:
Avoid attaching a metal mouthpiece
It is cold! You wouldn’t stick your lips or tongue to metal when temperatures are freezing, right? If you use a dry herb vaporizer with a metal tip in sub-zero temperatures, you risk drying your lips out. It may not be obvious at the start but you will notice that issue when you start experiencing discomfort. Recommended alternatives include plastic tips, glass tips, or rubber tips.
Insulation, heat, and patience
If you are planning to vape in cold weather, you should invest in a silicone sleeve. These sleeves are designed to trap heat and help reduce battery workload. Next, you may need to increase the heat slightly higher than usual. Some vapers vape dry herb on a Level-4 setting in freezing temperatures. Do give your device some time to heat up.
By considering the pointers above, you can be sure to have an enjoyable experience vaping in cold weather. It will also help prevent your vaping device from malfunctioning!

Why Choose Dry Herb Vaporizers Over Smoking?
August 31, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
While smoking can be very dangerous to anyone’s health, it remains to be a global trend until now. Campaigns have been launched against smoking and yet we still see people buying cigarettes day in, day out. There are of course some people who are aware of the dangers, particularly the health effects of smoking, but still, it seems that it is hard for them to quit the habit. The good news is there are already excellent alternatives to smoking. Now, there are dry herb vaporizers that you can count on. Get to know why these devices are better over regular cigarettes.
What is a Dry Herb Vaporizer?
A dry herb vaporizer is a device that has the capability to alter the way in which smoke is created. There is that type of vaporizer where combustion is used. In this type, direct heat is applied to the dry herb or plant that you are smoking. With this option, it looks like you are smoking regular cigarettes but actually, you are not. This type of vaporizer, however, releases unhealthy substances into the air and is not the dry herb vaporizer that we are saying is a better alternative to smoking.
The other type of dry herb vaporizer is one that comes with a heftier price tag than the first alternative we have talked about. This is healthier because you do not apply direct heat to the dry herbs that you are smoking. An example of this type of vaporizer is the Airistech Herbva Pro Dry Herb Vaporizer.
Now, let’s find out more about why using a dry herb vaporizer is better than smoking traditional cigarettes:
Easier On Your Lungs
Smoking cigarettes produce tar that can greatly affect an individual’s lungs. This can lead to possible chronic symptoms. But with vaping, these incidents can be avoided since the vaporizer only creates vapor. You can inhale the vapor and not worry about letting residue stay in the lungs. Individuals, who started using vaporizers, have reported that they experienced improvements in overall lung health, i.e. fewer chronic symptoms of wheezing and coughing.
A Better High
If you use a vaporizer, you will be able to feel the results of your dry herbs much faster. This is possible because your body is able to absorb the contents at a faster pace. This is also beneficial for individuals who are using dry herbs to relieve chronic pain or stress. Since the vaping method utilizes over 90% of the dry herb material, the vaper can experience a purer taste.
Saves You Money
The vaping method usually consumes a lesser amount of dry herbs to deliver the pleasant sensations you want. That’s why vaping has the potential of saving you hundreds of dollars in the long-term. You do not need to keep buying tobacco cigarettes.
Choosing to use dry herb vaporizers is the best move you can make today if you want to quit smoking. As mentioned, it can be a good stress reliever – a function commonly connected with smoking cigarettes – and is the better alternative as compared to puffing and releasing toxins into the air with the traditional smoking method.

What Do 510 Thread Batteries Mean?
August 29, 2018 by DiscountVapePen
510 thread batteries is a term used to describe a thread design that is universal, one that doesn’t have much basis within the thread’s technical specifications. Another expression commonly used is ego thread, which is a word largely used to denote a style which has gained wide acceptance within the vape community.
Battery Connections
It should first be noted that not all male 510 threads will connect with every female 510 thread. The correct components must always be selected irrespective of the fit. That being said, there is a great deal of compatibility among batteries and cartridges and this has given numerous batteries and cartridge brands the opportunity to work well.
Understanding the pairing components is essential as it will provide you with an advantage in establishing a kit which can function well with numerous carts that are store-bought and which use 510 threads.
An adapter which is magnetic will often be utilized to boost the distinctiveness of a product, and many enthusiasts love the 510 threads since it allows most vape pen merchandise to be open source, which means it can be fully customized to provide the best experience possible.
Understanding Voltage
The batteries used in vape pens can be purchased in a variety of voltages, with different styles. The standard range that you’ll come across is from 3.3v to 4.8v. Generally speaking, the voltage of the slim pen and stylus will fall into the 3.3v range, with the voltage being adjustable based on the draw strength, which can bring them down to 3.0v. This voltage will be most optimal for standard oil cartridges that use a polycarbonate style. However, it won’t provide sufficient power to thoroughly heat a wickless or ceramic cartridge. These types of cartridges provide a vapor which is superior in quality and have a range that starts at 3.7v or more.
Establishing the correct voltage is largely dependent on atomizer resistance. Having a lower voltage is an indication that the vapor will have greater purity but the hit will be lighter, so it is best to begin low and then move upward. It should also be emphasized that voltage numbers will not inform you as to whether a product is superior; it just reveals whether or not the product is ideal for the cartridge.
Understanding Mah
Many enthusiasts want to know how long the pen will hold its charge. The best way to determine this is by reviewing mah, or milliamp hour. This will inform you of the amount of power which will be supplied by a battery and the length of time that a charge will be maintained. In most cases, the battery of the vape pen will provide a mah which ranges from 280 to 900. 900 mah is extremely high and as such, it is only used for kits which are high resistance or high voltage like wax pen batteries.
