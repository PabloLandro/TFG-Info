An Australian Law Firm seeking those who have been harmed by wi-fi.
Premier Compensation Lawyers, based in New South Wales, Australia is now seeking potential clients who believe they have been adversely affected by WiFI. This is from their website:
If you believe that the effects of WiFi have caused injury to yourself, your child/children or a friend, you are not alone. The increasingly wide spread use of WiFi across business and government (especially in schools) is a move that goes against the rapidly mounting body of credible scientific evidence which makes increasingly clear that exposure to even low levels of WiFi on an ongoing basis has a wide range of serious adverse health effects.
In recent years it is well established that there are numerous adverse health effects of WiFi, although not always immediate, many of which are cumulative and irreversible, and have most damaging effects on children.
As from 2015, Lloyds of London, one of the world’s largest insurers, due to its conclusion that WiFi has long tail claims exposure (like asbestos) excluded as standard from all policies any WiFi health claims. Many insurers have followed.
If you think the exposure to WiFi has caused issues/injury please contact us to discuss.
