To lose weight you must expend more calories and energy than you take in. It is as simple as that. You get your calories from the food groups, carbohydrates, fats and proteins.
OK now let's take a look at some of the more effective remedies for natural weight loss. We can start with Green tea and ginger.
Green tea and ginger. Green tea has long been debated as a weight loss aid for quite some time, and more research is needed to establish the true effectiveness. However the caffeine that is inside green tea does help speed up the metabolic process and other body functions, so this in turn will help promote weight reduction over time.
Rose petal water.
The benefits of rose petal water have been backed by anecdotal evidence more than anything else; however you should not ignore this drink at all. Rose petals will act as a very gentle diuretic. Diuretics encourage your kidneys to increase the amount of sodium (salt) in to your urine.
In this process, here is what happens, the diuretics lose salt which is reduced from your kidneys, this ten draws water from the blood,and this in turn decreases the amount of blood in your circulatory system. It should be noted that this is not permanent weight loss just water weight, however this action encourages more drinking to keep your system flushed, clean and hydrated. Staying hydrated believe it or not can be a hugely beneficial to losing weight.
Dandelion and peppermint. Dandelion and peppermint tea is a drink that will prolong the life of your liver and keep it healthy. The liver plays a very central role in the body's metabolic process. Many of these functions affect weight management. The liver is full of cells that break down the fat cells stored so they can be used as energy. These cells also break down and absorb fat, which can also be used for energy expenditure. The list of functions that your liver is responsible for goes on, however the bottom line is that dandelion helps keep the liver healthy. Having a healthy liver is more beneficial overall for weight reduction.
Chew gum. Believe it or not by chewing gum you actually trick your brain and stomach in to thinking it's getting more than it is. The flavour of chewing gum rescues the appetite and helps resist the urge to eat or snack on unhealthy foods. This also stimulates the flow of saliva, these enzymes breaks down starches and fats.
Develop a rotuine. Have a routine and stick to it as much as possible. Routine is one of the most important elements when it comes to natural weight loss. It is right up there with a healthy well balanced diet. If you do not have some kind of routine in place,then any progress made will be slower and also your overall strategy will be less effective.
It only takes about 3 weeks to start and develop a new habit from scratch, so the best way to get started is to start small. Start making small changes to your dietary habits and exercise routine and keep this up for about 21 days. If you stick to a routine for about 80% of the time then you will see positive progress, and this will speed up the process of natural weight loss.
Use Coconut oil for cooking.
Coconut oil is not just a saturated fat, it contains special fats that will help you use energy (calories) more effectively. This alone will not promote weight loss, however if you replace coconut oil with other fats that you have been using then this will help you burn of excess fats.
