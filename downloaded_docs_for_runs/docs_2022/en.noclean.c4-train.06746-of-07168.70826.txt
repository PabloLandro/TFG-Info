Addictive Personality and Weed Addiction
Do you have an addictive personality?
There are many people that have what is called an “addictive” personality. They become obsessed and fanatic about certain things, both good and bad. Too much of any one thing, even if it is considered to be good, can end up having a negative impact on your life. For those that try drugs and alcohol it could result in terrible consequences and addiction.
As a person smokes weed they feel happy, relaxed and worry-free but over time they will need more and more to acquire the same level. At some point the tables are going to turn and they will suffer financially, professionally, socially and spiritually. For those that don’t realize they have become addicted they will continue down the same road blaming others for their poor quality of life. Those with an addictive personality will put more and more resources into getting their fix. Often the negative consequences of smoking weed are never considered, just the desire to get “high.”
When a person decides to quit smoking weed they need to address their conditioning and the psychological effects of smoking weed. For however long you have been smoking weed you have been telling yourself how good it feels, how it relaxes you and how it helps you cope with daily life. All these will need to be addressed when you quit smoking or you will feel like you have given up your best friend. Obviously most of society is able to live without smoking weed and being an addict.
Quitting smoking weed is one of the best things you can do for your health and well-being. However, the last thing you want to do is allow your addictive personality to move from one addiction to another. Often people quit smoking weed only to take up drinking or eating more. The goal when getting your life back on track is to find balance and healthy ways of dealing with daily life.
