Benefits Of Wearing Sunglasses
Prevents skin cancer
Reduces the risk of cataracts
Prevents macular degeneration
Keep away pinguecula
The most vital organ that we fail to protect from the adverse effect of sun is the eyes. There are several kinds of eye damages that can be caused by too much exposure to the sun. However, wearing sunglasses while out can prevent skin cancer, risk of cataracts, and macular degeneration from occurring.
There are already quite a number of lotions and ointments which helps us protect our skin from the stern effects of sun. Most of these products come with different degree of SPF. However, the one most vital organ that we fail to protect from the adverse effect of sun is the eyes.
How Can the Sun Damage Your Eyes?
Very much like the skin, our eyes are susceptible to the damage from too much exposure to the sun. The skin around your eyes, including your eyelids, is among the thinnest and most sensitive on your body, making it particularly vulnerable to wrinkling and age spots from excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. There are several kinds of eye damages that can be caused by too much exposure to the sun.
However, you don’t have to worry about it though, as there are quite a lot of products that are available in the market of which sunglasses are the most effective ones. Considered as a fashion accessory by most, many ignore the properties that make sunglasses one of best ways of protecting the eyes from probable damages due to intense exposure to sun. If you have been wearing sunglasses until now without knowing its benefits or if you do not prefer to wear them, here are some of the health benefits that you might want to know about the benefits of wearing sunglasses.
Why You Should Wear Sunglasses?
Prevents Skin Cancer
First of all, since up to 10 percent of all skin cancers are found on the eyelid, protecting the skin around our eyes from the direct light of the sun is very important. Sunglasses can do that.
Reduces The Risk Of Cataracts
The World Health Organization reports that, worldwide, approximately 900,000 people are blind because of cataracts (cloudiness in the lens of the eye) triggered by UV exposure. The risk of developing cataracts can be diminished by wearing sunglasses with UV protection.
Prevents Macular Degeneration
Over time UV light may play a role in damaging the macula lutea (an area of the eye with millions of light-sensing cells, which allow us to see fine details clearly), potentially leading to blurriness and vision loss. Thus wearing sunglasses help a lot.
Ward Off Photokeratitis
Photokeratitis, which is essentially a sunburn of the eye, is temporary (healing within 48 hours) but can be very painful, causing blurred vision, light sensitivity, and the sensation of having sand in your eye. It can develop after several hours under intense UV ray exposure. You can prevent photokeratitis from developing on your eyes by wearing sunglasses with UV ray protection.
Keep Away Pinguecula
A pinguecula is a non-cancerous eye growth, often painless, on the white part of the eye that can develop in everyone from kids to seniors. This can occur in anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, especially in a dry climate, without protecting the eyes from harmful UV rays is at risk. Thus, wearing sunglasses can again prevent this from happening.
Pterygium
Pinguecula can develop into ptergium if not treated in time. This is a thick growth of tissues and blood vessels on the eye. Due to inflammation, this can cause vision disturbances. This may need to be corrected with minor surgery.
What Should You Look For In Sunglasses?
Never use price to determine the quality of the sunglasses, as many of the higher priced brands cost more because of fashion, not function. Here is a quick quick guide that will help you buy the efficient sunglasses:
Avoid sunglasses that says “absorbs UV.” Look for a label that says 99-100 percent UV absorption or UV 400.
Polarized lenses help cut glare allowing for crisper vision, but they do not add sun protection.
Darker lens colors don’t mean better sun protection. The UV protectant added to lenses is clear; even grey, green, yellow or rose lenses can offer adequate UV protection.
Sunglasses made from plastic leads to distorted vision when you look to the right or left. Never buy them.
Larger frames shield more UV rays than smaller ones.
