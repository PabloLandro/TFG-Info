Highly flammable and poisonous type of alcohol which, when ingested even in quantities as small as 10 milliliter (two tea-spoonsful), can cause permanent blindness, and 100 milliliter may be fatal. Made by catalytic oxidation of methane (from natural gas), methanol can be used as an alternative fuel or as a gasoline additive. It is miscible with water and most organic liquids such as gasoline. When mixed with gasoline, it lowers carbon monoxide emissions but increases hydrocarbon emissions. Used alone, its emissions are less ozone harming than those of gasoline. Its other uses are for organic synthesis, especially of formaldehyde (methanal).
Also called wood alcohol, its chemical name is methyl alcohol.
