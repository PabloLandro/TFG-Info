Case Description
A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that did not require home oxygen, as well as hypertension, was brought to our emergency department after being found unresponsive at home. The patient's family said he was in his usual state of health until today, when they noticed increased dyspnea consistent with his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They believed it was caused by recent overexertion cleaning tools with various chemicals. His breathing became worse as the day progressed, and he was found overnight to be diaphoretic and unresponsive, prompting a 9-1-1 call. The family denied sick contacts, recent travel, and toxin ingestion.
Examination in the emergency department showed a chronically ill man in severe distress, with rapid shallow respirations, prompting immediate intubation. He exhibited no purposeful movements and no response to noxious stimuli, but his pupils were responsive to light. Vital signs included a heart rate of 86 beats/min; respirations, 26 breaths/min; blood pressure, 196/112 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 95% by pulse oximetry. Point-of-care glucose was 176 mg/dL (reference interval, 70–199 mg/dL). An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without ST segment changes. Initial laboratory testing included a basic metabolic panel, lactic acid, and arterial blood gases (Table 1). A white blood cell count was 20.8 K/mm3 (3.9–9.9 K/mm3).

Initial patient results.
Using the calculated total CO2 from the arterial blood gas, the anion gap was 27 mmol/L (2–15 mmol/L). Serum osmolality was 329 mOsm/kg (275–300 mOsm/kg), with a calculated osmolal gap of 52 mOsm/kg. Other initial blood testing included a hepatic function panel, lipase, troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and acetaminophen; all were unremarkable. Urinalysis was notable for 1+ ketones and 2+ protein. Computed tomography of the head and abdomen showed no acute abnormalities. A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac silhouette and no evidence of pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.
QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER
How is the anion gap calculated, and what is its significance?
How is an osmolal gap calculated, and what is its significance?
What is the differential diagnosis for a high anion gap metabolic acidosis?
Discussion
Electrical charge in the blood is balanced by cations and anions in the form of protons (H+), electrolytes, and organic compounds (1). The anion gap is estimated by subtracting plasma chloride plus bicarbonate concentrations (the main blood anions) from the plasma sodium concentration (the main blood cation):
A gap of up to 15 mmol/L normally exists because other blood anions such as phosphates, sulfates, and proteins are not routinely measured (1). Some laboratories choose to include [K+] in their calculation, in which case the normal gap is about 4 mmol/L higher.
Serum osmolality represents all dissolved particles in blood and is monitored by the hypothalamus as an indicator of hydration status (2). Normally, the main contributors to serum osmolality are sodium, chloride, glucose, and urea. These analytes (with sodium used as a proxy for chloride) are used to estimate the predicted serum osmolality, which often underestimates osmolality measured by freezing point depression by up to 10 mOsm/kg H2O (2), referred to as the osmolal gap:
where:
A widely accepted simplified equation for predicted osmolality with equal clinical utility (3) is:
High anion gap metabolic acidosis is a physiologic state defined by laboratory data. The differential diagnosis of high anion gap metabolic acidosis is broad, and a full diagnostic workup, tailored to the clinical scenario, is needed to delineate between the various etiologies. A popular mnemonic, MUDPILES, is used to remember the common causes, although an alternative mnemonic, GOLDMARK, has also been proposed (Table 2) (1). This new mnemonic includes more recently described metabolic acidoses such as D-lactate, a form produced in patients with short bowel syndrome, as well as oxoproline, a glutamic acid metabolite that accumulates in chronically ill patients with poor renal function and acetaminophen use (4).

Patient Follow-Up
A serum volatiles test by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection identified methanol at a concentration of 72 mg/dL (reference interval, ≤20 mg/dL). The patient was started on fomepizole and admitted to the intensive care unit for emergent hemodialysis. During placement of a central line for hemodialysis, the patient began seizing and entered status epilepticus. He subsequently developed diffuse cerebral and brainstem edema because of global hypoxic ischemic injury. Further discussions with the family revealed the patient had a history of alcoholism but claimed to be abstinent for the past 4 years. Although they did not see him consume any substances, they did note he had been spending more time in the garage cleaning tools with various chemicals, including denatured alcohol. He had also complained of light sensitivity, for which the patient had visited the optometrist the day before admission. Given the grim prognosis of the ischemic brain injury, the family opted for comfort measures, and the patient died 48 h after admission.
Methanol Toxicity
Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol, is a water-soluble colorless liquid used as a solvent in a wide range of cleaning products and varnishes, as well as a fuel octane booster (5). It is also used as a denaturant, a substance added to solutions containing primarily ethanol to render them unfit for human consumption (5). Methanol largely has no associated taste and has a mildly alcoholic smell. In 2015, there were 2117 cases of methanol exposure reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers; 16 of those exposures resulted in death (6). These numbers likely underestimate the true incidence of methanol exposures, as reporting to poison control centers is voluntary.
Methanol itself is not toxic, but toxicity results from its conversion to formic acid by the liver (7). Alcohol dehydrogenase converts methanol to formaldehyde, which is rapidly converted by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid. Formic acid deprotonates to produce formate and H+, consuming extracellular bicarbonate and resulting in metabolic acidosis with an anion gap. Formate also inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, increasing lactate production (7). Particularly susceptible to the effects of formic acid are the putamen and subcortical white matter in the brain, as well as the optic nerves (7). Clinical manifestations of methanol toxicity include altered mental status, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nausea, and vomiting. Chronic toxicity can cause atrophy of the optic nerves, causing blindness. Severe cases may cause seizures, coma, cerebral edema, pancreatitis, and death (7).
Diagnosis of methanol toxicity often relies on history provided by the patient or witnesses and clinical suspicion. The gold standard for laboratory diagnosis is detection and quantification of methanol by gas chromatography, but this methodology is often not available in a timely manner in most community and rural settings (8). Enzymatic assays measuring plasma formate or alcohols in blood or saliva have been developed but are not widely used (8). Fortunately, methanol toxicity is associated with derangements in common laboratory methods that should alert clinicians, namely, increases in both the anion and osmolal gaps.
In cases of methanol poisoning, consumption of bicarbonate by formic and lactic acids increases the anion gap. However, if tested shortly after exposure, or if there was coingestion of ethanol, there may not be sufficient formate production to yield an increased anion gap. Alcohol dehydrogenase has a higher affinity for ethanol; thus, coingestion with methanol can delay the production of formate (7). Methanol also contributes to serum osmolality when present and increases osmolality measured by freezing point depression but not by vapor pressure osmometry (2). Therefore, in cases of methanol toxicity there will be an increased osmolal gap, reflecting the discrepancy between the predicted and measured plasma osmolalities. As with other toxic alcohols, as time passes, the osmolal gap decreases and the anion gap increases (9).
Unfortunately, neither anion gap or osmolal gap increases are specific for methanol toxicity. The broad differential diagnosis for a high anion gap has already been discussed, but the presence of an osmolal gap with an increasing anion gap strongly suggests ethylene glycol (oxalic acid is the toxic metabolite) or methanol (5), as in this case. The one toxic alcohol that produces an osmolal gap, but does not result in an anion gap, is isopropanol (9). Isopropanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone, which is nonacidic.
A retrospective study reported the sensitivity and specificity of the osmolal gap for toxic alcohol ingestion to be 0.82 and 0.85, respectively, with a cutoff of >14 mOsm/kg (10). Other causes of increased osmolal gap that should be considered include alcoholic and diabetic ketoacidosis (acetone accumulation), renal failure, shock, and mannitol infusion (10). False-negative findings can occur in patients whose osmolalities are tested after the majority of methanol has been metabolized.
Treatment of those with methanol poisoning focuses on reducing production of formic acid and removal of methanol and its metabolites. Ethanol can be used as a competitive inhibitor of methanol metabolism as earlier described. A more popular option today is fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, which does not carry the risks of ethanol (7). Methanol is slowly eliminated by respiration and in urine (9), so in cases of severe toxicity, intermittent hemodialysis is recommended by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (7). Although the recommended threshold to initiate hemodialysis is a serum methanol concentration of >50 mg/dL, poor patient outcome better correlates with the severity of acidemia (blood pH), the development of seizures, and cerebral edema (7).
POINTS TO REMEMBER
Anion gap is an estimate of unmeasured anions, including organic acids and proteins, which maintain electric neutrality in the blood; one formula to determine anion gap is
The main contributors to serum osmolality are sodium, chloride, glucose, and urea; osmolal gap represents the difference between a predicted osmolality based on these solutes and the measured osmolality, where:
High anion gap metabolic acidosis is associated with several causes, which can be remembered by the mnemonics MUDPILES and GOLDMARK.
Methanol toxicity manifests on routine laboratory testing first as an increased osmolal gap followed by an increasing anion gap with metabolic acidosis.
The toxic effects of methanol are mediated by formic acid, which impairs oxidative phosphorylation, particularly in the central nervous system and optic nerves, causing central nervous system depression, visual disturbances, and, in severe cases, coma, seizures, and death.
Timing of specimen collection and coingestion of ethanol can prevent detection of increased anion and osmolal gaps in methanol toxicity.
