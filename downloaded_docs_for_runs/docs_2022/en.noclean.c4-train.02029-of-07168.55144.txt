Can You Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding?
Many women want to know things like "Can I get pregnant while breastfeeding?", "Can I get pregnant while on depo?" and "Can you get pregnant while on the pill?". These are tough questions because every woman is different, and pregnancy can happen under the most unlikely of circumstances.
While breastfeeding or while nursing, you can use this as a method of spacing out your pregnancies but, overall, breastfeeding is not a perfect method of birth control. Your body begins to ovulate sometime during the time of breastfeeding, but it can take up to six months before you are fertile again. This means that you may not have a period at all and can get pregnant again, even though you have not stopped breastfeeding. Use a barrier method of birth control if you are breastfeeding and don’t want to get pregnant.

Eventually, your ovaries kick into gear, and you begin ovulating even while breastfeeding. You cannot get pregnant while not ovulating but the exact time that you begin to ovulate varies from woman to woman. Many women are fertile at about six months postpartum, even if they are breastfeeding.
Can You Get Pregnant While on Birth Control?
You can get pregnant while fertile, even if you are on birth control. The birth control pill is not perfect and for some women, the birth control pill does not act strongly enough to suppress ovulation and they can get pregnant on the pill. Some women have decreased the effectiveness of the pill while taking antibiotics so you should use a barrier method of birth control on any cycle in which you are on antibiotics and while on birth control. Can you get pregnant while taking Provera? The odds of getting pregnant while on Provera are lower than when you are on birth control pills, but one out of every 1000 women will get pregnant while on Provera.
Can you get pregnant while on the IUD? This is very rare and usually happens if the IUD has fallen out, and you didn’t notice that it wasn’t there. The IUD affects the lining of the uterus so that, while you may still ovulate, you won’t be able to implant any fertilized egg that is in the fallopian tube or uterus. While on Mirena, which is a form of IUD, your chances of getting pregnant are less than one in a thousand.
Can You Get Pregnant While Spotting or Bleeding?
This depends on the cause of the spotting or bleeding. If you are having spotting or bleeding from a friable cervix, this does not impact your fertility, and you can still get pregnant. If the bleeding is from a lack of estrogen or progesterone, this probably means you are having an abnormal cycle and are less likely to get pregnant.
You can get pregnant while having a yeast infection or while having Chlamydia. These things do not impact your fertility over the short haul, although having untreated chlamydia for several months can cause your tubes to scar and can greatly reduce your fertility. If you are having symptoms of Chlamydia such as a malodorous discharge and burning in the vaginal area, you should visit your doctor to see if you have an infection like Chlamydia that can impact your fertility.

Can You Get Pregnant While Going Through Menopause?
Your fertility is very low while going through menopause so that you can expect that you are not able to become pregnant while going through menopause. It is still possible, but the chances are that your eggs will not yield a viable pregnancy. Your fertility drops dramatically after the age of forty so that, when you are fifty and going through menopause, you have a much less chance of getting pregnant. An ovulatory cycle can slip in there every once in a while but this is rare, and you can consider yourself unable to get pregnant after you have missed your period for about a year.
Can You Get Pregnant While Pregnant?
No. There is no chance that you can get pregnant while already pregnant. The hormonal milieu is such that you don’t ovulate again once the embryo has implanted, and pregnancy has begun. You can, however, get pregnant while tubes are tied. This is because the tube can grow back together unless a large piece is cut out of the tube so that the tube has no chance of reconnecting with the other side of the tube.
You cannot get pregnant while menstruating unless you have very long periods of bleeding, and you ovulate while still bleeding. This is very unlikely so that, while, on your cycle, the only days you can get pregnant are the “fertile days”, which are days 9-14 of your cycle. Women who bleed for longer than 9 days in a cycle are probably not ovulating anyway because most menstrual periods are not that long. You might ovulate and get pregnant from sperm deposited in the vaginal vault on day 9 of your cycle. By then, most women will have stopped bleeding.
Some women wonder how to get pregnant while on birth control. It is certainly harder to do when compared to not being on birth control. Your best chances to get pregnant while on birth control pills is to take antibiotics, which will reduce the effectiveness of the pill. If you don’t want to get pregnant, have sex while using a condom. That way, if you have a failure of birth control, you have a backup option so that you don’t get pregnant while ovulating.
The Chances of Getting Pregnant While Breastfeeding
In the early stages of breastfeeding, you will not ovulate, and you will be protected from getting pregnant. After about six months of breastfeeding, however, you will begin to ovulate again and will have a chance to get pregnant even if you are exclusively breastfeeding. The exact time that you will ovulate varies from woman to woman. If you are exclusively breastfeeding, you basically cannot get pregnant for the first three months. After that, you have a 2 percent chance of getting pregnant from 3 to 6 months after giving birth and after six months, your chances of getting pregnant rise to six percent as long as you exclusively breastfeed. If you are breastfeeding exclusively, your periods might not come back for up to fourteen months after delivery. If you are not exclusively breastfeeding, your chances of getting pregnant go up.
How to Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding
There is little you can do to stimulate ovulation while breastfeeding. Your body must do this on its own. If you cut back on breastfeeding and use a bottle some of the time, there is a greater chance that you will ovulate and will get pregnant while still breastfeeding. As you can see from the above statistics, it is not easy to get pregnant while exclusively breastfeeding. Some women will ovulate relatively soon after delivery while others will not become fertile for six to twelve months after giving birth and exclusively breastfeeding.
How to Get Pregnant While on the Depo Shot?
It is not easy to get pregnant while on the depo shot. Once the shot is given, you cannot get pregnant for the next three months. There is no way to counteract the effects of the depo shot. In addition, the depo shot can lower your fertility for up to two years after you have been on the shot for a while. If you don’t want this kind of trade off, then depo is not the choice of birth control you should be on. It is very protective against getting pregnancy and only about one out of a thousand women will get pregnant while the shot is still active.
Tips for Staying Comfortable and Healthy While Pregnant
Tips for Staying Comfortable and Healthy While Pregnant
Here are some things you need to know about being pregnant, including symptoms you may have and what to do about them:
How to get rid of heartburn while pregnant. You can always take TUMS while pregnant if you are experiencing heartburn. Some doctors will allow you to take Zantac for severe heartburn. Eat small meals and have the head of your bed elevated throughout the pregnancy to reduce heartburn symptoms.
How to get rid of a headache while pregnant. Headaches are common in pregnancy. You can get rid of a headache in pregnancy by taking acetaminophen or just by resting with a cold rag on your forehead. Most headaches of pregnancy are self-limited and mild so if you just wait it out, it will usually go away on its own.
How to get rid of a yeast infection while pregnant. Yeast infections are not uncommon in pregnancy. Fortunately, the over the counter remedies like Monistat are safe in pregnancy and you can just purchase Monistat cream or suppositories to get rid of the yeast infection.
How to get rid of nausea while pregnant. Nausea of pregnancy is best dealt with by having a little bit of something in your stomach at all times to dilute out stomach acid. It may mean having crackers by the bedside to eat during the night or when you first get up in the morning so you don’t get out of bed on an empty stomach. Eat small meals that are not too spicy so that your stomach is less acidic.
How to get in shape while pregnant. You can get in shape while pregnant by doing just about any low impact aerobic activity. This can include walking, jogging, swimming and sports like golf and tennis. These will help you burn calories to stay in shape but will not harm the pregnancy. Contact sports are definitely not acceptable during pregnancy.
How to get rid of constipation while pregnant. Constipation is common in pregnancy. You can get rid of constipation in pregnancy by taking in a lot of fluids and fiber or by using medications like Milk of Magnesia that can control constipation on a regular basis. Stay active so your bowels are always stimulated.
How to get rid of acne while pregnant. Acne is not that common in pregnancy. If you do find yourself with acne in pregnancy, you can use topical benzoyl peroxide on the facial areas so as to dry up acne spots and prevent new ones from occurring. Systemic medications are not recommended in pregnancy for the treatment of acne.
How to get comfortable while pregnant. It can be hard to get comfortable while pregnant. The best thing you can do is lie on your left side and rest as much as you can. Keep the environment cool so you are not too hot and shift your body around so that you can finally get comfortable. If you have restless legs during pregnancy, you can massage your legs before bedtime and take a warm bath before trying to go to sleep. These things can help you get a good night’s sleep until you deliver.
How to get rid of external hemorrhoids while pregnant. You can get witch hazel pads to help dry up external hemorrhoids in pregnancy. You can also have a high fiber diet so that you aren’t straining so much when having a bowel movement. If hemorrhoids are bad, try to stay off your feet as much as possible and lie on your left side to get the pressure off the veins of the anal area.
Can You Get a Tattoo While Pregnant?
There is nothing that says you can't get a tattoo while pregnant. The dye just goes under the skin so it won’t harm the fetus. Be sure to get a tattoo in a spot that isn’t so stretched out in pregnancy or you will have a tattoo that does not look normal after pregnancy. Be sure to get your tattoo from a licensed and reputable tattoo artist so as not to get an infection from equipment that is not sterilized.
