SALTOPIA's HIMALAYAN SALT LAMPS:
ALL COME WITH CERTIFICATES of AUTHENTICITY TRACEABLE THROUGH OUR
​US GOVERNMENT CUSTOMS & BORDERS
SALTOPIA’s Certified Himalayan Salt Lamps are highly beneficial to your health and well-being.
Himalayan Salt Lamps are Mother Nature’s best Ionizers, which provides multiple health benefits.
Himalayan Salt Lamps origin:
Himalayan Salt Lamps are made from salt that originated from our oceans 600 million years ago, which were free from any man-made contaminants. This salt was formed during the time the dinosaurs ruled the Earth and the continents collided raising ocean beds high into the mountains of the Himalayas. The salt from those beds still remains deep inside the mountains. Himalayan natural sea salt is actually Ancient Sea Salt. Our oceans cover over 70% of the earth’s surface. Unfortunately man has traveled, explored and ultimately polluted many of the world’s oceans. Most alarming is that our oceans are now contaminated with heavy metals like mercury, lead, cadmium and arsenic.
Himalayan Salt Lamp Benefits & how they work for us:
Many people swear by the Himalayan Salt's healing ability, claiming relief from the common cold, the curing of skin problems, mental health disorders, respiratory illness, headaches, migraines and much more. SALTOPIA’s Himalayan Salt Lamps are the most exquisite, guaranteed all-natural and certified authentic. SALTOPIA’s Himalayan Lamps are designed so that the slightest amount of heat inside the salt crystals will attract water molecules from the air, forming a NaCl and H20 solution. Sodium is a positive ion, and Chloride, a negative ion. Hydrogen has a two part negative charge and Oxygen is a positively charged ion. These ions create a reaction of two positive ions and three negative ions. After canceling each other out, one lone negative ion is produced. This negative ion seeks out the first positive ion like a dust, or bacteria particle and removes it from the air. This is the natural process of positive ion reduction and this is how our Himalayan Salt Lamps work their magic!
We offer Certification on each and every lamp sold:
Unfortunately, many companies manufacture salt lamps. Please know that these are not the same as a Certified Himalayan Lamp. Acrylic salt lamps do not offer benefits to your health in any way. This is why we offer the valid Certification proving that our lamps indeed are harvested from the Himalayan Mountains. Each certificate clarifies the approximate date of each Himalayan Salt harvest and vessel arrival notice from SALTOPIA’s Himalayan salt farms. We can absolutely track each and every harvest to confirm true authenticity.
What are specific health benefits from owning a Certified Himalayan Salt Lamp?
Today’s technology including computers, TV’s, microwave’s, cordless phones, mobile phones…even a vacuum cleaner - emit large amounts of positive ions. Tobacco smoke, hair dryers, electric heaters are only a few more that are creating havoc on our bodies and quality of life. The potential outcome is physical and mental fatigue among other chronic illnesses.
Having a Himalayan Salt Lamp converting positive ions into negative ions may assist in better health and well-being by reducing:
•Dust
•Pollen (grass, weed and tree pollen)
•Dust mites
•Animal dander
•Mold spores
•Bacteria
•Radiation
•“Electric Smog” (poor air quality from the use of daily technology)
Once the air is “cleaner” as a result from the Himalayan Lamp’s negative Ions, you may be able to see positive results for some of these ailments:
•Hay fever
•Asthma and other respiratory complications
•Air purifying
•Odor reduction
•Smoke elimination
•Seasonal depression disorder
•Depression
•Chronic fatigue
•Enhancement of immunity

Bioenergotherapists and homeopaths in Western Europe have recommended Himalayan Salt Lamps for a long time to support treatment of allergies, respiratory, blood systems and rheumatism. Because of their color they are also used in “color therapy” (also known as “chromotherapy). Their soothing light helps neurotic persons and people suffering from insomnia.
