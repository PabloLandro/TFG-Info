What is West Nile Virus?
Mosquitoes do more than just bug you, they can also make you sick. One of the diseases they carry is called West Nile virus. Mosquitoes get the virus from biting sick birds. They can then give you the virus when they bite you. You can only get West Nile virus from a mosquito that has the virus. Most people who get the virus do not feel sick. Some people feel like they have the flu. They can have a fever, headache, and rash or feel tired. Other people can get really sick if the virus infects their brains. The best way to protect yourself is not to get any mosquito bites.
