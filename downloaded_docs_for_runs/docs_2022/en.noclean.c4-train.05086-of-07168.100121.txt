There can be many different causes of nausea however among the most common reasons for this are; migraine, car sickness, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, anxiety, vertigo and food poisoning. Of course apart from this morning sickness experienced during pregnancy are quite common. While some foods can intensify nausea, some of them help to alleviate it. If you experience the nausea regularly and there is no particular reason for this you must visit your doctor for a diagnosis. You can consume the following foods and beverages to palliate the temporary nausea.
What is Good for Nausea?
Ginger: Ginger is good for nausea experienced for different reasons such as car sickness or morning sickness experience during pregnancy. You can drink 2-3 cups of ginger tea in a day to alleviate the nausea. It is recommended to use fresh ginger slice to prepare the tea instead of ginger powder.
Easy to Digest Foods: When you have nausea you can eat snacks such as saltine instead of rich in protein and fatty foods which are relatively more difficult to digest. Crackers which have not heavy taste and smell can suppress the nausea.
Lemon: Some women use lemon for nausea experienced during pregnancy. The sour taste of the lemon or even sometimes just the smell can help to relieve the nausea. You can squeeze half a lemon to your ginger tea you prepared for a more effective solution.
Don’t Leave your Stomach Empty: Empty stomach may cause nausea. That is why you can consume foods which are light, keep you full, and do not have heavy smell and taste. You can eat a piece of bread in order to take the gastric juice and keep you full.
Water: Loss of water is another factor that exacerbates the nausea. Especially on the days you experience nausea pay attention to the amount of the water you drink. Do not drink caffeinated beverages and energy drinks. Drink the water slowly instead of drinking it at a time and pay attention to water that it is not too cod. If you experience the nausea because of loss of water you can consume bananas which is rich in potassium with water in order to put the minerals quickly in place.
Mint: In conditions which nausea are heavy, chewing 1-2 mint leaves or drinking mint tea can be good. The mint helps to relieve the nausea by relaxing your stomach. However if you have heartburn problem consuming mint may worsen the heartburn.
Apple: The apple accelerates the elimination of toxins that cause nausea from the body with its fibrous structure. Of course consuming 2-3 apples at a time may exacerbate the nausea. Slice 1 apple and eat slowly.
Dried Nuts: Protein deficiency may increase nausea however you may not want to eat meat, chicken or fish while you have nausea. Instead of these foods you can consume one handful of nuts, peanuts, almonds.
Chicken Broth: The chicken broth soup (with rice or noodle) which is one of the frequently used foods to help the treatment of diseases such as flu may be heavy to consume while you have nausea. However the chicken broth is good for nausea and you can drink the water of the boiled 2-3 pieces of chicken instead of preparing a soup. You can use the broth if you do not have
chicken at home.
Other Suggestion for Nausea
Rest: Excessive nausea is usually associated with dizziness. In these cases do not force yourself and try to rest. A short nap or lie on your back for 30 minutes will help to reduce the nausea.
Room Temperature: Do not sit in very hot environments. If you are at home open your windows and refresh the air inside.
Walk: Go out and walk at a slow pace, breathe.
As a result you can prevent the exacerbation of nausea in days you experience it by avoiding consuming excessive coffee, drinking tea opt for east to digest foods instead of eating meat dishes or fast food.
Since constant nausea can be seen as a symptom of another health problem, medical supervision may be required. If you experience nausea with the following condition you need to go to a health care provider immediately and must be examined.
