How To Care For Your Mouth after Tooth Extraction
Posted on 25/12/2015 by Ronald Hooks
It’s important to take care of the mouth after a tooth extraction. There are certain things you can do on the first day that may help you to feel much better and heal faster. A professional dentist can do the extraction procedure. The following are some of them
What to Do
To Control Bleeding
The bite on the gauze is placed by the dentist firmly to control the bleeding. The pressure that will come from the bite will help to form a blood clot in your tooth socket. But if you’ve excess bleeding, you should bite on a tea bag. The tea bag has titanic acid that helps in forming a clot. Bite on tea bag or gauze until the bleeding stops. If you’ve to ooze of blood on the first day, don’t worry, it’s a normal thing.
To Minimize Pain
You should take prescribed medication as required by the dentist to lessen the pain. While taking pain medication, be advised; don’t drive as you are likely to feel drowsy. Remember to ask the dentist if it’s okay to take medication.
To Reduce Swelling
You should put some ice pack on the cheek near extraction site. In this way, you will reduce swelling. You can make your ice pack by simply putting ice is the plastic bag and wrap it in a thin towel. Next, apply this ice pack to the cheek for about 10 minutes. Remove for about 5 minutes and repeat the procedure. There is some bruising you may see on your face, and they’ll go away on their own.
Get Adequate Rest
After your tooth extraction, minimize your activities for first 24 hours. Get enough rest in the course of the day and retire to bed early. While lying down slightly elevate your head. In addition to these, the following will also help your mouth to heal faster
Dos
Brush the Teeth gently- You should avoid brushing the extraction site.
Don’t use any toothpaste because rinsing toothpaste in the mouth may dislodge the blood clot.
Eat soft, healthy foods and snacks- Drink plenty of liquids and dine on soft foods after the extraction.
Don’ts
Don’t drink hot liquids – They increase swelling and also limit the use of alcohol as it will slow the healing process.
Doesn’t use a straw- Sucking on a straw may dislodge the blood clot lowering the healing process.
If the pain becomes severe, the bleeding becomes difficult to control, the swelling worsens, and rashes or itching occurs after you’ve taken your medication, contact your dentist immediately.
