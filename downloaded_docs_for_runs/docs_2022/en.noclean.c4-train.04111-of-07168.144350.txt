Autism
While numerous American autism groups connect vaccines to autism, Canada remains mute regarding the association. Independent research has provided significant evidence that the mercury-containing preservative, thimerosal; aluminum adjuvants; MMR vaccine; and the colossal number of vaccines injected within a very short time span, all contribute to the total burden of autism.
In 2009, three year old Julia was awarded compensation for injury from MMR-V vaccine (MMR plus chickenpox vaccine. Although born a healthy baby, nine days after her first dose of this vaccine she began having seizures and was admitted to a Miami hospital neurology ward where she remained for a month. When she returned home, she was functioning at the level of a two month old. Her diagnosis, post-compensation, was pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), a condition recognized by the US CDC since the 1990s or earlier as one of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Even more damning was the 2007 ruling of the US Vaccine Court that MMR vaccine was the proven cause of PDD-NOS in then-ten-year-old Bailey Banks.
In May 2011, a peer-reviewed study published in Pace Environmental Law Review uncovered eighty-three US cases of compensation granted to children for vaccine-induced brain damage court-designated as “encephalopathy”, “residual seizure disorder”, “developmental regression”, etc. In fact, the medical diagnoses of these children had been “autism”. The report’s authors suggest that the eighty-three compensated are ‘just the tip of an iceberg’. Such flagrant denial of the causal relationship between vaccines and autism was publicly demonstrated by the Hannah Polling case. A 2008 Health and Human Services (HHS) report which was leaked to the press conceded that Hannah’s encephalopathy and subsequent developmental regression was triggered by injection of multiple vaccines. However, the report studiously avoided naming her condition “autism” – instead, she was said to have “autism-like symptoms”.
In the past, it’s been assumed autism is a psychological disorder. According to Dr Marcel Kinsbourne, emeritus professor of paediatric neurology at Tufts University and expert in childhood developmental disorders: “It is well known and generally agreed that there are at least dozens of different causes of syndromes of the autistic spectrum. Specifically, such a child could have a degenerative metabolic or a subacute inflammatory condition of the nervous system…” (Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines – The Truth Behind a Tragedy by Andrew J Wakefield; 2011; pg 156) The digestive and immune systems can also be involved. The most serious of the illnesses included in the disease category, ASD, are autism, Asperger syndrome, Childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome and PDD-NOS. ASD also includes the very common abnormalities, attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
