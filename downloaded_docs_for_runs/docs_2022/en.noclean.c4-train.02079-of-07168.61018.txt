Eat those carrots
Slice a carrot in half crosswise and it’s easy to see that the veggie resembles an eye—look closely and you’ll even notice a pattern of radiating lines that mimic the pupil and iris. And the old wives’ tale is true: Munching on carrots will actually promote healthy eyes. Carrots are filled with vitamins and antioxidants, like beta-carotene, that decrease the chance of macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss in older people.

That is so neat! I always heard about carrots being good for your eyes, but I never looked at the inside of one like this and saw what is so obvious! I buy nothing but organic baby carrots which we eat daily.
