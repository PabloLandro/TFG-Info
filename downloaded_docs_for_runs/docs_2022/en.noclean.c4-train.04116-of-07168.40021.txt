The Cure for Electromagnetic Sensitivity: Maintaining an alkaline state in your body.
After a lot of research, I came across an individual who may have just found the cure for electromagnetic radiation sickness. It's to create and maintain an alkaline PH state in your body through the use of supplemental minerals.
The guy's name is Steven Magee, and if you go to his author page on Amazon you will see an update video where he discloses his experiment findings with plants and how he successfully applied those theories to his own body. Here is his page where that video can be found:

You can also use baking soda in small amounts daily to help things along, too.

Re: The Cure for Electromagnetic Sensitivity: Maintaining an alkaline state in your body.
I've wondered about this. Being slightly alkaline will numb the surface of your skin a little bit. It also makes your muscles a little stiff, and too much will make you disoriented (as in hyperventilating).
Supposedly WiFi will only penetrate a few millimeters into your skin, so if it's messing with your nerve endings, a little numbness there might not be a bad thing.

Mr Steven Magee is brilliant writer on solar panel dangers, but I still do not think that ES is an illness, but rather our immune system warning us that exposing our selves to radiations, that we have not evolved to live in, is stupid and dangerous. It is cognitive dissonance that is the problem. We are not listening/ understanding what our bodies are trying to tell us. It would be much wiser to listen to our bodies, than do more of what is destroying the future of the planet overdosing on energies. Do you really think being in radiation millions of times higher than natural, most of it frequencies never before experienced, is likely to me anything but dangerous for our health?
Being alkaline is the natural state of the body IE PH 7.2. We are acid because of induced electricity and modern junk food and a lack of earthing. Read about earthing. Knowing all this and reacting appropriately has not cured me and I just stay away from radiations and I am totally healthy.
The eye is the most sensitive organ to radiation and myopia is going through the roof. Look it up. The health effects of radiation are clear if you read the research. For some reason we seem totally determined to ignore it. DUH! Save energy and save health.
Any thing other than being alkaline is a symptom of electricity. Like ES.
If we are living earthed we could not be anything else than alkaline. Ph 7.2 IE Sleeping on the ground and not wearing shoes. It is only since carpets, lino, wooden floors plastic shoes and induced electricity that we have been able to carry permanent body charges and be acid. Wet earth is an extremely good conductor. In our evolutionary history most of us were in it most of the time.

This is not going to cure ES. I maintain an alkaline body almost all the time. All you need to do is eat the right foods and drink the right water to maintain a healthy PH. I use test strips to monitor my PH. Only once have I ever tested my PH and got an acidic result and that was because that day I splurged with sweets.
Maintaining a healthy alkaline state (being too alkaline is not good either) is definitely necessary to healing and health. Acidic ph causes disease. I keep my alkaline ph at about 7.2-7.5.

Have you tried the earthing thing? I have a fairly rural and muddy life style so did not notice much difference. I know many people with the inflammatory problems but being English they all know electricity is harmless. They are a bunch of generally unwell stoned computer addicted dreamers. It is painful to watch. A problem I found is the earthing, both because of live electric fields and the person becoming the return feed due to a manky mains earth. Scary. I am not sure how to measure the induced charge when some one is on a computer but I suspect that many people are getting a real BUZZ!

I agree with Super Laura.
You can drink tons of baking soda to try to shift the alkalinity of the body, but that will never be a cure for an acid body.
Take baking soda for a while, and you realize you can't digest foods well anymore.
Why? it makes the stomach acids being cancelled.
That is even dangerous, as it can't digest foods well, plus, the stomach acids won't kill what it is supposed to kill.
Short term, baking soda can help for so many things. But long term, it's NOT a solution.
Just think about teeth health: you can use baking soda to brush your teeth, they kill bacteria, clean biofilms (plaque), etc. At the same time, it irritates the linings of the gums, if used long term, may cause bleeding.
Even though it is helpful to fight caries, clean the mouth / teeth, well, it is not a solution to have healthy teeth.
Baking soda was used even against cancer, by dr. Simoncini. He injected baking soda in arteries going to the cancer, and cured many many patients. For that, he lost his medical license (because he gave up using chemio and radio therapies in children).
Well, even though baking soda cures the cancer (like killing these cells), it is far from being a warranty that your body will not keep producing cancer in the future. Baking soda is not attacking the pH problem from inside, from the base, it is only dealing with the symptoms of acidity.
only food, fresh air, exercise, vitamins and minerals, can make it all reverse.
Anything you add chemically, as a single substance, will only be like a partial solution to save the boat from sinking.
But unless one fixes the problem from within - why the heck is my body being so acid? - the problem may come back.
Cancer, caries, probably diminishing ES too ?

Baking Soda is Sodium Bicarbonate and is one of the salts the body needs, and as i have found Salt has helped cure my ES. Salts are alkaline, please take a look:

Re: The Cure for Electromagnetic Sensitivity: Maintaining an alkaline state in your body.
Yep, baking soda is extremely alkaline, that is why it cancels stomach acids.
I do take it sometimes, but for short term. NOt as a solution of acidity, as it DOES cancel acids in the stomach.
you need acids to digest food, or they may ferment or go undigested down the gut.
Have you personally tried to take baking soda for long? I did, for a while, but stopped after noticing that it slows digestion.
The best way to get your body alkaline is by diet control: increase raw fruits and veggies, lower the amount of animal protein, carbs, avoid pure sugar, additives, fight pathogens, clean heavy metals, you'll get an alkaline body.

You seem to be missing the point of what alkaline is. Acid and alkaline are electrical charges in the body. Junk food certainly adds acid. If we are earthed our bodies can exchange ions with the earth and go back to 7.2 ph but with electrically insulating shoes carpets lino etc they cannot. So we hold a charge. Static can build up also, so we hold that charge. We are too near to AC voltages and induce a current into our bodies. So we react bio electrically to a pulsing charge. We are exposed to air born radiations so they earth or short circuit through our bodies. Depending on their wave length we can hold an unbalanced charge. We suffer the effect of their shorting as a possibly perceived message by our bio electric communications system. We use both AC and DC in our body to send messages. All these induced voltages will confuse our biological functions as they are all electrical. Chemistry is all electrical. Food values are all electrical. We are a fragile system that only runs well at 7.2 ph which relates to our earthed design voltage.

The book "Healing is Voltage" is a total must to understand how the body works.

Re: The Cure for Electromagnetic Sensitivity: Maintaining an alkaline state in your body.
There is another way to control alkalinity, which is through homeopathy.
Sanum has some good products like Sanuvis, even Citrokehl can help on that.
We don't want to have alkaline STOMACH, nor alkaline mouth (or bacteria won't be dead, we'll have more parasites, GI problems, or tooth decay).
I eat a very healthy diet, full of veggies, mostly organic, lots of raw, etc.
I still think my gut is not alkaline due to heavy metals and toxins...
I mean, these are just some ideas. I'll get back to Sanuvis - Citrokehl now.

Organic does not mean without pesticide it means a high risk of masses of nicotenic pesticide and this will give you too much ACh. Please see the post about VGCC mechanism explains all the EHS symptoms?
The problem with organic is it does not work as well as it did so they just bung more and more on. Look at the PAN data on food contaminations.
The only cure for this is less exposure to EMR or tighter controls on pesticides. ACh is toxic in large amounts. The Governments seem very reluctant to regulate the markets for these pollutants and we EHS CFS FM etc are the consequence.
Money is more important than our health. This is poor governance. We need to campaign to change things.
