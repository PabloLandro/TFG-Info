The factors that can trigger nausea are listed here:

Stomach flu
Food poisoning
Pregnancy
Motion sickness and seasickness
Medications for certain ailments
There are some people who are not able to tolerate certain food groups, for example some people are lactose intolerant. This food intolerance can also give rise to nausea.
Some Home Remedies
Nausea can be easily treated with natural remedies some of which can be followed at home.
