Autism & Vaccines: is there a link?
Home » Autism & Vaccines: is there a link?
Vaccines CAN and DO trigger autism
Thousands of parents describe their children as ‘fine’ one day, then their children suddenly develop autism (a neurological regression) after vaccines.
What does the science say? It agrees…
But first let’s go through the numbers. The increase in autism cases in the last three decades is truly shocking. Before the 1980s, autism was so rare, it was not even tracked. Remember the eye-opening movie RainMan with Dustin Hoffman? Before that movie came out in the early 1980s, many had no idea what autism was.
At that time, statistics put the rate of autism at 1 in every 8,000 children. By the mid-1990s, it was around 1 in 1000 children, but by the mid-2000s, it had risen to 1 in 250. The epidemic has continued and in 2017, the US National Center for Health Statistics just released the latest rate: 1 in every 36 children now have autism (link to report here). These skyrocketing rates clearly prove there is a true epidemic of autism in the United States.
So what is autism? Autism is brain damage caused by brain inflammation, which can be triggered by the heavy metals used as adjuvants (aka ingredients) in vaccines. Just as thousands of parents saw firsthand with their own children. Read some of these stories here.
Doctors usually try to deny any responsibility and connection to the vaccines they gave by saying “Autism is genetic.” But autism is even listed as a possible reaction (or side effect) of vaccines on some of the vaccine inserts. Unfortunately, doctors rarely see these inserts, favoring the pharmaceutical marketing sheets over real science.
So let’s get to that real science — the type that is NOT funded by the pharmaceutical industry that wants to sell vaccines and then the prescription drugs that these children are on to control the symptoms of autism, an issue possibly caused by the vaccines.
There are many studies linking vaccines to the onset of autism as well as many studies linking the popular vaccine ingredient, aluminum, to neurological regression (both autism and Alzheimer’s). Our favourite studies and news reports are below.
GROUNDBREAKING study: elevated aluminium levels found in those with autism
World-famous Cleveland Clinic doctor Mark Hyman has seen firsthand how autism can be treated through detoxification.
TODAY MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE that Autism is a genetic brain disorder. I’m here to tell you that this isn’t true. The real reason we are seeing increasing rates of autism is simply this: Autism is a systemic body disorder that affects the brain. A toxic environment triggers certain genes in people susceptible to this condition. And research supports this position.” Written by Dr Mark Hyman, Medical Director of the Cleveland Clinic

Studies on Autism and Vaccines
1. A two-phase study evaluating the relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccine administration and the risk for an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in the United States. Translational Neurodegeneration, 2013
“The present study provides new epidemiological evidence supporting an association between increasing organic-Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and the subsequent risk of an ASD diagnosis.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/
2. Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism? Elsevier, 2011
“The application of the Hill’s criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal. Because children represent a fraction of the population most at risk for complications following exposure to Al, a more rigorous evaluation of Al adjuvant safety seems warranted.”
www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013411002212?via%3Dihub
3. What is regressive autism and why does it occur? Is it the consequence of multi-systemic dysfunction affecting the elimination of heavy metals and the ability to regulate neural temperature? North American Journal of Medical Sciences, 2009
“There is a compelling argument that the occurrence of regressive autism is attributable to genetic and chromosomal abnormalities, arising from the overuse of vaccines, which subsequently affects the stability and function of the autonomic nervous system and physiological systems.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364648/
4. Thimerosal Exposure and the Role of Sulfation Chemistry and Thiol Availability in Autism. International Journal of Environmental Health and Public Studies, 2013
“The emergence of ASD symptoms post-6 months of age temporally follows the administration of many childhood vaccines.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774468/
5. B-Lymphocytes from a Population of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Their Unaffected Siblings Exhibit Hypersensitivity to Thimerosal. Journal of Toxicology, 2013
“This suggests certain individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be highly susceptible to mitochondrial specific toxins like the vaccine preservative thimerosal.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697751/
6. Theoretical aspects of autism: Causes—A review. Journal of Immunotoxicology, 2011
“Documented causes of autism include genetic mutations and/or deletions, viral infections, and encephalitis following vaccination.”
www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/1547691X.2010.545086
7. Transcriptomic Analyses of Neurotoxic Effects in Mouse Brain After Intermittent Neonatal Administration of Thimerosal. Toxicological Sciences,2014
“Our results indicate that higher dose of neonatal thimerosal-mercury (20× higher than that used in human) is capable of inducing long-lasting substantial dysregulation of neurodevelopment, synaptic function, and endocrine system, which could be the causal involvements of autistic-like behavior.”
https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/139/2/452/2511500
7. Aluminum in brain tissue in autism. Science Direct, 2018
“Shockingly high levels of aluminum have been found in the brains of autistic people, and aluminum in vaccines is implicated as having a part in the mechanism that causes autism.”
www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763
8. A positive association found between autism prevalence and childhood vaccination uptake across the U.S. population. Journal of Toxicology and environmental health Part A, 2011
“The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of AUT or SLI. A 1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having AUT or SLI.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623535
9. Commentary–Controversies surrounding mercury in vaccines: autism denial as impediment to universal immunization. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, 2014
“He confirmed that the risk of autism among African American children vaccinated before the age of 2 years was 340% that of those vaccinated later.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033
10. Methodological issues and evidence of malfeasance in research purporting to show thimerosal in vaccines is safe. BioMed Research International, 2014
“In a study conducted directly by CDC epidemiologists, a 7.6-fold increased risk of autism from exposure to Thimerosal during infancy was found. The CDC’s current stance that Thimerosal is safe and that there is no relationship between Thimerosal and autism is based on six specific published epidemiological studies coauthored and sponsored by the CDC. The purpose of this review is to examine these six publications and analyze possible reasons why their published outcomes are so different from the results of investigations by multiple independent research groups over the past 75+ years.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277
11. Abnormal measles-mumps-rubella antibodies and CNS autoimmunity in children with autism. Journal of biomedical science, 2002
“Furthermore, over 90% of MMR antibody-positive autistic sera were also positive for MBP autoantibodies, suggesting a strong association between MMR and CNS autoimmunity in autism.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534
12. Hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and autism diagnosis, NHIS 1997-2002. Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, 2010

www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170
13. Similarities in features of autism and asthma and a possible link to acetaminophen use. Medical Hypothesis, 2010
“The role of acetaminophen (paracetamol) in an increased risk for asthma is described and a possible similar link to an increased risk for autism is suggested.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261751/
14. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) use, measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, and autistic disorder: the results of a parent survey. Autism, 2008
“Acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was significantly associated with autistic disorder when considering children 5 years of age or less.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18445737
15. A case series of children with apparent mercury toxic encephalopathies manifesting with clinical symptoms of regressive autistic disorders. Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, 2007
“There was a significant dose-response relationship between the severity of the regressive ASDs observed and the total mercury dose children received from Thimerosal-containing vaccines/Rho (D)-immune globulin preparations.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560
16. A comprehensive review of mercury provoked autism. Indian Journal of Medical Research, 2008
“Furthermore, a review of molecular mechanisms indicates that Hg exposure can induce death, disorganization and/or damage to selected neurons in the brain similar to that seen in recent ASD brain pathology studies, and this alteration may likely produce the symptoms by which ASDs are diagnosed.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106436
17. Theoretical aspects of autism: causes–a review. Journal of Immunotoxicology, 2011
“Documented causes of autism include genetic mutations and/or deletions, viral infections, and encephalitis following vaccination.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355
18. Autism: a novel form of mercury poisoning. Medical Hypothesis, 2001
“A review of medical literature and US government data suggests that: (i) many cases of idiopathic autism are induced by early mercury exposure from thimerosal; (ii) this type of autism represents an unrecognized mercurial syndrome; and (iii) genetic and non-genetic factors establish a predisposition whereby thimerosal’s adverse effects occur only in some children.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339848
19. A prospective study of thimerosal-containing Rho(D)-immune globulin administration as a risk factor for autistic disorders. The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine, 2007
“Children with ASD were significantly more likely to have Rh-negative mothers than controls. Each ASD patient’s mother was determined to have been administered a TCR during her pregnancy.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17674242
20. Hypothesis: conjugate vaccines may predispose children to autism spectrum disorders. Medical Hypothesis, 2011
“Conjugate vaccines fundamentally change the manner in which the immune systems of infants and young children function by deviating their immune responses.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993250
21. The potential importance of steroids in the treatment of autistic spectrum disorders and other disorders involving mercury toxicity. Medical Hypothesis, 2005
“In light of the fact that there are a number of other diseases that may have a chronic mercury toxicity component, such as Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, obesity, ALS, asthma, and other various forms of autoimmune disorders, it is imperative that further research should be conducted to understand mercury-testosterone toxicity.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780490
22. Reduced levels of mercury in first baby haircuts of autistic children. International Journal Of Toxicology, 2003
“Hair mercury levels among controls were significantly correlated with the number of the mothers’ amalgam fillings and their fish consumption as well as exposure to mercury through childhood vaccines, correlations that were absent in the autistic group.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933322
23. Cultured lymphocytes from autistic children and non-autistic siblings up-regulate heat shock protein RNA in response to thimerosal challenge. Neurotoxicology, 2006
“The differences [between autistic and non-autistic siblings] in expression profiles between those cells treated with zinc versus thimerosal were dramatic.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870260
24. A dose-response relationship between organic mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. International Journal Of Environmental Research and Public Health, 2014
“The cumulative total dose of Hg exposure from thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine (T-HBV) administered within the first six months of life was calculated. [Significant links were found with: specific developmental delay, tic disorder and hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood]. Cases were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg exposure.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198681
25. Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism? Journal of inorganic biochemistry, 2011
“Results show that children from countries with the highest ASD prevalence appear to have the highest exposure to Aluminium from vaccines.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159
26. Transcriptomic analyses of neurotoxic effects in mouse brain after intermittent neonatal administration of thimerosal. Toxicology Sciences: An official journal of the society of toxicology, 2014
“Results indicate that a higher dose of neonatal thimerosal-mercury is capable of inducing long-lasting substantial dysregulation of neurodevelopment, synaptic function, and endocrine system, which could be the causal involvements of autistic-like behavior in mice.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675092
27. Neurological adverse events associated with vaccination. Current Opinion in Neurology, 2012
“The present review summarizes data on neurologic complications following vaccination and provides evidence that indicates whether they were directly associated with the vaccines. These complications include autism (measles vaccine), multiple sclerosis (hepatitis B vaccine), meningoencephalitis (Japanese encephalitis vaccine), Guillain-Barré syndrome and giant cell arteritis (influenza vaccine), and reactions after exposure to the animal rabies vaccine. Seizures and hypotonic/hyporesponsive episodes following pertussis vaccination and potential risks associated with varicella vaccination, as well as vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis following oral poliovirus vaccination, are also described.”
28. A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1. Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, 2008
“Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excess can result in the arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043938
29. Impact of environmental factors on the prevalence of autistic disorder after 1979. Journal of Public Health and Epidemiology
“Thus, rising autistic disorder prevalence is directly related to vaccines manufactured utilizing human fetal cells. Increased paternal age and DSM revisions were not related to rising autistic disorder prevalence”
