Light It Up Blue isn’t autism awareness: it’s Autism Speaks advertisement
2 Apr
What do these autism organizations have in common:
Autism Science Foundation
Autistic Self Advocacy Network
Autism Society of America
National Autistic Society
Autistica
The Marcus Autism Center
The Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism
I could list many more.
Besides being autism organizations, they all have this in common: no mention of “Light It Up Blue” on their webpages today.
Today is Autism Acceptance Day (aka Autism Awareness Day). Autism Speaks has been pushing this day with their “Light It Up Blue” campaign. Autism Speaks describes Light It Up Blue as
Each April 2nd, Autism Speaks celebrates the start of its signature campaign, Light It Up Blue, along with the international autism community in recognition of UN sanctioned World Autism Awareness Day and April, World Autism Month.
They are clear–it’s not an autism event, it’s an Autism Speaks event. Apparently “along with the international autism community”. Which doesn’t appear to be joining in.
Blue, by the way, is not the color of autism (it doesn’t really have one). Blue is the color of Autism Speaks.

Autism Speaks updates their mission statement. “Cure” is now gone
12 Oct
Stephen Shore alerted people on Facebook recently that change was coming to Autism Speaks. Stephen has now shown us that the mission statement has changed.
Here is the mission statement on the Autism Speaks website as it was in July:
At Autism Speaks, our goal is to change the future for all who struggle with an autism spectrum disorder.
We are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments and a possible cure for autism. We strive to raise public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families, and society: and we work to bring hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder. We are committed to raising the funds necessary to support these goals.
Autism Speaks aims to bring the autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis. It is our firm belief that, working together, we will find the missing pieces of the puzzle.
Click the links to learn more about our leadership, our board of directors, our scientific boards and our family services committee.
Here is how it reads today:
Autism Speaks is dedicated to promoting solutions, across the spectrum and throughout the lifespan, for the needs of individuals with autism and their families through advocacy and support; increasing understanding and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder; and advancing research into causes and better interventions for autism spectrum disorder and related conditions.
Autism Speaks enhances lives today and is accelerating a spectrum of solutions for tomorrow.
As Stephen Mark Shore wrote on his Facebook page about the change: “Cure” has been replaced with advocacy, support, and acceptance through the lifespan.

Autism Speaks founder Bob Wright’s opinion is more important than science
24 Sep
Last year the Chief Science Officer of Autism Speaks made a simple and clear statement
“Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.”
It was nice to finally see someone from Autism Speaks make a clear statement without a lot of equivocation and “leave the door open” language.
But what I think is nice and what Bob Wright, the founder of Autism Speaks, thinks is nice are two different things. The Wright family is, at least, sympathetic to the idea that vaccines cause autism (and, in at least one case, very outspoken on the idea.) So perhaps I should have been surprised when Autism Speaks put on their website Rob Ring’s statement together with a statement by Bob Wright.
Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.
Rob Ring
Chief Science Officer, Autism Speaks
Over the last two decades extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccines and autism. Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines. Vaccines are very important. Parents must make the decision whether to vaccinate their children. Efforts must be continually made to educate parents about vaccine safety. If parents decide not to vaccinate they must be aware of the consequences in their community and their local schools.
Bob Wright
Co-founder, Autism Speaks
Because why should we let the Chief Science Officer have the actual word on what Autism Speaks thinks about an issue of science? Why let a clear statement stand alone when one can leave the door open with “Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines.”
And that was sad. A sad move by Autism Speaks. A sad move by Bob Wright.
But I’ve already written about that. Why bring it up again now? Well, because a reader here alerted me to the fact that Bob Wright and Autism Speaks have expunged the statement by their science officer. If one now goes to https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/policy-statements/information-about-vaccines-and-autism, one finds only Bob Wright’s statement:
I so want Autism Speaks to be an organization I could support. And sometimes they seem to be moving in that direction. But, in the end, they are still clinging to ideas like “vaccines cause autism”, ideas that cause a lot of harm within the autism communities. And they also take a very stigmatizing approach to the discussion of autism, but that is another discussion.
Autism Speaks pretends to be a science driven organization, but they just aren’t. The founder is the founder and his opinion means more than the results of scientific studies as expressed by their own Chief Science Officer.

“light it up blue” isn’t autism awareness, it’s advertising for Autism Speaks
2 Apr
Tomorrow is Autism Awareness Day, by some calendars at least. The United Nations, for example made a resolution in 2007 to designate April 2nd as “World Autism Awareness Day”.
Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 2007 [on the report of the Third Committee (A/62/435)] 62/139.
World Autism Awareness Day The General Assembly,
Recalling the 2005 World Summit Outcome and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, as well as the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields,
Recalling also the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, according to which children with disabilities should enjoy a full and decent life, in conditions which ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate the child’s active participation in the community, as well as the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children,
Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Aware that autism is a lifelong developmental disability that manifests itself during the first three years of life and results from a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, mostly affecting children in many countries irrespective of gender, race or socio-economic status, and characterized by impairments in social interaction, problems with verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests and activities,
Deeply concerned by the prevalence and high rate of autism in children in all regions of the world and the consequent development challenges to long-term health care, education, training and intervention programmes undertaken by Governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, as well as its tremendous impact on children, their families, communities and societies,
Recalling that early diagnosis and appropriate research and interventions are vital to the growth and development of the individual,
1. Decides to designate 2 April as World Autism Awareness Day, to be observed every year beginning in 2008;
2. Invites all Member States, relevant organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations, as well as civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to observe World Autism Awareness Day in an appropriate manner, in order to raise public awareness of autism;
3. Encourages Member States to take measures to raise awareness throughout society, including at the family level, regarding children with autism;
4. Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and United Nations organizations.
76th plenary meeting 18 December 2007
While I’m sure that Autism Speaks lobbying had much to do with that resolution, it’s an awareness event. No where do you see any mention of Autism Speaks nor statements that we should “light it up blue”. Yet over the years, Autism Speaks has made autism awareness into autism speaks awareness. And no where is that more obvious than on April 2nd with their “light it up blue” event.
Is blue the color of autism? No. It’s the color of Autism Speaks. But Autism Speaks is out there asking people to shine blue lights for autism awareness. A whole section of their shop (yes, they have an online shop) is devoted to “light it up blue” merchandise. All complete with the Autism Speaks logo.
Here’s the text from the Autism Speaks web page on how to “light it up blue”. Each section brings you back to Autism Speaks. Shine a blue light..and project the Autism Speaks logo. Wear blue, including autism speaks pins or accessories. Blue=Autism speaks, basically.
How to LIUB
In honor of people with autism worldwide, iconic landmarks, hotels, sporting venues, concert halls, museums, schools, universities, bridges, retail stores, and thousands of homes will light blue beginning on April 2!
Light Homes, Businesses, Schools, and Landmarks Blue
Change outdoor or indoor white bulbs to blue bulbs.
Tint windows with blue gel sheets
Cover existing fixtures with blue gel filters
Project the Autism Speaks puzzle piece or Light It Up Blue logo on walls or buildings
Wear Blue
Ask family, friends, coworkers, and staff to wear blue (ties, scarfs, shirts, etc.)
Supply Autism Speaks lapel pins, bracelets, or other blue accessories to wear during the month of April.
Post Blue
Personalize your LIUB Selfie Sign to tell us where you Light It Up Blue
Post your photos on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, or Flickr with the hashtag #LIUB to be a part of the global autism awareness movement!
Turn your website blue with our Site It Up Blue kit or add the Light It Up Blue logo with a link to autismspeaks.org/liub
Turn your Facebook or Twitter profile picture blue
Tweet autism facts with the hashtag #LIUB
Raise Awareness with Blue
Distribute information about autism, World Autism Awareness Day, and Light It Up Blue in your establishment, neighborhood, or company.
Invite a local Autism Speaks representative to speak to your staff, school, or town about autism and the Light It Up Blue campaign.
Reach out to local media to let the community know about your great work for the autism community and your support of autism speaks!

Hey, you can take a “light it up blue” selfie. Complete with Autism Speaks logo.
Autism Speaks is corporate autism. They do some things I appreciate and many things I really, really (really) don’t. For example, perpetuating the vaccines-cause-autism idea, an idea which may be second only to the refrigerator mother idea in causing harm to our community. Just in the past couple weeks Autism Speaks had to put out a new message on the idea, because the science based and helpful message by their Chief Science Officer conflicted with the non-science educated founder’s beliefs. Autism Speaks doesn’t have autistic voices in important positions within the organization, an amazing position given the sizable self-advocate population they claim to serve. Autism Speaks has a history of perpetuating stigmatizing messages (search for “I am autism” if you are unaware of this). Autism Speaks has funded quality research over the years and I appreciate that. But every time I start thinking Autism Speaks is starting down a good path they do something that reminds me: they are not my family’s autism organization. They don’t represent my values. They don’t represent my family.
I won’t be “lighting it up blue” tomorrow. I won’t be encouraging people to “light it up blue”. I hope people will be more aware of the needs of people like my kid. I hope more that they will act. I will follow up with another post, but I’ll say it here now: remember the phrase “think globally, act locally”? Feel like donating to an autism charity? I bet you have an autism school in your area and autism schools need donations. I bet there are adult programs in your area that could use some support. That’s my suggestion for April 2nd.

Autism Speaks: The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism…but doesn’t let that statement stand alone.
26 Mar
Autism Speaks has come out with some very strong statements about autism and vaccines. And the back peddled.
First, here is a statement by Robert Ring, Chief Science Officer:
Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.
Rob Ring
Chief Science Officer, Autism Speaks
In the past Autism Speaks had been sympathetic towards the idea that vaccines cause autism. More than sympathetic, some would say. Such a clear statement as above would have been unthinkable from Autism Speaks only a few years ago.
I wish they had made these statements earlier, but I am glad they are making these statements now. The vaccine hypothesis has been the most damaging idea in autism since the refrigerator mother theory. With Autism Speaks position as a well known autism organization, perhaps even fewer families will get caught in the vaccines-cause-autism trap in the future.Here’s the way the Autism Speaks vaccines and autism page looked just last year. It includes many problematic statements and concludes: “A list of publications that used VAERS information to study associations with autism can be found here“. “Here” is a link to pubmed with the search terms “vaers” and “autism”. No surprise, it’s a list that is padded out by works by Mark and David Geier. The Geiers have been performing poor research for years and have been discussed here at Left Brain/Right Brain many times.
The above statement by Mr. Ring was picked up by the press in February as it was so clear.
Next, Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks:
Over the last two decades extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccines and autism. Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines. Vaccines are very important. Parents must make the decision whether to vaccinate their children. Efforts must be continually made to educate parents about vaccine safety. If parents decide not to vaccinate they must be aware of the consequences in their community and their local schools.
Bob Wright
Co-founder, Autism Speaks
It’s a fairly stilted paragraph in my read. It comes across as though Mr. Wright is trying to appear to ride the fence while at the same time pulling back dramatically from the clear statement by Mr. Ring. Scientific research has not directly connected autism to vaccines?
Even with that, I can’t imagine that admitting that vaccines are “important” will go over well in some circles. Close circles. Even “important” is to positive a word for some. But, seriously, here we have an invention that has saved more lives that possibly any other in medical history and we get “important”?
Yes, Mr. Wright, efforts must be made to educate parents about vaccine safety. That’s what your chief science officer did. Sadly, you can’t let Autism Speaks be a science led organization.

Is Autism Speaks supporting vaccine-autism causation proponent Congressman Bill Posey?
19 Aug
Someone forwarded an email from the “Autism Action Network” recently. The email asked people to support Congressman Bill Posey’s election campaign by attending a fundraiser. Looks like a few big donors to Mr. Posey were going to attend, including Sallie Bernard of SafeMinds and Autism Speaks. Ms. Bernard certainly is with both organizations, but I wonder if she was attending as an Autism Speaks officer or if Autism Speaks was even aware that their name was being used to promote the fundraiser.
Perhaps Ms. Bernard wasn’t aware that her Autism Speaks affiliation was being used this way. I’ve seen some of my affiliations used where I didn’t expect nor want them. Perhaps Ms. Bernard was aware that the AS affiliation was being used in this advertisement, but Autism Speaks wasn’t. Perhaps Autism Speaks was aware and supported this effort. I’m not betting heavily on that last option though.
Here’s the list of donors for the fundraiser in the email I got:
Jennifer Larson of the Canary Party and Health Freedom
Sallie Bernard of Safeminds and Autism Speaks
JB Handley of Generation Rescue
Tony Lyons of Shy[sic] Horse Publishing
Barry Segal of Focus Autism
Mark Blaxill of the Canary Party and Health Freedom
Dr. Gary Kompothecras
Teri Costigan
The Autism Speaks name adds a legitimacy to this fundraiser that the other groups just can’t. The Canary Party and Health Freedom (which I assume to be Americans for Health Choice) are basically the same people with “Canary Party” as a political party and “heath freedom” as a charity. The Canary Party/Health Freedom team is led by the same people who funded large donations to Oversight & Government Reform Committee Chair Daryl Issa ($40k plus). JB Handley is not as vocal as he once was, but he founded Generation Rescue on the notion that “autism is just a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning“. Sky Horse publishing is boutique publisher of many of the books on vaccines and autism, including “Age of Autism” and books by Andrew Wakefield. Barry Segal (Focus Autism) has been a large supporter of groups like Generation Rescue, the Age of Autism, SafeMinds and is very vocal on his belief that vaccines cause not only autism, but many other health problems as well. Gary Kompothecras has been funding Mr. Posey for years and is an autism parent and benefactor of groups promoting the vaccine/autism idea.
Without Autism Speaks’ name added to this, this would be very clearly all about a small but wealthy group of people pushing the failed ideas of vaccines and autism. People with failed and damaging ideas have the right to lobby members of congress along with everyone else. I, for one, am glad that the vast majority of Congress has moved on from the vaccine/autism-epidemic idea. I look forward to the day when that majority reaches 100%.

HHS Announces Appointment of New Public Members to the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee
2 Jul
The U.S. Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) will have two new members when it meets next week. The press release is below. The new members are Wendy Chung from Simons Foundation and Robert Ring from Autism Speaks. The Simons Foundation is the largest non-governmental funder of autism research and previously had a member on the IACC (Dennis Choi). My understanding is that Mr. Choi took a position working with a foreign government and that conflict required him to resign the IACC. Geri Dawson is still on the IACC and started this session working for Autism Speaks. Ms. Dawson has since left Autism Speaks.
For Immediate Release
July 2, 2014
HHS Announces Appointment of New Public Members to the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee
The Department of Health and Human Services today announced the appointments of Wendy Chung, M.D., Ph.D., and Robert Ring, Ph.D., as public members of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), a federal advisory Committee composed of federal agency officials and appointed community stakeholders that provides coordination and a forum for public input on issues related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prior to her departure, former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius appointed Dr. Chung, Director of Clinical Research for the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), and Dr. Ring, Chief Science Officer of Autism Speaks, to join the IACC in order to provide additional perspectives and expertise to the Committee. Dr. Chung and Dr. Ring serve as leaders within the two organizations that are the largest private funders of autism research in the United States. Both organizations were previously represented on the Committee by individuals who were appointed in 2012, but who have since left or changed affiliation.
Dr. Insel, Chair of the IACC and Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, welcomed the expertise and dedication that Dr. Chung and Dr. Ring bring to the IACC. “Both Dr. Ring and Dr. Chung will be important additions to the Committee, given the depth of their scientific and clinical experience, and their dedication to improving the lives of people on the autism spectrum,” he said.
Dr. Chung, in addition to directing clinical research at SFARI, served as a member of SFARI’s scientific advisory board. Dr. Chung is also the Herbert Irving Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine and Director of Clinical Genetics at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where she is the principal investigator for the Simons Variation in Individuals Project (Simons VIP), funded by the Simons Foundation.
Dr. Ring, who has been the Chief Science Officer of Autism Speaks since 2013, also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Delivering Scientific Innovation for Autism (DELSIA), the venture philanthropy arm of Autism Speaks, and leads Autism Speaks’ collaboration with the Simons Foundation to launch the Autism BrainNet, a privately-funded multisite brain banking effort focused on supporting autism research. Dr. Ring previously served as Autism Speaks’ Vice President of Translational Research. He holds adjunct faculty appointments in the Departments of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Pharmacology and Physiology at Drexel University College of Medicine. Prior to his work at Autism Speaks, Dr. Ring served as Senior Director and Head of the Autism Research Unit at Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development and worked in the area of psychiatric drug discovery at Wyeth Research.
These two new members of the Committee will serve for the remaining months of IACC activity under the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2011, which will expire on September 30, 2014. If reauthorized, the IACC will be open for nominations of new potential public members in late 2014.
