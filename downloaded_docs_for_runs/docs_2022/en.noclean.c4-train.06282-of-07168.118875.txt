After Tooth Extraction
After a tooth extraction, it’s important for a blood clot to form to stop the bleeding and begin the healing process. Some bleeding is normal, sometimes up to 24 hours. Bite down on your gauze (we will give you extra gauze) for 45 minutes at a time, and then replace as needed. When the bleeding is minimal, take the gauze out. Chewing on it can start the bleeding again. The old trick of using a tea bag to control bleeding-still works! A moist tea bag can be placed directly at extraction site, biting firmly for 1 hour. However, heavy bleeding (that you can’t seem to control) should be reported to the office.
After the blood clot forms, it is important not to disturb or dislodge the clot as it aids healing. Do not rinse vigorously, suck on straws, smoke, drink alcohol or brush teeth next to the extraction site for 24 hours. These activities will dislodge or dissolve the clot and retard the healing process. Limit vigorous exercise for the next 24 hours as this will increase blood pressure and may cause more bleeding from the extraction site.
After the tooth is extracted you may feel some pain and experience some swelling. An ice pack or an unopened bag of frozen peas or corn applied to the area will keep swelling to a minimum. Take pain medications as prescribed. The swelling usually starts to subside after 72 hours.
Use the pain medication as directed. Call the office if the medication doesn’t seem to be working. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection are gone. Drink lots of fluid and eat nutritious soft food on the day of the extraction. You can eat normally as soon as you are comfortable.
It is important to resume your normal dental routine after 24 hours. This should include brushing and flossing your teeth at least once a day. This will speed healing and help keep your mouth fresh and clean.
Everyone is concerned about a dry socket, and they do occur, especially after difficult wisdom tooth surgery. If the blood clot is lost after the 2nd to 4th day, you may experience pain in the site and into the ear. It does not respond too well to pain medications. PLEASE call-we can help a lot.
After a few days you will feel fine and can resume your normal activities. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain, continued swelling for 2-3 days, or a reaction to the medication, call our office immediately at Panama City Office Phone Number 850-769-3253.
