6 Reasons You Must Get A Himalayan Salt Lamp Right Away

The Purity and Health Claims of Himalayan Salt
Himalayan Salt is one of the purest and precious items found on this planet. It becomes preserved for over 250 million years, in the foothills of Himalayan Mountain Ranges.
There are many reasons to get a Himalayan salt lamp as it is safe from pollution and contamination. It is usually hand excavated from those mines and sold in various shapes and as different products. It is getting more and more popular over time. It can improve your lifestyle not only as a unique decoration item that perfectly matches any decoration scheme; but also benefits your health in a countless manner. Himalayan crystal salt lamps are a remarkable addition to your home or office. They offer many positive benefits during the day and their sleep. They are a big piece of Himalayan salt with a light bulb.
Reasons to Get a Himalayan Salt Lamp
Wake up suffocating in the morning
Have sneezing
Have allergies, sinus or respiratory problems.
Work in environments that compromise your respiratory health, such as nail rooms or laboratories
Have trouble sleeping
Wake up tired and not refreshed.
Interrupted sleep
Have a headache with the lights of the night.
Himalayan salt lamps have many benefits and an absolute blessing that are beyond count. Here some of the significant and scientifically proven health claims of Himalayan Salt Lamps discussed briefly.
1. Himalayan Salt Neutralize Positive Ions
One of the reasons to get a Himalayan salt lamp is that it neutralizes the positive ions. Living in the present age is like being at war with the impacts of the destructed atmospheres filled with the positive ions all the time. All the electronic equipment and other instruments present in homes continuously release positive ions. These positive ions pose adverse effects on our health by disturbing the chemical balance of our brains.
Role of Himalayan Salt Lamps
Get Himalayan Salt Lamps because they solve the main and rising issue of positive ions contamination in no time. Just turn the lamp on, and it will release negative ions. Those negative ions will neutralize the smog of positive ions leaving the negative ions and makes the air fresh, pure and safe to breathe in. The neutralization of positive ions will ultimately save you from various diseases starting from sinus to cancer.
2. Cleanse, Purify and Deodorize the Air
The purification of the air is an essential part of your home to improve your quality of life. As the water and Oxygen are the sources of life, and you want to have fresh air also and breathe inside your home. A salt lamp from the Himalayas is particularly vital for those who live in places highly polluted by smog and air pollution.
Get Himalayan Salt Lamps because they have hygroscopic properties which mean that they absorb moisture and water vapours that contaminate and pollute the air from the surroundings by using the attractive moisture property of the salt lamp. Himalayan Salt Lamps trap the dust particle inside their salt rock by using the light present in the salt lamp. When it heats, the cleansed water vapours are released back into the atmosphere, and dust particles and other particulate matter that is present in the atmosphere become accumulated in the rock salt, and that makes the air clean, purify and deodorise.
3. Himalayan Salt Lamps Reduce Allergy Symptoms
If you have allergies or asthma, a salt lamp from the Himalayas can bring some release. Several studies demonstrated that Himalayan salt lamps or salt therapy could reduce asthma, allergies and help relieve the symptoms of Chronic Pulmonic Disease or lung disease.
Himalayan Salt Lamps not only absorb the dust particles along with the water vapours but they also trap many pollutants, particulate matter and allergens suspended in our surroundings that are the prime reason of allergy or asthma. It is quite difficult to remove these tiny microscopic particles from the air, but Himalayan salt lamps can do that job efficiently.
As the allergens are removed from the atmosphere by Himalayan salt lamps, people suffering from allergies and asthma feel better, and their symptoms are relieved. Studies conducted on Asthma, Sinus and some allergy patients revealed that when exposed to Himalayan Salt Lamps, they felt better and relaxed.
4. Improve Blood Flow
The circulation system is significant for the distribution of blood, oxygen and many essential nutrients in the whole body. If blood circulation is reduced in some parts of the body that can affect the movement of that part.
The reduction of the blood circulation is due to the presence of particulate matter in the air, that inhaled with the other gases into the blood, and they will make the blood clots in the arteries or veins. These blood clots reduce the blood flow.
Studies suggest that the negative ions emitted by Himalayan salt lamps relax our brains and helps it to maintain the normal chemical balance, which results in improved circulatory systems and contributes to avoiding vascular issues and blood clots.
5. Sharpen Mood With Himalayan Salt Lamps
Particular studies suggested that these Himalayan salt lamps boost the production of serotonin in the brain, a chemical that enhances the mood and hence, these lamps prove to be helpful for people suffering from anxiety, depression, SAD and other psychological disorders.
Having a cheerful pink light in the room makes you happy, calm and relaxed. If you feel bored and depressed, try a salt lamp. It looks beautiful in your house.
The thing is that these are beautiful. There are not two of the salt lamps having the same shape and colour. They come in amber, pink, red and even a rare white. It is nature that shows its art.
And its beauty reaches a whole new level when it lit. Having a hot and shiny salt from the Himalayas is an excellent addition to any room. You can also have tea light candles, complements or bright orbs that affect very similar to that of Hogwarts.
6. Salt Lamps Reduces Electromagnetic Radiations
In today's electronic world, we are barraged with radiation and having a Himalayan salt lamp on hand can protect you against the positive ions that are harmful to your health. Computers, TVs, microwaves, air conditioners, cell phones and other devices emit electromagnetic radiations or pollution. The nearer you are to the salt lamp, the more effective the results will be. Make a habit of turning off any electrical equipment you do not use and do not put it into sleep mode.
Himalayan salt lamps produce negative ions to eliminate the positive harmful effects of the devices mentioned above.
