Without Squat, You Don't Have Squat!
Samuel Mielcarski
February 8, 2019
I have said for a long-time: “Without squat, you don’t have squat!” What does this mean? It means that the deep squat position is not only healthy, it’s the difference between good and poor health-- for so many reasons! The ability to squat deeply (especially when voiding, such as when “going Number 2”), can help to prevent a myriad of health challenges, such as: hemorrhoids; incontinence (leaky bladder); colon issues (colorectal cancer, Chron’s, colitis, Inflammatory Bowel issues,diverticulosis); hiatal hernia; prostate issues; uterine issues; birth and pregnancy challenges and complications; pelvic organ prolapse; sexual dysfunction; hernias; and appendicitis to name some of them!
If you can squat, then keep squatting (especially on the toilet). Many health challenges listed above may be linked to the negative side-effects of using the modern-day toilet! Not kidding! If you can’t squat, then it would be wise to start getting yourself back in shape so you can (even if that means hiring a competent physical therapist, fitness trainer, or other qualified professional to help you). Squatting is a vital aspect of health and well-being! And… “No, squatting is not bad for your knees!” That is… if you do it correctly! If done correctly, it will actually strengthen your knees, as well as the rest of your body! It’s basically “use it, or lose it” for sure. Unfortunately, in America, many people have lost it (the ability to squat)! It’s interesting to note that in other places around the world, where squatting deeply is an everyday occurrence (even among older age groups), the same health challenges that Americans face (such as those listed above) are far less and/or non-existent! Hmmm…. so just something to think about!
Mastering the basic body-weight deep squat will suffice. You DO NOT have to do weighted squats to get the benefits of squatting deeply. In fact, many peoples’ form breaks down significantly when they start adding weight to this basic movement pattern. Remember, you don’t need to carry extra weight with you onto the toilet to maintain good health. However, you do need to be able to fully evacuate your colon (as well as maintain proper pelvic floor alignment and strength) for good health. Assuming the deep squatting position can help you achieve this!
*Note: If unable to deep squat on the toilet (which would mean standing on the toilet and squatting down vs. sitting on the seat), then using a foot stool to support your feet when sitting on the toilet (so that your knees are positioned above your hips) may help you get into a better voiding position. However, this is NOT a substitute for proper squatting; it’s a modification to provide an advantage over just sitting on the toilet!
