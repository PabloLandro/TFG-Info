Table Salt vs Pink Salt: Which is healthier for me?
Table Salt vs Pink Salt: Which is healthier for me?
Many of us have heard of Himalayan Pink Salt but many are unsure of the health benefits that it offers. In short: Himalayan Pink Salt can be considered as a superfood.
In a typical Singaporean household, 90% of us use regular table salt while cooking or preparing dishes. However, table salt can cause some serious health problems. We explain further below.
Table Salt
Table Salt contains more sodium than other type of salts. Its chemical properties show that table salt is 99% sodium chloride (NaCl) and 1% anti-caking agents, which is used to increase its shelf life. Essentially, table salt lacks good minerals for the body.
Moreover, table salt are heavily refined and processed. Did you know that it contains aluminium, ferrocyanide, and bleach in it? All the chemicals added to keep salt from absorbing moisture for prolong shelf life is highly concentrated and is toxic to you.
Without offering any real benefits to your body, table salt should be avoided and eliminated from your diet. But what’s the healthier alternative? We did our research and found that Pink Salt is a favorable choice, which is why we added a small sachet of it into our Asian Quinoa Packs.
Why we switched to Pink Salt?
Natural Electrolytes
The chemical properties of pink salt is similar to table salt. It’s 98% Sodium Chloride but with 2% of minerals like magnesium, potassium, iodine. In fact, Pink Salt contains all 6 electrolytes which is required for health: sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus and calcium.
In the sweltering heat or after a workout, where you have lost electrolytes through perspiration, it’s good to replenish your body with a natural supply of electrolytes.
Migraine Relief
Migraines and terrible headaches are more common than you think. Research have shown that the primary cause of these head problems comes from a magnesium deficiency.
Because Pink Salt contains magnesium and is eaten regularly (a few times a day), it can help relax blood vessels and prevent the terrible headaches.
How to switch to Pink Salt?
With salt being the core of every type of cooking, it’s important to get a healthier alternative that offers real benefits and not pose a harmful effect to your body. And now you finally can have your own Himalayan Pink Salt to go with your quinoa. We sourced for a pollutant-free pink salt with no chemicals and 100% natural so you get the most nutrition possible! Best part? It’s affordable! Get yours here!
