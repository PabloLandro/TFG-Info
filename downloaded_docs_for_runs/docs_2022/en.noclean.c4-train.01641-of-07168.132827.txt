Benefits of Himalayan Salt Lamp
January 12, 2019 February 14, 2019
Having a form of Muscular Dystrophy a muscle wasting disorder your always on the look out for new things that will help the many different issues you face day-to-day like sleeping, breathing, relaxing. and as my friend Carrie only said to me this week ‘we need all the help we can get!’.
I’ll admit, I’d heard about Himalayan salt lamps as many rave about them and how they set the room up, It’s got a beautiful glow that surrounds it when it’s on it’s a pinky colour quite beautiful. I’ve just never really looked into the benefits the salt lamps has to offer until now, reason being I got one for Christmas.
About the salt lamp
Scientist have claimed a number of amazing benefits that salt can offer, which have been dated back centuries. Particularly the Himalayan salt it’s said to be the purest salt on earth. It’s untouched by pollutants and toxins, found at the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains formed 250 million years ago. Himalayan salt is far superior to traditional iodized salt and contains the same 84 natural elements and minerals found in the human body. who knew!!
Himalayan salt has a unique structure that allows it to store energy. This salt is beneficial to our health,
One way I can explain is have you ever stood at the foot of the Ocean with the cool sea breeze hitting your face and body and never felt more relaxed and alive at that moment that’s because of the negative ions that’s are released feeding your body.
It’s said that a Polish physician in the 1800 hundreds discovered breathing pure iodized air in the salt mines was beneficial in soothing inflammation and curing respiratory conditions. People soon sought out ‘salt caves’ in Eastern Europe to help cure their ailments. In our current times our lungs are continually under stress from both indoor and outdoor pollution. A current, popular physician Dr. Mehmet Oz recommended Himalayan Salt Therapy as a way to help relieve asthma, congestion, colds, allergies and hay fever.
While most of us cannot always be near the serenity of the ocean to give us what we need, we can though bring a part of it into our homes even the office.
‘Salt lamps when on and starts to heat up release negative ions into the air which cleanse and purify the air in what ever room it in, also creating some of the benefits of being in a “salt cave”.
These salt lamps also help to protect you against the constant EMF (electromagnetic fields) we are surrounded by in our modern everyday lives like; TV’s, laptops/ computers and wireless devices. The Himalayan Salt resonate a frequency almost identical to our bodies, helping to counter the excessive EMFs organically. The lamps not only help with our health but are beautiful and serene to look at.
Here’s 11 benefits the Himalayan salt Lamp offers.
Purifies the air
Eases allergy and asthma symptoms

Helps you sleep better
Reduces electromagnetic radiation.
Promotes blood sugar health and helps to reduce the signs of aging

I have myself felt the benefits of having the salt lamp in my home it’s definitely had a great effect on my everyday life from my moods to my energy levels that I’m going to get one for my bedroom as well.
