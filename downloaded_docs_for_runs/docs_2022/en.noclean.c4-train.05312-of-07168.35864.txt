Home » Oil Pulling For Oral Health
Oil pulling for oral health is a topic that is very hot right now. I get asked about the effectiveness of oil pulling for oral health and whether or not it works. I will share with you my experience with oil pulling and also explain to you the research supporting this new crunchy craze.
My Personal Oil Pulling Experience
I personally have oil pulled on and off for many years. I stumbled across this concept while reading Weston Price’s work on dental hygiene. Though the average dentist leads you to assume that declining dental health comes with aging, Weston Price found this to be quite the opposite. Good oral health is possible with age, but we will need the right strategy.
I personally healed three cavities with oil pulling. I was oil pulling consistently for a year after a dentist told me I needed to get my cavities filled. Upon my next checkup, three of my cavities were gone. Literally gone! But besides that, I have always done it for good oral health and that I have.
I go to a very good dentist who practices holistic dentistry. He is a fanatic for having the latest and greatest holistic dental practices, and I trust him. I’ve referred several of my patients to him for proper amalgam extraction (getting rid of those nasty mercury fillings). He has mentioned to me that I have such amazing teeth for my age, and when he asked me my secret, I said oil pulling. Long story short I’m a huge fan.
What is Oil Pulling?
Oil pulling originated in Ayurvedic medicine. It was used then and still used today in order to remove cavity-causing bacteria and toxins from the mouth. It is considered a good daily detoxifier for your mouth. Oil pulling is done by simply swishing 1-2 teaspoons of coconut oil in your mouth for 10-20 minutes.
Here are some of the touted benefits of oil pulling:
• Reduces inflammation
• Prevents cavities
• Heals cracked lips
• Improves acne
• Kills bad breath
• Boosts Immune System
• Whitens teeth
• Soothes throat dryness
• Heals bleeding gums
• Cures tooth decay
• Prevents heart disease
• Strengthens gums and jaw
Here is some of the research on oil pulling:
Though there is not extensive research on this topic and mostly just testimonials from the many people who have reaped the benefits of this health practice, here are a few journal articles we can hang our hats on.
The Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics & Preventive Dentistry found a reduction in S. Mutans in the mouth. This is important because this is the same bacteria that causes cavities. They concluded oil pulling is effective and useful.
The Journal of Oral Health & Community Dentistry found oil pulling to be useful as well. They stated: “there was statistically significant reduction of the pre- and post-values of the plaque and modified gingival index scores in both the study and control groups.”
The Asia Journal of Public Health said that oil pulling was a viable way to improve oral hygiene and dental health in developing countries due to the coconut oils anti-microbial properties.
So there is research to support its effectiveness. Now we just need to get you started.
How to Start Oil Pulling for Oral Health
1)Brush your teeth. I prefer to brush my teeth prior to oil pulling. Some do it after oil pulling as well. I prefer before.
1) Put 1-2 teaspoons of coconut oil in your mouth. The extra virgin oil is less coco-nutty if that bothers you. I used to use regular extra virgin coconut oil. I now use Skinny Oil Pulling Oil because it has peppermint in it. I like the flavor better and I think its more effective with peppermint.
2) Swish for 10-20 minutes. I usually stick to 20 minutes. I sometimes do less, sometimes more. Don’t get too hung up on the time. Swish for 10 minutes at the very least.
3) Spit the oil out. Many say you will plug your drain if you spit the oil down the sink. I personally turn the hot water on and spit it down the drain. Never had an issue, but giving you fair warning.
4) Rinse your mouth out. Get all the oil out. It is carrying bacteria and toxins at this point, so you want to make sure it’s gone for good.
Final Comments: Oil puling can be done by anyone and is not known to be harmful in any way. There are no reported dental issues that would be a contraindication to oil pulling, but certainly ask your doctor if you have any concern. You have nothing to lose by oil pulling so why not give it a shot. Ask questions below and share you results!
