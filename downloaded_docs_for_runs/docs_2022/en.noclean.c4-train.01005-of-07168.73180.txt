Morphine Addiction Can Lead to…
Morphine addiction is a problem that affects thousands of people around the world. The consequences are devastating and rising. The use of this opiate is also linked to heroin abuse. Learn more about the misuse of morphine and why users may abuse heroin.
What Is Morphine Addiction?
Morphine is the main chemical element in opium. This is why it’s considered the gold standard among pain relievers. For this reason, health care professionals use this analgesic drug to treat severe pain. The drug can also create the feeling of euphoria and reduce tension.
Like other prescription opiates, morphine can lead to addiction fast, even when doctors use it for medical reasons. This means that the body starts to tolerate the drug, so users have to take more of it to feel the same result.
With repeat use, morphine can develop patterns in the brain that compel users to seek it out. Morphine abuse can have dangerous and fatal consequences. Combining it with alcohol or other drugs increases these consequences.
The Link Between Morphine Addiction and Heroin Abuse
Morphine abuse can lead to heroin abuse because the illegal drug is processed from morphine. Due to this, heroin also creates the feeling of euphoria and makes users relax.
Heroin abuse is a complex problem in many parts of the United States. This is partly because it’s cheaper than morphine. Sometimes heroin is easier to find and buy since morphine and other opiates such as OxyContin and Vicodin require a prescription.
The Risks of Morphine Addiction and Heroin Abuse
Morphine attaches to receptors in the brain and other parts of the body. Its ability to change how the body feels pain is why it’s so effective, as well as dangerous and addictive. With repeat use, morphine hinders the ability of the body to make its own opioid chemicals. This is why stopping the use of morphine causes so much discomfort for those addicted.
Some people even crush morphine pills and inject or snort the powder to make the effects more intense. However, this also increases the risk for serious medical issues.
Heroin abuse is dangerous because the risk of overdose is high. This danger is so high because there’s no control over how pure the substance is. Contamination with other drugs is possible, and sometimes these drugs are potent opiates that people already abuse. Injecting the drug also increases the risk of hepatitis and HIV as well as injection site infections.
Signs of Morphine Addiction
The misuse of morphine can cause many side effects. Constipation is a common one because the analgesic slows the normal movement of the digestive tract. Depressed respiratory function is a serious side effect that can cause asphyxia or death. Other signs of morphine addiction are:
blue nails and lips
coma
confusion
dizziness
extreme drowsiness
itchy skin
loss of consciousness
low blood pressure
nausea and vomiting
poor circulation
Constricted pupils
weak pulse.
