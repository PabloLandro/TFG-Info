Is Wi-Fi Safe for Children?Beware of Health Risks: Children are Particularly Susceptible to the Harm of Wi-Fi
Is Wi-Fi Safe for Children?
Beware of Health Risks
Doctors and Scientists around the world have warned against unnecessary exposure of children to RF/microwave from wireless technology and recommend safer WIRED internet connection instead, both in school and at home. We are parents who fully support the use of computers and the incorporation of technology in education, and we believe that it must be implemented in a SAFE manner.

-Dr. Gerd Oberfeld, Scientist for Public Health Department of Salzburg, Austria - who led the country's ban of Wi-Fi in schools - and Professor Olle Johansson of Nobel Prize-winning Karolinska Institute in Sweden explained that the biological effects of Wi-Fi include DNA break, DNA damage, chromosome damage, impact on concentration capacity, decrease in short-term memory, increase in cancers, and "yet we don't feel it. We don't get a warning signal."
Dr. Ian Gibson, Biologist and cancer specialist for 40 years, UK, "there's enough (evidence) now to be worried about".
