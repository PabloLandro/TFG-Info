What you didn’t know about Vitamin C
Friday, 11 April 2014
Author - Good Health
Vitamin C is the most popular single vitamin on the world market. A lot of people will load up the minute they're feeling slightly under the weather. Aside from being great to prevent colds and flus, there are plenty of other benefits. We asked our naturopaths to name a few… We wouldn’t have guessed #6!
1. It gives you youthful skin.
That’s right, move aside botox. Vitamin C is an important factor in collagen production. It’s also a strong antioxidant which helps to prevent premature aging. The combination of these two ingredients makes it an excellent supplement to take for healthy looking skin.
2. It’ll make you stress less.
Vitamin C is one of the main nutrients that your adrenal glands (stress glands) need to function properly. When you’re under stress your body uses up much more vitamin C than usual. Humans (unlike most animals) can’t make their own vitamin C so we need to obtain it from our diet or through supplementation.
3. It helps your wounds to heal quicker.
From cuts and broken bones to burns and recovery from surgical wounds, vitamin C taken orally helps wounds to heal faster and better. It helps to heal connective tissue but also has anti-inflammatory properties.
4. It reduces suffering for asthmatics.
Asthmatics tend to have higher needs for vitamin C because of the antioxidant function it plays in the lungs and airways. Doses of 1,000 to 2,000 mg per day reduce asthmatic symptoms and lessen the body's production of histamine, which contributes to inflammation. Most asthmatics are also lacking in magnesium too.
5. It’s beneficial for people with diabetes.
People with diabetes can benefit from extra vitamin C, too. This nutrient can help regulate your blood sugar levels. Since insulin helps vitamin C, as well as glucose, get into cells, people with diabetes may not have enough vitamin C inside many of their cells. Just like glucose, vitamin C can't do its work if it's not inside a cell. Supplementing vitamin C can force it into body cells, where it can protect against the many complications of diabetes.
6. Protection from toxins and aids smokers.
Did you know that every cigarette you smoke uses up about 1000mg of vitamin C from your body? Vitamin C aids detoxification and/or neutralisation of many harmful agents. It helps to keep certain heavy metals (like lead, cadmium and arsenic) in solution, thus allowing them to be more easily eliminated in urine. This is one of the reasons why smokers use up vitamin C so quickly.
7. It helps to prevent heart disease.
As with many other antioxidants, vitamin C helps to prevent heart disease by preventing free radicals from damaging artery walls, which could lead to plaque formation (atherosclerosis). This nutrient also keeps cholesterol in the bloodstream from oxidizing, which is another early step in the progression towards heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure may also improve in the presence of this wonder vitamin. All these factors combined make vitamin C an inexpensive and easy way to lower one's risk of heart disease and strokes.
8. It reduces your suffering from allergies.
Vitamin C is a natural anti-histamine (histamine is an inflammatory chemical the body releases when exposed to an allergen) therefore can be useful in the prevention and treatment of hayfever and hives.
9. It helps to prevent cataracts.
Cataracts are when the eyes start to cloud over and can lead to blindness. The lens in your eye needs a lot of vitamin C to counteract all the free radicals that form as a result of sunlight on the eye. Vitamin C is concentrated in the lens. When there's plenty of vitamin C floating through your system your eye is more protected from damage. It's possible that 1,000 mg per day of vitamin C might stop cataracts in their tracks and possibly improve vision.
10. It supports your immune system.
This probably isn’t news to many, but winter is looming. Vitamin C reduces the severity and duration of viruses such as the common cold but it’s ideally used as a preventative rather than a cure. Vitamin C works by inhibiting the virus replication in the body.
It’s clear that Vitamin C has a multitude of benefits across a broad range of conditions. Even pregnant women and children can take vitamin C. Why wait – get dosed up before winter hits. The problem with a lot of vitamin C is that they are not absorbed well and are not retained in the body for long. They are also acidic, making them hard on the stomach and teeth. Good Health Opti-C is an advanced, highly absorbable, stomach friendly Vitamin C that provides potent 24 hour immune support plus antioxidant protection. It’s made using a special water-based process that makes the Vitamin C molecules more active resulting in increased absorption and it stays active in your body for longer.
Opti-C 1000mg is available in 50 and 100 tablet pack sizes.
Opti-C 500mg delicious chewable with Echinacea and Acai is available 60 and 120 tablet pack sizes.
