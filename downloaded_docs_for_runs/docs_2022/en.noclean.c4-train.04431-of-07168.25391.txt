We were doing our usual morning crawl through the web when stumbled onto 40 Uses for WD-40. We’ve always known it for making rusty joints squeaky again but apparently WD-40 is no one-trick pony. The lubricant actually has over 2000 uses, these are only 40 of them.
Uses in bold are ones that we thought were either interesting, pure bullshit or outright creepy. Click here to visit their website and discover (or submit) your own uses!
