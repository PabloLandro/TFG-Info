10 Winter essentials to prevent & protect your children’s health
It is vital for us as parents to prevent and protect our children’s health in the Winter months.
Winter can be harsh and full of lurking germs, and our children’s immune systems may not be ready to protect them.
Somehow, they don’t always receive the enough of the right nutrients or healthy foods during these months.
So, to make sure they stay healthy and full of energy this Winter, try to include these essential preventative and protecting nutrients and foods to their diets.
FOR PREVENTION
Vitamin C
Although this vitamin (if we rely on a food source) cannot prevent those nasty colds and flu’s, it is known to reduce the length of – and severity of the symptoms. However, if we take a food based Vitamin C supplement with all the components of the C family such as bioflavonoids, we can prevent the colds and flu that seem to plague us at this time of the year.
We encourage families to be proactive and start supplementing to PREVENT illness. For example, a sustained release Vitamin C that releases gradually for 8 hours into the body will be very beneficial to prevent colds. If you do catch a cold or get the flu, then you really should have larger doses of Vitamin C released into your body via a fast release Vitamin C – which would be more beneficial and result in a very short illness period.
A food based Vitamin C with all the components of the C family protects the body and is a wonderful antioxidant too.
If you are looking for a good supplement – we have in stock here.
Sources – An adequate range of fresh fruits and veggies – citrus fruits, strawberries, green leafy veggies, etc. As it is Winter, not all fruits and veggies are available, so supplementation is recommended to make up for this.
Vitamin D
You can consider this vitamin to be an essential supplement to give your child during Winter. Research has indicated that children with higher Vitamin D levels, who do get sick, tend to have milder symptoms and may recover faster.
Sources – through direct sunlight, but with fewer sunny days, you may want to supplement or make sure that there an adequate amount in the supplements they are taking.
FOR PROTECTION
Probiotics
The good bacteria (living microorganisms) which helps your child’s natural defenses fight bad bacteria and infection. It also keeps their digestive system functioning properly.
Sources – Good sources are some of your fermenting foods such as, sugar free plain yoghurt , Kefir, etc. Otherwise if your children are lactose intolerant, try supplementing.
Zinc
Zinc is essential for immune protection, growth and development as well as healing.
Sources – As Zinc is found in beans and meat, for a fussy eater try to supplement with a good sources such as VitaGuard – which is a complete anti-oxidant for children. Straight Talk’s Chelated Zinc supplement is also a good source of highly absorbed Zinc.
Selenium
Helps boost the immune system while Zinc protects it.
Sources – Excellent sources are Brazil nuts, seafood and organ foods – As most kids do not favour these types of foods, try to choose a good supplement that contains selenium.
FRUIT & VEGGIE IDEAS
Sweet potatoes
Are a good source of Vitamin A, potassium and fibre.
Food ideas – Substitute potato fries with sweet potato fries, bake them, mash them, puree them and add them into different foods.
Cauliflower
Prevents inflammation and is rich in Vitamin A, C and even K, some B. Assists in good digestion too.
The cruciferous compounds of Cauliflower protect the cells.
Food ideas – Roast them and sprinkle some cheese on top. Make cauliflower rice instead of normal rices.
Squashes
Squashes are rich sources of Vitamin A and carotenoids, assisting in the health of immunity and skin.
Food ideas – Add some butter or cinnamon to enhance the taste.
Supplement with a good supplement that contains carotenoids.
Salmon
Good for heart health and brain development – even during the Winter months. Salmon is a good source of Omega-3, iron and minerals.
Food ideas – cut into kebab and fry, or grill in the oven with honey.
Clementines
A citrus fruit rich in Vitamin C and fibre, and do contain potassium, magnesium and calcium – a fruit that is good for muscle functioning.
Food ideas – eat as is or add to a delicious salad.
Besides the above mentioned essentials, try to give your child balanced meals daily. Don’t forget to include:
Other milk and dairy products
Proteins – eggs, meat and chicken
Whole grains
Frozen berries
Add to smoothies and receive the amazing antioxidant power from the reds and purples of berries. Wonderful total health protection for the whole family.
Freshly squeezed citrus juices made at home
These are not acidic, and they have no preservatives in them.
Squeeze and drink – how delicious and healthy!
