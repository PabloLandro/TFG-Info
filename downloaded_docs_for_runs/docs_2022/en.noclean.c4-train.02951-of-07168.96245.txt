Eight Benefits To Have A Salt Lamp From The Himalayas

Benefits of Himalayan Salt Lamps
There are plenty of positive attributes that come from having the Himalayan salt lamps in your home, that are mystical devices. If you have never used a salt lamp from the Himalayas, you don't know what you missed. Himalayan salt lamps are like an open window and a natural source of fresh, clean air on your counter, in your living room, near the bed or wherever you choose to put it.
Before plunging into the benefits of using Himalayan salt lamps in your home, it may be helpful to have a brief chemistry lesson first:
Brief Chemistry of Matter
All matter (the human body, air, water, etc.) consists of molecules made of atoms composed of three types of particles:
Protons (Positive charge),
Electrons (negative charge)
Neutrons(no charge).
Electrons orbit their molecules as planets revolve around a star. From time to time an atom flies away, and when it does, it leaves behind a positively charged ion whose only purpose in life is to fill the void places by its lost little electron. In other words: it requires to take a replacement electron from another molecule. Due to differences in molecular structure, some materials lose electrons much more easily than others.
There are many benefits of salt lamps. The following top eight benefits of the Himalayan salt lamps are the following:
1. Himalayan Salt Lamps Clean And Freshen The Air
The first benefit of the Himalayan salt lamp is that it clean and refreshen the air. Probably it is the best- known advantage. The majority of people use them due to their incredible power of removing dust, pollen, cigarette smoke and other air contaminants.
Power of Hygroscopy of Salt Lamps
Himalayan salt lamps purify the air with the power of hygroscopy, which means they attract water molecules from the adjacent environment and then absorb these molecules and any foreign particles they contain. When the lamp heats up from the heat produced by the bulb inside, this same water then evaporates into the air and particles of dust, pollen and smoke remain locked in salt. In this way, Himalayan salt lamps help to breathe in the pleasant atmosphere. There are three ways to clean up the energies of your home that makes the air more clean and fresh.
2. Himalayan Salt Lamps Reduce Symptoms Of Allergy and Asthma
Another Himalayan salt lamp benefit is for the asthmatic patients who want to reduce the symptoms of asthma and allergy. Himalayan salt lamps remove microscopic particles of dust, dander, mould and other particles from the air that can irritate the respiratory tract of the allergic persons. Placing one or two lights of salt in the rooms where you spend the most time can reduce the symptoms of allergy. Even people with asthma should notice a big difference after a week or two.
Himalayan Salt Lamps and Seasonal Affective Disorder
Salt lamps also deal with Seasonal Affective Disorder. Decreasing sunlight in autumn and winter can cause a disorder in the winter. This decrease in sunlight can disrupt your body's internal clock, and reduce levels of serotonin (a brain chemical that affects mood), and create feelings of depression.
Himalayan pink salt lamps help to combat depression and anxiety as are producing negative ions that enhance mood and energy levels. The soft natural light of the salt lamp is close enough to the heat of the sun to relieve symptoms.
3. Himalayan Salt Lamps Relieve Coughing
The crystalline salt lamps are beneficial for reducing cough which is a respiratory problem. When the Lamps warms up and begins its hygroscopic cycle of airborne particles, it also alters the charge of the molecules that are released. The Himalayan salt lamp benefit is that it relieves a cough that appears to be good for health.
Positive Ions and Its Contribution to Respiratory Problems
Positively charged ions are present in most of the homes that are not particularly good for the health. Some of the things create positive ions, but the prime source for most of us comes from electronics.
One of the health disadvantages of breathing lots of positive ions in the air is that the eyelashes (microscopic hairs) that line the trachea become lethargic and do not work as well to keep contaminants out of our lungs.
Role of Himalayan Salt Lamps in Preventing Respiratory Problems
As a pink Himalayan salt lamp absorbs water and particles from the air, it also takes positive ions with them. Then, when the heated salt releases water vapours in the air, it also ejects negative ions, which affect positively on our airways - increasing ciliary activity to keep your lungs clear.
In addition to removing contaminants from the air, Himalayan pink salt lamps also help your body filter the air more efficiently, so foreign particles do not penetrate in the lungs. In this way, salt lamps prevent respiratory problems.
4. Himalayan Salt Lamps Raise Energy Levels
One of the essential benefits of Himalayan salt lamps is that it raises a person’s energy level. Walking in the countryside, spending time on the beach or camping in the mountains or just taking a shower in the morning is exciting. It is because these activities have detrimental concentrations of negative ions. The Himalayan salt lamps produced the same negative ions.
The truth is that positive ions consume our energy. Unfortunately, it is common for us to diagnose a problem as something completely different.
If you often feel tired and do not know why? Try placing the Himalayan salt lamp in the room or where you spend the maximum time. After about s few days, you will notice a difference.
5. Himalayan Salt Lamps Defuse The Electro-magnetic Radiations
Today, most of us live in the metaphorical ocean of electronic radiation (EM), which originates from our electronic devices such as television, computers, cell phones, tablets, appliances, stereos, etc.
Effect of Electromagnetic Radiations
Although the electromagnetic radiations may be invisible, the long-term impact of EM exposure can be very thoughtful. It is known that sustained interaction with EM radiation increases the level of stress, causes chronic fatigue and reduces the body's immune response.
The benefit of Himalayan salt lamps is that it defuses electromagnetic radiation when they release negative ions into the air. Keep a pink salt lamp near to the computer, television, and other electronic devices, to reduce the potential danger to you and your family.
6. Sleep Better With Himalayan Salt Lamps
Another side effect of positive ions that are overexposed to air is that they prevent you from having a quality sleep. This is because these positively charged particles can effectively reduce blood and oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in an irregular sleep pattern. Himalayan pink salt lamps are natural negative ion generators, which solves this problem. The benefit of the salt lamp is that it helps to sleep better. Place one or two around the room to improve the air quality and have a good night's sleep.
When to Turn On-Off The Salt Lamp
If you have a problem that unless there is black, you can not sleep, you can turn off the lights of a salt lamp before sleeping. Keep it turned on, the rest of the day while you are awake.
People in humid climates should know that the HPS lamp buzzes when the salt becomes cold. You want to protect the surface by placing a dish underneath and be sure to follow the instructions for use and maintenance that the luminaire must use!
7. Himalayan Salt Lamps Improve Mood And Attention
The benefit of the Himalayan pink salt lamp is that it is a great way to naturally enhance your mood and provide relaxation at the end of the day. This is due to the effects of negative ions on your body, the improvement of carries blood and oxygen to the brain and other organs, and the stimulation of serotonin (neurotransmitters) that make us happy.
Also, these lights are ideal for attention, because of the soothing light that the Himalayan salt emit. It provides the attraction of the viewer and can use as a decoration piece in homes.
8.Himalayan Salt Lamps As A Light Source That Respects The Environment
Another benefit of the salt lamp is that we can use it as a source of light. The pink salt lamps in the Himalayas are ecological. The base of these lamps is typically carved on durable wood, such as the Indian banyan tree. Some bulbs use low-energy bulbs and consume very little energy, while others are small candles.
Benefits For The Health of Himalayan Crystal Salt Lamps
