Warts / Skin Tag Removal
Warts and Skin Tag can be unsightly and cause embarrassment for some sufferers.
Warts are a small, benign growth on the skin, caused by a virus. They are highly contagious. There are many different types of warts, but the most common is a raised bump with a rough surface between 1-10mm in size. Warts are commonly seen on the hands, feet, knees and face and can be single or in clusters. They can be itchy and uncomfortable.
Whereas skin tag looks like tiny bits of “hanging” skin and typically occur where clothing rubs against the skin or where there is skin-to-skin friction, such as the underarms, neck and upper chest. Skin tags are soft skin growths that almost all of us will experience at some point in our lives. They look lke a small hanging piece of flesh-coloured skin, usually between 2 – 5mm in diameter. Skin tags appear mostly on the eyelids, neck, armpits and body folds (source).
Although skin tags are not contagious and usually painless, they will usually linger on your skin unless treated.
