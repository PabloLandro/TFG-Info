Sunglasses from Your Austin Optometrist
Sunglasses are good for your eyes and for your image! At Austin Vision Center, we carry sunglasses for everyone, from children to seniors. Whether you require corrective lenses or are simply looking for non-prescription sunglasses, our selection spans a range of styles and brands to meet your unique needs. As your optometrist in Austin, we focus on patient education to help our patients understand why they should wear sunglasses whenever spending time outdoors. This helps keep our patient's eyes healthy and helps reduce cases of cataracts, macular degeneration and other degenerative problems.
Benefits of Sunglasses
There are many reasons to wear sunglasses!
Protection from UV rays - Special coatings of UV protection on your lenses can help block UVA and UVB rays. This kind of protection can prevent conditions like cataracts and macular degeneration, thus helping you to maintain good eyesight.
Protection from glare - On long days spent in the sun, glare can cause headaches and even temporary blindness. Going indoors from the outside, your eyes may need several minutes to adjust. Your sunglasses can help you avoid these problems.
Protection from the sun year-round - Sunglasses aren't just for summer use! Many people need to wear sunglasses year-round. Even in winter, when the temperature outside is its coldest, people use their sunglasses to protect against snow glare and other light-related problems.
Safety - Driving in sunlight without sunglasses can be dangerous, because direct sunlight that shines in the eyes can reduce a person's ability to see properly. Wearing sunglasses can prevent this problem.
UVA/UVB Protection
The best sunglasses block 99% of UVA and UVB rays. People who own glasses that provide proper protection should wear them outdoors for recreation, driving, working and more. At Austin Vision Center, we help our patients purchase sunglasses that protect their eyes while outdoors on all occasions.
Polarized Sunglasses
Polarized sunglasses help protect the eyes from the effect of horizontal glare, such as the glare you might see when light reflects off water or snow. Polarized sunglasses are helpful for patients who spend a lot of time outdoors in snow or near water.
Prescription Sunglasses
When you need prescription sunglasses, our optometrists will update your prescription with a comprehensive vision exam. We'll check for eye disease, refractive error and proper eye function. Getting a new exam every time you purchase new glasses helps to ensure that your corrective lenses are right for your needs.
