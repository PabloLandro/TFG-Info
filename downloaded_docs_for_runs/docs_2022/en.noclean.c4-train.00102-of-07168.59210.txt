UTI in Men
Compared to women, Urinary tract infections in men are uncommon. This is due to the longer length of urethra and dryness of the urethral opening (called meatus). Prostatic secretions have antibacterial properties and hence these may prevent urinary tract infections. Non-circumcision is also a risk factor for UTI. The commonest organism is E coli.
UTI is common if there is an anatomic abnormality, obstruction, instrumentation of the urinary tract or prior surgery. In men after 50 years of age, prostatic enlargement can make a person prone to UTI.
As in the case of women, the infections of the urinary tract may involve urethra, bladder or kidney or a combination of all of them. In addition, the prostate gland can also be infected.
Symptoms :
Symptoms are similar to those in women. However, infections of the prostate can give rise to fever and pain in the perineum (the area between anus and scrotum).
Diagnosis of UTI is by its symptoms, physical examination and laboratory tests. The prostate is tender on digital examination of the rectum.
Urine shows increased pus cells, nitrate test is positive and midstream urine culture shows >105 bacteria /ml of urine. In case of recurrence, if no cause is apparent, tests are done to ascertain anatomical details of the urinary tract.
Treatment is started empirically. In case of no or poor response in 2-3 days, the drugs are modified based on culture results.

Diabetes Care
- May 08, 2018
For patients suffering from type II /adult onset diabetes :In type II diabetes, diagnosis is often late (after the disease has already been present for some time). In early days T2DM (short for the adult type of diabetes) are often without symptoms. Hence the delay in diagnosis. This means complications will be seen early after diagnosis. Foot Care : Foot disease in diabetes may lead to difficulty in walking, pain and may lead to infections. If neglected amputation may be required. Inspect feet with a mirror before going to sleep every night. Use well fitting shoewear. Do not walk bare feet even in the house. Socks should be clean and correct size. In case of deformities of feet, special shoes can be worn. Eye Care : It is nowadays the commonest cause of blindness throughout the world.

Nephrotic Syndrome
- July 13, 2018
Nephrotic Syndrome Kidneys receive approximately 1 liter of blood every minute. Of this, about 100 ml gets filtered in the kidney. This contains, small molecules and few large molecules. This is due to the intricate cellular structure that prevents proteins from getting filtered into the urinary space. A derangement of this filter results in passage of heavy amounts of proteins in urine. This condition is called HeavyProteinuria or Nephrotic syndrome or Nephrosis. Definition: In the urine, the protein excretion is > 3.5 gm/day or in children, it is >50mg/kg of body weight. In most cases, the serum albumin is <3gm/dl (normal>4), and passage of lipids in the urine. The lipids in the blood increase and swelling of face and feet also occur. Causes of Nephrotic Syndrome: In children, most cases are due to Minimal Change Disease, FSGS, MPGN etc. In adults, most cases are due to primary illness while upto 30% may be due to secondary illness. Clinical Features: Apart from Edema, ther…
