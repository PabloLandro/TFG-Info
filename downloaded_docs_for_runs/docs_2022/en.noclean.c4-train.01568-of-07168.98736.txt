Nutrition & bio-availability
What does the evidence say about the nutritional composition of 100% fruit juice, or the bioavailability of its nutrients and bioactives? In this section, we present summaries and mini literature reviews on the latest science.
Nutritional benefits of 100% fruit juice
Fruit juices contain a range of minerals, vitamins and bioactive compounds, such as phytochemicals, that are important for good health.

Processing fruit may lower glycaemic index
There are mixed views about how the juicing of fruit can affect blood glucose levels and indeed disease risk. To better understand this, researchers looked at how blending fruit can influence postprandial glucose levels.

Drinking a daily glass of 100% fruit juice not associated with a higher risk of hypertension in people with type 2 diabetes
It has been speculated that drinking 100% fruit juice does not compare with eating whole fruit from a health perspective. To evaluate this scientifically, a large prospective study in the US analysed how 100% fruit juice and whole fruit compared in relation to increased hypertension or type 2 diabetes risk.

Nutrients in 100% fruit juice are bioavailable but processed has edge over fresh for bioactives
In accordance with EU regulations, 100% fruit juice (100%FJ) has nothing added or taken away, which is why it reflects the nutrient content of the fruit from which it is made1 . The nutrient composition of 100% orange juice (100%OJ) is shown below per 100 g. Values in red represent official ‘source’ claims that can be made on pack.

Metabolic health and 100% fruit juice
There is a belief that 100% fruit juice (100%FJ), on account of its natural sugar and low fibre levels, as well as its liquid format, could have a detrimental impact on blood glucose control and body weight. However, these views are often based on assumptions rather than solid evidence. This article will review recent studies that have considered these issues.

GI and GL of typical foods and beverages
Glycemic index (GI) provides information on how a food or drink is likely to affect blood glucose levels. Additionally, glycemic load (GL) takes into account the portion size. Healthier diets tend to be those with a lower GI and GL. So, how do 100% orange and apple juices compare with other foods?
