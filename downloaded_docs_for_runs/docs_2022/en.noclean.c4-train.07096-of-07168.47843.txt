Not all salts are equal.
Reading comments following my last post ‚ÄúOxygenate‚Äù I realized, that I have made some of my dear Readers worry about my health. I‚Äôm fine, better than I was a week ago. I‚Äôm oxygenating, drinking glass of good water/with 1/2 a teaspoon Himalayan Pink Salt and 1/2 a teaspoon baking soda every morning.
You see, first I should have explained the difference between regular table salt and Himalayan Pink Salt.
Here it is.
We all know how bad is regular table salt ‚Äì Sodium Chloride ‚Äì refined ‚Äì processed white stuff devoid of nutrients ‚Äì contains aluminium and many other harmful ingredients. One only good element in it is Iodine.
But Himalayan Pink Salt contains the same 84 trace minerals and elements that are found in the human body. Iodine too.
Himalayan pink salt is good for vascular health ‚Äì supports respiratory function ‚Äì promotes stable pH balance -reduces signs of aging ‚Äì promotes healthy sleep ‚Äì increases libido ‚Äì prevents muscle cramps ‚Äì increases hydration ‚Äì strengthen bones ‚Äì lowers blood pressure ‚Äì improves circulation ‚Äì detoxifies the body.
So lets replace Table Salt with Himalayan Pink Salt ‚Äì For better health!
Thank you for reading.
‚ù§ .
God Bless you all.

I‚Äôve used Himalayan Pink Salt for years ‚Äì I put medium chunks in our clear salt grinder & it‚Äôs lovely ‚Ä¶ another friend started doing the same thing (she is well-known for loving anything pink), so when dinner guests saw that, their initial assumption was that she‚Äôd figured out a way to dye her salt.

I also like Redmond Real Salt for the same reasons. I think it has a few less trace minerals, but it‚Äôs basically local.

I‚Äôm going to have to check into this salt. Is it anything like Real Salt, which is just natural salt with all the minerals still intact?

Your posts on the salt was JUST what I needed, thanx. [Synchronicity at its finest!] I have been using Sea Salt to get away from ‚Äòtable salt‚Äô. Lately, I have been wanting ‚Äòtable salt‚Äô and figured my body was craving iodine. I can‚Äôt get myself to buy ‚Äòtable salt‚Äô.
Years ago, I bought a ‚ÄòNatural Himalayan Salt Lamp‚Äô (love it!). It came with a sample of pink Himalayan salt. I put the salt in a small glass jar, set it in the cupboard and forgot about it ‚Äî and now, thanx to you, I pulled it out and have it available for daily use. I will be buying more pink salt. Thank you, I am very grateful!

We‚Äôve switched over to the Himalayan pink salt years ago. I‚Äôm definitely loving the pink colour and just knowing that it is a lot better. Even for sugar we‚Äôve switched from white sugar to more natural alternatives, like raw honey, maple syrup, stevia, molasses. The best part about our raw honey is it comes from our very own backyard beehive.

Hi there ‚Äî one of your fans mentioned a Himalayan salt lamp. I have one beside the computer and one in our lounge area, to de-ionise the air (clean up the air and protect from electro-magnetic frequencies). And if you get hungry or run out of salt in the kitchen you can scrape off a bit of the lamp‚Ä¶. never tried that but apparently it‚Äôs possible!

I got a small Himalayan pink salt lamp that just holds a tea light. It is perfect for relaxing in the evening when I do my meditation. I have been using sea salt but I will try using the Himalayan. i rarely use salt but it would look pretty on my slced tomatoes and cucumbers.
