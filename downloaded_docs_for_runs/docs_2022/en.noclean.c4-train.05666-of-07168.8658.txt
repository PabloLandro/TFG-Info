Hemorrhoids, sometimes called piles, are swollen veins that affect your rectum and anus, and the most common symptoms include itching, pain, and rectal bleeding. It is important to learn how to get rid of hemorrhoids fast. This article will teach you how to make hemorrhoids go away without the use of prescription or over-the-counter medicines.
Increased pressure on the anal veins is often the result of constipation and straining to pass stools. Approximately 50% to 75% of Americans suffer from hemorrhoids, and nearly a third of the population suffers from them on an ongoing basis.
Hemorrhoids can occur inside (rectum) or outside (anus) the body, and are called internal and external hemorrhoids. When internal hemorrhoids become enlarged, they may partially prolapse and become lumpy-looking masses of tissue called prolapsed hemorrhoids.
But, how long do hemorrhoids last and how long do hemorrhoids bleed? Hemorrhoids typically go away within a few weeks; however, they will cause mild to severe discomfort at the same time. To help tolerate them, we will take a look at natural treatment for hemorrhoids.
How to Get Rid of Hemorrhoids Fast
Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, while the external kind can be quite painful. Either way, there is often bleeding and you shouldn’t have to suffer through that. That is why it is important to learn how to shrink hemorrhoids fast at home.
There are natural tips for how to get rid of piles without seeing a doctor. The following details how to get rid of hemorrhoids naturally with home remedies.
1. Epsom Salt Sitz Bath
A sitz bath is a warm, shallow bath that cleanses the space between the scrotum or vulva and rectum. It involves sitting in the warm water for 10 minutes, twice per day. It is known as one of the better non-invasive options for getting rid of hemorrhoids fast, and is also helpful for other symptoms like aching or burning, anal itching, or pain. Try the following for an Epsom salt sitz bath:
Clean and rinse the bathtub.
Fill the bathtub with three to four inches of warm water, and add two tablespoons of Epsom salt. Gently stir the bathtub.
Step into the bath, and soak your anal region for 20 to 30 minutes. Do this two or three times daily for healing hemorrhoids quickly.
2. Witch Hazel
Witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) is a natural anti-inflammatory with antioxidant and astringent properties that is useful for reducing hemorrhoids symptoms like itching, inflammation, and pain. Topical liquid witch hazel can be purchased and applied to your hemorrhoids.
3. Coconut Oil
Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that can smooth out digestive problems. Many people swear by coconut oil for hemorrhoids and constipation. Take one tablespoon of coconut oil in the morning or at night on a regular basis to prevent the occurrence of hemorrhoids.
4. Aloe Vera
The anti-inflammatory properties of aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis) help soothe the inflammation associated with hemorrhoids. As a result, aloe vera could also relieve constipation due to hemorrhoids. That being said, you should only use pure aloe vera gel for hemorrhoids, since some people are allergic to the latex from just beneath the aloe leaf skin.
5. Cold Compress
A cold compress is another trick for how to get rid of hemorrhoids fast. For this method, simply apply a cold compress or ice pack to the anus to relieve swelling for 15 minutes each time.
This can be a very effective treatment for large and painful hemorrhoids. Cold compresses help hemorrhoids shrink while also relieving itching and pain. After swelling has reduced, stools are easier to pass. Remember, though, to never apply anything frozen directly to the skin. It is always best to wrap ice inside a paper towel or cloth.
6. High-Fiber Diet
It is important to avoid constipation and hard stools to get rid of hemorrhoids. This can be done by eating a high-fiber diet that includes green leafy vegetables, avocados, berries, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, lentils, nuts, chia seeds, and flaxseed. Studies show that high-fiber diets can reduce hemorrhoids symptoms like bleeding by about 50%.
7. Horse Chestnut
Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is a common herbal remedy used for treating swelling and regulating poor blood flow. Research published in the journal Alternative Medicine Review in 2001 found that horse chestnut can improve microcirculation, vascular tone, and capillary flow. All of these factors are helpful for getting rid of hemorrhoids and relieving constipation. (1)
8. Butcher’s Broom
Butcher’s broom (Ruscus aculeatus) is known to reduce inflammation and swelling associated with hemorrhoids. A study published in the German journal Arzneimittel-Forschung in 2002 found that butcher’s broom was effective for patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency—a condition where the blood pools because the flow of blood through the veins is inadequate.(2)
9. Drink Plenty of Water
Dehydration is a potential problem associated with constipation, since fluids or water is needed for fiber to travel smoothly through the digestive system. When you don’t get enough water, bowel movements become hard and difficult to pass, and this will enlarge hemorrhoids and increase pelvic pressure.
A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2003 indicated that fluid loss and fluid restriction can increase constipation, which worsens hemorrhoid symptoms. When considering how to make hemorrhoids go away fast, it is recommended to drink at least one glass of water during each meal or snack daily.(3)
10. Essential Oils
Essential oils can also provide relief from hemorrhoids, particularly cypress essential oil and helichrysum essential oil. Helichrysum essential oil helps stimulate the secretion of gastric juices needed for the breakdown of food and prevent digestive issues like hemorrhoids and constipation. The astringent and hemostatic properties of cypress essential make it good for relieving constipation and stopping excess blood flow.
Rub a few drops of helichrysum or cypress essential oil on a cotton ball, and apply to the abdomen for hemorrhoid relief.
11. Fermented Foods
Fermented foods can help provide the digestive system with healthy bacteria, or probiotics, that are essential for proper elimination and treating hemorrhoids and constipation naturally. Research shows that fermented foods improve intestinal health, aid digestion, and enhance the bioavailability of nutrients. Some of the most common fermented foods include kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, kombucha, and raw cheese.
12. Psyllium Husk
Psyllium husk is a good fiber supplement that is found in powder form. Research shows that psyllium husk can reduce the frequency of bleeding when using the bathroom while also helping to avoid straining or constipation. It is also recommended to drink lots of water when using psyllium husk.
Practice Better Toilet Habits to Get Rid of Hemorrhoids
There are other steps for how to make hemorrhoids go away fast. You can treat and prevent hemorrhoids by following a handful of simple, better toilet habits. Keep these in mind the next time you are sitting on the porcelain.
Avoid Straining and Go When You Need To
Straining during a bowel movement is never a good thing, and it can be painful and even worsen hemorrhoids. When you need to go “number two,” don’t delay it. Waiting can back up your stool, make it harder, and lead to increased pressure on the weakened veins.
It is always best to go to the bathroom in a relaxed state. In general, it is recommended to set a time for daily bowel movements to help establish a regular routine. For instance, going first thing in the morning or after breakfast are good times to start a regular bowel habit.
Avoid Prolonged Sitting on the Toilet
Have you ever spent hours on the toilet reading or playing video games on your phone? Sitting for a prolonged period of time, especially on the toilet, can lead to more straining and worsen or cause your hemorrhoids.
Prevent Constipation
Constipation will force you to strain while going to the bathroom. That increases pain and inflammation associated with hemorrhoids. To avoid constipation, be sure to eat a high-fiber diet and drink lots of fluids to help soften stools. In turn, this will help treat and prevent hemorrhoids.
Clean Yourself Thoroughly
Cleaning your anal area after bowel movements is very important, since left over fecal matter can irritate the skin and aggravate hemorrhoids. However, do not cleanse yourself roughly or with soaps that contain alcohol, perfumes, or harsh chemicals. Soothing wet wipes, moist toilet paper, or a wash cloth are all options when cleaning your anal region.
Limit Spicy Foods and Alcohol
Before going to the toilet, it is important limit alcohol and spicy food consumption. Spicy food can intensify hemorrhoid symptoms, whereas alcohol is dehydrating and can worsen hemorrhoid symptoms.
Stay Active
Staying active and exercising can help reduce pressure on the veins. This can also help you lose excess weight that may contribute to hemorrhoids.
You Can Get Rid of Hemorrhoids Fast and Naturally
As detailed throughout this article, it is important to know how to get rid of hemorrhoids fast.
Some of the best natural methods include an Epsom salt sitz bath, cold compress, aloe vera, witch hazel, coconut oil, horse chestnut, butcher’s broom, psyllium husk, and essential oils like cypress and helichrysum. It is also helpful to drink plenty of water and eat a high-fiber diet and fermented foods like kefir, sauerkraut, or kimchi.
Also, be sure to remember to practice a better toilet routine, including avoiding straining, prolonged sitting on the toilet, and constipation, while also cleaning yourself thoroughly. After all, bowel movements should be smooth and without strain.
