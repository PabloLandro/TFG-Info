Hemorrhoids are veins that have become swollen and inflamed. They may form around the anus and are called external hemorrhoids.
Some can form inside the lower rectum and are called internal hemorrhoids. They can be very painful when you have a bowel movement and itch a lot.
You will also be very uncomfortable when you sit. If you eat a diet which is naturally rich in fiber, you can have soft feces which you can pass easily.
Kinds of Fiber
Soluble fiber – this collects the water in your digestive tract. Later on, it becomes like jelly which slows down your digestion.
Insoluble fiber – it stays in your system, intact. It moves through your intestines to push out the waste and increases the bulk of your feces.
Fruit
Fruits which have soft parts like the apple or orange give us soluble fiber. Majority of fruits give us soluble fiber since they have soft, fleshy inside parts.
If you consume the outer part of a fruit that is tough, it is rich in soluble fiber. Berry and pear skins, citrus fruit veins and peels from apples are rich in insoluble fiber.
Eat the whole fruit and not just its juice because you will get all the fiber you need this way.
Hemorrhoid Treatment: Fiber
Lifestyle changes and most importantly, diet can lessen inflammations and swelling caused by hemorrhoids. If you eat a lot of fibrous foods like fruits, you can reduce strain when you have a bowel movement.
Fiber makes your stool bulky and soft, so you’ll have an easier time passing them. This will reduce the pain and pressure on your hemorrhoids.
Amount of Fiber To Eat
Relieve the pain of hemorrhoids and enhance your digestion by eating about 14 grams of fiber per 1000 calories.
If you have a diet with 2,000 calories, you will need to have 28 grams of fiber to offset it. For hemorrhoid relief, eat whole fruits since they contain the two types of fiber you need.
Food To Avoid When You Have Hemorrhoids
Processed Food
This kind of food has a high animal fat content and very little fiber. They can raise the risk of having hemorrhoids because they don’t have roughage.
Roughage can help make stool soft and move gently through the intestines. Prepackaged, boxed and canned food must be lessened in your diet.
Foods That Are Highly-Refined
Pastries, white bread, cookies, sugary cereals, white rice and prepackaged cakes are not easy to digest.
They have very little dietary fiber and may cause strained passing of stools and constipation. Painless and soft bowel movements are produced by fiber.
Alcohol and Caffeine
Caffeine and alcohol must be eliminated from your diet if you have hemorrhoids. The water supply in your body will be diminished by these substances, so your stool will be dry and small.
Eat more whole fruits daily to add more fiber into your diet to lessen the chances of hemorrhoids forming. It will also diminish the hemorrhoids you already have.
