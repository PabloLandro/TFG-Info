Jury Still Out on Link Between Vaccines and Autism
by Marco Cáceres
Published April 13, 2018 | Opinion
Epidemiology is a basic science, not an applied science. It is not designed to prove anything.
“There is no link between vaccines and autism.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clearly states it on its website.1 It is stated in nearly every newspaper or magazine article written, either by the author or by someone the author has quoted.
In a recent article in HealthDay, postdoctoral fellow Ousseny Zerbo of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center was quoted as saying, “[W]e know through numerous scientific studies that there is no association between childhood vaccination and the incidence of autism spectrum disorders.”2 You can find some variation of this statement in countless other articles. “The scientific evidence is very clear: There’s no link between vaccines and autism.”3
Here’s another one: “The research is clear: Vaccines don’t cause autism. More than a dozen studies have tried to find a link. Each one has come up empty.”4
Here’s one of my favorites: “To be clear, there is no current scientific debate about whether vaccines cause autism. Study after high-quality study—carefully conducted and peer-reviewed—has provided overwhelming scientific evidence that there is no link between childhood immunizations and autism.”5
I could fill many rooms with articles, excerpts from websites and presentations declaring positively and without a doubt that there is no link between vaccines and autism. I could probably fill one room with such declarations from CNN’s chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, MD. Here’s one of my favorites from Dr. Gupta: “Studies […] show no link between vaccines and autism. That is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact.”6
It’s a fact?
No, it is not a fact, and it is irresponsible to say that it is. Why? Because all that research and all those studies and “scientific evidence” often cited to assure the public that there is no link between vaccines and autism are based largely on epidemiological studies.7 8 Epidemiology is a basic science, not an applied science. It is not designed to prove anything. What epidemiology is designed to do is “point the way for further research by fields of applied science that are more capable of solving problems and finding answers.”9
According Freedman Green, MD, “Epidemiology is concerned with the incidence of disease in populations and does not address the question of the cause of an individual’s disease. The question, sometimes referred to as specific causation, is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology.”9 10 11
“Even the most rigorous epidemiological studies suffer from a fundamental limitation, states Georgia Ede, MD. “At best, they can show only association, not causation.”
Dr. Ede adds, “Epidemiological data can be used to suggest hypotheses but not prove them. … Epidemiological studies, at their best, can only point out a possible connection between two things, but that is only the very first step in trying to figure out whether or not there really is a connection between them.”9 10 12
Former director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bernadine Healy, MD concurred with both Freedman and Ede when she said in a television interview, “Populations do not test causality, they test association.”13 14
Dr. Healy was referring to the numerous epidemiological studies that have been done to determine if there is a causal link between vaccines and autism. She was making the point that you cannot rely on epidemiological studies to test causality, because epidemiological studies only have the ability to show a correlation. And correlation is not the same as causation.
So, again, in response to Gupta’s statement of fact about there being no link between vaccines and autism, it is simply not true. Belief and fact are two different things. Gupta, the CDC and many other individuals and institutions may believe there is no link. However, many others believe there is or might be. On this question of a link between vaccines and autism, Healy perhaps said it best…
The more you delve into it, if you look at the basic science, if you look at the research that’s been done in animals. If you also look at some of these individual cases, and if you look at the evidence that there is no link, what I come away with is… the question has not been answered.13 14
It sounds more like the jury is still out on this issue.

I agree.
They can’t come clean now, they are in way too deep. It didn’t start with Autism & as bad as Autism is; there was something worse.
Full transparency would risk the discovery of what really happened with Salk’s SV40 (simian virus) contaminated Polio vaccine. Full transparency would result in the realization that Autism is only one of several conditions involving impaired Synaptic Pruning caused by neuroinflammation (along with Schizophrenia & Alzheimer’s).
It’s the proverbial snowball that rolls downhill: One lie. That requires another lie. They hope that the worst will not be realized. But then it is. More lies. Pretty soon, that little snowball has picked up layer after layer of lies & it turns into a giant wrecking ball; obliterating everything in its path.
The mass shootings: The CDC is squabbling once again with the NRA. The NRA doesn’t want the CDC to get the funding to control the research of firearm injury. The CDC doesn’t want the NRA to switch the narrative away from gun control to mental illness. Because Schizophrenia results from accelerated Synaptic Pruning. And Autism results from under-active Synaptic Pruning. And they are both triggered by the same neuroinflammatory irritant.
If the CDC had any interest in accountability; they would not starting a whole new snowball layer this late in the game.

Also, isn’t it correct that when they say “no link between vaccines and autism” they are only referring to one ingredient in one vaccine (Thimerosal in MMR) because that’s all that the government has studied?
Reply
Joe Harris April 15, 2018 at 9:47 pm
Thimerosal was never in the MMR, it would kill the live viruses.
Fact is, that the Measles virus separates & embeds into the Gut and cerebral spinal of our children. Dr. Wakefield, trapped Dr. Stratton of the vaccine commission into admitting she if it were her child would be concerned. If they found Vaccine strain measles in their Guts an cerebral spinal. I have the audio, and when you listen to it. You have no doubt in your mind who cars about the children. And it is not! the vaccine commission’s Dr Stratton. She makes it clear, if it were her kids she would be concerned. Anybody else, not so much. She just said “we just don’t think that it (measles in bedded into the child’s Gut)
can cause Autism”

Alexander MacInnis April 15, 2018 at 6:44 pm
I am disappointed in this article. You could have cited some basic science and statistics to support the argument that nobody has yet disproved a link between vaccines and autism. But instead you made the claim that the work done so far could not have disproved a link because the work is in the field of epidemiology. That is simply incorrect. Epidemiology is the science of finding the determinants of health, among other things. It is built on biostatistics and study design. It is certainly not limited in the ways stated in this article.
Of course it’s true that correlation does not imply causation. But does lack of correlation imply lack of causation? The correct answer is “yes”. The question, then, is how to show a definitive lack of correlation? One could critique studies that claimed there is no correlation because they didn’t find one – but were they really looking for it? There are all sorts of potential flaws in study designs and biases in data that could produce false negatives. The science of epidemiology teaches you how to identify and prevent such problems. Unfortunately epidemiology can be misused.

SO the increasing incidence of autism diagnosis and the increasing number of vaccines administered to children under 5, in the SAME time frame is just pure coincidence??? And that fact that the people doing most of those studies have strong reasons to NOT find any connections as well is also coincidence? I spent enough time around cops to know they don’t like that kind of coincidences when investigating crimes. And they don’t fly well in this case either.

George Henry April 15, 2018 at 7:30 pm
There is most definitely a link between the MMR vaccine and AUSD. William Thompson Ph.D and leading vaccine researcher at the CDC found a 340% increase in AUSD among African American children below the age of 3 who got their shots on time. This information was criminally redacted and destroyed by the CDC before the study was released. He became a whistleblower and testified in front of Rep. William Posey, R.Fl. His full testimony is available thru his office. Just watched VAXXED the movie for more of this crime against humanity.

This was a very conservative article compared to the number of court cases judgements and legal practitioners winning these cases. It also does not reveal the number of scientific studies that do indeed come to the conclusion that adjuvants are also involved. 24 Published Studies Showing Vaccines Cause Autism http://avoiceforchoice.org/issues/pharmaceuticals-and-vaccines/24-studies/ https://www.facebook.com/notes/lisa-joyce-goes/30-scientific-studies-that-demonstrate-vaxes-can-cause-autism/10150278904786311/ https://vaccinationdecisions.net/open-letter-2-university-of-wollongong-vaccines-can-and-do-cause-autism-and-chronic-illness/

The problem with several of these studies is they’re older; most vaccines no longer have thimerosal in them. Flu shots do, though. So, no surprise, as of late, VAERS pays out mostly to people who seem to have damage from the flu shots.

Nicholas Kottenstette April 18, 2018 at 10:33 am
The above link is about aluminum (not thimerosal) – the papers are recent and they are grounded in biological mechanisms. Particularly about:
1. The biopersistence of the aluminum nanoparticles being readily absorbed by the imune cells and are transported to your brain;
2. The citokines produced from immune responses and their effects on creating autisim in animal models; and
3. Possible treatment options.

Mercury and aluminum derivatives! Two of the most toxic substances to the human body, injected into the blood stream of a small baby boy or toddler. And your telling me that’s not the cause of one in forty or so getting brain damage and developing autism? How long will the world continue to be duped by the profit motive of these creeps. “Every vaccine caused neurological damage” – Dr.Mayer Eisenstein.

Ed,
Nobody injects vaccines into anybody’s bloodstream. Vaccines are injected under the skin or intramuscularly. There are enough eggheads pooh-pooh-ing those of us who believe that vaccines are toxic and cause injury. When you get the details jumbled, it is ammunition for the vaccine pushers to attack people who advocate choice, and the pushers claim that advocates for choice are uneducated, ignorant or misinformed. Don’t give them that opportunity. Get your facts straight.
Thank you

Hi Ed,
I would like to address your comment here and provide a little more insight from my perspective. You mention that both mercury and aluminum derivatives are present in vaccines. While this is true (in some but not all vaccines) I would like to talk why a little further why this isn’t as scary as it sounds. Mercury was found in vaccines in the form of thimerosal which breaks down to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate in the body. Both of which are metabolized safely by the body. Ethylmercury is different that methylmercury, which has been found toxic but is found in some fish. To compare, there is as much methylmercury in a 3oz can of tuna as there is ethylmercury in an average dose of a vaccination (0.5 mL) ((https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm096228#pres). Further more, we have known since 1931 that thimerosal is safe in humans, and further studies since this time have shown this to be true (https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/14/1/218/71322, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19560158?ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum).Regardless of all of this, thimerosal has not been used in vaccines since 2001 due to concerns from the public (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html).
As for the aluminum in vaccines, it also has been shown to not be harmful. Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in vaccines, a way to make the vaccine more effective. When people think of aluminum, most think of the Autoimmune/Autoinflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants (ASIA) which was brought to the public attention after a paper was published in 2011. However, further research since then has shown that aluminum is not a factor in ASIA and is in fact quite safe (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888842).
To address the article above, epidemiology is in fact a valid science that data can be extrapolated from. Many, many peer-reviewed studies show that vaccines are extremely safe with adverse reaction being incredibly rare. The last link I will leave you with is a review that has compiled many years of research into one paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086160).
I hope that this helps you and others understand the safety and efficacy of vaccines. If you have any questions or comments please reply and I will be happy to explain further as best as I can.
Best,
Patrick

The important point: THE SCIENCE OR STUDIES ARE IRRELEVANT! THE IMPORTANT THINGS ARE THE ACTUAL FACTS. And the facts are that newspaper reports (which get the info from the local health departments) prove (ACTUAL FACTS) that it is vaccinated people that cause outbreaks. This proves that:
1. Vaccines Don’t Work
2. Unvaccinated Children do not cause outbreaks
3. People that get vaccinated are more prone to be the ones getting infected, which means that
4. Vaccinated people ARE THE ONES CAUSING THE OUTBREAKS
To determine if vaccines are harmful to some individuals or to the U.S. population to a lesser or higher degree (up to autism and SIDS), one need only apply the law of Parsimony. The Parsimony principle is basic to all science and
tells us to choose the simplest scientific explanation that fits the evidence. In the case of vaccination, the
following basic facts apply:
(1) A CHILD OR PERSON HAS PERFECT HEALTH
(2) IMMEDIATE AND SERIOUS INJURY HAPPENS AFTER VACCINATION
(3) NO EXPLANATION FOR INJURY OTHER THAN VACCINATION IS LOGICAL OR PLAUSIBLE

How on earth is all this going to end? With the CDC and FDA not doing their jobs and actually in bed with big pharmaceutical and so utterly and completely compromised by their close ties with the pharmaceutical industry and lobbyists. It’s going to take one night seismic shift to move this sludge out of the dam. I had high hopes for Trump’s presidency because he was talking about vaccines and the. Red to urgently review them but he seems to have backed off now. It just demonstrates how powerful these guys are. Given their unilateral support even if applied science was able to show definitively that vaccines cause mercury how could they row back from
Their stated claims of generations and decades? President JF Kennedy described the CDdC way back in 1963 as a “cesspool of nepotism and corruption” but then he got assasinated so the investigations he was doing came to a close. Maybe Trump has been scared off too? Once again, it’s up to us parents to try and protect our kids on our own. Lately, I music say governments are doing MORE HARM than good. It’s like we are existing and coping IN SPITE of the government and not because of them.

We all need two groups of children :
The firsth group are children , who are fully vaccinated,
the second group are only non vaccinated children.
Then we can compare the main trait : autismus !
Do you know some non vaccinated children , who suffer from autismus?( Only unherited form of autismus.
Reply
Julie April 17, 2018 at 10:32 pm
Three groups of kids would be needed. They must be randomly assigned to 1)vaccinated, 2) left unvaccinated 3) receive a placebo. They then need to be followed (studied) for a period of time. Personally, I would first examine brain inflammation immediately, and then follow the kids over several more years. Realistically, this study is not possible. Who would let someone else decide if they’re kids would or would not be vaccinated?

Where in hell do all the these vaccine shooting parents think how did my child get any sort of Cancer! What at six months old! Every cancer victim is preceded by some sort of vaccine!
I read a medical journal stating those that get ALS have high amounts of formaldehyde in their bodies. When a person takes a flu and tetanus vaccine together….get Als. My friend did, and she just got that disease. Both vaccines have high amounts of formaldehyde.

How many diseases or maladies have been studied for over 20 years without finding out what causes it, how it spreads, how to avoid getting it,how to treat it? According to the medical community they only know after 20 years is that autism cannot be genetic because you cannot have a genetic epidemic. Where are the 40,50,60 year olds with autism?

All I would like to see is one stupid true statistic published, but you will NEVER SEE THIS Statistic: Just tell me: What percentage of people, who die from the flu, or flu related illness recieved the flu vaccine? You will never see this statistic, because they know that people are getting the vaccine and still dying from the flu–to give you the true numbers would automatically prove that the vaccine causes the flu or is ineffective at the very least.

Great, but I guess you’re in the business of staying in the business. Why don’t you headline each newsletter with that info from last year’s video seminars, that CDC whistleblowers proved in 2013 CDC knew since 2000(?) vaccines caused brain-damage autism.
Why the perpetual dancing? WHY NOT EXPOSE IT, EVERY CHANCE? Has something about that changed? Did I not get the whole “news” because I listened to the free version of seminars? The many doctors, etc., interviewed for the films were very believable. Did I misunderstand?
THOSE IN POWER WILL CONTINUE TO DENY AND MANIPULATE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EXPOSED ENOUGH. Certainly the mainstream snooze media will never tell—and they and gov are paid off. Kennedy said Big Pharma bribes twice as much as oil & gas. None of us even combined can ever stand up to corporations on the gov dole—hence the whole intent of modern fascism. They bought the gov, because the elected and plenty appointed whores were for sale. LOOK at the godless murderous FBI & DoJ et al. (HEY, IT’S THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF WACO, where federal “Agents” murdered more American citizen, Christian families than any school/mass shooting, EVER.

The jury is still out is bull. The evidence is quite clear. Ray Charles could see it. The fact is they say the jury is still out and if anyone disagrees then they will be taken out. You might say a convenient suicide for example Dr. Jeff Bradstreet in Chimney Rock, NC in 2015 conveniently committed suicide.
