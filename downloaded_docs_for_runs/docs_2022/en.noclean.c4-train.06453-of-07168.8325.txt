Foods to be Avoided for High Blood Pressure
High blood pressure if left unchecked results in increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and leads to target organ damage such as LVH, retinal changes and vascular changes. The main objective in the management of hypertension is prevention of target organ damage and reduction of cardiovascular risk. The management requires a multi-prolonged approach.

One of the most common hemorrhoid symptoms is bleeding. If you are noticing any blood in your feces or undergarments, you may have a hemorrhoid problem. Bleeding happens because hemorrhoids themselves are swollen blood vessels in your rectum. When your blood vessels break it causes bleeding. Often, hemorrhoids are caused because you have constipation, so, if you are straining to have a bowel movement, you may break hemorrhoid vessels and bleed.
Another of the hemorrhoid symptoms that you may find yourself dealing with is an irritated reaction that can be triggered by several aspects of your lifestyle. For instance, sitting or standing for a long period of time, heavy lifting and exercise can all cause a strain on the muscles in your rectum. Also, as with itching, if you rub or clean the area it may cause your hemorrhoids to become more swollen and irritated.

Causes of Hemorrhoids
Bad diets and straining on the toilet are the two most likely causes of hemorrhoids and these two reasons are interlinked.
Most cookies contain high fat content Many fast foods are also rich in fats Saturated fats are not good for heart and blood vessels. Low density lipoprotein LDL is main factor which causes thickening of blood vessels so causing extra strain on blood vessels in patients of high blood pressure.

4- Caffeine Intake: The evidence from the literature is rather conflicting and the effects of caffeine seem to depend on multiple variables such as daily dose, preexisting Blood pressure and coffee drinking habits. The ingestion of 250mg of caffeine has been shown to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure ranging from 6mm of hg in normal individuals to 10 mm hg in patients with hypertension and an increase in diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm hg in normal individuals to 8.5 mm Hg in patients of hypertension.

More salt intake will result in more retention of fluid by kidneys and this will lead to more preload on heart, that will result in more blood pressure. You should avoid salt in your diet if you really want to control your blood pressure. If you are already a patient of hypertension, then reduce salt in your diet as it just accentuates the problem. You can lower your blood pressure to a great extent if you reduce salt consumption in your diet. You should not have more than 6 grams (100mmol/day) of salt per day. Pizza, canned foods, frozen diners, broths, canned soups and salad dressings have high sodium so try to avoid these foods. If you are non-vegetarian then make sure you are including white meat like chicken and fish rather than red meat in your diet.
Prolapsed hemorrhoids are another of the common hemorrhoid symptoms. Hemorrhoids start out internally but they can extend to your anus and the outside of your body. That can cause you to be in pain, itch and swell up quite a bit. When that happens, you have prolapsed hemorrhoids. Prolapsed hemorrhoids also cause lumps to appear. The lumps are blood clots just under the surface of your skin. They are caused by bleeding just below the surface and can result in pain and discomfort.
Bleeding Hemorrhoids:- Bleeding hemorrhoids are the most fatal one. Bleeding from internal or external hemorrhoids is considered as bleeding hemorrhoids. There are many causes for bleeding from rectal veins, so consult your doctor.
Not many of us would like to talk on Hemorrhoids and few would seek help to treat this painful condition. This is because of the inadequate and occasional information found on print and electronics media. Looking at the occasional information on hemorrhoids one would imagine that hemorrhoids are rare. But actually hemorrhoids are the most common disease in developed countries like United States.
Here are some foods that you want to avoid to prevent aggravating your hemorrhoids. "	Chili Peppers - It has been found that when you eat a lot of chili peppers
"	Red and Black Currant Berries - Currants are high in Vitamin C, rutin, and minerals. This makes their juice valuable in clearing hemorrhoids. The also have a small amount of the fatty acid GLA, which produce prostaglandin that control body pain.
Itching is another of the major hemorrhoid symptoms, which you may experience. Itching is, unfortunately a self-feeding problem for you. If your hemorrhoids are itchy it may be nearly impossible for you to resist the urge to scratch. Fortunately, there are creams available to help relieve some of that itchiness. However, such creams should only be used on a short term basis and are best used with a consulation by your doctor.
Prevention of Hemorrhoids
Bowel Habits: - You should not wait when there is a nature's call and it should take hardly 2 to 5 minutes to pass stool. Waiting can lead to hardening of stool and thus more difficult to pass.
Cream, ice cream, Whole milk, 2% milk. Most pies, pastries, cakes. Most cheeses (like cream cheese, cheddar, American) Many snack foods (like nuts and chips)
Aging is another cause of hemorrhoids.
Pregnant women are more prone to hemorrhoids as due to pressure on hemorrhoids veins during pregnancy.
Intake of processed food lacking in fiber, is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids
The western style toilet is another cause for hemorrhoids as it encourages straining of toilets
Following Foods should be avoided if you have High blood pressure: 1. Alcohol The association between alcohol and high blood pressure is well documented both in population and clinical studies. An Alcohol intake of about 80 g/day (Equivalent to four pints of beer) has been shown to raise Blood pressure particularly in patients of hypertension. Blood pressure tends to fall when alcohol is stopped or reduced and remains low in patients who continue to abstain. Patients with hypertension should avoid Alcohol. As alcohol can raise blood pressure directly, is also an important factor in damaging walls of blood vessels, which can elevate the blood pressure further and make it more difficult to treat, while at the same time increasing the risk of complications. Limit consumption of Alcohol to no more than two drinks per day in most men and one drink per day in women and lightweight men.
A good diet is always the key to keeping healthy and getting well. But if you target those foods that can help you get hemorrhoid relief, then you add healing power to your good diet. If you have a high protein diet, which moves slowly through your colon, then, expect to be constipated. Constipation is the main cause of hemorrhoids, so this is one condition you need to eliminate or prevent.
The good news is that, hemorrhoid symptoms can be treated. All you need to do is consult your doctor for advice. You can also try adapting your diet as well. No matter what is causing your hemorrhoids, there are treatments available for this uncomfortable, painful and embarrassing problem.
Right medication, precaution and care should be taken to treat hemorrhoids.
