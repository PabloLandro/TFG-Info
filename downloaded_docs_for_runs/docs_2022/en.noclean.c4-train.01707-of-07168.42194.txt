Morphine Addictions
Morphine addictions ruin lives every day and numb people to the world around them. The drug Morphine is a narcotic that relieves moderate to severe pain. When this pain reliever is prescribed it is meant to dull the pain away so an individual will not be suffering. Morphine targets the pain receptors that are located throughout the brain and changes how they transmit information that is perceived as pain.
Are Morphine Addictions Causing You To Struggle?
There is hope for the battle with morphine addictions. Once an individual starts abusing Morphine they will enjoy how it makes them feel and after prolonged use their tolerance level increases. They will then need to start taking higher dosage so to get the same effects they were originally getting and this is how dependence and addiction begin.
Morphine should only be taken by those it is prescribed to because it can become highly addictive medication. Those that already have or feel they are at the beginning of a drug addiction should never be allowed access to Morphine.
Morphine should always be taken as the doctor prescribes it and should never be out where children or other people can reach it. Taking the recommended amount is very important and never going over is crucial to one’s health. Combining other substances or alcohol with Morphine could be very dangerous or life-threatening.
Here is a list of some serious side-effects experienced when taking Morphine: weakness, slow and shallow heart rate and breathing, faint or light-headed sensations, dizziness, confusion, clammy skin. If you or someone you know is taking Morphine and develops these side-affects you should find help and contact a doctor or go to the emergency room immediately.
On the other hand, a few mild side-effects will be diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, loss of sleep, anxiety, dizziness, and headaches. If any of these persist contact your doctor as a precaution.
