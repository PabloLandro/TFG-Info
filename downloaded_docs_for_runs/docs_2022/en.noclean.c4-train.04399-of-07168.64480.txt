01/8Should you really be drinking your own urine?
The Internet is a strange place. While it is obviously helpful in a lot of ways, and surely finds answers to your weirdest of queries, there are times you stumble upon something extremely bizarre, which is far beyond your imagination.
The latest fad which seems to have caught the interest of DIY health elites is... wait-for-it... drinking your own urine.
It is okay if you feel grossed out, frankly, we are not too sure if we have any appetite left.
The fad claims that drinking your own piss and further applying it to your skin results in clear skin, helps in battling acne and increases general vitality.
As crazy as it may seem, right from Madonna to Indian politician and Nobel prize winner, Swami Agnivesh practice urotherapy.

02/8​But first what exactly is urotherapy?
Wikipedia states urotherapy as the application of human urine for medicinal and cosmetic purposes in the alternative medicine.
It also includes drinking your own urine and massaging your skin with it.
Now, why you definitely should not be drinking your own piss
Even though there are several self-acclaimed ‘health-experts’ going gaga about the urotherapy --the latest internet buzzword, the fact is drinking your own piss is not deemed to be beneficial by the science.
We are listing down the reason why you should NOT be drinking your own piss if you are already not grossed out enough by the idea of swirling your pee in your mouth like the YouTube experts.

03/8​Urine is not STERILE
First things first, the claims floating around the internet of piss being sterile are completely untrue and not proven at the very least.
This myth of urine being sterile has spread like a wildfire. This misconception seems to have triggered by studies conducted way back in the 1950s, when the study samples showing UTI signs were labelled ‘positive, urine that did not show any sign of UTI was labelled ‘negative’.
This confusion stems from the fact that the absence of UTI (urinary tract infection) does not mean the absence of bacteria, as UTI is caused by the overgrowth of bacteria.

04/8​Toxins
For the uninitiated, urine contains waste products filtered out from the bloodstream. The funny part is urine is actually excreted out of the body, making it seemingly unfit to consume again.
After all, why would you want to strain your kidneys by reintroducing waste products in your body?

05/8​Medications
After being metabolized, the medicines you take are excreted through your urine. Now add two and two and guess why it is not advisable to drink your own urine?
Answer: It could change the dose of medications you are taking.

06/8​Bacteria
By drinking your own urine, you may introduce bacteria into your system, as your urinary tract contains different types of bacteria. This may further result in various types of infections or diseases.

07/8​Dehydrating
It is a known fact that the urine contains salts in a concentrated amount. When you drink it, you are straining your kidneys to process this salt for which it will need some water.
This will result in peeing a lot more water to compensate for the increase in salt intake aka your piss.
The takeaway, drinking urine will end up dehydrating you.

08/8​The bottom line
Dr Zaki Almallah, a consultant urologist further makes an interesting point, “The only time it's medically recommended to ingest urine is if you're stranded without food or water for many days. The point of urination is to rid the body of excess. Why would you want to reabsorb that?”
If you ask us, urine is best flushed down the toilet seat.
