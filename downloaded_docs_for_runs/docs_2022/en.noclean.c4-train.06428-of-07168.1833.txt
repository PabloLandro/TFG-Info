Today in the United States, Autism affects 1 in 50. A government survey issued in 2015 claims the ASD rate may be as high as 1 in 45 children between the ages of 3 and 17. Why? I think after reading this newsletter and listening to the many testimonies from parents, you will have enough information to decide. You can not only decide what is the cause of Autism but know what to do to rid the body of this dis-ease. The medical system calls it a “disorder”, (autism spectrum disorder). My question is; what caused this “disorder” of the body’s normal functions?
In 2010, Jim Humble and I had just started the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing when a woman named Kerri Rivera and her husband came to the Dominican Republic for a visit. She wanted to talk to Jim to learn more about MMS. She had been using it with her son, Patrick, with success and wanted to know more about using Chlorine Dioxide in the body. At that time, Jim had been experimenting and perfecting its use for 13 years successfully curing Malaria, AIDS, and Cancers in Africa personally. He published his first book in 2005, “Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21st Century” which told of his experiences that started a movement around the world!
Kerri Rivera shared the story about her son, Patrick, with all of us at a seminar where Jim and I were teaching. She went back to her home in Mexico and developed protocols specifically designed for treating Autism. I’m glad to tell everyone that now there are over 8,000 people that have done these protocols with over 200 children completely cured with a non-autism diagnosis i.e cured!
Here are testimonies of her experiences with Autism:

Below you can see testimonies from parents of Autistic children of how activated MMS, (chlorine dioxide), helped them.
NOTE: These people are NOT actors but REAL parents of children suffering from Autism. What caused it? Vaccines? Heavy medications? Toxins?

NOTE: Activated MMS or Chlorine Dioxide is the reason why children and adults have recovered from the symptoms of Autism (ASD)
I believe that 95% of all children that have Autism had a vaccine!http://www.ageofautism.com/2016/04/lets-go-find-unvaccinated-children-with-autism.html
I say 95% because I’ve met one that has all the symptoms of Autism and never had a vaccine but was heavily medicated when very young to where his brain swelled!
Here is a study of 15,000+ UNVACCINATED children and instances of diseases. http://www.vaccineinjury.info/survey/results-unvaccinated/results-illnesses.html
http://healthimpactnews.com/2016/study-unvaccinated-children-healthier-than-vaccinated-kids-doctors-agree/
NOTE: You see a very small amount of dis-eases but there are some, even Autism. Why? Are theses children in contact with toxins from food, water and air?
Vaccines are full of toxins period. No debate necessary! Here is a list of many of the toxins that are in vaccines today:
Toxic vaccine ingredients and their adverse effects:
• Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also, shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions.
• Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues.
• Gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease).
• Sodium chloride: Raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth.
• Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and salmonella bacteria.
• Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple* vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day.
• Human albumin: The protein portion of blood from pooled human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. Injecting "pooled blood" can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency virus infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts.
• Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation, respiratory distress and cancer. Plus, formaldehyde has been known to fail to deactivate the virus the vaccine is intended to cure, thus enabling a live virus to enter your blood and infect your system.
• Phenoxyethanol: A glycol ether/chemical; highly toxic to the nervous system, kidneys, and liver. The FDA warns "can cause shut down of the central nervous system (CNS), vomiting and contact dermatitis" in cosmetics; imagine when injected into your blood.
• Aluminum phosphate: Greatly increases toxicity of mercury, so caution about minimum mercury tolerance is therefore severely underestimated. CDC scientists and all doctors are well aware of this.
• MSG (monosodium glutamate): When injected becomes a neurotoxin, causing CNS disorders and brain damage in children.

Question to parents; How can you read this list of ingredients found in the vaccines and still allow your child, or yourself for that matter, to be injected?
Look what Mahatma Ghandi said about vaccines
HORRORS OF VACCINATION BY Dr. Schieferdecker 1870
NOTE: This is a book from 1870!!!! NOTHING has change!
Dr. Collins, twenty years vaccine physician in London and Edinburgh, writes “There really exists no change in the virulent character of the small-pox notwithstanding the vaccination-laws; and of those attacked by the disease at the least two-thirds were satisfactorily vaccinated.” He adds: If I had the desire to describe one-third of the victims ruined by vaccination, the blood would stand still in your veins. I have not the least confidence in vaccination; it nauseates me, for it transfers often filthy and dangerous diseases from one to another, without offering any protection whatever.”

NOTE: Makers of two of the most used vaccines MMR and Tripedia admit can cause "autism"!
Original MMR Package Insert Has
Autism As Adverse Effect
The drug company that makes the M.M.R. vaccine (Merck) publishes an extensive list of warnings, contraindications, and adverse reactions associated with this triple shot. It may be found in the vaccine package insert given to doctors administering MMR, and inside the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR)(8,9). However, this information is never given to patients or parents. The insert is quoted immediately below.
An Excerpt from the Original M.M.R. Drug Insert
The following afflictions affecting nearly every body system -- blood, lymphatic, digestive, cardiovascular, immune, nervous, respiratory, and sensory -- have been reported following receipt of the MMR shot: encephalitis, encephalopathy, neurological disorders, seizure disorders, convulsions, learning disabilities, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) demyelination of the nerve sheaths, Guillain-Barré syndrome (paralysis), muscle incoordination, deafness, panniculitis, vasculitis, optic neuritis (including partial or total blindness) retinitis, otitis media, bronchial spasms, fever, headache, joint pain, arthritis (acute and chronic) transverse myelitis, thrombocytopenia (blood clotting disorders and spontaneous bleeding) anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, pneumonitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, urticaria, pancreatitis, parotitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, meningitis, diabetes, autism, immune system disorders, and death
The M.M.R. vaccine manufacturer has begun censoring autism from the package insert for its second version of the M.M.R. vaccine ("M.M.R. 2"). Most of the above indications continue to be cited, except for the admission of an autism link, which has been selectively removed. The vaccine manufacturer previously admitted to causing autism, but only in private communications with doctors. Their statements to the public and the media were the complete opposite.
Parents in the British medical system are often ignored when they report problems with vaccines, because the doctors act as the gatekeepers. Parents cannot directly report bad reactions to regulators. They must instead go through their doctor, who may refuse, in order to protect himself. Keep in mind that doctors in Britain get monetary bonuses for administering vaccines, which could be considered a conflict of interest.

CDC Whistleblower to Extend MMR Vaccine Fraud
While the CDC claims no knowledge of a connection between MMR and autism, Dr. Thompson’s own statement to Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL) when he released thousands of documents to Posey is explicit, “We hypothesized that if we found statistically significant effects at either the 18-month or 36-month threshold, we would conclude that vaccinating children early with the MMR vaccine could lead to autism-like characteristics or features.”
In fact, the CDC’s data did show statistically significant effects at the 36-month threshold, proof that the CDC knew their study found a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. CDC responded to this finding by manipulating the data to make this finding disappear.

If Vaccines don’t cause Autism why is it a side effect listed on the package insert with the FDA!

Quote from Package insert of Tripedia Vaccine
“Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.2″

Doctor links toxins and autism…
Jan 6, 2017, Cleveland Plain Dealer: Make 2017 the year to avoid toxins (good luck) and master your domain: Words on Wellness
This was an interesting piece. A doctor, Daniel Neides, from the Cleveland Clinic is speaking out on toxins (including vaccines) and our health.
Neides described how he received a thimerosal-free flu shot, only to find out that it still contained toxic formaldehyde. Within 12 hours, he was sick.
(Dr. Neides should look at the findings from the CDC, other agencies, and the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration. The ineffectiveness of the flu shot has been shown over and over.)
Regardless, Neides knows toxins are affecting our health and officials are doing nothing about it.
“.But when toxins disrupt normal function, problems can occur. Those problems include cancers, auto-immune diseases, neurologic problems like autism, ADHD, and Parkinson's disease, and the most prevalent chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease….”
Neides is especially concerned about the explosion in autism.
Why do I mention autism now twice in this article. Because we have to wake up out of our trance and stop following bad advice. Does the vaccine burden - as has been debated for years - cause autism? I don't know and will not debate that here. What I will stand up and scream is that newborns without intact immune systems and detoxification systems are being over-burdened with PRESERVATIVES AND ADJUVANTS IN THE VACCINES. http://www.ageofautism.com/
Doctors See Link Between Vaccines
and Autism Rates
“We all need to be looking at improving the safety of vaccines,” says Bose Ravenel, M.D., whose practice is based in Winston Salem, North Carolina.
Ravenel, 78, admits that in his long career practicing medicine he used to dismiss the idea vaccines are connected to autism or other health problems in children. But now, after attending autism conferences, researching the peer-reviewed scientific literature, and paying more attention to parents’ experiences, he has changed his mind.
“There is clearly a relationship between vaccines and autism,” Ravenel says. “But to say that ‘vaccines cause autism’ is an inaccurate, non-nuanced statement. At the same time, to say that ‘vaccines don’t cause autism’ is also inaccurate. In certain conditions, like with mitochondrial dysfunction, vaccines certainly can cause autism or contribute to it.”
Ravenel insists that any doctor who does the research, instead of just heedlessly following the recommendations of his professional medical organizations, will come to the same conclusion.
“Any physician who would be willing to look at both sides openly and study it seriously would conclude that the idea that vaccines have been proven not to cause autism is not accurate,” Ravenel says.

Other governments tell their citizens the truth about vaccines and even take them off the vaccine program! What is up with US, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand? All the same bird! These nations do everything the same in regard to vaccines. Why?

In the United States, however, you cannot sue the manufacturers of vaccines, as they are protected from civil criminal prosecution.

Robert Kennedy Jr. says he's accepted
job offer from Trump
President-elect Donald Trump met with Robert Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday. According to incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, the two discussed “the issues pertaining to vaccines and immunizations.”
Kennedy, who criticized Mr. Trump during the election campaign, has also written a book and promoted a documentary on the subject. During one showing of that documentary, according to the Sacramento Bee, Kennedy compared the damage done by vaccines to “a holocaust.”
“They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,” Kennedy said at the screening in 2015. “This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.” It was a comment which he later apologized for, saying, “I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.”

What is the common denominator in all vaccines and side affects TOXINS Look at the ingredients! Is it the Mercury? Aluminum? Formaldehyde? Glutamate? Squalene? Or is it a combination of all of them. Not one of these toxins should be put into a human or animal body!
Here is an example of a person coming to a conclusion not based on facts about vaccines which probably caused cancer in her son! Educate before your vaccinate!
An Open Letter to Non-Vaxxers:
Tonight, while enjoying a nice dinner, I got a call from the director of my son's preschool. She was calling to tell me that they had made the decision to put my son in a different class because two children in the class he was supposed to be in have "opted out" of their vaccines. This may not sound like a big thing. He is still in the Tuesday-Thursday class, and since he doesn't start school until next Tuesday, it's not like he has to get readjusted to a whole new class. No harm, no foul. Actually, this is a big deal--a very big deal. You see, my son is immunocompromised. He has cancer. He was fully vaccinated and supporting the whole "herd immunity" thing before his cancer diagnosis, but that darn chemo wiped out his immunity to the communicable diseases against which he had already been vaccinated.
So, parents who choose to not vaccinate because you feel it's the "right choice for your family", I would like to thank you. Thank you for adding yet another worry to my plate and my husband's plate. You see, we already worry about a lot--it's an unfortunate part of your child having cancer--you worry every night. On top of worrying about things like relapse, organ toxicity brought on by chemo, debilitating late effects of chemo, secondary cancers brought on by chemo, the mental effects of having more than three years of painful treatment, we now get to worry about, of all things, measles. And mumps. And whooping cough. And chicken pox.
Your responsibility to your community is to vaccinate your child. The number of people who actually, literally, physically can't have vaccines is extraordinarily small. The number of people who choose to not vaccinate is not--it's growing. These people cite a vague unease about the number of vaccines a child gets or statistics they learned from Internet memes on autism. They confess conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and how it's all a ploy to get doctors and pharmacists rich. They share anecdotes of a college friend's neighbor's son who got so sick from his vaccine he was hospitalized. They say their child got incredibly sick from the one round of vaccines he or she got at his 2 month visit, and they said they're not vaccinating anymore. Guess what--if your child is sitting here today, talking, walking, eating, laughing, playing, and learning, he or she wasn't that ill from the vaccine. He or she got a fever and reacted to the vaccine--it doesn't mean they had an "adverse" reaction.
I am horrified, non-vaxxers, that you are so quick to forget the lessons of history. You're spoiled and selfish because you have never seen the horrors of a society in which vaccines are not available. Perhaps you should talk to my mother about her neighbor growing up--the one who contracted German measles while pregnant with her third child. That third child was born deaf and with brain damage, thanks to his mother catching that communicable--and now preventable--disease while pregnant. Perhaps you should talk to anyone over the age of 60 about what it was like when polio was around--how nobody was allowed to go swimming or use public drinking fountains for fear of catching that dreaded--and now preventable--disease. Perhaps you should talk to the parents of a child with cancer whose daughter spent a month in the Pediatric ICU during treatment because she caught chicken pox--a preventable disease--from an unvaccinated classmate. Perhaps you should take a trip to a third world country and explain to them why they should not be lining up in droves to get their children vaccinated by the Red Cross or other relief organizations. Perhaps, better yet, you should keep your children out of school.

“He is a fool that allows his precious child, a gift from God, to be injected with poisons” - M.Grenon
Why is the Government paying compensation to vaccine injury victims?
Text of May 5th 2008 email from US HRSA to Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News]. In it the US Health Resources Services Administration [HRSA] state to CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson in response to her question about how many cases had been compensated by the US government in which a vaccine-injured child developed autistic symptoms:
We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy, or general brain disease. Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures.”
• This is the Best Explanation of the Vaccine/Autism Connection I've Ever Heard! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc
Despite all the lies and deceit by health official worldwide, the question “do vaccines cause autism” was answered after the Hannah Poling story broke in the USA in February 2008 [see CHS article here: https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/secret-british-mmr-vaccine-files-forced-open-by-legal-action/#US_Developments
Hannah developed an autistic condition after 9 vaccines administered the same day. Under the media spotlight numerous US health officials and agencies conceded on broadcast US nationwide TV news from CBS and CNN. Full details with links to the original sources can be found in this CHS article: Vaccination Causes Autism – Say US Government & Merck’s Director of Vaccines.
There are many more videos, papers, articles and research all over the internet showing the tie between vaccines and Autism. Do your "due diligence" and reasearch it before you allow your child to be vaccinated! We at the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing have exempted ourselves from the vaccine schedule the CDC or any governement agency mandated to us! We are going to protect our families from this onslot of poisoning the bodies of ALL of us!
This week on the G2VOICE Broadcast we will be not only discussing; do vaccines cause Autism? But, how to use the Genesis II Sacraments to restore health from vaccine injuries.

Those problems include cancers, auto-immune diseases, neurologic problems like autism, ADHD, and Parkinson's disease, and the most prevalent chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease….” Neides is especially concerned about the explosion in autism. Why do I mention autism now twice in this article. Because we have to wake up out of our trance and stop following bad advice. Does the vaccine burden - as has been debated for years - cause autism? I don't know and will not debate that here. What I will stand up and scream is that newborns without intact immune systems and detoxification systems are being over-burdened with PRESERVATIVES AND ADJUVANTS IN THE VACCINES. http://www.ageofautism.com/ Doctors See Link Between Vaccines and Autism Rates “We all need to be looking at improving the safety of vaccines,” says Bose Ravenel, M.D., whose practice is based in Winston Salem, North Carolina. Ravenel, 78, admits that in his long career practicing medicine he used to dismiss the idea vaccines are connected to autism or other health problems in children. But now, after attending autism conferences, researching the peer-reviewed scientific literature, and paying more attention to parents’ experiences, he has changed his mind. “There is clearly a relationship between vaccines and autism,” Ravenel says. “But to say that ‘vaccines cause autism’ is an inaccurate, non-nuanced statement. At the same time, to say that ‘vaccines don’t cause autism’ is also inaccurate. In certain conditions, like with mitochondrial dysfunction, vaccines certainly can cause autism or contribute to it.” Ravenel insists that any doctor who does the research, instead of just heedlessly following the recommendations of his professional medical organizations, will come to the same conclusion. “Any physician who would be willing to look at both sides openly and study it seriously would conclude that the idea that vaccines have been proven not to cause autism is not accurate,” Ravenel says. http://healthimpactnews.com/2016/study-unvaccinated-children-healthier-than-vaccinated-kids-doctors-agree/ Other governments tell their citizens the truth about vaccines and even take them off the vaccine program! What is up with US, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand? All the same bird! These nations do everything the same in regard to vaccines. Why? • Gov.

In the United States, however, you cannot sue the manufacturers of vaccines, as they are protected from civil criminal prosecution. As a result, marketing efforts to increase the sale and distribution of the HPV vaccine are increasing.

What do we have to lose. — Donald J.

According to incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, the two discussed “the issues pertaining to vaccines and immunizations.” Kennedy, who criticized Mr. Trump during the election campaign, has also written a book and promoted a documentary on the subject. During one showing of that documentary, according to the Sacramento Bee, Kennedy compared the damage done by vaccines to “a holocaust.” “They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,” Kennedy said at the screening in 2015. “This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.” It was a comment which he later apologized for, saying, “I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.” http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-says-hes-accepted-job-offer-from-trump/ar-BBy7z6P?ocid=ob-fb-enus-280 What is the common denominator in all vaccines and side affects TOXINS Look at the ingredients! Is it the Mercury? Aluminum? Formaldehyde? Glutamate? Squalene? Or is it a combination of all of them. Not one of these toxins should be put into a human or animal body! Here is an example of a person coming to a conclusion not based on facts about vaccines which probably caused cancer in her son! Educate before your vaccinate! An Open Letter to Non-Vaxxers: Tonight, while enjoying a nice dinner, I got a call from the director of my son's preschool. She was calling to tell me that they had made the decision to put my son in a different class because two children in the class he was supposed to be in have "opted out" of their vaccines. This may not sound like a big thing. He is still in the Tuesday-Thursday class, and since he doesn't start school until next Tuesday, it's not like he has to get readjusted to a whole new class. No harm, no foul. Actually, this is a big deal--a very big deal. You see, my son is immunocompromised. He has cancer. He was fully vaccinated and supporting the whole "herd immunity" thing before his cancer diagnosis, but that darn chemo wiped out his immunity to the communicable diseases against which he had already been vaccinated. So, parents who choose to not vaccinate because you feel it's the "right choice for your family", I would like to thank you. Thank you for adding yet another worry to my plate and my husband's plate. You see, we already worry about a lot--it's an unfortunate part of your child having cancer--you worry every night. On top of worrying about things like relapse, organ toxicity brought on by chemo, debilitating late effects of chemo, secondary cancers brought on by chemo, the mental effects of having more than three years of painful treatment, we now get to worry about, of all things, measles. And mumps. And whooping cough. And chicken pox. Your responsibility to your community is to vaccinate your child. The number of people who actually, literally, physically can't have vaccines is extraordinarily small. The number of people who choose to not vaccinate is not--it's growing. These people cite a vague unease about the number of vaccines a child gets or statistics they learned from Internet memes on autism. They confess conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and how it's all a ploy to get doctors and pharmacists rich. They share anecdotes of a college friend's neighbor's son who got so sick from his vaccine he was hospitalized. They say their child got incredibly sick from the one round of vaccines he or she got at his 2 month visit, and they said they're not vaccinating anymore. Guess what--if your child is sitting here today, talking, walking, eating, laughing, playing, and learning, he or she wasn't that ill from the vaccine. He or she got a fever and reacted to the vaccine--it doesn't mean they had an "adverse" reaction. I am horrified, non-vaxxers, that you are so quick to forget the lessons of history. You're spoiled and selfish because you have never seen the horrors of a society in which vaccines are not available. Perhaps you should talk to my mother about her neighbor growing up--the one who contracted German measles while pregnant with her third child. That third child was born deaf and with brain damage, thanks to his mother catching that communicable--and now preventable--disease while pregnant. Perhaps you should talk to anyone over the age of 60 about what it was like when polio was around--how nobody was allowed to go swimming or use public drinking fountains for fear of catching that dreaded--and now preventable--disease. Perhaps you should talk to the parents of a child with cancer whose daughter spent a month in the Pediatric ICU during treatment because she caught chicken pox--a preventable disease--from an unvaccinated classmate. Perhaps you should take a trip to a third world country and explain to them why they should not be lining up in droves to get their children vaccinated by the Red Cross or other relief organizations. Perhaps, better yet, you should keep your children out of school.

Text of May 5th 2008 email from US HRSA to Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News]. In it the US Health Resources Services Administration [HRSA] state to CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson in response to her question about how many cases had been compensated by the US government in which a vaccine-injured child developed autistic symptoms: We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy, or general brain disease. Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures.” • This is the Best Explanation of the Vaccine/Autism Connection I've Ever Heard! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc Despite all the lies and deceit by health official worldwide, the question “do vaccines cause autism” was answered after the Hannah Poling story broke in the USA in February 2008 [see CHS article here: https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/secret-british-mmr-vaccine-files-forced-open-by-legal-action/#US_Developments Hannah developed an autistic condition after 9 vaccines administered the same day.

I have not the least confidence in vaccination; it nauseates me, for it transfers often filthy and dangerous diseases from one to another, without offering any protection whatever.” https://ia600800.us.archive.org/15/items/39002086344398.med.yale.edu/39002086344398.med.yale.edu.pdf
