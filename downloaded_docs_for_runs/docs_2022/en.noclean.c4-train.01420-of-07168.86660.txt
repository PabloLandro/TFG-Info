Find Relief From Your Hemorrhoids With These Tips
November 16, 2018 February 28, 2017 by Laura
Individuals of all types suffer from hemorrhoids. Usually, people don’t know what they can do, due to the fact that they’ve never received any advice. However, this is going to change for you right now. In this article, you may be given some surprising hemorrhoid advice.
Witch hazel is a product that could help to alleviate some of the pain felt from hemorrhoids. Witch hazel has astringent properties, which causes the hemorrhoids to shrink and heal more quickly. Witch hazel can either be applied via inclusion in a sitz bath, or by direct application using a cotton ball for a few minutes.
To prevent hemorrhoids, make sure to drink plenty of water. Your stools will be softer if you are hydrated. You must also cut down on caffeine and alcohol, alike.
Adding a little lemon to your water will help ease the hemorrhoid problems that you have. Lemon juice contains nutrients that will relieve hemorrhoids by strengthening your capillaries and blood vessel walls. Drink a lot of lemon water if your hemorrhoids are irritated.
Most hemorrhoids are caused by overexerting the sphincter muscles and the muscles around them. This is why, if you repeatedly have hemorrhoids, you should not exert too much force in daily life.
Even though it is likely hemorrhoids, you should check with your doctor to confirm this. Blood in the stool or bleeding from the rectum can point to more serious causes, such as colon cancer. Getting a diagnosis can bring you peace of mind. If it does end up being hemorrhoids, your physician can direct you towards the best treatment options.
Add more high fiber foods to your diet. When you have a high dose of fiber in your diet, your stools will be a lot softer. You will find passing bowel movements easier and your hemorrhoids will not bother you as much if you do not have to push hard. Eat fruits or take fiber supplements to make it easier to pass stools.
To prevent or lessen the pain of hemorrhoids, drink plenty of water. If your body is dehydrated, it affects your stool. In turn, your stool will then harden, and going to the bathroom can become a painful experience. By drinking enough water every day, you won’t have this problem.
Don’t become dependent on laxatives. While they can certainly help those with hemorrhoid problems, they’re meant to be a one-time fix, not a cure. You can get through the next couple of days with ease when you take some laxatives, but the truth is that there are other things you must do in order to cure your hemorrhoids.
Take frequent warm baths to help alleviate hemorrhoid swelling and the pain that often accompanies it. Sitting in a bathtub with up to a foot of lukewarm water helps boost blood flow and decrease the pain that hemorrhoids can cause. As you sit in the tub, your knees should be bent. Allow plenty of time, at least until the water has begun to cool.
As you’ve read, people from all walks of life have to deal with hemorrhoids. Most people suffer in silence because they are unsure how to treat the condition. That is because they haven’t consulted doctors or online information to get advice. You can learn how to treat hemorrhoids if you use the tips that have been provided in this article.
