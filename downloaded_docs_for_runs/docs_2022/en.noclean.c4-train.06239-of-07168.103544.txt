Can Himalayan Salt Lamps Naturally Support Health & Wellness?
I'm sure you've seen the Facebook posts or perhaps you've been attracted to them on Amazon or in a local store. That warm, soothing glow is hard to ignore. But, are Himalyan Salt lamps really good for you? Yes, is the short answer. For many years, I had a retail space in a popular world market here in San Diego called Leaping Lotus. There, I sold a range of products to support emotional and spiritual healing. From Buddhas, Thai Silks and Tibetan Thankas to essential oils and aromatherapeutic bath salts to intention-setting journals and inspirational Eckhart Tolle calendars, and yes, eventually Himalayan Salt Lamps. I did a lot of research on these naturally cleansing light-bringers before adding them to my collection. See below for more information on how the lamps work and links to my top picks (mostly with free shipping through Amazon Prime)...
How Do They Work?
Not only do Himalayan Salt Lamps create a relaxing environment, but they do naturally support health and wellness, both physical and emotional. Water vapor is always circulating in the air we breathe, which can carry allergies such as dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke particles, and even bacteria and viruses.
Salt is hygroscopic attracting water molecules from the air, so a large salt rock such as a Himalayan Salt Lamp is especially attractive to water vapor and the pollutants it carries. Pollutants are attracted and remain on the lamp and create condensation, so you will find that salt lamps (if they are real) will weep and need to be maintained by gently cleaning the surface with a damp cloth once the light is off.
This one (pictured left) is about $30 with free shipping through Amazon Prime. Click here or the picture itself to open a separate window to the Amazon page.
Do Salt Lamps Generate Negative Ions?
Himalayan Salt Lamps also produce (in moderation) negative ions to help to further and naturally purify the air and neutralize technology pollution.
While the negative ion-producing benefit is not as impactful as, say, an electric negative ion-producer, this natural method has a much smaller price tag and can be very impactful, particularly when used in conjunction with diffusing pure essential oils such as those from Young Living, not to mention they are more soothing and reduce stress, promote restful sleep.
Not all salt lamps are alike, though. They must be real Himalayan Salt to have the best benefits. This one is about $69 on Amazon. Click here or the picture to learn more.
Varying Designs
Some Himalayan Salt Lamps are carved into ornate shapes, others are natural and rough. The benefits are the same, but I find that intention is important, especially if you're looking to support emotional balance, so pick what speaks to you and feels like the best choice for your space.
As a Young Living distributor, focused on helping people to discover the therapeutic benefits of pure essential oils, I, of course, am attracted to this drop shape, but I have all of these lamp styles and more.
I love surrounding myself with natural healing modalities, and for many years now, I've gotten so many positive responses to these negative ion-producers from friends visiting my home for social or oil classes. This drop-shaped lamp is available on Amazon for about $27. Click here or the picture to visit the Amazon page.
