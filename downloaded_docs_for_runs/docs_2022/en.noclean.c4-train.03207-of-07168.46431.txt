What is hydroquinone?
Hydroquinone is a prescription-only skin lightener that has been banned in several countries, including those of the European Union. Hydroquinone is an industrially produced compound that is commonly used to develop photographs. It is used in some medicines to lighten areas of human skin that have severe melanin hyperpigmentation including melasma and freckles. The FDA revoked its over-the-counter approval of hydroquinone in recent years stating that the substance cannot be ruled out as a possible carcinogen. Topical application of hydroquinone causes reversible skin-bleaching action. Once the patient experiences sufficient exposure to sunlight, repigmentation of bleached areas can occur.
How do I take hydroquinone?
You can buy hydroquinone in a tube of cream at your local pharmacy with a prescription from your doctor. If using this medication to treat a large area, it is wise to test it on a small patch of skin and wait 24 hours to see how your skin reacts. Wash and dry the area you want to treat before applying hydroquinone. Then apply a thin layer of medication to cover the area and rub it in thoroughly. Wash your hands after applying. Try to avoid getting the medication outside of the area you want to treat. Do not get hydroquinone in your eyes, ears, nose, lips or mouth. If you get hydroquinone cream on these areas, rinse it off thoroughly with water. If eye irritation persists after rinsing, contact your doctor. Do not apply this cream to broken or infected skin.
Before taking hydroquinone, tell your doctor if:
You are using other skin care products.
You are taking prescription or nonprescription drugs, herbal supplements, or herbal preparations.
You have allergic reactions to any skin products, or you are allergic to any of the ingredients in your hydroquinone cream.
You are pregnant or breast-feeding.
You suffer from eczema, psoriasis, or any other chronic skin condition.
What are the possible side effects of taking hydroquinone?
Side effects from using hydroquinone cream include a mild burning or stinging sensation, redness, or dryness at the site of application. This medication can also increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun. If you experience a rare side effect such as allergic reaction, blistering, cracking or breaking of the skin, or a blue black pigmentation of the skin, stop using the cream and contact your doctor immediately.
What if I forget to take a dose of hydroquinone?
If you forget to apply hydroquinone, apply it as soon as you remember. If it’s close to the time of your next application, skip the missed dose and continue on your regular schedule. This medication works best when applied in the morning and before bed. Do not use a double dose or two consecutive applications of this cream to compensate for a missed application.
How do I store hydroquinone?
Keep hydroquinone tightly closed in its original container. Store it away from excess heat and light. A room temperature between 59 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal. Talk to your pharmacist about the storage of your particular hydroquinone product. Keep your medication out of reach of children and pets.
What happens if I overdose on hydroquinone?
Excessive use of hydroquinone can cause severe skin irritation. This medication is for topical use only. If someone accidently ingests hydroquinone cream, contact the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Warnings
Hydroquinone increases the skin’s sensitivity to sunlight. Wear protective clothing or avoid the sun while undergoing treatment with this medication.

Brand names for hydroquinone cream include Melquin HP, Melquin-3, and Lustra. A popular combination product containing hydroquinone along with tretinoin and a corticosteroid is called Tri-Luma.
