WiFi May Be Hazardous To Your Health
Posted by naturalhealthmd on April 23, 2007
It’s convenient and widely available but a growing group of researchers warn that WiFi may be hazardous to your health.
William Stewart, the head of Britain’s Health Protection Agency, is worried that wireless Internet access may pose a health threat — particularly to children — and is privately calling for a study of the hazards of WiFi, the Independent reports.
Researchers believe that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the phones, cell-phone towers and WiFi masts are contributing to an “electric smog” that could pose a future health risk.
The researchers say this smog of electromagnetic radiation is 1 billion times stronger than the natural fields in which living cells have developed over the last 3.8 billion years. Children may be more vulnerable as their skulls are thinner and their nervous systems are still developing, not to mention that they’ll be exposed to more radiation over their lifetime
The Austrian Medical Association is just one group that wants to keep WiFi out of the classroom, the Independent reports.
The head of environmental health and medicine in the province of Salzburg calls WiFi “dangerous” to sensitive people. “The number of people and the danger are both growing,” Dr. Gerd Oberfeld said.
The World Health Organization says that three out of every 100 people are “electrosensitive,” the paper reports.
In Britain, a lawmaker from the wireless city of Norwich is calling for an official inquiry into WiFi’s risks and the nation’s Professional Association of Teachers is lobbying Britain’s education secretary for one, as well.
“I am concerned that so many wireless networks are being installed in schools and colleges without any understanding of the possible long-term consequences,” said Philip Parkin, the association’s general secretary. “The proliferation of wireless networks could be having serious implications for the health of some staff and pupils without the cause being recognized.”

Mercury Part 2
Posted by naturalhealthmd on April 23, 2007
Breaking News about Mercury Amalgam Fillings and Chronic Mercury Poisoning – Page 2
Mercury Emissions: Poisoning our Air, Water, Soil, and Food
We know that high amounts of mercury are found in the fossil fuels; oil, gas and coal. But the problem isn’t that mercury is found in fossil fuels but that it is released into the atmosphere when it is burned. Mercury is the only toxic heavy metal that is a liquid at room temperature and vaporizes as the temperature increases. Once in the air it can be moved over vast distances by air currents.
The Importance of Reducing Mercury Emissions
Mercury is one of the most poisonous substances on our planet, much more poisonous than arsenic, lead, or cadmium. Living downwind from any facility that releases mercury into the air will expose you in many ways. First, you can inhale it from the polluted air. Second, airborne mercury will eventually find its way into the soil, rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Of course, the concentrations will be greatest in the area closest to power plants burning fossil fuel. Once the airborne mercury has returned to earth, microorganisms in the soil and water readily convert it to its most toxic form, organic mercury (commonly known as methylmercury). Once this poisonous form of mercury enters the food chain, it can be ingested and readily assimilated into the body from the intestine. Regardless of how mercury enters the body mercury, it will cause harm in extraordinarily small amounts. Mercury poisons everyone, but is especially toxic to the fetus, nursing baby, and young child.
Mercury Emissions and Silver Amalgam Dental Fillings
There is no doubt that it is critically important to our health to eliminate any toxic substance that enters our environment, but there is absolutely no excuse for our government not to protect us from a substance as poisonous as mercury. Not only can mercury from power plant emissions enter and accumulate in the body, but mercury from the environment and food is not our only source of exposure.
Environmental mercury, as serious a health hazard as it is, pales in comparison with the daily amount of mercury people with silver amalgam fillings receive. For those with these toxic amalgam dental fillings any additional exposure to mercury increases the risk to their health. This is even more important for a pregnant or nursing mother.
