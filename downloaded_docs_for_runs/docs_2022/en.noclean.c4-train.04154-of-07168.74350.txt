Dark Chocolate Improves Night Vision -- and More!

Nope, the title to this hub is not a mistake. This research project has brought some interesting results. First the information I found on carrots, and then I will get to the new findings on chocolate . . . yes, chocolate! Chocolate can improve your eyesight!! And that’s not all.
Can carrots make your eyesight better? Some people think they can while other people think not. I have been told all of my life that eating carrots will make my eyesight better. Recently a friend told me that generally accepted belief had turned out to be wrong. My friend told me that the generally accepted belief that carrots can improve a person's eyesight, and especially their night vision, had been debunked.
Since I know carrots contain beta-carotene (learned that in my nutrition class at the university), and that beta-carotene can be turned into vitamin A by the liver, and that vitamin A is directly related to healthy eyes and eyesight, in my mind I questioned my friend’s statement. Then an idea for a new hub was born!
Carrots provide important nutrients for you whole body, especially your eyes. | Source
Dark chocolate that is at least 70% cocoa is good for your eyes and for your brain. | Source
Vitamin A Is An Important Ingredient In Your Diet
Vitamin A has always been considered important for a lot of things, but it is believed to contribute especially to good eye health and vision. I did not challenge my friend’s statement at the time -- that eating carrots had no effect on eyesight. Instead, I decided I would research whether or not it was still considered true that carrots do in fact improve a person’s eyesight. I just wanted to see if something had changed since I took that nutrition class at the university nearly 10 years ago.
Yes, believe it or not, things that have been considered scientific facts for a long time are sometimes changing as new information is discovered. Our new and improved technology is making it possible to learn more details about things we thought we knew, and sometimes that means modifying or completely changing what were previously thought to be scientific facts. So rather than arguing with my friend, I decided to do a little research to see what I would find.
Most eye specialists still agree that carrots can improve nutrition, which in turn will improve eyesight – if that vision problem is attributable to poor nutrit
“According to Dr Amy Chow, O.D, an eye doctor at Cupertino Family Eye Care Center, carrots can improve your eyesight. They contain beta-carotene, which is turned into vitamin A by the liver. The vitamin A is absorbed by retinal cells in the eyes so you can see,” (Robbertt).
Professor Algis Vingrys of the University of Melbourne's Department of Optometry and Vision Services, is reported on ABC’s Health and Well Being blog as saying, “A diet with sufficient vitamin A, iron and other provitamins (substances that our bodies can convert into vitamins) is vital for eye health, (Ryan).
According to Professor Vingrys, night blindness may be the first sign of vitamin A deficiency, and that vitamin A deficiency is usually quite severe by the time night blindness is noticed as a problem by an individual. He also says eating carrots can improve night vision if you have a vitamin A deficiency, but if your diet is already balanced, eating more carrots will have no affect.
Cheryl Murphy, Optometrist, writing on the Scientific American blog, expresses it somewhat differently. She agrees that proper nutrition is important for healthy eyes and can even help slow the advancement of certain eye conditions and diseases like cataracts and macular degeneration, but she says there is no magical cure for the need for glasses or contacts.
Carrots Can Improve a Person’s Eyesight
So it turns out that carrots can help a person’s eyesight, because vitamin A (manufactured by the human body from beta carotene) directly effects eye health, vision, and night vision. Carrots are a good source of beta carotene, so they are a good way to get the necessary vitamin A your body needs to be healthy -- not limited to just effecting your vision.
In fact, according to the experts in vision that I found listed on the Internet, and there are many more than I have listed in my reference section, if one is deficient in vitamin A, then eating carrots can improve one’s vision and one’s health generally. Will eating carrots improve a person’s eyesight to the point where they will no longer require corrective lenses? Not likely.
More About the Benefits of Dark Chocolate
Benefits Of Dark Chocolate
Dark Chocolate is the healthiest of all the types of chocolates. To know all about chocolates and the benefits of dark chocolate, read on...
Chocolate Lovers Rejoice! Dark Chocolate Improves Eyesight!
Interestingly, Cheryl Murphy talks about a study that was done this last May on the effect of cocoa flavanols. The study found that persons who consumed dark chocolate showed improvement in both cognitive and visual performance in as little as two hours after eating the dark chocolate!
So, what it seems to boil down to is that carrots are a good source of beta-carotene, which the human body turns into vitamin A, which in turn contributes to better overall heath as well as healthy eyes and better night vision.
Eating carrots can help improve your vision if your vision is defective because of poor nutrition, but if your poor vision is a result of genetics, or some other cause than poor nutrition, eating carrots is not likely to help.
More studies are needed according to Cheryl Murphy, but it is looking like eating dark chocolate may actually help improve your eyesight more than carrots do! How long before mothers everywhere are saying to their children, “Finish your chocolate Sweetheart, so you will grow strong and have good eyesight!”

Patricia (pstraubie48), thank you for reading and voting on and sharing this article! Thank you for the angels also, and may there be plenty more to be with you and your loved ones at all times.
In fact carrots are still very helpful to sight, day and night sight, and dark chocolate is even better, so your idea of dipping carrots in dark chocolate is an excellent one. At the same time, dark chocolate makes the brain operate more clearly and thinking becomes easier and better. Lots of benefits from eating the very dark chocolate, at least 70% cocoa. :)

My solution will be to eat carrots slathered with dark chocolate.
Thanks for the heads up.
I am often amused when we are told that something we believed as true is said to be not true. I just wonder how many years it will be till the pendulum swings the other way
I guess we just need to eat healthy all the way around and that should cover it.
Gotta' share this...it will make a lot of people happy
Angels are on the way to you ps

Am finding it difficult to believe I am just now seeing this. Perhaps I was interrupted by a call when I first saw it, but I suspect I may have decided to go for my daily dose of dark chocolate which often requires a cup of coffee on the front porch which can lead to a neighbor stopping in and by then I might have forgotten to come back to this interesting hub. Anyway, that chocolate has more benefits than carrots is not common knowledge. Oh to be a kid in such a day as you predict! Also, we may have to stock up and hide stashes once rabbits get wind of this… :)

Thank you Aunt Jimi, for commenting, and for the votes and share too. Yes, I read in my research that dark chocolate, at least 70% cocoa actually improves cognition more than night vision. I should probably eat more of it myself . . . ;)

This is wonderful news and information. I love carrots, but it's good to know dark chocolate is good for a person too. Seems like every time I turn around I'm reading that dark chocolate is good for something else. This is the first I've heard about it improving one's eyesight and cognitive abilities. Maybe if I eat enough of it I'll get smarter! Voted up and interesting, awesome. Will share, too.

moonlake, thank you for reading and commenting on this hub. Carrots are good, but it turns our chocolate is better for night vision and important brain functions. So unless you're allergic to dark chocolate or just hate it, try to work a little more of it into your diet every now and then to get all the benefits you can -- just a suggestion . . . ;)
Sorry it's taken me so long to address my comments, but work takes every bit of time during the week and every bit of energy -- and now I'm sicker n' a dog with chills and the whole 9 yards (for the last 4 days actually). Been in bed most of the day and now trying to stay warm while I try to get to at least a few comments. I'm always slow because of time constraints, but now has been even tougher. Even so, I appreciate very much that you and all my readers take the time to read and comment on my hubs.

Thank you for your comments Shyron. I wish you could enjoy chocolate too! Have you tried the 70% or more cocoa chocolate that gives all the health benefits? Could that darkest of chocolates have a different effect than the milk chocolate so many people favor?
I know people are more likely to get horrific hangovers and headaches from cheap alcohol (scientifically proven), so maybe it's the same with chocolate. Eat the high quality stuff and maybe it will have a completely different physical affect from what you have gotten from the lower quality (not 70% cocoa) chocolate. Just a thought . . .

Hi Jen! Glad to see that you checked this article out on carrots & dk chocolate. Yes, pretty interesting that one can get so many good benefits from eating dark chocolate and they kick in pretty quickly after eating it too. I think eating some before studying for and again before taking an exam might not do any harm. Would be interesting to see if it made a difference. Thank you for reading & commenting, Jen!

What a surprise to learn that dark chocolate improves night vision and cognitive ability too. I'm putting dark chocolate on my shopping list. I won't forget to make sure it's 70% cocoa. So nice to have chocolate on the list of foods that are healthy for a person.
