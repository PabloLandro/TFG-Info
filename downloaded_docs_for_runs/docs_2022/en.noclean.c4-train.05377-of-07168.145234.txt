After Tooth Extraction
After tooth extraction, it’s important for a blood clot to form to stop the bleeding and begin the healing process. That’s why we ask you to bite on a gauze pad for 30-45 minutes after the appointment. If the bleeding or oozing still persists, place another gauze pad and bite firmly for another 30 minutes. You may have to do this several times. If you feel bleeding is excessive after six hours, bite on a moistened tea bag for thirty minutes, the tannic acid in the tea helps to form a clot by contracting bleeding vessels.
After the blood clot forms, it is important not to disturb or dislodge the clot as it aids healing. Do not rinse vigorously, suck on straws, smoke, drink alcohol or brush teeth next to the extraction site for 72 hours. These activities will dislodge or dissolve the clot and retard the healing process. Limit vigorous exercise for the next 24 hours as this will increase blood pressure and may cause more bleeding from the extraction site.
After the tooth is extracted you may feel some pain and experience some swelling. An ice pack or an unopened bag of frozen peas or corn applied to the area will keep swelling to a minimum. Take pain medications as prescribed. The swelling usually subsides after 48 hours.
For pain control, we recommend the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as Ibuprofen / Motrin, 800 mg by mouth 3 times a day. For smaller adults, 600 mg is recommended. Other medications such as Aleve, Naprosyn and Advil can be used instead as directed. Take these types of medications as soon as you arrive home and have had something to drink. Continue its use for 72 hours while awake. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended. Do not take Motrin or Ibuprofen if you have experienced an allergic reaction to these medications in the past. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection are gone. Drink lots of fluid and eat nutritious soft food on the day of the extraction. You can eat normally as soon as you are comfortable.
It is important to resume your normal dental routine after 24 hours. This should include brushing and flossing your teeth at least once a day. This will speed healing and help keep your mouth fresh and clean.
After a few days, you will feel fine and can resume your normal activities. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain, continued swelling for 2-3 days, or a reaction to the medication, call our office immediately at South Orlando Phone Number 407-351-0575.
