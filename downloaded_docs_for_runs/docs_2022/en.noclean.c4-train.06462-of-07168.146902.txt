Morphine Addiction
What is morphine and why is it so addictive?
The painkiller morphine is by far one of the most powerfully addictive and psychoactive drugs on the streets today. It is often referred to as the prototype of opioids which partially explains why it is so addictive and why a tolerance to the drug builds up so quickly. Other examples of semi-synthetic opioid medications include OxyContin, Percocet, and Percodan, all of which exhibit highly addictive qualities. The onset of dependency results from the fact that tolerances to the drug build up rapidly.
Morphine addiction is both physical and mental because of the way in which it creates an artificial euphoric feeling in the person. Greater cravings result with increased doses as the individual attempts to achieve the high they did initially. Morphine is characterized by the way it inhibits a person’s ability to think properly and be aware of their surroundings. It renders the individual less conscious and impairments of this nature can be potentially harmful, especially when driving a vehicle.
Symptoms of morphine abuse or overdose
There are numerous signs and symptoms that are indicative of the presence of morphine abuse, addiction, and/or dependency which include:
dilated or “pinpoint” pupils
drowsiness or sleepiness
fingernails and lips that have a bluish hue
fluid build-up in the lungs
nausea and vomiting
respiratory difficulties
skin that is clammy and cold
Morphine overdose can easily be fatal or result in the individual becoming comatose, hence the number of fatalities that occur each year. Morphine is also a concern of the DEA where primary drug threats in the US are concerned. Additionally, morphine addiction poses a serious public health threat according to health organizations and medical professionals.
