Oncologists Don’t Like Baking Soda Cancer Treatment Because It’s Too Effective and Too Cheap
HFS TIPS November 24, 2016
Facts say that 9 out of 10 cancer patients choose chemotherapy without even considering other less invasive options. Even though the vast majority of us know that chemotherapy is toxic to all cells, it represents the only measure that oncologists employ in their practice in most cancer cases.
Then, why would chemotherapy be the most popular treatment, actually, why is it still used at all? The answer is simple: because pharmaceutical companies and doctors earn from it. The reason is not that it has some beneficial effects, not that it decreases morbidity, mortality or diminishes any specific cancer rates. It does the opposite, actually. Even oncologists know that chemotherapy boosts cancer growth and long-term mortality rates.
There are other options that we may choose to treat Cancer. The best way surgeons would suggest (as they love to cut), is surgery. This is true if the cancer cells are localized in a specific part of your body. Radiation therapy is another way to deal with it, in fact this is now the most common way to treat cancer. As our world revolves, advancements in medicine takes a new level of learning and therefore, more advanced way of treating Illnesses. Some of the new treatments introduced to treat cancer are Photodynamic Therapy, Targeted Therapy, Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunotherapy and a lot more.
These technological advancements may be on their way to finding the real cure for the most feared disease of all time. That is inevitably, partially true. However, until the curator of Cancer is born, we can’t all be sure of all of its effects, can we? So, how about we step down a notch and go back to where medicine originated. Let’s go back to all natural, than chemical- with the use of Baking Soda.
In one 2009 study, published in journal called “Cancer research” the results from one testing made quite an impression with fact that baking soda is really helpful and indeed is raising the pH and reducing the metastases.
Also it reduces the environment of the lymph and did not spread the cancer cells to other organs.
Baking soda as treatment for cancer, Dr. Sircus explained the treatment in one of his books, presented by one of his patients who had a fight with prostate cancer which was mediatized to his bones.
The patient on the first day mixed 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of molasses in a cup of water.
He took this for another 3 days after which his saliva pH read 7.0 and his urine pH read 7.5.
Stunned by the results, the patient took the solution 2 times on day 5 instead of once daily. And from day 6 — 10, he took 2 teaspoons each of baking soda and molasses twice daily.
By the 10th day, the patient’s pH had risen to 8.5. The only side effects he had were headaches and night sweat.
After that the patient had a bone scan and too other medical tests. The results showed that his PSA (prostate-specific antigen, the protein used to determine the severity of prostate enlargement and prostate cancer) level was down from 22.3 at the point of diagnosis to 0.1.
Another baking soda formula recommends mixing 90 teaspoons of maple syrup with 30 teaspoons of baking soda.
To do this, the maple syrup must be heated to become less viscous. Then the baking syrup is added and stirred for 5 minutes until it is fully dissolved.
This preparation should provide about 10-day worth of the baking soda remedy. 5 – 7 teaspoons per day is the recommended dose for cancer patients.
Care ought to be taken when utilizing the baking soda remedy for treat cancer. This is on the grounds that sustaining a high pH level can itself bring about metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte irregularity. These can bring about edema furthermore influence the heart and pulse.
Preferably, you ought to counsel a specialist before starting with the baking soda solution.
