Is Pink Himalayan Salt Really Good for You?
The Answer to This Is Yes &...Well, No?
Both table salt and pink Himalayan salt consist mostly of sodium chloride, but pink Himalayan salt has up to 84 other minerals and trace elements!
This salt is recognised for its beautiful pink colour, high mineral content, and its therapeutic properties.
Salt is often a hotly debated topic in the natural health community & we'll explore WHY in this blog post...
SALT = MONEY
It was literally once worth its weight in gold!
Yes, it is SO important to our health & longevity that has been used in multiple cultures & throughout history as currency.
Think about it like this; the human body has all these little "tradesmen" inside of them that create life, balance the body, take things apart & put things together on a consistent basis...they're called enzymes. Without enzymes, there's no life. Without minerals there's no enzymatic activity.
The 84 trace minerals we get from natural salt are like keys to unlock enzyme activity. Technically speaking they are called "cofactors" and they have the ability to turn on, or up, more enzymatic activity. This helps everything in your body from a faster metabolism, to the colour of your hair, to expressing more DNA, to your cleansing, healing and repair mechanisms.
Here's some benefits you can find with regular consumption of natural salt containing ALL its essential minerals and trace elements:
Balances Electrolytes
Increases Hydration
Increases Metabolism
Increases DNA Expression
Supports Proper Nutrient Absorption
Eliminates Toxins
Balance Hormones
Increase Cell Communication
Increase Insulin Sensitivity
Balances the Body’s pH
Normalises blood pressure, and increases circulation and conductivity.
It can also assist with relief from arthritis, skin rashes, psoriasis, herpes, and flu and fever symptoms.

If it's so good for us, then WHY does everyone tell me to stay away from it?
Because of the toxic load, lack of trace minerals and denaturing that most commercially available salt has.
You see, man-made table salt is not the same as mineral-rich natural salt. Real salt has many important roles in the body and avoiding it can be problematic.
AND even if you are getting "natural salt" depending on where it comes from, it could be LOADED with toxic chemicals.
Let's take a closer look...
TABLE SALT
Table Salt, which is 97% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is chemically produced, bleached and devoid of most other nutrients. They cook it at such high temperatures that it "denatures" the minerals and renders them useless, which throws the whole body's electrolyte balance off.
Lastly, they add anti-caking agents like; anti-caking agent (554), which is sodium aluminosilicate, a man-made product that increases heavy metal toxicity.
To make matters worse, during the mining process explosives are used and then the salt is chemically cleaned, leaving traces of pollutants like plastic, cyanide, aluminium and many others.
SEA SALT
Depending on the water source many sea salts contain petrochemicals, radioactive waste, heavy metals and others. During the mining process many evaporated salts from the oceans or saltwater lakes are chemically refined at high temperatures removing most trace minerals.
Choose your Sea Salt wisely.
HIMALAYAN or PINK SALT
Around 250 million years ago crystallised sea salt beds, now deep within the Himalayans, were covered by a protective layer of lava. This shielding layer of lava is believed to provide a protective barrier from modern-day pollution and many experts claim that the Traditional Himalayan Pink Salt is the purest salt found on earth. The varied hues of pink, red and white are an indication of this salt’s rich and varying mineral and energy-rich iron content.
This pure pink salt from the Himalayas gains its mineral richness from marine fossil deposits, there's no comparison to the many health benefits of this beautiful pink salt has opposed to common table salt.
Many pink salts come from South America, Australia, Poland or Pakistan. While the a great majority of them still contain all 84 trace minerals, it's the area that they originate from and the mining process that makes a BIG difference.
HERE'S WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD...
The wise consumer knows that not all Himalayan Pink Salt is equal.
Most pink Himalayan salt today comes from the bottom of the mountains in Pakistan where it is industrially mined, often using explosives in an area that collects pollutants like contains bromine and many other heavy metals. These salts are may be artificially coloured as well.
