Avoid Mosquito Bites while Traveling

Traveling? Don’t let mosquitoes ruin your vacation.
If you are planning a trip, do your homework before traveling! Learn how to keep yourself and your family healthy during and after your trip. Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses are all spread by mosquito bites. Anyone who lives in or travels to an area where these viruses are found and has not already been infected is at risk.
Getting infected with dengue or chikungunya can make you sick and if you are pregnant, Zika infection could threaten your pregnancy. The best way to prevent getting sick is to protect yourself from mosquito bites.
What is Zika?
Zika is a virus primarily spread to people through mosquito bites. Zika can also be spread by an infected person to his or her sex partners. A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth. Zika can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects. The most common symptoms of
Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). Many people who get infected won’t know it. For people who do get sick, the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week.
What is Dengue?
Dengue is another common viral infection found throughout the Americas. There is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat dengue. Symptoms of dengue begin with high fever, and may also include severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, joint pain, muscle and bone pain, rash, and mild bleeding (e.g., nose or gums bleed; unusual bruising). Most people will recover after about a week, but sometimes dengue can become a serious or even fatal. Severe dengue is an emergency and requires hospitalization.
Stay Healthy During Your Trip
The mosquitoes that spread the chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses bite during the day and night. The best way to prevent getting sick is to protect yourself from mosquito bites with QM mosquito trap.
