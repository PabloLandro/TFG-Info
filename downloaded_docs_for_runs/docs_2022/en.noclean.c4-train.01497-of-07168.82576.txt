Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are invisible areas of energy, known by most of us as radiation, that have been found to cause great harm to the human body. I am not just talking about nuclear fallout, but importantly, cell phone use, WIFI technology, cordless phones, clock radios, hair dryers, X-rays, radiotherapy, air travel-associated radiation, and other exposures that pose day-to-day radiation toxicity. Sadly, we are all exposed to ionizing radiation and could be potentially at increased risk for adverse health effects.
Ionizing radiation causes damage by producing free radicals like reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can randomly react with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids of cells causing oxidative stress and damage which can lead to molecular and cellular damage. Oxidative stress is considered one of the major factors connected with increased cancer risk and is implicated in cardiovascular events, osteoporosis, male infertility, and more.
Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation can result in increased rates of genetic mutations. DNA damage caused by oxidative stress may lead to mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes.[i]
In addition to free radical production, another source of indirect post-irradiation toxicity is inflammatory processes. Radiation-induced damage initiates long-term pro-inflammatory reactions in the surrounding tissue. Exposure to large amounts of ionizing radiation could result in a severe inflammation reaction causing irreparable damage to various tissue and organs, particularly in the heart, lungs and kidneys.
In an attempt to minimize these effects, a small number of compounds in plants have been identified for use as agents that offer some protection against radiation-induced toxicities, and many more are being investigated. These effects are possibly due to free radical scavenging, antioxidant, metal chelating, immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and enhancement of the DNA repair processes. Also likely is that certain substances are able to absorb strong energies such as EMFs and convert them into less reactive forms.
The Role of Radioprotectants:
The need for protection against the toxic effects of ionizing radiation comes from many different directions: occupational exposure, nuclear accidents, environmental sources, the use of cell phones and other devices, and protection of normal tissue during the therapeutic irradiation of cancer. No matter the source, radioprotectants are important in protecting cells from deleterious radiation-induced side effects.
Radio-protectors are agents that protect the body’s cells and tissues from the undesirable effects of radiation by scavenging radiation-induced free radicals. In the past, synthetic radio-protectors were found to help mitigate or minimize the life-threatening effects of radiation, but they were not put clinical use due to undesirable side effects and inherent toxicity, such as hypotension, vomiting, nausea, sneezing, hot flashes, etc.[ii] Therefore, the exploration of radio-protectors with less toxicity became essential.
The first line of defense from the damaging effects of ROS is antioxidants, which convert strong oxidants to less reactive forms. Antioxidants can minimize the damaging effects of ROS by converting strong oxidants to less reactive forms. For example, the powerful antioxidant lycopene can protect and repair cellular damage from free-radicals, including those induced from ionizing radiation.[iii] This suggests that supplementation of lycopene might be useful in diminishing of negative effect of cancer radiotherapy or in mitigating the effects of possible radiation accidents and exposures on human health. Red fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes (especially when cooked), watermelons, red peppers, pink grapefruits, apricots, pink guavas, dragon fruit, and papaya contain lycopene.
Studies confirm that lycopene and other compounds in fruits, vegetables and associated dietary supplements reduce risk of cancer and inhibit the growth of tumors. Research also shows that nutraceuticals have protective effects against other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, male infertility. These results could be in part due to their protection against damage induced by ionizing radiation, offering yet another reason to consume them copiously.
N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC) helps to replenish intracellular glutathione, a vital cellular antioxidant. Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) also helps boost glutathione levels (see below for more substances that boost glutathione).
Another substance, melanin, has shown to offer radioprotective properties and is being studied. It is already well known for protecting human skin from UV radiation. While found in foods such as seaweed, eggs, cheese, fish (rich sources of tyrosine, an amino acid that aids in the production of melanin), it is most abundantly found in mushrooms, particularly Chaga mushrooms. Compounds in melanin absorb electromagnetic radiation and help deactivate radioactive isotopes, converting them into benign forms.[iv]
To keep this post short and sweet, I have referenced some studies rather than get into depth on them all, but have included some highlights below. This list is not inclusive, but rather illustrative of how eating a significant amount of fruits and vegetables, and at times supplements, throughout the day can be radio-protective (Click on the highlights for a few brand recommendations for supplements–widely available in most stores).
Lycopene [v]
Chaga[vi]
Flaxseed[vii]
Blueberries[viii]
Mint[ix]
Black current[x]
Green and black tea[xi]
Citrus extract[xii]
Apple pectin[xiii]
DIM[xiv]
Buckwheat[xv]
Astragalus[xvi]
Fun Facts:
Lycopene reduces the negative effect of cancer radiotherapy and other sources of radiation exposure, especially in advance of exposure.
Compounds in Chaga mushroom absorb electromagnetic radiation and help deactivate radioactive isotopes, converting them into benign forms.[xvii]
Flaxseed, already known for its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, works as both a mitigator and protector against radiation exposure, including regarding pneumopathy. It not only protects lung tissues before exposure to radiation, but can also significantly reduce damage after exposure occurs.[xviii]
The protection afforded by flaxseed may be attributed to the omega-3 essential fatty acids and phytoestrogenic lignans, which appear to play an important role in free radical scavenging.[xix]
Asparagus are high in glutathione and also selenium and zinc, which also help you make glutathione are protective against EMFs.
Olive oil and cruciferous vegetables (in particular the sulfur/sulforophane in these veggies) boosts glutathione.
Blueberries contain delphinidin, which has strong antioxidant properties that scavenge radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), making them protective against a wide scope of radiation exposures.
Radioprotectors such as delphinidin used during cancer radiotherapy could offer some protection to normal tissues around a cancerous tumor, which are unintentionally exposed to radiation during traditional and proton radiotherapy[xx]
Blueberry anthocyanins inhibit cell apoptosis and reduce the radiation injury by decreasing gene and protein expression of p53 and other proteins that regulate cancer cell division, growth, and death.[xxi]
Apple pectin aids in removing radionuclides, with one study showing a 62% reduction in radionuclides in treated children from the Chernobyl area and another with a 28-39% reduction after just 16 days, improving cardiovascular health in the children.[xxii]
Flavonoids in fruits and vegetables offer a variety of beneficial properties including protection from ionizing radiation, DNA protection, immune system protection, hemopoietic system protection, scavenging of free radicals, antioxidant properties, antitumor properties, antiviral properties, antibacterial properties, and anti-inflammatory properties.[xxiii]
Intravenous administration of melanin-coated nanospheres has demonstrated protection of bone marrow against radiotoxicity during radioimmunotherapy of cancer. [xxiv]
Buckwheat flavonoid offer radio-protective mechanisms on the hematopoietic (bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes) and immune systems[xxv]
Plant compounds offer substantial protection and do not appear to interfere with therapeutic radiotherapy.
DIM may protect against ionizing radiation taken before or up to 24 hours after radiation and does not protect breast cancer tumors against radiotherapy.[xxvi]
Importantly, many compounds, such as the antioxidants lycopene and delphinidin need to be taken before exposure, which means it is best to consume these on a regular basis. Enjoy in abundance tomatoes (especially cooked), blueberries, dragon fruit, mint (fresh or tea), apples, flax seed, green tea, and others. Buckwheat is quite versatile and is naturally gluten-free –try this delicious flatbread recipe.
Regarding Radiation Therapy for Cancer Treatment
Radiation therapy is a highly utilized therapy in the treatment of malignancies with up to 60% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy as a part of their treatment regimen. However, the radiation-induced damage to the normal tissues often restricts the therapeutic doses of radiation that can be delivered to tumors and thereby limits the effectiveness of the treatment[xxvii] Notably, researchers have found that there are numerous substances that are radio-protective and yet do not interfere with therapeutic radiotherapy.[xxviii] Unfortunately, not all radiation oncologists recommend such substances, so it is imperative that you seek help from a qualified professional.
Radiation therapy does, however, cause a wide range of adverse effects that can be severe and cause permanent damage to the patient.[xxix] Radiotherapy also does not target cancer stem cells and can actually make them more aggressive.
Radio-protective Devices
If you don’t see yourself consuming radio-protective foods and supplements on a regular basis or feel that you are particularly exposed (aren’t we all?) you may want to take advantage of the plethora of devices that offer EMF protection. There are also many lovely and inexpensive shungite pendants and bracelets available online that help balance energy, as well as other items that can be attached to your cell phone, hair dryer, clock, laptop, etc., and to your own jewelry. Please note that since my previous post, Aries Tech has discontinued their older generation Aires Black Crystal and Aires Defender and replaced them with more effective and powerful protection, all made in the EU.
Aires Shield Pro – Powerful enough for all devices from phones to large smart TVs. [Aries Shield Pro]
Aires Defender Pro – To be used on the person for full body protection. [Defender]
Aires Guardian – To be used in all areas of a typical home or office as an area protector. [Guardian]

Can Cell Phones Cause Cancer, Infertility; Are Our Children at Risk?
In Uncategorized on August 21, 2012 at 11:28 pm
Cell phones; we can’t live without them, but are they safe for you, for your children? Can they cause cancer, infertility? Contrary to firmly held beliefs, invisible radio frequency radiation can alter living cells and increase the risk of cancer and neurological disease. If it were true, we’d know about it; such a logical statement. We all have cell phones and if the FDA and others had reason to think they are unsafe, they would tell us, right? No. And I guess the last thing the cell phone industry wants is for us to know about the serious biological damage radiation is causing.
Today, on Survive and Live Well, I had a great discussion on this topic with Dr Devra Davis. Dr Davis gave clarity to the issue of radiation, and offered suggestions on how to reduce risk from not just cell phones, but also the cordless and wireless technology we all know and love.
Cell phones are two-way microwave radio that changes brain cells and alters glucose levels (the brain’s main fuel). Since a brain tumor utilizes excessive amounts of glucose, changes in glucose utilization may be a key mechanism to support tumor growth. Even short-term exposure to nerve cells from cell phones can increase glucose in the brain. Thankfully, our DNA works to repair and prevent damage to our cells from becoming permanent. So, if the body is capable of repairing itself, then why worry? The system can fail, become overwhelmed, and cancers develop. However, and you knew this was coming, a diet rich in antioxidants is an excellent tool for combating or minimizing the damage from radiation (cell phone, dental, scan-related, etc). Remember, that distance is your friend. Do not carry your phone on your body or place it against your head. Use handsets and speaker phones, and do not use your phone when the signal is weak. Set your phone to airplane mode when not in use.
Medical science now understands that because the causes of chronic diseases can take decades to be detected (sometimes up to 40 years, as in the case of brain cancer), we should not wait for definitive human evidence. It is better to prevent harm than wait for proof that harm has happened. In fact, there are a few dozen compounds that we know cause cancer in humans, and these cancers developed after years of exposure (think tobacco, asbestos)…I, for one, do not wish to be the proverbial guinea pig, and our children are not to be science experiments.
Please donate today to further the research. Pick up a copy of Disconnect…I promise you, you will be inspired, informed, and armed with the information you need to protect yourselves and your children. Knowledge is indeed power; I sincerely hope that we have empowered you.

Join us Tuesday, August 28st, as I chat with John Coleman, who lost his youngest son to testicular cancer. John works tirelessly to bring awareness of early detection of testicular cancer to the forefront. Likely radiation is playing a role here too, so let’s get those cell phones out of our pockets. We will also chat with Rachel Papas when she talks about her experience with breast cancer, mental illness, and what she learned and what you can learn from her.
You can listen live, Tuesday at 1pm, on http://www.W4CS.com, the internet radio show for cancer.
