#012: Why Pulsed Microwave Frequencies are More Harmful.
by magda
Updated: July 7, 2018
Why pulsed microwave frequencies are more harmful than continuous waves and why we should care. As I read the documents from Dr. Glaser’s archives, I can’t help but think that we are being “dummified”. It seems we know… Read More

#011: Potentially Harmful Radio Frequencies used in the Packaging and Food Industry.
by magda
Updated: July 7, 2018
Few people realize that radio frequencies (RF) are currently used in the manufacturing industry to mold plastics for car parts, vinyl fabrics, and food packaging. In fact this industry used the first incarnation of the “microwave” oven that… Read More
