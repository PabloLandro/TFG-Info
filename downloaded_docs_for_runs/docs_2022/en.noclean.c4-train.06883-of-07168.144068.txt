After Tooth Extraction
After tooth extraction, it’s important for a blood clot to form to stop the bleeding and begin the healing process. That’s why we ask you to bite on a gauze pad for 60 minutes after the appointment. If the bleeding or oozing still persists, place another gauze pad and bite firmly for another 45-60 minutes. You may have to do this several times. If you are actively bleeding with the gauze in place and/or the gauze is saturated with blood, may not have the gauze in the correct position. If the gauze is just between the teeth and not putting pressure on the extraction site you will bleed around the gauze. The gauze needs to be directly over the extraction site. Pressure stops bleeding! A moistened teabag can also be used to apply pressure to the extraction site. Tea has tannic acid in it which causes blood to clot.
After the blood clot forms, it is important not to disturb or dislodge the clot as it aids healing. Do not rinse vigorously, suck on straws, smoke, drink alcohol or brush teeth next to the extraction site for 72 hours. These activities will dislodge or dissolve the clot and retard the healing process. It is important to keep food and debris from accumulating in the extraction site. Beginning 8 hours after your surgery, you may begin to use warm salt water rinses, 1/2 teaspoon table salt in 8 oz. of warm water. Use the salt water rinse after every meal. Rinse gently the first three days.
Limit vigorous exercise for the next 24 hours as this will increase blood pressure and may cause more bleeding from the extraction site. If bleeding restarts, replace the gauze and bite with firm pressure for another 60 minutes.
After the tooth is extracted you may feel some discomfort and experience some swelling. An ice pack or an unopened bag of frozen peas or corn applied to the area will keep swelling to a minimum and decrease the discomfort. The swelling usually peaks at 48 to 72 hours.
Use the pain medication as directed. Do not drive or operate dangerous after taking a narcotic pain medication. Call the office if the medication doesn’t seem to be working. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection are gone. An antimicrobial mouth rinse, chorhexidine, may be prescribe and should be used the evening of the surgery and continued twice a day for one week after the surgery.
Drink lots of fluid and eat nutritious soft food on the day of the extraction. You can eat normally as soon as you are comfortable. It is probably best to avoid hard, crunchy foods and spicy hot foods the first week after surgery.
It is important to resume your normal dental routine within 24 hours. This should include brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. This will speed healing and help keep your mouth fresh and clean.
After a few days you will feel fine and can resume your normal activities. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain, continued swelling swelling after 3-4 days, temperature > 102 or a reaction to the medication, call our office immediately at Cincinnati Office Phone Number (513) 451-7300/ (812) 539-4105 (800) 272- 2978.
