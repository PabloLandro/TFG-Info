Home » How to Get Rid of Cavities Naturally
What are cavities?
A cavity is a hole that forms in your tooth, also known as tooth decay. Cavities or tooth decay are some of the most common health problems in the world. Cavities are seen mostly among children and aged people, however, anyone with teeth can develop cavities.
Causes of Tooth Cavities
Tooth cavities are caused by plaque, which is a combination of bacteria, saliva, acid and food particles. Plaque is a sticky substance that binds to teeth. Bacteria in the plaque convert sugar into acid that dissolves the tooth structure, causing holes, or cavities.
At first, you won’t feel any pain in your teeth, but as the disproportion between sugar consumption and enamel reinforcement continues to grow, the acid reaches your dentin, the secondary layer of the tooth. In this stage, the pain kicks and you start to realize that something’s wrong with your teeth. If proper care or treatment is not taken at this point, the cavity will ultimately reach the blood vessels sunk deep within your teeth.
How to Get rid of Cavities Naturally

Crowns &
Root Canals
