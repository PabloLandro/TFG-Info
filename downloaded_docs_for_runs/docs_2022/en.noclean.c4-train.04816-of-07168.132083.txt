A woman suffered from basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, located on the crown on her head. She was cured after her daughter insisted that she tries baking soda paste, and apply it directly on the area.
Her mother first resisted, but Azizo, a respected writer and supporter of natural medicine, read many articles about people who cured their skin cancer using a combination of baking soda, or soda bicarbonate.
Azizo applied the remedy for 38 days, and her mother was completely free from skin cancer and the wound healed completely. This type of skin cancer is not deadly as melanoma can be, but it does continue spreading on the skin until cured completely
It is regular household baking soda they were using, nothing fancy or expensive. Of course, the rumors about aluminium in baking soda are totally misguided. Baking powder contains aluminium, unless it is labeled as aluminium free.
Baking soda provides alkaline environment, and as we already discussed, tumors only thrive in acidic environment.

How to Wipe Out Chronic Inflammation (Free Book)
By Jonathan Richard, WMHB Staff Writer
In April, 2009, researchers stunned the medical community when they reported chronic inflammation as the root cause of several major diseases.
See, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease. Cancer claims another 584,000...stroke 130,000...Alzheimer's disease nearly 85,000 — and the list goes on.
Truth is, we now know... chronic inflammation is responsible for 7 out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States! Hundreds of studies and scientific reviews prove it.
Fortunately, newer research shows you can prevent-even reverse-most major diseases by "turning off" inflammation. And in our new book, we show you how to do just that.
If you or a loved one is suffering from a debilitating condition-and you"re not sure what the culprit is-now's the time to find out...while you can still do something about it!
