Collagen Supplement Side Effects
Question:
Are there side effects from collagen supplements?
Answer:
Collagen supplements containing collagen hydrolysate, collagen peptides and similar ingredients appear to be generally safe and well-tolerated. However, some people may experience mild side effects, ranging from gastrointestinal symptoms to skin rashes. Rarely, liver abnormalities have been reported, and people who are allergic to certain sources of collagen, such as fish, or who are allergic to sulfites, should not take collagen products containing these ingredients. For more information, see the "Safety and side effects sections" of our CL Answers about using collagen supplements for reducing joint pain or improving aging skin.
People with kidney disease or who are on dialysis should consult with their physician before consuming bone broth as a source of collagen, as some bone broths contain high amounts of sodium and potassium.
[Note: ConsumerLab will be testing collagen supplements in 2019.]

I tried collagen powder to help with hip osteoarthritis. It seemed to help somewhat with that but gave me such horrible insomnia I had to quit taking it. I believe the amino acid, Aspartic Acid, was what caused the insomnia.

I was taking a collagen product recently that made me feel extremely hypoglycemic. Every day I took it, I ate a sleeve of cookies to feel better! Has anyone ever heard of this as a side effect?
