WD-40 LUBRICANT
Brand: WD-40 | Category: Other
This is an email I got today. Whether true or not regarding the ingredients I thought it would be an idea for Lumberjocks to add our uses for this great product.
In case you ask I have no connection with suppliers or manufacturers of the product.
.
Read the Email an you can add your uses if you wish!

What Is The Main Ingredient of WD-40?
Before you read to the end, does anybody know what the main ingredient of WD-40?
No Cheating…..
.
WD-40 ~ Who knew!
.
I had a neighbor who bought a new pickup.
I got up very early one Sunday morning and saw that someone had spray painted red all around the sides of this beige truck (for some unknown reason).
I went over, woke him up, and told him the bad news.
He was very upset and was trying to figure out what to do….probably nothing until Monday morning, since nothing was open.
Another neighbor came out and told him to get his WD-40 and clean it off.
It removed the unwanted paint beautifully and did not harm his paint job that was on the truck. I was impressed!
WD-40 who knew?
“Water Displacement #40”.
The product began from a search for a rust preventative solvent and degreaser to protect missile parts.
WD-40 was created in 1953, by three technicians at the San Diego Rocket Chemical Company.
Its name comes from the project that was to find a ‘Water Displacement’ Compound.
They were finally successful for a formulation, with their fortieth attempt, thus WD-40.
The ‘Convair Company’ bought it in bulk to protect their atlas missile parts.
Ken East (one of the original founders) says there is nothing in WD-40 that would hurt you.
When you read the ‘shower door’ part, try it.
It’s the first thing that has ever cleaned that spotty shower door.
If yours is plastic, it works just as well as on glass.
It’s a miracle!
Then try it on your stove-top.
It’s now shinier than it’s ever been.
You’ll be amazed.
. WD-40 Uses:
1. Protects silver from tarnishing.
2. Removes road tar and grime from cars.
3. Cleans and lubricates guitar strings.
4. Gives floor that ‘just-waxed’ sheen without making them slippery.
5. Keeps the flies off of Cows, Horses, and other Farm Critters, as well. (Ya gotta love this one!!!)
6. Restores and cleans chalkboards.
7. Removes lipstick stains.
8. Loosens stubborn zippers.
9. Untangles jewelry chains.
10. Removes stains from stainless steel sinks.
11. Removes dirt and grime from the barbecue grill.
12. Keeps ceramic / terracotta garden pots from oxidizing.
13. Removes tomato stains from clothing.
14. Keeps glass shower doors free of water spots.
15. Camouflages scratches in ceramic and marble floors.
16. Keeps scissors working smoothly.
17. Lubricates noisy door hinges on both home and vehicles doors.
18. It removes that nasty tar and scuff marks from the kitchen flooring.
It doesn’t seem to harm the finish and you won’t have to scrub nearly as hard to get them off.
Just remember to open some windows if you have a lot of marks.
19. Remove those nasty Bug guts that will eat away the finish on your car if not removed quickly!
20. Gives a children’s playground gym slide a shine for a super fast slide.
21. Lubricates gearshift and mower deck lever for ease of handling on riding mowers…
22. Rids kids rocking chair and swings of squeaky noises.
23. Lubricates tracks in sticking home windows and makes them easier to open.
24. Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close.
25. Restores and cleans padded leather dashboards in vehicles, as well as vinyl bumpers.
26. Restores and cleans roof racks on vehicles.
27. Lubricates and stops squeaks in electric fans.
28. Lubricates wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons, and bicycles for easy handling.
29. Lubricates fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running smoothly.
30. Keeps rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools.
31. Removes grease splatters from stove-tops.
32. Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging.
33. Lubricates prosthetic limbs.
34. Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell).
35. Removes all traces of duct tape.
36. Folks even spray it on their arms, hands, and knees to relieve arthritis pain.
37. Florida’s favorite use is: ‘cleans and removes love bugs from grills and bumpers.’
38. The favorite use in the state of New York, it protects the Statue of Liberty from the elements.
39. WD-40 attracts fish. Spray a little on live bait or lures and you will be catching the big one in no time. Also, it’s a lot cheaper than the chemical attractants that are made for just that purpose.
Keep in mind though, using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing are not allowed in some states.
40. Use it for fire ant bites. It takes the sting away immediately and stops the itch.
41. It is great for removing crayon from walls. Spray it on the marks and wipe with a clean rag.
42. Also, if you’ve discovered that your teenage daughter has washed and dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry, saturate the lipstick spots with WD-40 and rewash.
Presto! The lipstick is gone!
43. If you spray it inside a wet distributor cap, it will displace the moisture, allowing the engine to start.
. P.S. As for that Basic, Main Ingredient….... Well…. it’s FISH OIL….
. OK Jocks, what can you add to the list?

I didn’t read it yet (didn’t cheat), but I think the main ingredient is fish oil? I heard you can put it on fish lures or something???

From the WD-40 website:
What a Fish story!
Myth: WD-40 contains fish oil.
Fact:
Consumers have told us over the years that they have caught some of the biggest fish ever after protecting their fish hooks and lures with WD-40. We believe this legend came from folks assuming that the product must contain fish oil since it appears to attract fish. Sorry Charlie®, it just ain’t so.
It seems the material is mostly aliphatic hydrocarbons based on the MSDS sheet (aliphatic hydrocarbons are those without double bonds and are unlike many fish oils which tend to be double bond containing or unsaturated). You can also get some information from a Wired article: http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/17-05/st_whatsinside
I would also take some of these proposed uses with a grain of salt…

That may well be correct Chem but what do you use it for?

Grumpy I use it for squeaky door hinges. Not a very original use nor a woodworking use. Actually I don’t love the smell. Reminds be of work too much.

Used it to kill bugs in VietNam. Put the red tube in, start the spray and add a lighter. Instant inferno for the large bugs. Actually looked more like a minature flame thrower.

in the boatyard
would spray it in our tool grips
after short summer rains
if we got caught inside working
to displace the water
easier than wiping one by one

Well Grumpy, you got me to thinking after reading your uses. I have this favorite carving shirt from Texas and after spilling red wine on it awhile back. I figured what the hell! I gave it a shot of WD-40 and bam it started to come out . I figure one more shot and it will be gone! Smells kind of automotive but one good wash will take of that. Big Thank you Grumpy!!!!!!!

Anti-seize, lubricant, and flamethrower for wasps are my top uses. Also used it on my ATV’s recoil once to displace a bunch of water that got in there from having the plug loose. The starter bendix was rusted up and wouldn’t move, so I replaced it and got rid of the problem water.

My grand daughters (twins) would find a Sharpie marker and color their legs. They had to wear long pants forever. They were to be in a wedding as flower girls and had just colored their legs. We used WD40 and a clean rag to take the marker off their legs so they could wear dresses. Cleaned them up and gave them a bath. They looked like new.
