Can Drinking Too Much Water Really Kill You?
Posted by admin /
June 26, 2017
An athlete dies after drinking a lot of water after a workout. A fraternity hazing incident results in the death of a pledge forced to drink large amounts of water in between rounds of push ups. A woman participates in a contest to win a Wii video game by drinking 3 liters of water without urinating for several hours, and is later found dead in her home. Autopsies reveal that all these persons died of water intoxication or water poisoning.
We hear constantly that most people do not drink enough water throughout the day, that we are virtually made of water, and that water is the most crucial nutrient for life. But occasionally we hear of someone dying from drinking too much water. How can there be too much of such a good thing?
First, it is pretty difficult to drink too much water. Normally, when you start to take in too much water, your body gets rid of it by increasing the need to urinate. However, when you are engaging in strenuous exercise, you are losing a large amount of water through sweating, and your body responds by secreting antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which suppresses the urge to urinate. This is why the majority of deaths from over consumption of water happen to athletes.
Second, it is not so much the large amount of water that kills you, it is the resulting imbalance of sodium and electrolytes in your system. Normally your kidneys and individual cells are capable of fine tuning the balance of sodium, electrolytes and water in your system by drawing more or less water into the cells. However, when your body is swamped by an overdose of water with too little sodium and electrolytes, a condition called hyponatremia (literally too little salt in the blood) results.
Cells respond by trying to take in more water, which causes them to swell. Cells are capable of swelling quite a bit without danger, normally, provided there is room for them to get larger. The problem comes when hyponatremia causes brain cells to swell with water, as the skull does not allow this room for expansion, and any fluids in the brain are already sharing space with cerebrospinal fluid that is meant to be there. Just as when the brain swells due to injury, headache, convulsions, coma, and death can quickly follow.
The best preventative to this condition for athletes is to be careful to balance water intake with consumption of sports drinks that contain sodium and electrolytes. If your normal thirst awareness is not impeded by drugs or a medical condition, trust it to tell you when you have had enough to rehydrate.
Early symptoms of water intoxication can resemble those of alcohol intoxication. If you are working out with others or coaching kids or athletes at a training session, watch out for these signs:
Loss of coordination
Confusion
Vomiting
Complaints of headache
Seizures or convulsions
Loss of consciousness
If you see any of these symptoms developing, try to determine how much water and/or sports drinks the individual has recently had, and call for an ambulance. Hyponatremia can quickly become alife-or-death emergency and needs prompt medical treatment.

5 Ways To Cope With Menopause
Posted by admin /
June 26, 2017
Menopause is something all women go through. It can happen between the age of 30 and 60 although the average age is 52 and experiencing it under the age of 45 is considered to be premature.
Menopause occurs when the hormones in the body change and stop menstruation. There are a selection of symptoms that women can suffer from and some can be unpleasant. Some women get none at all. Some symptoms are easy to manage, but some women find that they need help.
HRT
Hormone Replacement Therapy is successfully used by some women. It replaces the lost oestrogen in the body and therefore eliminates the symptoms of the menopause. It is something which can be given on prescription in cases where the symptoms of menopause are having an extremely disruptive effect on day to day life.
Reducing Stress
Stress can make everything seem worse. However, hormonal imbalance can make you feel irritable anyway and so if you have high stress levels this can make everything even worse. By trying to reduce your stress levels as much as you can, you will be able to more easily cope with the hormonal feelings that you get. It should also help with any aches and pains or other symptoms too.
Exercise
Regular exercise can help in a selection of ways. It can help you to get a supply of endorphins which should help you feel better. It will also help improve serotonin levels which should help you to feel happier. Just getting out of the house and getting some fresh air can help to make you feel good.
Diet
Having a healthy balanced diet can really help your mood and hormones. Making sure that you have a low amount of sugar and a high amount of protein and healthy fats will allow your blood sugar to stay more stable which should help to balance your insulin and other hormones.
Herbal Medicine
Some people take herbal medicines, Chinese medicine or various supplements to help them through the menopause. Women differ in what they find works for them and so it can be worth trying a few different things and seeing what seems to be the best. If you are already on medication or have a medical condition then it is very important to check with a GP before taking any sort of supplement or herbs.
Many people just put up with the symptoms, but this isn’t always necessary. It can be worth trying different things to see whether these can help the symptoms. It may not be possible to eliminate the symptoms completely but it can bring some relief. It is never worth suffering hen something can be done to help, so it can be worth trying some of these things. There are many other things that women try and so speak to other women, especially family members to see what has helped them. Your family are more likely to have the same symptoms as you and it is also likely that the same things might help you as have helped them.

4 Reasons Why You Have Bad Breath
Posted by admin /
June 26, 2017
Bad breath is simply a major turn off and it is also a common problem among adults. It can be categorized into persistent and transient types. Persistent bad breath can be treated once a thorough diagnosis is done, while transient bad breath is only a temporary problem so you can easily get rid of the odor by rinsing or brushing your teeth. You may have experienced bad breath at some point or the other and know how embarrassing, uncomfortable and unprofessional it can be. Knowing the root cause of your bad breath and how it can be avoided or treated are effective ways of battling bad breath.
1. Poor Oral Hygiene
When you have poor oral hygiene, you can expect bad breath as a result of the accumulation of food particles slowly decaying in your mouth. This is because bacteria grows and releases hydrogen sulphide which produces bad breath. Plaque is also left behind by the bacteria on your teeth that can lead to cavities and tooth decay. The more cavities in your teeth, the more tooth decay can be expected. Brushing your teeth is essential each day after meals and you can also floss or rinse with mouth wash whenever needed to prevent bacteria growth. However, when all fails, seeking oral care from a reliable dentist is always the best option to take.
2. Food That Can Make You Smell
Sometimes, the most tasty, attractive, healthy and common food products can make you smell too. This is caused by the volatile oils in the food which can lead to bad breath and even strong body odor. These oils are so pungent that they can get absorbed into the blood stream as digestion occurs. The pungent smell is then transferred into the air from the lungs when breathing. Garlic, onions and spices are some food items that can lead to body odor and bad breath which can stick around for a few days. Eating such food products in moderation can help battle such odors and brushing your teeth after meals can help you a lot too. A consistent consumption of fluids can also help get rid of the odor in your system.
3. Smoking And Drinking Habits
If you think that smoking and drinking have nothing to do with bad breath, then you are mistaken. These habits can easily dry up the mouth causing bad breath. This is due to the tar being deposited in the teeth when smoking and the digestive problems caused by alcohol. Getting rid of these habits is the best way to gradually stop bad breath.
4. Nose, Throat And Other Problems
Even when a foreign body is stuck in the cavity of your nose, bad breath can occur. The same goes if you have a sinus infection, since the discharge produced by the sinuses produces a bad odor. In such cases professional help from a reputable dentist is required. Cancers can lead to bad breath and this includes kidney or liver failure, including dehydration or constipation. Diagnosis from a dentist can help determine the problem and a specializing doctor is often recommended by the dentist. Once the problem is treated, your bad breath will also be treated.
The best way to get rid of bad breath both temporarily and permanently is to have good oral hygiene. Staying hydrated is also a great way to keep your mouth clean and bacteria free. If you are uncertain about the cause of your bad breath, you can always schedule a dentist appointment to determine the problem right away.

What Are the Benefits of Colon Cleansing?
Posted by admin /
June 26, 2017
Colonic irrigation can provide you with the needed treatment to improve your digestive health. Factors such as stress or consuming a diet high in processed, fatty foods can cause you to become constipated and irritable. By using colonic irrigation, also known as colonic hydrotherapy, you can clear out your digestive tract with an effective and safe procedure. If you happen to live an unhealthy lifestyle you can use colonic hydrotherapy to reduce your likelihood of experiencing bowel cancer or other diseases consistent with poor digestive health.
Many individuals take in low amounts of fruits and vegetables. Combine this with the fact that high caffeine intake as well as soda consumption seems to be on the rise throughout the world and you have a recipe for a massive buildup of toxic waste within the body. Using colonic hydrotherapy can help you release harmful waste in an expedient and safe manner. It is recommended to receive multiple colonic irrigation sessions to effectively clear your colon. Since the bowel typically reaches between 5 and 6 feet in length and fecal waste accumulates over a period of years frequent treatments can help you remove the toxic build up.
Immune System Boost
Colonic irrigation can help reduce bad bacteria and promote good bacteria growth within your digestive tract. Fostering a healthy digestive environment can improve the absorption of critical minerals and vitamins, promoting your health and strengthening your immune system. A strong immune system may ward off the development of serious diseases, such as cancer.
Improve Your Mood
Constipated individuals usually feel irritable, being quick to anger. By undergoing colonic irrigation you can facilitate the movement of fecal matter through your digestive tract. Effectively processing and elimination waste can improve your mood, helping you feel more fresh and energized. Being treated with colonic hydrotherapy can also help you sleep more easily, reduce your headaches and improve clarity of thought.
If you are feeling lethargic or de-energized consider using colonic hydrotherapy to release waste and improve your mood quickly.
Improve Bowel Regularity
Colonic hydrotherapy can strengthen the bowels, promoting regular bowel movements. Improving your bowel regularity can reduce the likelihood of you becoming afflicted with bowel cancer. This treatment provides you with a better approach to relieving constipation as opposed to laxatives, which tend to relax the bowels, but can be quite harsh; because of their strong effects, you may become dependent on them to have a bowel movement.
Complement Your Treatment with a High Fiber Diet
One note; do not treat one or two colon cleanser irrigation sessions as the cure all for your constipation issues. Eating a high fiber diet with fruits and vegetables can promote your health and overall wellness. Make sure to drink a sufficient level of water daily to hydrate properly and stimulate bowel movements. Complement your colonic hydrotherapy treatment by consuming a healthy diet and do not forget to exercise regularly to improve your circulation and promote bowel health. By making a few key lifestyle changes and using colonic irrigation you can facilitate frequent bowel movements.
