Holistic Solutions for Decayed Tooth
Tooth decay and cavities are among the world’s most common oral health problems. These problems are most often seen in children, teenagers and older adults. However, anyone can get cavities.
Dental cavities, also referred to as caries, are holes in the teeth caused by tooth decay. Decay usually occurs due to a bacterial infection that causes demineralization and destruction of the hard tissues in the teeth.
Certain factors can increase the risk of getting cavities, including foods that cling to your teeth for a long time, frequent snacking or sipping, poor oral hygiene, not getting enough fluoride, dry mouth, worn fillings or dental devices. Eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia can also contribute to serious dental problems due to repeated purging.

The signs and symptoms of cavities vary, depending on the type and the severity of the problem. Some common symptoms include toothache, tooth sensitivity, mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking, visible holes or pits in the infected tooth, and black, brown or white stains on the tooth’s surface.
If cavities aren’t treated, they can lead to severe toothache, infection and even tooth loss. Some of the treatments for tooth decay and cavities are fillings, crowns and root canals.
The first step toward preventing cavities and stopping existing cavities from becoming worse is to take good care of your teeth. Brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes twice a day, in the morning and before bedtime. Floss once a day and also clean your tongue daily.
There are also some natural remedies that can help provide relief and maintain good oral health. Also, consult your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Here are the top 10 home remedies for tooth decay and cavities.
1. Clove
Clove is one of the most important ingredients for treating any kind of dental issue, including cavities. Due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antibacterial properties, clove can help alleviate pain and prevent the cavity from spreading.
<img class=”alignnone size-medium wp-image-7414″ src=”https://www.top10homeremedies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tooth-decay-home-remedy-300×300.jpg” alt=”tooth decay home remedy” width=”300″ height=”300″ />
Dilute 2 to 3 drops of clove oil with 1/4 teaspoon of sesame seed oil. Put a few drops of this solution on a cotton ball and dab the solution on the affected tooth. Repeat every night before going to bed.
Another option is to gently chew a whole clove to extract its oil. Then keep the clove under your tongue for several minutes.
Note: Do not use clove oil in excess or too frequently as it best used for temporary relief.
2. Salt
Salt can also be used to treat cavities due to its antiseptic and antibacterial properties. It can reduce inflammation, ease pain, draw out any infection and prevent growth of bacteria in the mouth.

Dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Swish a mouthful of this solution around in your mouth for 1 minute, concentrating on the affected tooth. Follow this treatment 3 times a day until your symptoms subside.
Alternatively, mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little mustard oil or lemon juice to make a paste. Massage the gums gently with this paste for a few minutes, then gargle with warm water. Repeat twice daily for a few days to kill bacteria.
3. Oil Pulling
Oil pulling is an age-old practice that can reduce cavities as well as bleeding gums and bad breath. It helps clean the mouth of harmful bacteria that are responsible for different types of dental problems.
1Put 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth.
2Gently swish it around for about 20 minutes.
3Spit it out. Avoid gargling or swallowing the oil.
4Rinse your mouth out with warm water. Use salt water for added antimicrobial benefits.
5Brush your teeth as usual.
6Do this daily in the morning, on an empty stomach.
This can also be done with sunflower or coconut oil.
4. Garlic
Being rich in antibacterial as well as antibiotic properties, garlic is often recommended for tooth decay and cavities. It can also provide respite from pain and promote healthier gums and teeth.
Prepare a paste from 3 to 4 crushed garlic cloves and 1/4 teaspoon of rock salt. Apply it on the infected tooth. Leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing with a mouthwash. Do this twice daily for a few weeks to reduce cavities.
You can also rub garlic oil on the affected tooth to get quick relief from pain due to a cavity.
Eating raw garlic regularly can also provide effective results.

Apply some turmeric powder on the affected teeth. Leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse well with warm water.
Another option is to mix 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder with a little mustard oil and use it to massage your teeth and gums. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then spit it out.

The natural antibacterial properties in wheatgrass help fight tooth decay and cavities as well as reduce the pain resulting from cavities.
Plus, wheatgrass is a highly concentrated source of vitamins A and E along with minerals like iron, calcium and magnesium, which are essential for healthy and strong teeth.
Drink 1/2 glass of wheatgrass juice daily on an empty stomach as a preventive measure to fight cavities.
Another option is to mix one part wheatgrass juice with six parts water. Swish it in your mouth for 1 minute and spit out. Follow this treatment 2 or 3 times a day.
You can also chew some wheatgrass slowly and thoroughly. This is considered a healthy exercise to make the gums and teeth strong.
Additional Tips
Regularly use an antibacterial mouthwash. This can help kill bacteria, remove plaque and prevent gum disease.
Rinse your mouth with warm water after every snack or drink.
Avoid foods and drinks with refined sugar as they can create plaque.
Drink green and black tea to reduce plaque build-up and reduce the growth of bacteria in your mouth.
After drinking any kind of acidic beverage, brush your teeth and rinse thoroughly with warm water.
Chew sugar-free gum to stimulate the production of saliva and make your teeth strong.
Drink an ample amount of water throughout the day. Water not only helps clear away bacteria, but is important for the production of saliva.
Drinking cranberry juice regularly also helps improve oral hygiene.
Make sure to eat foods rich in vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as enough calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and other key minerals.
Eat high fiber foods to help increase the production of saliva in your mouth, which serves as a natural protector for your teeth.
Take a vitamin D supplement.
Eat cheese daily to obtain relief from the problem of cavities.

CAUSES
Cavities, also known as caries, are little holes that appear in the tooth and are caused by a decay in the tooth or teeth that are affected. What causes tooth decay you might ask? Tooth decay can be caused by a bacterial infection. This bacterial infection will cause the affected tooth to become demineralized and destruct the hard tissues within the teeth.
There are certain risks associated in developing cavities. You can develop a cavity from several different factors which includes:
Food that will cling to your teeth for long periods of time
Frequent sipping or snacking
Dental hygiene that is poor
Lack of proper amounts of fluoride
Dry mouth
Worn out fillings or other dental devices
Developed eating disorders such as bulimia or anorexia due to the constant purging. (The stomach acids in the vomit will eventually break down the enamel placing the teeth at high risk for developing cavities.)
Weakness in the teeth due to lack of proper diet
Damaged teeth that have not been looked after
Diets lacking calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus
Understanding the causes of cavities will allow you to understand how to prevent cavities. Cavity prevention is essential in dental health and hygiene. Yet, before I go on to cavity prevention, let’s have a look at the signs and symptoms of cavities so you can understand what a cavity will do.
​
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
When you have a cavity as an adult, you will know. However, cavities in children can be harder to identify. This can be due to the fact that they do not realize they have one. Not to mention, their teeth are smaller so it can be tricky to spot. Yet, if you are aware of the signs and symptoms, not only can you quickly identify a cavity in a child, you can recognize a cavity appearance in your own mouth.
The signs and symptoms of cavities include:
Toothache
Tooth sensitivity to cold and/or hot temperatures
Sharp or mild pain when drinking or eating
Visible pits or holes in the affected tooth
Black, white, or brown staining on the affected tooth
If you allow your cavities to go without treatment, they can develop into more serious problems. This includes tooth decay, severe toothaches, infections, and even losing the affected tooth. When this occurs you will need to seek the professional advice of your dentist for professional (and expensive) treatments such as root canals, fillings, and/or crowns.
If you have noticed your child or yourself developing any of the above listed symptoms, you should go to a dentist for a medical diagnosis. With a dental check-up you can determine how serious the cavity is and receive a proper diagnosis. It is advised to speak to your dentist before administering any tooth decay treatment at home.

​
1. Administer Clove and Sesame Seed Oils

Cloves are one of the most vital ingredients in fighting cavities naturally. Due to the high properties of anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and analgesic properties, clove can help to soothe any pain caused by the cavity as well as heal them entirely. Clove will target the affected area and prevent it from spreading from the first use.
In addition to cavities, clove is useful for a wide range of dental problems.
Required Ingredients:
2-3 drops of clove oil
¼ teaspoon of sesame oil
Cotton balls
Process:
Place the sesame oil and the clove oil on a cotton ball.
Gently rub and press the cotton ball directly onto the tooth affected by the cavity.
Repeat nightly before bed.
Notes: Do not use and excess amount of clove or continue use for extended periods of time. Clove oil is best used as a quick and temporary relief from cavities.
2. Swish Salt Water
Salt is a highly useful home remedy for cavities due to its high levels of anti-bacterial and antiseptic properties. Salt will allow for the pain and inflammation to be reduced, it will draw out the infection present in the tooth, and it will prevent further infection from occurring.
Required Ingredients:
1 teaspoon of salt
Warm water
Process:
Place the salt into a glass of warm water.
Immediately take the water into your mouth, without swallowing, and swish thoroughly in your mouth. Make sure to concentrate on the effected tooth.
After one minute of swishing, spit into the sink and rinse your mouth with cold water.
Repeat three times each day until you no longer have cavities.
3. Practice Oil Pulling
The art of oil pulling is centuries old. It is an ancient home remedy for dental health issues and can assist in issues such as bleeding gums, foul breath, and of course, reducing cavities. Oil pulling helps you to pull the harmful, infection causing bacteria from the mouth. The cleansing effect of oil pulling will help you clear your mouth of harmful bacterias.
Required Ingredients:
1 tablespoon of sesame, sunflower, or coconut oils
Process:
Place the tablespoon of the oil of your choice directly into your mouth. Do not swallow.
Gently, yet vigorously swish the oil into your mouth for approximately 20 minutes.
Spit it out. Make sure you do not swallow or gargle the oil o choice.
Rinse with warmed water. (you can add a little salt for added benefits)
Brush your teeth as usual.
Repeat each morning, on an empty stomach, until the cavities are gone.
4. Administer a Garlic Paste
Garlic is a natural fighter against bacteria and can help reduce the infection caused by the cavity as well as keep it from spreading. Garlic is often recommended among homeopaths for cavities and tooth decay as a natural remedy. In addition in assisting with the infection, garlic can reduce and soothe any pain, inflammation, and help to promote healthier gums and teeth.
Required Ingredients:
3-4 cloves of fresh garlic
¼ teaspoon of rock salt
Process:
Peel and crush the fresh cloves of garlic.
Slowly start to add the rock salt and combine with the crushed garlic to make a paster.
Directly apply it to the infected tooth.
Leave to rest on the infected tooth for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, rinse with a mouthwash.
Repeat twice daily until your cavity is healed.
Notes: If you do not want to make a paste, you can rub garlic oil directly on the infected tooth with a cotton ball for the same amount of time. In addition, consuming raw garlic will aid in cavity prevention and healing.
5. Administer Licorice Root

Licorice root is a natural ingredient that will help to keep the teeth and the rest of the mouth healthy. This is because the licorice root contains two powerful ingredients- licoricidin and licorisoflaven A – both of which will directly fight against infection and inflammation. Licorice root will also help prevent the cavity from spreading as well as fight against any plaque present on the teeth.
Required Ingredients:
½ teaspoon of dried licorice root
Process:
Add the dried licorice root to your toothpaste on your toothbrush.
Brush normally and rinse.
Repeat twice daily until your cavities are healed.
Notes: If you do not want to use dried licorice root, you may also gently chew on a piece of soft licorice and use it in place of your toothbrush.
6. Administer Turmeric

Turmeric is often turned to for a natural remedy to fight against cavities. Turmeric will provide instant relief from pain caused by the cavities as well as stop any inflammation. Turmeric contains high anti-bacterial properties that will aid in gum health as well as prevent the spread of any infection present in the tooth.
Required Ingredients:
½ teaspoon of turmeric powder
Process:
Place the turmeric powder directly into your mouth paying attention to any areas affected by cavities.

Notes: In addition to using turmeric powder, you can also combine the turmeric with ¼ teaspoon of mustard oil. You will need to massage this combination onto your teeth and gums and leave in place for ten minutes before rinsing with warm water. Repeat on the same schedule for best results.
7. Administer Neem

Neem leaves, also known as Indian Lilac, are a cure all for several skin, teeth, hair, and digestion issues in humans and animals. This is due to the high levels of anti-microbial, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial agents found in the neem plants. The high levels of anti-bacterial agents will easily heal any size cavity quickly and prevent the further spread of cavities in the mouth.
In addition, neem will promote healthier gums and strong teeth.

Another herbal remedy for cavities is Indian Gooseberry, sometimes called amla. This herb contains high amounts of Vitamin C and antioxidants as well as being a natural anti-bacterial fighting ingredient. Indian gooseberry will promote the healing of the cavities present as well as prevent the further spread of any infections present.
Indian gooseberry will also aid in the development and healing of the gums connective tissues. Furthermore, the indian gooseberry will cleanse the mouth and get rid of bad breath.

Gently rub the cotton swab onto the affected area and leave for 10 minutes before rinsing. Follow the same regime schedule as the above listed home remedy.
10. Administer Wheatgrass
Wheatgrass is a natural ingredient containing high levels of vitamins and minerals as well as cancer and anti-bacterial fighting properties. Since the wheatgrass contains such high levels of anti-bacterial properties it is a great home remedy for fighting against cavities. The wheatgrass will help fight the infection and the spread of the infection, any inflammation, and any pain associated with the cavity.
In addition, wheatgrass has high levels of Vitamin E and A and it also contains minerals that are vital for strong and healthy teeth such as calcium, magnesium, and iron.

Repeat once to twice a week for 1-2 weeks or until the cavity is gone.
Any of the above listed home remedies for cavities can be used on children, just be sure to find one that agrees with your child as some of them have a stronger taste than others. In addition to helping to cure cavities and tooth decay in adults and children, the above listed home remedies are also great for treatment for baby bottle tooth decay in children.
In case you are not aware of this condition, baby bottle tooth decay is a term given to the condition that develops in babies and toddlers who are developing teeth, yet are already suffering from tooth decay due to the high sugar contents of a juice or bottle given to them. Babies and toddlers are susceptible to developing baby bottle tooth decay since they will be regularly using a bottle and they are constantly drinking or sipping throughout the day without rinsing their mouths with water.
In addition, many parents make the mistake in assuming babies and toddlers do not require dental care. This cannot be further from the truth. If teeth are present in the mouth, even if they are baby teeth, oral hygiene and care are important for the proper development and health of the teeth and mouth.
Combining any of the above home remedies for cavities can also be implemented, depending on the severity of your cavities or tooth decay, personal preference, and dental recommendations. There are also several tips you can keep in mind so you have optimal dental health and prevent further cavities from developing.
Tips for better dental hygiene and to prevent more cavities from developing include:
Regularly use a mouthwash that is antibacterial. This will enable you to fight off bacteria, plaque, and even prevent gum disease.
Rinse your mouth with slightly warm water any time after eating a snack or drinking something that is not water.
Cut out sugary foods, candy, and sodas from your diet or reduce your intake of these products.
Make sure to brush 2-3 times per day.
When you brush ensure you are using gentle and circular motions.
Make sure to floss at least once per day to help remove plaque, bacteria, and any food stuck in between the teeth and gums.
Drink black or green tea to prevent plaque build-up on the teeth.
After drinking any drinks that are acidic, make sure to rinse your mouth with warm water to help remove the acids from your teeth and enamel.
Drinking cranberry juice often will help to promote dental health.
Make sure you are getting plenty of vitamin d – whether it be through exposure to the sun, eating plenty of diary, or even taking a supplement.
Chewing sugar free gum will aid in saliva production which will help prevent dry mouth, remove any food particles in the teeth, as well as prevent cavities.
Drink plenty of water each day. The water will help to rinse away anything left on the mouth and increase your saliva production. You will also prevent dry mouth and bad breath with regularly drinking water.
Make sure your diet is high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals so you can be at optimal health and fight infection naturally as well as increase your saliva production.
Keeping a healthy smile will leave you wanting to smile even more. And smiles are very contagious. This is why I am passionate about oral health and hygiene and with the help of home remedies for cavities you can be sure to achieve the best natural dental health for you and your family. Keeping high levels of dental health are vital to ensure you have long lasting gum and tooth health.
After your baby teeth, you only get one chance to keep your teeth for the rest of your life. Make sure you take care of them. This is another reason why I love to share natural remedies with others. If you can use a natural remedy to help with the health and care of your body instead of using harsh chemicals, you will find they are powerful and gentle.
Have you tried any of the above home remedies for cavities or tooth decay? Did you find that you prefer a certain method over another or did you use the home remedy for your child or children? Let us know about your experience because after all, sharing is caring!
