Conclusion
Living in today’s world can be scary. With more and more detrimental and deadly diseases popping up daily, we need to realize that we are the greatest protectors of our bodies, souls, and minds. The truth is that everyone takes this job pretty differently. Some people make sure to be vaccinated for everything, while others focus on their daily diets to make sure they are getting all of the nutrients that they need to function daily. But here’s the thing: I guarantee that if we were more educated about vitamin C health benefits as well as the benefits of other vitamins, the entire world wouldn’t be able to get enough.
Most people don’t realize the importance of certain vitamins and what kinds of effects they can actually have on our daily lives. It’s up to you to make sure you’re taking all the right precautions and movements necessary to ensure that you are living healthily and proactively. Today I’d like to expose the world of Vitamin C and all of its benefits. There are so many different ways that you’re able to get this amazing vitamin into your body, whether through vitamin form or a vitamin C serum. In reality, most people just aren’t aware. Here are a few different ways that Vitamin C can change the way you live.
Five Health Benefits Of Vitamin C
1. Improves Cardiovascular Health And Blood Flow
In recent years, there have been tremendous breakthroughs in cardiovascular health. For years, scientists and doctors worldwide have warned us against the dangerous buildup of plaque. It can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Research has shown that vitamin C plays a role in reducing the risk of plaque buildup. One of the most intensely studied areas of vitamin C benefits is in the area of cardiovascular health. Researchers are finding that vitamin C impacts several aspects of cardiac health, ranging from blood pressure to endothelial health. Vitamin C is seen as a key protective element against many aspects of cardiovascular disease as the relationship between oxidative damage, inflammation, and atherosclerosis become increasingly investigated by science.
Not many people know, but most of the damage to blood vessels during a heart attack is caused by the blood vessels failing to dilate, which obstructs the blood flow. Chest pain or angina is also caused by the inability of coronary arteries (arteries that carry blood to the heart) to dilate. Multiple studies have shown that even small doses of vitamin C can help in improving dilation of blood vessels in people suffering from angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure.
2. Heals Skin Issues
Treat skin problems the natural way.
Since the beginning of time, vitamin C has been used to treat a lot of skin-related problems. Its antioxidant properties and role in collagen synthesis make it vital for skin health. Today, vitamin C is used in a lot of moisturizers, face packs, and masks for providing a natural glow to the skin. Vitamin C is helpful in reducing wrinkles and preventing sagging skin by improving its elasticity. It also helps to protect the skin from harmful UV rays of the sun. You can use vitamin C as an addition to sunscreen but not as a replacement. Since vitamin C supports new tissue growth, it’s great for healing burns and wounds, including a sunburn. A supplement with vitamin C and zinc can also act as a potential cure for eczema. If more people were aware of the benefits of vitamin C, they would most certainly do everything they possibly could to get their hands on it!
3. Reduces Stress
It’s known that vitamin C has an important role to play in protecting the brain and nervous system from the harmful effects of stress. It’s able to this because it allows your body to clear out cortisol quickly. Cortisol is the primary stress hormone that increases the sugars in your bloodstream. Sufficient levels of vitamin C are specifically needed for the synthesis of stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline, which play a role in the fight-or-flight mechanism of decision making. There have been studies that prove this. People were less stressed when given a vitamin C supplement. Adding vitamin C to your daily life can truly improve your mental state.
4. Improves Common Cold Symptoms
Vitamin C for the common cold.
The role of vitamin C in preventing colds has always been controversial. Although there is no evidence that vitamin C can prevent colds, several studies have shown that vitamin C can reduce the severity of cold symptoms and its duration. Vitamin C is a natural antihistamine and therefore helps in controlling allergies by reducing the levels of histamine. Since vitamin C is an antioxidant that produces collagen, a deficiency results in scurvy. Scurvy isn’t a problem today since there are much more foods that are rich in vitamin C. This also shows us that when vitamin C is decreased, so is the immune system. You’re at a higher risk if you don’t have enough of it. Immune cells have a high concentration of Vitamin C.
5. Prevents Diseases
Vitamin C is necessary for the development and maintenance of our connective tissues. It also plays an important role in bone formation. It even protects the body from free radical damage. Arthritis is caused by the collapse of cellular processes that help in the production, maintenance, and repair of cartilaginous tissues. Physical stress on the cartilage can cause the destruction of collagen and can also interfere in its production. Since vitamin C is required for collagen production, it helps to reduce pain, inflammation, and swelling of joints in people with arthritis. It also helps in maintaining healthy joints and keeping them flexible. A study had suggested that high doses of vitamin C can enhance the cancer-killing effect of drugs used in chemotherapy for cancer patients. Vitamin C has also been found to be target specific, unlike other drugs which can harm normal cells as well. Researchers believe that vitamin C can be a safe and cost-effective treatment for ovarian, lung and some other cancers.
STAY-C® 50 Review
It only gets better from here. Not many people are even remotely aware of the different kinds and forms of vitamin C there are out there. Stay C–50 is a perfect example. It’s actually pretty simple as well. STAY-C® 50 is a stable Vitamin C with numerous benefits for skin, hair and oral care. Vitamin C was under-used for some years due to stability hurdles of straight ascorbic acid. It only moved into the center of interest with the availability of ascorbic acid derivatives, such as the more stable and easy to handle STAY-C® 50.
STAY-C® 50 is one of the most stable and bio-available forms of vitamin C currently on the market. It improves sun damage, acne, and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Vitamin C has the remarkable ability to decrease the prominence of hyperpigmentation. At the same time, it’s brightening the skin that is tired and stressed. It’s shown that regular use of vitamin C serum will help to restore that youthful glow and promote an evener skin tone.
Something that drew me into learning more about Stay-C 50 was the significant impact that it has on skin. Not only does STAY-C® 50 reduce the level of damaging free radicals, but it also can increase your skin firmness. I personally had to use an emulsion with STAY-C® 50 and experienced a firmer skin. It’s shown that STAY-C® 50 promotes the synthesis of collagen I and III in human fibroblasts. The truth is that consumers look for products with Stay-C 50 for better skin care and sun-care benefits. For the most effective anti-aging prevention and protection possible, you should use a daily moisturizer with vitamin C and E, as well as broad-spectrum sunblock. Together, they will not only protect against the harmful UV rays but will also guard against UV induced free radicals, which cause premature aging of the skin.
Conclusion
Like I started off saying, we are our greatest providers and protectors. As you can see from reading everything until now, vitamin C can be so crucial in keeping your body healthy and protecting it against different kind of scary things. You’re most likely already eating plenty of vitamin C if you eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is in citrus fruits like lemons and limes. Vitamin C is also in broccoli, kale, brussels sprouts, strawberries, papayas, and so many more veggies and fruits.
It’s vital for your immune system, circulation, heart health, and connective tissue. Not getting enough of it can have detrimental effects on your health. It’s an essential step toward disease prevention and good health. It also isn’t that hard to get Vitamin C into your daily routine. There are SO many products and supplements that can easily get you all the vitamins and minerals that you need. You can apply it topically or take it orally. Whichever way you decide to increase vitamin C in your life can only help and improve your current mental and physical health. With its plethora of benefits, it’s hard to forget about.
