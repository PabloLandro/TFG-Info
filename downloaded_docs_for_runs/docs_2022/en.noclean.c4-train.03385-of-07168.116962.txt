The lightening of the skin requires the patient
In recent years, hydroquinone has become a controversial ingredient for topical use that is used to treat brown or dark spots on the skin.
What is known for some is that hydroquinone is a potent inhibitor of melanin production. For more than 50 years, it has been established as the most effective ingredient given its ability to reduce and potentially eliminate pigment spots on the skin often referred to as melasma or age spots.
Hydroquinone, this bleaching agent for the skin, has been linked to certain health problems. Is it a safe ingredient to use?
How does hydroquinone treat brown spots?
Hydroquinone is used to clear up brown or pigmented skin spots (also known as hyperpigmentation, melasma, age spots, freckles, acne spots , etc.) that are caused by various factors.
In different concentrations hydroquinone inhibits or prevents the skin from producing the enzyme responsible for triggering melanin, the pigment that gives the skin its color.
Be careful!
Hydroquinone has proven to be effective for many people in the treatment of brown spots. However this ingredient has been associated with some problems and side effects:
“The British Cancer Journal” published a study that linked very high doses of hydroquinone to cancer in mice. A second study found similar results. Subsequently, hydroquinone has been banned in Europe, Australia and parts of Asia and Africa but not in the USA.
Each medicine has risks and benefits. There are benefits to hydroquinone and a number of people find it helpful for skin conditions and had no problem using it.
Where to find hydroquinone?
In Europe hydroquinone has been banned but it remains legal in the USA. If you are interested in this ingredient to eliminate your brown spots you can buy a cream on our website, but you must choose the right concentration and not risk the potential side effects.
Products sold in the US without a prescription containing hydroquinone may contain 0.5% to 2% concentration, with 2% being the optimum amount. At our pharmacy, 4% hydroquinone concentrations (and sometimes even more) are sold without a prescription. A concentration of 12% prevents the production of melanin completely.
