Baking Soda actually has saved a lot of lives in the emergency room and making headway in diseases like cancer and diabetes.

You can even clean your pool with it rather than all different chemicals.

I know a man who worked in a hospital and his job was to alkalize with baking soda. It sure is true!

I have gout. Sounds like something I will try if I feel the heat and soreness starting in my foot.
Bryon Pegan Reply September 6, 2014 at 9:12 am
Definitely try it. I can usually start to feel it at night and I’ll mix it up and drink it before bed. Again in the morning and maybe the next night and morning and its always gone away by then since I found this remedy. I used to get it once or twice a year so bad that I wouldn’t be able to walk or sleep for a couple days because of the pain. In the last 4 years I’ve had it that bad once and one other time just bad enough that it was uncomfortable and both those times I know I didn’t act when I should have. The only thing I have read is that it can raise your blood pressure so if you have problems with that be careful. Another helpful thing I have found is get pH strips at your local health store and check your pH when you think it may be coming on. Gout will attack when your pH drops to between 5.0-5.5 the baking soda takes your body back to neutral and that’s why it goes away.

Interesting !

It is anecdotal because no studies have been done and probably won’t be. Who do you expect to pay for these studies, the big pharma? It takes a lot of money to run these long term double blinded studies and nobody is willing to sponsor them because there’s no money to be made and actually would hard pharmaceutical industry in terms of billions …! However hundreds of years of its use is enough to support its efficacy and safety for many disorders. You don’t need a study to show that the sun rises every morning because it’s obvious and you’ve observed it as have your parents and friends for ever. Same with many anecdotal remedies!
Jordan Saulnier Reply September 12, 2014 at 5:19 pm
Thanks for you input. I believe in natural remedies. My point was that it is sad that these alternative remedies aren’t more well studied because that is how the medical community recognizes

It’s not bad to use on occasion but is not good for daily use! Just an example it is used to treat gas and bloating in your stomach but can be dangerous if used daily and will cause more harm than good! Everything in moderation…

Daniel Burke Reply December 14, 2014 at 2:32 pm
Jordan, do you really think the big Pharmaceutical companies or even the government is going to spend millions of dollars to research natural cures. the articles are usually written by everyday folks and not by lawyers or those paid by Pharmaceutical companies. also, who sets the standard for peer reviews or clinical reviews, the people that are paid by the Pharmaceutical companies. money talks and BS walks. has anyone ever really listened to the medical commercials on tv and thought about all the side effects they have compared to what they say they will help cure. these drugs are approved by the government. then there are the law suit commercials with these approved drugs that are all over the TV. Pharmaceutical companies are here to make a profit, not to cure your ails.

Read the book “Cancer Is A Fungus”.

Thank you brenda was real confused x….

I agree with you 100%, where does the money really go. They say there, oh yes, we need money for certain Diseases, so now they have certain relalities to put money towards. And they have been doing this for years. Now there is no cure, but people still give money for this cure. Is the income tax so good that they can not see the problem. I really wonder what is going on in our world. Are they that stupid, that they can not reliaze what is happening

Really, why is there still so many dying from Xa?
Barbara Anne Jones Reply December 29, 2014 at 1:55 am
apparently, the best time to take it is last thing at night before bed, because while youre sleeping, it works on things like Tumours, while youre inactive.
Barbara Anne Jones Reply December 29, 2014 at 1:58 am
Sorry Jenn Ann but research more deeply, and be prepared to be amazed at the Cancer Cures that are happening & have been for quite a long time. No good for the huge Drug Industries though…
they want the $….not the cure of Cancers.
Barbara Anne Jones Reply December 29, 2014 at 2:01 am
Jenn Ann the body needs to be in a more alkaline state. Acidic, which so many eating habits cause, make an inflamatory state, which can lead to cancers .
Barbara Anne Jones Reply December 29, 2014 at 2:06 am
more people die from the side effects, eventually, of all the Chemical drugs Doctors prescribe, than by natural cures. ever read the side-effects ? ridiculous, and crazy. Some of them make worse the symptoms that the patient saw the Doctor for in the first place . Then…who’se nuts ? The Doc, or the patient who’s read the warnings and takes them anyway ??
