Lemon and Baking soda Miraculous Healing Combination
Health Natural Remedies February 15, 2014 141
Why did not we know about this miraculous cure and why we still didn‚Äôt try it? Because there are organizations that have an interest, common people not to know about the miraculous healing properties of the combination of lemon and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Therefore, from now onwards, spread the words about this simple but amazing cure to the people that really needs it!
Miraculous healing combination: EFFECT 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy!
Many people die while this secret is jealously kept in order to not affect the interests of the large corporations.
Lemon has strong anti-carcinogenic properties that are already been proven. Beside that it has many other useful features. It has a very strong effect over cysts and tumors. This fruit can cure cancer, it is tested on all types of cancer, and if baking soda is added it will have even bigger effect, because it will normalize the pH value in the body.
Also lemons have very strong anti-microbial effect with very wide range of activity against fungal and bacterial infections. Lemons are effective against worms and internal parasites. It is a powerful antidepressant and regulates the blood pressure, reduces stress and calms the nerves.
An interesting fact is the source of this information: It comes from one of the largest producers of medications, which says that after 20 laboratory tests conducted since 1970 until now it has been proved that: Lemon destroys carcinogenic cells in 12 forms of cancer. Also it prevents the spread of carcinogenic cells and has 10,000 times stronger effect than medications such as chemotherapy, anticancer drugs and narcotic products.
Even more interesting is the fact that this kind of treatment with lemon and baking soda only destroys the carcinogenic cells and does not affect the healthy cells.
The preparation is very simple, mix 2 dL (aprox. 6.8 oz) lemon juice with one teaspoon of baking soda in a cup, optional you can diluted the mixture with a distilled water and the miraculous drink is ready! Consume the drink before breakfast on a empty stomach for better effect. To have even bigger effect it is best to use organic lemon. Organic lemon is 100 times more efficient than lemon grown with artificial fertilizers and sprayed with chemicals.
Also an interesting fact is that this remedy does not have the terrible side effects that are typical for the chemotherapy.

People with acid reflux problems can consume this remedy without problem, baking soda will help you with the acid-reflux. Although lemon juice is acidic in nature, it creates a paradoxical reaction in the stomach, stimulating the release of bicarbonate in the pancreas and neutralizing acids.

My grandmother was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer that spread trough to her abdomen and started collect large amount of fluid. She was given less than a week to live. My mother somehow, found out about the baking soda mixed with water and lemon, started giving it to her 4 times a day. Her pain level has greatly decreased, she accumulates less fluid, and urinates a lot more.
This Saturday will give her a month since she was released from the hospital on Hospice care.
I am amazed, this Monday she‚Äôll turn 93 years old. This recipe is worth looking into. Stephanie M.

Is this taken in an empty stomach in the AM or PM for high blood pressure?
Lesley Wallace March 5, 2014 Reply
Love this article. As a life coach, I have many clients that suffer stress-induced stomach issues and some suffer the same condition I have.
I was diagnosed 1 year ago with hypochlorhydria, a lack of stomach acids for which digestives are required every time I eat in order to process my food. I also have limited pancreatic acids for which I require specific digestives. I was initially told that nothing could be done and it was from accumulated stress. They could only recommend digestives ‚Äì nothing restorative.
7 years ago, I was diagnosed with adenomysis and endometriosis, requiring me to ingest large doses of ibuprofen (1200 mg/4 hours) over a 2 year period to manage intense pelvic pain. I have since had a hysterectomy to combat that issue, however, I have learned that ingesting such high doses for so long may be the reason for my my current condition of hypochlorhydria. Not ruling out the stress part from doctors but I believe there is something to my high consumption of ibuprofen that has tipped my body to function the way it is.
My question to you is would this be helpful for hypochlorydria? In other words, by taking the lemon and baking soda (pharmaceutical brand), would there be hope that my stomach and pancreatic acids begin functioning properly again? I would LOVE to move away from having to be on digestives every time I eat something. AND, I have been looking at ways for restoration and hoping that this lemon bicarb remedy may be the answer. Is restoration a possibility with this remedy?
Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm happy to be the guinea pig, for if this is successful, it‚Äôs a remedy that I can forward on to my clients.
Many thanks.
Lesley Wallace
BestHH March 12, 2014 Reply
One of the simplest ways to test for low stomach acid in the comfort of your own home is known as the ‚Äúlemon test.‚Äù When you are suffering from stomach discomfort, simply place a teaspoon of lemon juice in 2-4 ounces of water and drink the mixture. If there is not enough acid in your stomach, the addition of the acid-filled lemon juice mixture will provide you with relief from your symptoms. But i don‚Äôt know how your body will react in combination with baking soda, so it is best to consult with your doctor.
Thanks for your visit!

Question‚Ä¶.. Does the lemon cause you to become acidic? I know a lot of cancer patients are said to use Ester C vitamin C because it‚Äôs not acidic. It seems that the lemon would irritate the stomach. I love lemons. I found that they upset my stomach after being diagnosed with Lung Cancer. But I‚Äôve never tried lemon with baking soda though. Maybe that‚Äôs a better balance.
BestHH March 10, 2014 Reply
The acidity of the lemons is neutralized by the sodium bicarbonate.
Joe Schrock March 12, 2014 Reply
Apparently a person needs a prescription for pharmaceutical sodium bicarbonate. What if a person just wants to take it as a preventative. Can that be done, I mean without a prescription ? I have had gall stones it would help dissolve them correct?
BestHH March 13, 2014 Reply
Baking soda can help you with the gallstones, it should dissolve them. About the prescription, you can use regular baking soda, only it must contain low level of aluminum.
Ms Anderson March 17, 2014 Reply
You actually don‚Äôt need a prescription for sodium bicarbonate. If you have a Rite-Aid in your area. The rule is the pharmacy can‚Äôt sell opened bottles, but you can order a sealed bottle of 1000 tablets of sodium bicarbonate from any pharmacy. The bottle ranges from $15-$35 a bottle.
I hope this is helpful. You may have already resolved this. Also, you don‚Äù‚Äòto need to crush the tablets, they dissolve quite nicely within a minute of being submersed in liquid. Salud! To health.

thank you for this very good and informative article, although still leaving some questions‚Ä¶
i press 2 oranges and 1 lemon and drink a glass of this juice with one teaspoon baking soda, is that just as good or it really has to be pure lemon juice?
In another article about baking soda you say that ‚ÄúWhen baking soda is combined with other basic and strong natural substances like iodine and magnesium chloride, we have a trinity of medical super heroes.
Does the iodine and magnesium have to be mixed with the lemon juice or to be taken separated and in what quantities?
It seems that also nano-silver is a good cure against cystes. Is it possible to use a cure of nano-silver in the same time or is this not a good combination?
BestHH April 14, 2014 Reply
The recipe is with organic lemons but if you what can mix it with oranges if you want (lemon in combination with baking soda will have even bigger effect, because it will normalize the pH value in the body).
You can take the magnesium chloride and iodine separately (about the magnesium chloride, prepare one liter of boiled water, but it must be left to cool before you add 33 grams of magnesium chloride). Consume one small cup of coffee from the magnesium chloride every morning, until you consume the whole liter of this mixture. ( We are preparing article for magnesium chloride, coming soon!).
About the combination of the four cures, we think that it is not recommended to consume all of them at once. You can consume two of the cures combined, than after some period combine the other two, to have better results (chose the combination randomly).

I quite like the mixture, after adding the bicarb, it tastes like homemade lemonade.
I was prone to kidney stones but this mixture helps dissolve the stones small enough for you to pass naturally!
I have a question: can it help with weight loss? It could be a coincidence, but I have lost half a stone, I have found i haven‚Äôt been as hungry

One month is not near long enough. When you deal with a natural therapy; it takes months and months for a complete healing. I‚Äôve been down this road before and a minimum of 3 months is a starter.

Some of the information relating to the acidity of lemon juice is incorrect. Stomach acid has a very high ph. It is hydrochloric acid which is strong enough to dissolve chicken bones. The mix as described will ave very little effect of stomach acid. The effect here is Vitamin C. As far as the body is concerned Lemon juice is not acidic since the Ascorbic acid in the lemon juice is turned into a compound which the body uses. Under certain circumstances you want quite high level of vitamin c. You will tell went you may be over dosing by loose bowel movement. You might want to back off. Cut out refined sugar which leads to yeast over load in the gut. There is another product a natural anti-biotic called citricidal grapefruit seed extract (the best one is made by a company called higher nature) It is a good alternative to antibiotic for children. It taste quite bitter if you have acid reflux try it in pineapple juice, the bromaline helps digestion, then end with an apple, some people find the pectin helps. Oatmeal seems to be the thing that really kicks reflux off for me. Also look at your levels of Vitamin D3 produced by your exposure to sunlight. many cancers are traced to low vitamin D3 levels.

Thanks

Hello, thanks for the information.. I have persistent stomach pain ssince last three months(mild pain and discomfort both side below ribcage) and my doctor told me I could have an intestine infection.
My question is, Does intestine infection last that long? Because I‚Äôm having stomach discomfort for almost 3 months and flatulence etc.
Will the baking soda with lemon can solve my issue?
P.S ‚Äì I got my CT scan and no kidney stone or gallbladder issues were found.
Any help would be appreciated.
Best regards,
Raj

I was told that fresh and squeezed lemon is alkalizing if taken instantly. Half a lemon left for later turns acidic and looses the Vitamin C content. That‚Äôs why it is not good to use a commercial juice or anything that is not freshly cut and taken instantly. Also the fruit must be never kept in a plastic bag ( do not buy the pre-packed lemons or any other fruit ‚Äì the plastic leaches out very toxic chemicals into it, also bacteria & molds multiply extremely quickly in that environment.) Keep fruit in a paper-bag away from the light.

Everyone should read the book Sodium Bicarbonate ‚Äì Nature‚Äôs Unique First Aid Remedy by Dr Mark Sircus.
Also, just plain Arm & Hammer Baking Soda has no aluminum. Baking powder does.
The book is amazing. Dr Sircus also has a web page. drsircus.com

Mixing Sodium Bicarbonate and Lemon juice together makes FALSE claims of curing cancer!
Made from soda ash, soda bicarbonate has an alkaline base. Approximately 5 percent of lemon juice is citric acid, which accounts for the sour taste of the lemon. When you mix an acid and a base, the result is a chemical reaction that creates a new product, with a neutral base. In the case of lemon juice and baking soda, the new product is (carbon dioxide gas) (Water) and (salt).
The above result of the reaction between the two produces a benign compound that is inert and does absolutely nothing for cancer and as it as described above consists thereafter of the following;
Water
Salt
Dissipated Carbon Dioxide gas.
Those that keep propagating this unproven negative treatment should desist, all it does is give false hope to cancer sufferers that take it hoping for a cure and it doesn‚Äôt work!

As soon as I use baking soda and lemon juice as described my low pH of 5.5 increases to 7.2 which is neutral. This is great for my general health and hopefully will stop the increasing of my PSA (Prostate cancer)
