Himalayan Salt Lamp FAQs
Himalayan Salt Lamp FAQs
Author: Saltco Australia Date Posted:1 January 2017
What is Himalayan Rock Salt?
Himalayan Rock Salt was formed over 250 million years ago after an ancient sea became landlocked and eventually evaporated leaving behind a huge salt deposit. Is considered to be the purest form of rock salt on Earth. Buried deep within the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains, the salt that is exhumed today is still what it was some 250 million years ago, pure & free from all modern contaminants.
Why does the salt have a Orange/Pink colouring?
Unlike refined table salt which is processed beyond belief, Himalayan Rock Salt is natural in all forms & has a pinkish coloring due to the 84 minerals & trace elements found within.
What is a Himalayan Salt Lamp?
Himalayan Lamps, Salt Lamps or Crystal Salt Lamps as they are commonly referred to are a small hand carved solid salt crystal that is hollowed out to fit a small low powered light bulb.
How do they work?
The salt lamp absorbs water and particles from the air, and as it does, it also takes positive ions with them. By gently heating the salt crystal with the low powered light bulb (5-10 degrees above room temperature), the heated salt releases cleansed water vapor back into the air. It also releases negative ions that combat the positive ions in our environment that are caused by pollution, dust, electronic devices, animal fur, pollen etc. thereby improving our air quality.
What are the health benefits?
The health benefits from salt lamps can vary depending on who you ask, however the most common stated benefit is the release of Negative Ions from the lamps.
Studies have shown that Himalayan Salt Lamps can help with the following conditions:
Why are Negative Ions so good for you?
Negative ions are odorless, tasteless, and invisible molecules that we inhale in abundance in certain environments. Think mountains, waterfalls, and beaches. Once they reach our bloodstream, negative ions are believed to produce biochemical reactions that increase levels of the mood chemical serotonin, helping to alleviate depression, relieve stress, and boost our daytime energy.
What size lamp should I buy?
The bigger the lamp the greater the ionisation area, however as rule of thumb please use table below:
Lamp Size
Weight [kg]
Ionisation [m2]
Room Type
Small
1-4
3x3 = 9m2.
Small Bedroom.
Home office
Medium
4-10
5x5 = 25m2.
Large Bedroom
Bathroom.
Large
10-20
7x7 = 49m2.
Lounge Room
Kitchen.
Should I keep my lamp on all the time?
The more the lamp is on the better the benefits, however it is not advisable to leave it on 24/7 unattended. Just make sure you switch them on whenever you are home.
Why is my Salt Lamp shedding?
Salt Lamps absorb moisture from the air, and when they are turned off they can Shed or “cry” if the weather is quite humid or if you live close to the beach or a lake.If you do need to have it turned off for a long period of time, please wrap in a plastic bag or cling wrap to prevent shedding. Or leave on a plate. For extra precaution, you can remove the cord and globe from within the lamp, in case of a moisture build up.
Are they hot to touch like a normal light globe?
No, the lamp itself should only ever be warm to the touch. If your lamp is too hot to touch you are most likely using the wrong size globe & it should be changed.
For globe size recommendations please use table below:
Lamp Size
Weight [kg]
Bulb Type
Small
1-4
7 watts.
Medium
4-10
15 watts
Large
Extra Large
10-20
20+
15 watts
25 watts
How to prolong the life of your Himalayan Salt Lamp Globes:
Why are my globes blowing?
Salt lamp globes have a life of around 1000 hours, so if left on continuously, they should last approximately 41 days. Unlike the incandescent light bulbs you might find in your ceiling, that remain stationary and untouched throughout their life, salt lamps globes are prone to more movement and vibrations that can potentially reduce the life of the globe.
So ideally your salt lamp should remain stationary and be placed somewhere it cannot be knocked easily.
If you are having trouble with your salt lamp globes blowing a little too often, here are some things to consider:
Make sure the globe is screwed in firmly enough to touch both contacts. If it isn’t screwed in enough then it won’t work.
Oils from your fingers can cause the globes to blow, so use a tissue when changing the globe.
Ensure the globe is not touching the inside surface of the lamp. Do not push the globe in too far and make sure it is straight.
Try to leave the lamp stationary after turning it off and allow it to cool down before moving it, as a hot globe is more prone to blowing than a cool one.
If there is a large current drawing appliance on the same circuit that is switched on/off frequently, this can cause power spikes and/or surges which can blow a globe. Consider another plug or power board with surge protection.
Excessive vibrations from a radio or TV being too close. Not a big deal, but something to consider if you are consistently experiencing globes blowing excessively.
Neglected salt lamps can ‘cry’ when barely used. If the residue settles on the globe it can cause the globe to blow. To avoid a sad lamp and therefore a sad globe, please wrap the lamp in plastic when not in use for an extended period to avoid crying. This is more likely to happen in humid weather or if you live near the beach. We recommend always leaving the lamp on when you are home, off when you are not home and off and wrapped with the cord and globe removed when you are going to be away and not using the lamp for several days.
Will my lamp look like the one on your website?
Not necessarily, as each lamp is hand carved from natural salt crystals, no one lamp will ever be the same as another. They will vary in shape and colour. You can request a certain look if you have a preference.
Do your lamps come with globes & cords?
Yes all of our Salt Lamps come with a globe & electrical cord. You can choose your globe size, electrical cord colour and electrical cord length.
What type of wood is used on the Salt Lamp base?
Sheesham Wood, also known as Indian Rosewood.
Do your power cords meet Australian Safety Standards?
Yes, all our electrical cords used in our Salt Lamps at Saltco Australia are Australian Safety Standard Approved. You can view our certificates here. Our Erac number is E5730
