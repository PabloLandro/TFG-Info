How to Increase Your Chances of Getting Pregnant
in Getting Pregnant
on June 3, 2016
Are you trying to get pregnant? Do you want to do it right?
There are many ways to increase the chances of getting pregnant, and we want to make sure you are going about it the right way.
How We Get Pregnant
There is lots of pregnancy information out there. Some of it is even right. What we have here are 100% scientific sources that show you what your body does and what it is going through. No wives tales, no religious doctrine. These are facts.
In a normal, healthy woman, the ovaries produce ﻿﻿estrogen and progesteron﻿e in alternating cycles throughout the month. Estrogen is produced during the first 14 days. During this time, an egg is developing in the ovaries. Menstruation is occurring during the first 5 to 7 days of this time.
At approximately day 14, the egg emerges from the ovary and begins its trip to the uterus. If you don’t ovulate, you can’t get pregnant. The ovaries now switch to producing progesterone, which encourages the endometrium lining of the uterus to enlarge, getting ready for a fertilized egg to implant.
When a fertilized egg does not implant, progesterone production slows way down and the endometrium begins to slough off. This is the start of the next cycle. The blood of your period is actually the endometrium and the resulting bleeding from the broken blood vessels. A normal menstruation happens over several days because the endometrium doesn’t detach all at once.
While the egg is moving from the ovaries to the uterus, it travels through the fallopian tubes. However, only during the first two days of ovulation can fertilization occur. After that, the egg is not longer viable.
The sperm from the man travels up through the vagina, past the cervix, and into the uterus. From there, they can remain in the uterus or travel further to the fallopian tubes. Sperm is strong, but stupid little things. They survive from 2 to 3 days in the uterus, but can’t tell direction. Most get lost in the uterus. An estimated 0.0000001% of sperm actually reach the egg. Of course, most men ejaculate 40 to 200 million sperm, meaning 0.0000001% is only a few hundred.
Once a sperm makes it to the egg, it needs to burrow in and join it’s c﻿﻿hromos﻿﻿omes to the eggs. Then, the zygote (fertilized egg) begins to develop. By day 9, it has implanted into the uterus. Failure to implant causes menstruation.
Getting pregnant is a quiet event. It does not hurt, nor do you feel anything at all.
Of course, you can get your period even when pregnant. For some women, menstruating 3 months after becoming pregnant occurs. It has been known that some women will menstruate during all nine months of their pregnancy while others completely stop. Family history, exercise levels and overall health play a big role in knowing this.
Things that Prevent Pregnancy
Did you know that 90% of all pregnancy failures you have no control over?
About 50% of all fertilized eggs never attach to the uterine wall. Another 25% may attach, but the body doesn’t recognize it and menstruation washes it away.
That’s a full 75% of pregnancies ended before they really had a chance to get going.
During the first month, another 15% of pregnancies are spontaneously aborted when the body rejects the zygote. This can happen for any reason, from a time of year to eating the wrong foods.
Doesn’t it make you wonder how we are here at all?
Even after a fertilized egg becomes successfully implanted, there are still many dangers that can cause termination.
The top threats to pregnancy are alcohol, drugs, and smoking. There are thousands of websites and doctors that can tell you why you shouldn’t do these, so we won’t bore you here.
Poor nutrition is another factor. You need lots of vitamins, healthy protein, and good fats to produce a healthy child. Processed foods and fast foods are the two biggest threats to your child. Vegetables are your best friend and you should eat more than 5 servings per day.
Poor environments include moldy air, high allergens, chemical residues, and risk of injury. Anything that makes you feel bad will increase the harm to your child. We recommend you avoid these situations. There is help from most governments to aid pregnant women in obtaining new homes during pregnancy.
Age is a huge risk factor. Becoming pregnant before about the age of 20 or after 40 carries big risks. In the teenage years, the body is not developed enough to be able to hand the rigors of pregnancy. The organs are too small and the hormonal system to support the body is not fully functioning. Many children of teenage mothers have developmental problems that last their whole lives.
A past history of polycystic ovaries, endometriosis, and irregular periods can delay or prevent pregnancy. It is possible to become pregnant, but usually, you require the aid of a doctor. In most cases, becoming pregnant with these conditions makes them worse and put your baby at great risk. Things like endometriosis are not cured by pregnancy.
Anything that would harm you will harm your child. This includes accidents, roller coasters, too much work, and much more. Although nature designed us as women to be the perfect vessel for a child, the risks are still there. Do well to avoid dangerous situations and put the wellbeing of your child foremost in your mind.
Tips for Getting Pregnant
We’ve been asked many times for tips on how to get pregnant fast. We have to say that if you are planning to get pregnant, we want you to take the time to truly understand all that goes into making sure you have a happy and healthy child.
This isn’t just a decision you can make lightly. Once you are pregnant, there is 9 month of being devoted to gestation. You are 100% responsible for growing and nurturing your child. Everything you do will affect your child.
Then, you have at least 18 years of direct, intense contact with your child. You will be 100% responsible too. Even after they are 18, you still are in their lives until the very end. This could 40, 50, even 60 more years.
A child is for life.
That’s why it’s not so easy to get pregnant. As we showed above, there are lots of factors that go into getting pregnant.
If you are ready, if you are prepared, we can show you how easy it is to get pregnant.
First, eat a diet rich in vegetables and fruits. This provides your body with the nutrition it needs to nourish the baby. Fast food, processed foods, and junk lowers your chances of getting pregnant.

Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can lower your chances of pregnancy. Soda also changes the pH of your vagina, which can injure the sperm.

Avoid cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and medications. All of these can prevent pregnancy or create circumstances that damage the baby.
Exercise often. Movement increases the blood flow to the body and signals that you are healthy. It balances your hormones, which can create a better balance to encourage proper ovulation and menstruation.
There are several herbal remedies that claim to help a woman become pregnant. Unfortunately, these are mostly snake oils. If anything, they help provide better nutrition to the woman, which can, in turn, increase the chances of becoming pregnant.

Supplements, like Geritol *, can help you with better nutrition to help support a baby.
We recommend you talk to your doctor when you are getting ready to become pregnant. They will recommend a daily regime of pren﻿﻿atal vitamins before you even become pregnant. Stick to a healthy diet and plenty of exercise. A body that is not stressed from chemicals, poor foods, drugs, and laziness is more open to creating new life and keeping it healthy.
Becoming pregnant run you the risk of becoming ill. Your immune system has to go through many changes to accommodate a child. In many cases of termination, the immune system recognizes the DNA of the child as too foreign and does what the immune system is designed to do: eliminate the foreigner.
Because of all the changes, many women experience urinary tract infections. Women are more prone to these infections to begin with. Becoming pregnant affects the immune system and hormones. It also allows the natural yeast and probiotics of the body to change. Because of the changing immunity, and a unbalance of our natural probiotics, UTIs become a higher risk. You can help prevent them by eating and drinking ﻿﻿acidic foods﻿﻿, like cranberry juice and apple cider vinegar, and keeping clean as possible.
Additionally, you could have a herpes outbreak if you are already infected. This runs a greater risk, as herpes could be transmitted to your child and most medications are contraindicated for pregnant women.
When Can I Get Pregnant?
The best days to get pregnant are the two days just after ovulation. But, that can be a huge issue. Very few women actually know when they are ovulating.
In a perfect woman, you can get pregnant only on days 14 and 15 after the first day of you period. For most women, you can get pregnant 7 days after your last period or 14 days before your next period. Most of us are not perfect.
For some women, you can get pregnant the day after your period ends. You can get pregnant any day before your period. It all depends on your ovulation cycle.
There are kits available for you to use to know when you are ovulating. It tests the differences between the estrogen and progesterone in your body.
If you have an irregular period, anything that is not the perfect 28-day cycle, it can be hard to know when you will ovulate. The only sure way to make sure you hit each day is to have sex every single day. While fun, it’s not very realistic.

You can pay attention to your bodies. Many women have their breasts become very sensitive during ovulation. The breasts often will swell slightly during the progesterone producing phase.
Other women notice their sex drive increases. Scientists speculate that this is in response to the urge to mate and produce offspring. Having a women become sexually aroused increases the likelihood of conception.
Common Myths & Truths
Myth: You Can’t Get Pregnant During Your Period
Truth:
Any time there is a viable egg within your body, you can get pregnant. This does mean during your period as well. However, because the body is sloughing off the endometrium that has been growing to support the fetus, it greatly reduces the chances.
Also, having a viable egg ready for fertilization during your period means you have irregular periods, and this makes pregnancy risky. The fertilized egg can adhere to the newly exposed uterine wall, the fallopian tubes, or even outside of the uterus.
The chances of getting pregnant during your period increase as your flow decreases. Only knowing exactly when you ovulate will tell you when you are able to get pregnant.
Myth: Precum Can’t Get You Pregnant
Truth:
While there is no live, active sperm in precum, you can still get pregnant. Precum is a fluid designed to clean out the penis to protect the sperm in the next ejaculation. Within the penis, live sperm from the previous ejaculation may remain, and enter the vagina when swept out with the precum. At a certain point, the precum becomes true seminal fluid and sperm is active in this fluid. Seminal fluid can begin leaving the penis prior to orgasm/ejaculation.
Myth: Condoms Prevent Pregnancies
Truth:
Condoms are great, but can you get pregnant using a condom? Yes. Even using them correctly, ﻿condoms only have 98% success rate﻿. Statistically, most people don’t use condoms correctly, which puts the success rate much lower.
This is true for IUDs as well. While they are 99.9% effective, you can become pregnant on Mirena or other IUDs. Pregnancy with an IUD is exceptionally dangerous to the fetus and the mother and needs to be resolved immediately.
Myth: Tubal Ligation and Hysterectomies Prevent Pregnancy
Truth:
These are 99.999% effective. However, there are rare cases of women becoming pregnant after a ﻿partial hysterectomy﻿﻿﻿﻿, fallopian tubes severed or their partners having a ﻿tubal ligation. If the ovaries and/or testes are removed, then it is 100% impossible to become pregnant. But, if anyone tells you they had their tubes tied, demand proof.
Myth: You Can Get Pregnant from Swallowing Sperm
Truth:
You cannot become pregnant from swallowing sperm. There is no direct connection between the uterus and stomach. It is nearly certain that you will obtain an STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) from oral sex if your partner is infected, however.
Myth: Birth Control Works for Years After You Stop
Truth:
You can get pregnant on﻿ birth control and immediately after you stop. The pill * is 99% effective when taken perfectly. For most women, they forget a pill here or there and this takes the effectiveness down to 95% or less. It is possible to ovulate while on the pill and become pregnant and you can get pregnant if you miss one pill.
Once you stop the pill, your body takes back over. This can happen immediately or it may take a little while. While most women will experience difficulty getting pregnant just after they stop taking the pill, your chances go up rapidly the longer you are off it. Some women will get pregnant right away.
Myth: Getting Pregnant while on Birth Control Harms the Baby
Truth:
For most women that become pregnant while on birth control, it results in termination. The body flushes out the zygote because conditions are not right. But, if you do manage to maintain the pregnancy, being on birth control does little to harm the child. There is a risk, especially a longer you are on birth control, but the risk is much less than smoking or drinking alcohol.
Fortunately, being on birth control also makes it easier to notice a missed menstruation.
Myth: Virgin Births
Truth:
You can’t get pregnant by yourself. Pregnancy requires the aid of a man. Even artificial insemination requires a man to donate the sperm, and then a doctor to help you.
Of course, you can get pregnant without intercourse. You can get pregnant with your clothes on if the seminal fluid penetrates the clothes. You can get pregnant if your fingers have sperm on them and then you touch your vagina.
Basically, if there is any way for the sperm to contact the vagina, you run the risk of pregnancy. This includes pre-ejaculate.
Myth: Abortion Prevents Pregnancy
Truth:
You can get pregnant normally after a proper abortion. When done correctly, an abortion leaves no physical damage or scarring. It is possible to become pregnant within 2 weeks of an abortion because the sudden loss of the fetus signals the body to ovulate.
Myth: Breastfeeding Prevents Pregnancy
Truth:
This is a myth that has been around a long time. You can get pregnant while breastfeeding. But, as a rule, breastfeeding will cause a hormonal adjustment that helps prevent pregnancy in some people. Breastfeeding is not a full-proof way to avoid pregnancy, and you run the risk of other complications. Pregnancy can stop milk production, so in favor of the child you have, we recommend using other birth control methods to prevent a future pregnancy.
Myth: Menopause Ends Pregnancy Risk
Truth:
While menopause signals the end of ovulation, and it is rare, women have become pregnant during menopause. Until the ovaries completely stop producing eggs, they may produce a viable egg, even during the end phases of menopause. So, just because you have stopped having periods, doesn’t mean that the ovaries can’t have one last hurrah and surprise you.
Myth: Pregnancy Emancipation
Truth:
This is an odd question we have gotten often. No, becoming pregnant does not emancipate you. In fact, your child becomes a ward of your nearest relative or state. You do not even retain rights to your child because you are underage.
Myth: Tattoos & Breast Implants
Truth:
Neither of these will harm your child. Reputable doctors and artists will not work on a pregnant woman or even one thinking about becoming pregnant to avoid risk. Having breast implants should not affect your pregnancy or your ability to breast-feed. Having a tattoo will not affect your pregnancy. But, of course, if either of these was done illegally or poorly, risk factors are high.
We’ve Been Trying. Why Can’t I Get Pregnant?
There are as many reasons for not getting pregnant as there are people. The most common reasons are actually very simple.
First, your body might not recognize that it’s time to have a child. This could range from being too early in life to poor nutrition.
It might also not be your fault at all. Men have just as many problems with fertility. And it’s actually easier for a man to be tested for fertility than a woman. If it’s been more than 4 months, have your doctor talk to your partner to see if he has proper fertility. Once you eliminate that, then we work on you.

One of the first things they will test for is proper vitamin and hormone levels. They would ultrasound the uterus and check to make sure there are no physical blocks.
More invasive testing includes biopsies, hormone treatments, and possible surgeries. These are things you need from your doctor.
Once you know why you are not getting pregnant, you can work on remedies *. There is just one exception. If you are not ovulating, you can’t get pregnant. No egg means no pregnancy.
Conclusion
Despite all the complications and risks, the majority of women have healthy pregnancies and healthy children. You increase your chances of becoming pregnant by nurturing your body. Stick to avoiding drugs, alcohol, and medications. Exercise regularly and eat a diet rich in vegetables. Being healthy yourself will help you become pregnant and give birth to a healthy child.
