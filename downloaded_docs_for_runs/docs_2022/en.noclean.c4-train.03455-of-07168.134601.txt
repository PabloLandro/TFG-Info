Oncologist Makes Groundbreaking Discovery- Baking Soda: Helped to Cure Cancer
CancerPrevention
“Cancer is a fungus, called candida albicans, and it can be treated using sodium bicarbonate,” So says Tulio Simoncini.

Simoncini is a former Italian oncologist in Rome who developed a theory that all cancer is caused exclusively by a fungus called candida albicans. His alternative cancer treatment is simple: To alkalize the body and tumor by the use of a cheap, common compound, sodium bicarbonate, tackling the candida, shrinking the tumor and stopping metastases. Thus it is also a natural cancer cure.
Candida, beneficial bacteria, acidic bodies, and cancer are all interconnected.
The background to Simoncini’s work involves the following theoretical elements:
Firstly, acidic bodies are known to be linked to ill health and cancer.
Secondly, sodium bicarbonate can alkalize your body. It has been used in many preparations as an antacid; an indigestion aid. Additionally is is extremely inexpensive.
Thirdly, the beneficial bacteria in your intestine are now known to direct up to 85% of your immune response, to release anti-cancer vitamins (like biotin, B-12, folic acid, vitamin K) from your foods and even to produce a compound (sodium butyrate) which causes cancer cells to self-destruct. Beneficial bacteria work imperfectly if the acidity of the gut increases, even slightly. Similar to mechanisms observed in plants by botanists.
However, fourthly, at night when you sleep, beneficial bacteria digest vast quantities of microbes, fungus and yeasts that you consumed during the day with your food. In fact, their favorite food is the yeast or fungus, Candida albicans. So, they are your first line of defense.
So how might candida cause cancer?
Candida albicans is known to be able to escape the intestine and travel around the body in the blood stream. Oregano oil and cinnamon can kill the yeast in the blood stream. About 25% of type-2 Diabetics were shown to improve when given cinnamon. This is because the fungus sits on the outer membranes of cells, preventing crucial receptor sites from working properly – in the case of diabetes, those receptor sites are for insulin. However, candida also produces a sugar-like waste product. People with higher blood sugar levels develop more cancer; and survive less.
There is a second potential problem. Yeasts such as candida are anaerobes – this means they generate their energy in the absence of oxygen. Once in the blood stream they can colonize certain local areas of the body and greatly reduce the oxygen levels in that area. The result is that the local cells do not die, but switch their own energy production from an oxygen-based system to one that doesn’t use oxygen. This is the system employed by cancer cells, which also do not use oxygen to generate their energy from food molecules. In fact, Otto Warburg won a Nobel Prize in 1931 for telling the world this property of cancer cells and that oxygen was their enemy!
Is it any surprise then that women who had taken antibiotics more than 25 times during their lifetime had twice the risk of breast cancer, according to research covered in CANCER actives research service Cancer Watch? Their friendly bacteria were reduced allowing candida more chance to survive in the gut and move to the blood stream. Their immune systems were weak, indicated by the illnesses that required the antibiotics. And so on.
Dr. Simoncini was a respected Italian Oncologist until he developed his theory. His theory is that all cancer is caused by the fungus, candida albicans. His cure is to alkalize the body to produce conditions in which the candida could not thrive. His main weapon is the inexpensive, sodium bicarbonate. He was struck off, in Italy.
