This article is another remarkable story about the benefits of baking soda, when it comes to battling cancer. Vernon Johnston is a man who has been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. As expected, he had only a few options and his standard treatment was undergoing chemotherapy sessions with the hope that chemo drugs will destroy cancer cells faster that it can kill off the healthy ones which have remained.
It is a well-known fact that chemotherapy is an aggressive form of cancer treatment. Often, it can leave the patient drained of energy and it can drain the resources, leaving him with debilitated immune system that is almost next to nothing. Vernon’s cancer is at an advanced stage and even the regular chemotherapy sessions won’t guarantee that he can be cured. Consequently, he was left with no other solution but to take matters into his own hands. He took his brother’s advice to raise his body’s pH levels, which was supposed to prevent the spread of cancer in his body. To do this, he needed cesium chloride.
The cesium therapy is another cancer treatment but doctors seldom recommend this treatment to their patients. In comparison to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, cesium therapy is said to offer better results. Being aware of this, Vernon started ordering cesium alternative ways to in order to raise his body`s pH levels.
After solid research, he came across an unlikely remedy – baking soda.
Baking soda is a household item and it is used as antacid. Vernon mixed baking soda with maple syrup and started using it on daily basis. It may seem unusual and unlikely to battle cancer with baking soda and other common household ingredients, but Vernon’s progress is documented on hi s blog and it is available for everyone to see.
Baking soda basically raises the pH levels in the body by neutralizing its acid content. In addition, it is used as topical antiseptic that prevents blisters and scarring. Finally, it is effective in reducing itching which is oftentimes caused by skin allergies.
BAKING SODA AND HOW IT CAN HELP BATTLE CANCER
According to many experts, alkalizing the tumor environment can starve the cancer cells and inhibit their growth, because in general cancer cells thrive in the acidic environment. Naturally, getting the sodium bicarbonate closer to the tumor by intravenous injection is superior to oral administration. On the other hand, oral medications are more available, cheaper and safer than intravenous injection.
