Question
I'm 26 and still breastfeeding my son, who is just 16-weeks-old. Nevertheless I believe I'm pregnant.
I've used three home-pregnancy tests. None of them had any markings in the control field, but they all had very clear markings in the answer field.
Am I pregnant?
Answer
If there aren't any markings in the control field of the home pregnancy test, there could be something wrong with them.
Consult your doctor and take the first sample of urine you pass that morning so that he or she can arrange for you to get a firm answer.
It is possible you could be pregnant, even though you are breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding does delay the return to normal fertility to some extent. But all women are different and the effect of feeding is greater in some women than in others.
The contraceptive effects of breastfeeding only usually exist while a woman is feeding on demand day and night.
If you are only feeding occasionally, the hormone that inhibits ovulation is unlikely to be at a high enough level to have this effect.
If your periods have returned and are regular, it is likely you could conceive.
Some women do breastfeed throughout a pregnancy, and there is no evidence this is harmful to the foetus.
In theory, the hormone oxytocin that is stimulated by breastfeeding might stimulate uterine contractions, possibly causing miscarriage.
However, most experts say that this is not a risk.
If your pregnancy is confirmed, it might be wise to stop feeding or at least to discuss this issue with your GP if you have a history of miscarriage or unusual uterine contractions while feeding.
It is worth saying that when a breastfeeding mother is pregnant her nipples may become tender, the supply of milk may diminish and there may be a change in the taste of the milk so your baby may become reluctant to feed.
This is usually a transient problem.
Some women find breastfeeding too tiring during pregnancy and if this is the case or you just feel it's time to stop, then it's probably time to begin the weaning process.
