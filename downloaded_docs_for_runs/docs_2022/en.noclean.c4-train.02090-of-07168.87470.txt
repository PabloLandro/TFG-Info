Do you remember this episode in Friends when Monica is stung by a jellyfish and asks her friends to pee on her to relieve the pain?
We debunked this myth early this summer, as it turned out that urinating on a person who was stung can actually make it worse.
But what about mosquito bites?
Faith Canter, 39, claims that drinking urine helps to keep the swelling.
The health and fitness trainer does not do it apply But they bit – she drinks it.

Faith, also a self-love coach and author, is originally from Aberdeen, Scotland. She lived in Castelo Branco, Portugal when she was bitten in the eye by a mosquito at night.
When she woke up and looked in the mirror, she saw a huge knot that covered her right eye.
This was just one of many cases where Faith had an extreme allergic reaction to mosquito bites.

In the past, she has tried various medical treatments to alleviate her symptoms – from steroid creams to antihistamine tablets – but nothing worked.
It took seven to ten days for the itching to stop and the swelling to decrease.
Then one of her friends recommended urine therapy; Application or massage for medical or cosmetic purposes in the skin or gums.
At first she thought it was a crazy suggestion, but her eye was so swollen that she decided to give it a try and drink half a cup of her own urine.
Faith says the bite was healed in just four hours.
Now she drinks two glasses a day for his alleged health benefits.
What happens when you drink urine?
Urine therapy may have been used in ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt, as the reports suggest that piss was offered as a treatment for everything from acne to cancer.
There was also a time when doctors tested for diabetes in the urine to taste.
Healthline says there is no official evidence that taking urine has any benefits.
Urine is also a myth.
Interestingly, studies show that urine contains bacteria that can be harmful if they enter or are taken into the bloodstream via a wound, toxins and other harmful substances.
It can even burden your kidneys unnecessarily.
Wee contains concentrated salts and minerals. To process salt, your kidneys need a certain amount of water. To compensate for the increased salt intake, you would need to peel more water than you receive from the urine.
This would speed up the dehydration process, so drinking in a desert is not a good idea.
