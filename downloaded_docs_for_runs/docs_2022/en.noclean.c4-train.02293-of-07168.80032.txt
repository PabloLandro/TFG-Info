Hydroquinone In Skin Lightening Creams
Hydroquinone is an aromatic organic compound and an ingredient that is usually found in cosmetic skin lightener products. The main function of this compound is to reduce dark patches of the skin by reducing melanin production in the skin. It is an effective skin lightening component that is generally used for fading acne marks, sun spots, age spots and other skin discoloration issues.
How Does Hydroquinone Work?
Hydroquinone is the most popular and most effective ingredient available in the market. The way it works is simple. It inhibits an enzyme called tyrosinase, one which is responsible to make melanin. In this way, hydroquinone reduces the production of melanin and lightens your skin.
Is Hydroquinone Safe?
The safety of a hydroquinone has been a question asked by many. There are a lot of myths associated with the usage of this compound. It is believed by many that usage of hy-droquinone leads to cancer. But there is not a lot of evidence stating and confirming that it develops cancer among people but you should still research this statement thoroughly before you decide for yourself.
It is found in some studies that large doses of hy-droquinone causes side effects but small dose is safe to use. Some argue that it is not safe at all and it is even banned in Europe countries. But, I would also argue that it is widely used in Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea and many other Asian countries.
Hydroquinone is also used in US countries and treated as a safe ingredient.
The bottom line is that it is safe to use in limited dosage, but it is important not to use it in combination with any other creams that contain peroxides or resorcinol. Also keep in mind that usage of hydroquinone must be avoided around the eye area.
What Percentage of Hydroquinone is Safe to Use?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) studies show that 2% of hy-droquinone marketed over the counter is safe to use and 4% is safe if legally prescribed by a doctor. You generally find a 2% of hy-droquinone in a skin lightener products and it is safe to consider. But, you can get 4% concentration under doctor’s prescription. Your doctor can also prescribe other skin brightener product that is combined with hy-droquinone.
Conclusion:
Even though less dosage of hydroquinone is considered safe to use, it is recommended to consult your doctor before applying it. The doctor will diagnose you by considering other medical factors and the type of skin you have. If you are under medication, your doctor may prescribe you other skin products instead of hy-droquinone.
