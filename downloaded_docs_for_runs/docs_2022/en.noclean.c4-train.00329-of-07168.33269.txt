Himalayan Salt Lamps: What Should You Know?
Posted on 11 March 2015
As part of your effort to improve your overall health, holistic methods should not be excluded. Health products, such as Himalayan salt lamps, are thought to be beneficial when used on a regular basis. If you are considering buying salt lamps, here are some of the possible benefits you can enjoy.
What Are Himalayan Salt Lamps?
A Himalayan salt lamp is carved from a large salt crystal. The lamp is usually colored and the inside has a carved out space in which a light bulb can be placed. A candle can also be used inside of it.
When lit, the salt lamp gives off a pleasing glow that can be used as mood lighting. It is the glow that emits from the lamps that are the source of the health benefits people hope to get from them.
What Are the Benefits of the Lamps?
The air that you breathe is filled with a mixture of ions. Positive ions in the air are the result of electronic devices, such as lamps, computers, and televisions. When there are more positive ions in the air than negative ions, you can have various problems, including migraines and trouble sleeping.
Negative ions tend to balance out the positive ions in the air. Negative ions are often the result of more natural events, such as storms, waterfalls, and sunlight. When they interact with the positive ions, a more neutral environment is created. That neutral environment can help to elevate your mood and overall health.
Purportedly, burning Himalayan salt lamps helps to increase the presence of negative ions in the air. As a result, the lamps can help with alleviating problems ranging from headaches to mental health disorders.
Are There Risks Associated With the Lamps?
Even if you doubt that the lamps are beneficial to your health, using them is not harmful. The lamps are considered to be a natural product and you do not have to ingest it to get any benefits.
How Should You Use the Lamps?
You can use the lamps at home or in the workplace. To maximize the benefits of the lamp, you have to focus on cleaning the air. One way is to place plants throughout your home. You can also restrict smoking in the home.
If you feel you need a pick-me-up, buy a Himalayan salt lamp and it might be the perk you need. You might find that you experience unexpected health benefits.
