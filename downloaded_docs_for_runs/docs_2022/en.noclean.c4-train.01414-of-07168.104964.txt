Journey to Hope: Leaving the Fear of Breast Cancer Behind
October 10, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff 1 Comment
Journey to Hope: Leaving the Fear of Breast Cancer Behind
now available on Kindle!
Click HERE to download.
Women fear breast cancer more than any other disease. This is true even though a woman in the United States is ten times more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than she is breast cancer. Much of the reason for this fear is that women are told there’s nothing that can be done to prevent breast cancer. They’re told only to get a yearly mammogram hoping to find it at an earlier, more treatable stage. And now, even that’s controversial.
Western medicine is so focused on family history as the overriding risk factor for breast cancer that not much else is ever discussed. But only 25% of all cases of breast cancer occur in women with a family history. What about the other 75%? How can conventional medicine be so dogmatic that breast cancer can’t be prevented when no one knows what’s causing three-quarters of the cases?
Trying to obtain information about breast cancer risk can be as confusing as it is overwhelming. So many questions. So few concrete answers. So much information. So much of it contradictory. Does it matter what I eat? Should I take vitamins? What about stress? Are emotional and psychological factors important? What about toxins in the environment?
The traditional medical view is that none of this matters. But there is much evidence to the contrary. There are simple, reasonable steps you can take that will significantly decrease your risk of developing breast cancer and decrease your risk of dying of it if you have already been diagnosed.
The key to good health and cancer prevention lies more in your own hands than you might think. What you eat, how you feel, what you think, and even what you believe affects your breast cancer risk. The focus of this website as well as my book, Journey to Hope, is self-care, which means learning to do for yourself what the medical system cannot do for you.
My goal is to dispel the current medical dogma that there’s nothing you can do to prevent this disease. The good news is—there’s a lot you can do. The bad news is—your doctor can’t do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
Dr. Hudson developed a special interest in health and wellness several years ago, especially as it relates to cancer and cancer prevention. His passion is to spread the message of self-care and prevention to women concerned about their risk of breast cancer. He counsels women one-on-one on matters of overall health and wellness, including how the mind-body connection impacts their cancer journey.
Consultation Services
Dr. Hudson is available by appointment for telephone or Skype consultations. Because of his broad experience in breast imaging and breast cancer diagnosis, he can be helpful in a number of ways:

Cancer Diet Sugar-Free Protein Packed Brownie Recipe
October 8, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff 2 Comments
These chocolate protein brownies are super easy to make – loaded with protein from the almond butter, plus antioxidants from the chocolate bar and no sugar! This is a perfect cancer patient snack. Remember use organic ingredients when possible.
Ingredients:
1 jar Almond Butter
2 eggs or egg alternative
1 cup erythritol
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup of cocoa powder
1/2 scoop of protein powder
1/2 teaspoon of sea salt
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 sugar-free dark chocolate candy bar (3-4 oz.)
Directions:
In large bowl blend almond butter with electric mixer.
Blend in eggs or substitute, then erythritol & vanilla extract.
Add cocoa, protein powder, salt, baking soda & coconut milk.
LIne 9 x 13 glass baking dish with parchment paper. Pour batter into baking dish. It will be thick and you will have press into shape.
Bake 325 for 35 – 45 minutes.
If you want brownie bite bake at 325 for 15 minutes.
I did bake this chocolate protein brownie into brownie bites and they are a bit heavy but they tasted good. You can always add sugar-free chocolate chips, chopped nuts or dried cherries or cranberries. Another great thing about these brownies is that they taste as delicious if you make a bigger batch and freeze them. Just defrost them two to three hours before you want to eat them, and they will be as good as freshly baked.

Cancer Treatment With Self-Oxygenation Therapies
October 3, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff Leave a Comment
Medical research suggests that cancer is based and caused by low oxygen levels in cells or tissue hypoxia. Of course, there are other factors like smoking that can lead to lung cancer, heredity that increases chances of breast cancer or prostate cancer or blood cancer, diet that can lead to throat or stomach or colon cancers and so forth. These factors are also important in understanding cancer causes and search for cure for cancer.
However, body oxygenation is the key factor Note that I am talking about body oxygenation since it is not just tumors, but the whole body hypoxia is required for appearance of cancer cells. Hence, cancer sure requires normal body oxygenation.
Free Download
How could baking soda or sodium bicarbonate influence body and tumor oxygenation? It releases CO2 or carbon dioxide. CO2 is dilator of blood vessels or vasodilator. It is also crucial for release of oxygen in cells due to the Bohr effect.
More information about cancer research, cancer causes, and natural alternative therapies for cancer cure: http://www.normalbreathing.com/diseases-cancer.php .
These are the key factors that increase oxygen transport to cancer cells in case when Dr. Tullio Simoncini (Italy) injects baking soda solution into the artery leading to the tumor. Therefore, baking soda cancer treatment therapy works due to increased CO2 levels in the blood that increase oxygen delivery to the cancer cells.
Cancer patients breathe much more than both norms. Furthermore, respiratory rate (breathing frequency) of cancer patients, as many studies have found, is an independent predictor of their mortality. Over breathing or hyperventilation in people with cancer causes low CO2 levels in the arterial blood and reduces oxygen levels in their bodies and tumors.
Other natural alternative treatment therapies are based on increased body oxygenation due to breathing retraining techniques, such as the Oxygen Remedy, Buteyko method, Frolov breathing device, and some other techniques that can be used for cancer cure. Find more about them since they are much more effective in treatment of cancer than foods and diets.
What about diets and foods to cure cancers? You can eat tons of supplements, vitamin B17 and super-foods, drink canisters of herbal drinks, have hundreds of colonic irrigation procedures, and practice yoga for many hours every day, but if your body oxygen level remains the same, you will suffer from the same symptoms and require the same dosage of medication.
Experience of hundreds of people using the Buteyko breathing therapy suggests that cancer tumors naturally disappear, if one gets more than 40 seconds for the body oxygen test 24/7.
Here is the link to the clinical trial on metastasized breast cancer with breathing retraining :
http://www.normalbreathing.com/diseases-cancer-1-clinical-trial.php .
Other types of cancer, like prostate cancer, blood cancer, stomach cancer, throat and lung cancers can also be addressed with these techniques.

Labyrinth Walking: A Healing Tool For Cancer Patients
October 2, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff 7 Comments
Labyrinth Walking can be a healing tool for cancer patients. In many ways the labyrinth represents the journey to healing. Healing is not only physical but also occurs on the emotional, mental, and spiritual levels. A physical healing is often described as a cure. While a cure might not be possible, healing is always an option. To be healed means to be made whole, and wholeness is fundamentally a psychological and spiritual process of finding meaning. The labyrinth can be used as a tool of healing to help people find meaning in their situation. You can find more healing tools in the book ABC Workbook for Cancer Patients.
A portable canvas labyrinth can be used and cancer patients are encouraged to walk it as a symbolic journey to recovery and healing. It is suggested that you think about your life from diagnosis through treatment up until the present moment and to relate your journey to the labyrinth walk.
Suggested questions
What is the most important lesson your illness and recovery has taught you?
How has your illness had a positive effect on your life?
How has it affected your relationships?
In what ways are you more whole than before you illness?
What about your illness are you grateful for?
How has your spirit been influenced?
What is required for continued healing?
The path towards healing is not straight and often you feel lost. Perseverance is required to complete the journey. The center represents treatment and the journey out is toward recovery and acceptance. People come and go on the journey. The whole process occurs in the container and context of love and spirit. You feel more connected and relaxed

5 Ways Yoga Benefits Cancer Post-Treatment Fatigue
October 1, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff Leave a Comment
If you’re a cancer survivor and feeling tired or even worse, even long after treatment, you are not alone. About one-third of breast cancer survivors experience this debilitating condition for anywhere from a year to several years post-treatment.
Cancer-related fatigue, (CRF)is very common in breast cancer patients. Fatigue can often be confused with tiredness. Tiredness happens to everyone. One would expect to be tired after certain activities, treatments or from daily activities. Sleep and resting is most important when recovering. Fatigue can prevent you from functioning normally and impacts your quality of life.
However, fatigue is an unusual or excessive whole-body tiredness is not relieved with sleep. It can be acute (lasting a month or less) or chronic (lasting from one month to six months or longer).
How To Cope With Cancer-Related Fatigue
The precise reason is unknown, but it may be related to the process of the disease itself or through the chemotherapies and radiation treatments. (CRF) is one of the most common side effects of cancer and its associated treatments. Usually, it comes on suddenly, does not result from activity or exertion, and is not relieved by rest or sleep. It is often described as “paralyzing.” It may continue even after treatment is complete.
What Cancer Patients Can Expect From A Yoga Practice :
women with post-treatment fatigue were still feeling more invigorated than before they started
women become more energized
women see improvement in mood and sleep
women are typically more relaxed, and more aware
women are more accepting of what life brings to them
Unfortunately there’s no conventional therapy to resolve it, but studies are increasingly showing yoga designed specifically for breast cancer survivors is helping women to catch a second wind. In fact, a recent UCLA study found that three months after beginning yoga, women with post-treatment fatigue were still feeling more invigorated than before they started. Not only do women become more energized, but they see improvement in mood and sleep; they are typically more relaxed, more aware, and more accepting of what life brings to them. All these attributes are so critical as we work toward our continued mental and physical well-being, and ultimately, our healing. We suggest ABC Workbook For Cancer Patients for additional post-treatment tools.

Breast Cancer Psychologist Offers Self-Healing Books For Patients
June 12, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff Leave a Comment
Good afternoon this is Robin Dilley from Phoenix Arizona. I’m making this video, especially for Breast Cancer Authority Blog because I think there’s a couple of fun things that you don’t know about us yet that I would like for you to know. One is Dawn Bradford and I have been collaborating and we have a project that we finished over a year ago and we’ve not done any advertising and I think it’s about time that you know about it because book two is almost ready to come out.
Our first book is Breast Cancer: A – Z Mindful Practices, this is a very simple very short trip through the alphabet. A to Z it’s designed for those people in treatment at this time and it’s designed to keep it safe simple and uncomplicated.
When I was a breast cancer patient I wanted a story that let me know how other people did it and at that time I wrote the book In a Moment’s Notice a Psychologist Journey with Breast Cancer.
In addition to my first book, I also wanted to compose something simple. There were so many medical appointments, so many treatment options, so many decisions to be made it became overwhelming. Most of the time you need something simple so I’ve created a simple book along with Dawn Bradford’s help.
This simple book has wonderful little things for you to think about, like how important is laughter, which is the L word for this book. It’s so important that we keep laughing through this process. life is short for all of us and laughter is the best medicine.
So you can pick up your copy of this today amazon.com by just typing in Breast Cancer A – Z Mindful Practices. I hope you’ll do that I hope you’ll find the book really helpful and keeping you present calm and collected through your treatment.
I just want you to know that it’s a very tedious hard journey and you are the hero in this journey so whatever we can do to help you out we want to do that and hopefully this little book will be helpful you can download it or you can buy it in paperback it’s completely up to you and I wish you the best on your journey.

Protein Rich Entree – Vegan Sausage, Spinach & White Beans
June 11, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff Leave a Comment
This one pot wonder is perfect for a breast cancer recovery diet. Easy to make and the whole family can enjoy! Also use organic ingredients when possible.
Ingredients:
1 Package of Vegan Italian Sausage
2 Cups of Vegetable Broth
2 Cloves Garlic
1 Tbsp Dried Oregano
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Can Drained Cannellini Beans
1 Can Diced Italian Tomatoes or 2 Diced Plum Tomatoes
6 Cups Baby Spinach (1 bag)
Directions:
Fry vegan spinach in Olive Oil when done add garlic and cook for 2 minutes.
Add vegetable both, beans, tomatoes cook for 7 minutes.
Add baby spinach, stir into mixture just until wilted.
Put into and sprinkle Nutritional Yeast on top.
Enjoy!
A combination of a healthful diet and physical activity seems to be particularly important, as was shown in the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study, which included 3,088 women previously diagnosed with breast cancer. Women who had at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day and averaged 30 minutes of walking 6 days per week had roughly half the risk of dying from breast cancer, compared with women who ate fewer vegetables and fruits or who were less active.
So a healthful plant-based diet helps in many ways. It makes weight control easier, helps you avoid unhealthful fats, and keeps fruits and vegetables front and center. This combination, along with regular exercise, helps prevent cancer and also reduces the risk of recurrence.

3 Broccoli Sprout Recipes For Fighting Cancer
April 16, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff Leave a Comment
Broccoli sprouts contain many cancer-busting phytochemicals (John Hopkins Scientists). Broccoli sprouts look and taste like alfalfa sprouts and are also a great addition to sandwiches, salads, juice, or as a garnish on foods such as humus. Broccoli sprouts are one of our favorite sprouts because of how easy they are to grow and add to just about any meal. Below are a few recipes that include cancer fighting broccoli sprouts.
Avocado & Broccoli Sprout Toast
Bread of choice (Sprouted Ezekial Bread)

Topical Melatonin cream for breast radiation dermatitis
April 3, 2018 by Breast Cancer Authority Staff 1 Comment
Many women who have breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer go on to have radiation treatment. One of the most common side effects of this radiation is dermatitis, causing pain, itchiness, discomfort, and blisters. A study has found that topical melatonin may prevent and reduce the severity of this dermatitis.
The goal of radiation after breast cancer surgery is to reduce the rate of local recurrence, as well as reducing the risk of death from breast cancer. But radiation dermatitis can have serious effects on quality of life and treatment compliance. Thus finding an effective treatment is important in cancer care.
One such treatment being investigated is the use of melatonin as an emulsion in a topical cream. I’ve written several blog posts about melatonin before and it’s impact on circadian rhythm, anti-cancer effects, digestive effects and more. But using it topically applied to the skin is a more recent development.
Animal and in vitro studies have shown that melatonin reduces the oxidative damage caused by radiation. And now we have a study that shows its impact in women.
Study Design
The study looked at 47 female breast cancer patients with a median age of 55 who had early stage breast cancer, stages 0-2.
The women were randomized into two groups. The melatonin group received melatonin as an emulsion in a cream, applied to the breast. The other group received a placebo cream with the same constituents as the test group, just no melatonin.
For all women, the cream was applied twice daily over the treated breast, but not within 2 hours prior to radiation.
Both groups received whole breast radiation, 5 days a week for 5 weeks.
Statistically significant results
Those who were treated with melatonin had less dermatitis than the placebo group – 59% occurrence in the melatonin group compared to 90% in the placebo group
The severity of dermatitis was less in the melatonin group compared to the placebo group
Conclusions
While the study is relatively small, the results tie in with the in vitro and animal studies and show promise for a hard-to-treat side effect that can have a considerable impact on women.
Further applications
Other studies have investigated the protective effects of melatonin on the inflammatory effects of radiation. They have shown positive effects using melatonin in REDUCING:
mucositis after gastrointestinal radiation;
radiation associated pneumonitis after chest area radiation;
enteritis associated with abdominal and pelvic radiation; and
radiation myelopathy after spinal cord radiotherapy.
Take home message
Yes, the study summarized here was only small. But along with the evidence for other protective effects against radiation side effects, this use of melatonin warrants further examination. Indeed, melatonin creams are currently readily available and are being used successfully by practitioners. However, caution is necessary regarding the timing of application in relation to radiation treatment. Talk to your healthcare practitioner if you are want to explore this further.
