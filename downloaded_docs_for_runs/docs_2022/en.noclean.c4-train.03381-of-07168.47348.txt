GOODBYE UTI -A NATURAL SUPPLEMENT FOR EVERYONE YOU LOVE
Goodbye UTI For Pets
Bacterial urinary tract infection is the most common infectious disease of dogs. And although UTIs are uncommon in young cats, the incidence is much higher in older cats.
Acquired resistance to antibiotics is of great concern in veterinary medicine and is increasing rapidly, particularly in infections in dogs and cats.
When dogs or cats get UTIs, they may strain or have difficulty urinating and they may have blood in their urine.
Goodbye UTI is a natural supplement alternative to antibiotics. And because it comes in powder form, it is so much easier to give to your pet. No more fighting to get the pills down, simply mix it into their water bowl.
Dosage: For urgent support, one scoop/teaspoon every 2-3 hours. Please consider weight - a smaller pet may need only a quarter to half a teaspoon. Continue during the night until problems resolve, and then reduce slowly. To avoid recurrences, use a half-dose daily.
Take your pet to the veterinarian if symptoms do not resolve within 48 hours of starting Goodbye UTI.

Goodbye UTI For Men
Urinary tract infections are rare in young men, but risk increases as a man ages; UTIs are more common in men after the age of 50.
Besides age, there are additional factors that put men at a greater risk for getting UTIs including an enlarged prostate gland or kidney stones.
Goodbye UTI, a natural supplement alternative to antibiotics, can help alleviate urinary tract infection symptoms.
Dosage: For an active UTI, one scoop every 2-3 hours for the first 24 hours. To avoid recurrences, one scoop daily.
If fever, chills or back pain are still present within 48 hours of starting Goodbye UTI contact your physician. These symptoms are signs that the disease has spread to the kidneys or the upper urinary tract, which is a more serious problem that requires prompt treatment.

Goodbye UTI For Seniors
A urinary tract infection in the elderly rarely causes clear symptoms such as burning sensation or frequency of urination; in fact, it might not involve pain or discomfort at all.
For this group, common warning signs of a UTI might include: the onset of elderly urinary incontinence, confusion or not being able to do tasks they could easily do a day or two before.
Antibiotics are the first choice of treatment. But depending on the age and health of the patient, the UTI treatment can take weeks and perhaps involve hospitalization for the administration of intravenous antibiotics. Goodbye UTI, a natural supplement, can help seniors avoid this.
Dosage: For an active UTI, 1 scoop in 8 oz. of water should be taken every 3 hours for 48 hours. Symptoms should abate within the first 24 hours. To avoid recurrences, 1 scoop should be taken in a glass of water every day.
