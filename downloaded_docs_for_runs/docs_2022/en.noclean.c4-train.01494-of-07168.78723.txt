Have you noticed more and more products on the shelves claiming to fade away age spots and freckles? A big business in Asia, skin lightening/brightening creams have hit our shores. There are a several effective ways to lighten skin, but they do have their risks. There is a lot of information to cover in one post so today I'm going to focus on the most popular skin-lightening ingredient, hydroquinone. Look for future posts regarding other popular skin lighteners.
What is hydroquinone?
Hydroquinone is proven to be one of the most effective skin-lightening ingredients available but also one of the most controversial. It works by decreasing the formation of melanin, the pigment in your skin that gives it color.
I s it safe?
Unfortunately, there doesn`t seem to be a clear consensus in the scientific community. In the US, the FDA generally recognizes hydroquinone to be a safe and effective ingredient (at the moment). However, due to more recent data suggesting that hydroquinone act as a carcinogen, the FDA is recommending further studies to be conducted by the NTP (National Toxicology Program) to evaluate the health related effects of hydroquinone. These studies have not yet been completed so the current safety status of hydroquinone in the US has not changed. However, many companies are looking for safer alternatives to hydroquinone.
The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) does continue to cite hydroquinone as a way to treat dark spots as well as other skin disorders such as melasma (overproduction of melanin resulting in dark patches on the face). However, the AAD does warn that overuse of hydroquinone could lead to irritation and potential darkening of the skin.
In Europe, where regulations tend to be a bit different, hydroquinone has been banned. This reminds us of how different countries treat chemicals differently. For example, the US has banned the artificial sweetener cyclamate because of studies showing that it might act as a carcinogen, yet it is allowed in more than 100 other countries. Who's right, who's wrong? Unfortunately, even science isn't always black and white.
Bottom Line
As of now, hydroquinone is considered safe in the US. If you have concerns, I'd suggest talking to your dermatologist to see what she recommends to deal with with your dark spots. Of course, one of the best ways to treat age spots is to not get them all. UV exposure is one of the biggest culprits of dark spot formation so be sure to wear sunscreen and minimize sun exposure to keep skin spot free! Also, if you ever have questions about what is in your beauty products - just look at the label. The beauty of ingredient lists is that you can read the package and decide for yourself if the product is right for you or not.
