4 Things You Should Know About UTIs in Men
Although urinary tract infections traditionally affect women, men are far from immune to this condition. To help you recognize these infections and react to them in time, here are some things you should know about urinary tract infections in men.
Common Symptoms
UTIs in men can sometimes manifest with no symptoms. However, if symptoms do show up, they usually include:
Frequent need to urinate;
Pain while urinating;
Blood in urine;
Pain in the lower abdomen;
Urine leakage or a slow urine stream.
You can also find it hard to start urinating or keep a steady, long stream instead of short bursts.
Risk Factors and Causes
Men over the age of 50 are more likely to get diagnosed with a UTI. Most of these infections are caused by Escherichia coli – a bacterium that is naturally found in our bodies. Cases of urinary tract infections in younger men are rare, and similar symptoms are more often caused by STIs.
Treatment
Urinary tract infections in men are most often treated with antibiotics. They can prevent the growth of bacteria and stop the infection from spreading to the upper urinary tract or the kidneys. Depending on the severity of the infection, the treatment can last from three days to several weeks.
Prevention
There are several things you can do to prevent a UTI:
Drinking a lot of water;
Urinating more often;
Using protection during sex;
Cleaning your genitals carefully, especially after sex and urination.
Final Word
Urinary tract infections in men may not be as common as in women, but they can certainly be an unpleasant experience. Take the necessary steps to prevent them and contact your doctor if you notice any of the above mentioned symptoms.
