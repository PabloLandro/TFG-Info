Vaccines and Autism
Parenting By The Doctors Staff on 4:00 AM PDT, August 29, 2012
Vaccinations employ an innocuous form of a disease agent, such as a dead or weakened bacteria or virus, to stimulate antibody production in the body. In the United States, children are generally vaccinated at a young age for diseases from chickenpox and measles to tetanus and rubella; however, some parents are concerned that these vaccinations can cause autism.
Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center, says her son, Chris, was vaccinated with a DPT shot then immediately suffered a convulsion and was later diagnosed with brain damage. Barbara insists that the vaccination and successive events were not a coincidence and points out that billions of dollars have been awarded to families of vaccinated children under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that that there is no relationship between vaccines and autism rates in children. Research specifically studied the ingredient thimerosal, which was previously used as a preservative in childhood vaccines. It has since been removed or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines except for one type of flu shot. Findings from a number of studies do not support the association between thimerosal and autism, which has been confirmed by the Institue of Medicine. Source: CDC
"I don't think you should ever ban a child from getting healthcare," E.R. physician Dr. Travis Stork says. "In an article I read recently, there was a big study done by the Institute of Medicine that looked at 1,000 [subjects] and found that vaccines are very safe."
