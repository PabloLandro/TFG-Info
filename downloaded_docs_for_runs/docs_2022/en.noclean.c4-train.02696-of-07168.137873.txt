[post_content] => Warts and skin tags share a common feature, namely, the fact that they basically are growths on the skin. Their causes, however, are not in any way related.
Unlike warts, skin tags will not keep coming back periodically. As long as the source of friction that caused them initially is eradicated, they can go away for good. We can compare them to infestations such as scabies in humans. All you need to do is keep away from the external cause and they will be avoided permanently. Warts on the other hand are unfortunately eternal. Once infected with the HPV virus that causes them, they will keep coming and going.
The good thing is that a wart remover kit can be used for both skin conditions effectively.
Can you use wart remover on skin tags
So, can you use wart remover on skin tags? The answer is absolutely yes! The remover usually contains a compound known as salicylic acid.
As you may already know, acids produce a corrosive effect to the skin and other materials. The corrosion occurs when parts of the skin are digested away by the acid. Although this can be very dangerous and harmful where strong acids are used, this effect can be taken advantage of with mild acids.
[RELATED]
This is what happens with wart removers. When applied on warts or skin tags, the acid eats away the skin growths layer by layer. With time, the whole growth will disappear.
It is advised that you use a pumice stone to keep rubbing off the dead skin debris that will form on top of the skin tag. This will speed up the remover process as well as ensure that the acid penetrates inside the skin tags appropriately.
How to use wart remover for skin tags; how it works
Here is how to use wart remover for skin tags:
The first thing you will need to do is ascertain that it is a skin tag you indeed are dealing with. A mole on the face, for example, can be easily mistaken for a skin tag.
Go through some of the available top removal brands available today. Compound-W freeze is a good example.
Use the remover on the skin tags, just as instructed in the user manual. The products can be irritating to the eyes or other sensitive areas. In fact, you are not advised to use the same at home to remove a wart on the eyelid.
The skin tags may take a while before finally going away. The important thing is to follow the provided guidelines. Also, ensure that the remover is not applied on cracked areas or on open sores.
Does wart remover work on skin tags; can you use it?
Does wart remover work on skin tags? Can you use it on other skin conditions apart from warts? Not only is a wart remover effective on skin tags but it can also be used on moles and razor burn.
[RELATED]
Although most remover kits work almost exactly the same, differing use guidelines may be provided. Also, ensure that you are not treating a wrongly identified skin condition. If you are not certain, try comparing images and pictures. If that doesn't confirm your suspicion, get a medical diagnosis.
Removing skin tags with a wart remover kit
A wart remover kit can make use of other removal methods apart from salicylic acid. Here are some other ways that you can try when removing skin tags with a wart remover kit:
You can just cut off the tags with a pair of scissors. This method is not advised for large skin tags.
TagBands can be used the same way you can use a string to remove skin tags at home. The good thing is that they are more customizable than strings.
Over the counter freeze kits can be used the same way liquid nitrogen is used in clinics. They are, however, not as effective as clinical cryotherapy.
The remover kit can also come with a cauterization tool. It is simple to use once the provided guidelines are followed.
You may need to consult your doctor if the skin tags are too large. On average, a skin tag should not measure more than 5 mm. Anything larger than that will invite complications when trying to treat it at home. In this case, incision and electric burning are better options.
Using home remedies with a wart remover for skin tags
Remedies such as apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil can be of great help when used with removal kits. As well as speeding up the removal process, they also protect from possible infections.
In fact, such remedies will be the best options to treat skin tags that may be bruised or are causing swollen lymph nodes. Although it rarely occurs, open sores caused by continued friction on the tags can result in injured skin tags.

[post_content] => Skin tags are generally small. They tend to appear on parts of the body that are prone to friction. If left untreated, they can fall off the skin or continue to grow bigger.
Large skin tags will not develop into malignant tumors. However, it is very necessary that you be certain that it is definitely a skin tag you are dealing with. Skin growths that continue to gain mass and size can be pretty dangerous.
Removing large skin tags under the arm and other body parts
First, we will need to set the limits for when a skin tag will be considered big. On average, they will not get larger than 5mm across. Big skin tags however will get to the sizes of grapes or figs. This means that they can even measure 1-5 cm across.
[RELATED]
In these cases, most home remedies will not work. Therefore, medical treatments for removing large skin tags will be necessary.
Skin tags on the buttocks, under the arm and on the inner thighs can continue growing in size due to constant friction on those parts.
How to remove large skin tags; clinical removal for big skin tags
A skin tag can occur singly or in clusters. As we have already observed, you will not succeed in trying to remove a big skin tag at home especially one on the back or on the buttocks.
When it comes to how to remove large skin tags in a clinic, any of the following methods can be used:
Incision
This involves surgically cutting off the skin tag by the stalk. You find that the tags are attached to the skin through a skinny stalk which can be cut. Small skin tags can be removed this way at home.
In a clinic, a doctor will probably need to administer anesthesia. The whole process is not that complicated. In fact, it won’t take more than 30 minutes.
You are not advised to try this at home. Skin tag stalks contain networks of blood vessels. For this reason, cutting them at home is risky.
Laser treatment
In this case, the tags will be poisoned using controlled laser beams. With time, the tags will die off and fall from the skin. For large skin tags, this method may take several appointments to work effectively.
Electrical treatment
Electricity is used to generate heat, which is then used to burn the skin tags. With time, the burned areas will die off and the tag will detach from the skin.
Freezing
Liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze the big skin tags and in the process inhibit blood circulation. Without being provided with nutrients in this way, the skin tags will die and fall off.
Expect for incision, the other removal techniques might not be very effective in removing very large skin tags. In fact, a doctor may have to use a combination of them to get effective results. For example, a skin tag can be frozen and then burned with an electric current. A skin tag removal cream can also be applied to fasten the removal process.
Can you remove large skin tags yourself at home?
Removal at home works best for small and averagely sized skin tags. Even if you are to buy over the counter removal kits and creams, they most likely will not be effective.
[RELATED]
It is just the same as when you want to get rid of scabies. You can use home remedies but you will still need to have a doctor treat the same if the mites and their eggs are to be removed completely.
How to remove large skin tags yourself on inner thighs
Big skin tags on the inner thigh might force you to search for ways remove large skin tags yourself. If for example we are to take the method of salicylic acid, which is the active ingredients in most over the counter removal creams, the acid will need to penetrate the skin to remove the tags.
As it happens, big skin tags, especially like the ones occurring on the inner thigh, are thicker than the skin itself. Bearing in mind that over the counter creams for skin tags removal at home may take up to weeks to be effective, you can see why it is not necessary to even try them.
Such removal creams and home remedies will work better for simpler conditions such as pimples on the penis or a mole on the scalp.
How to remove large skin tags with home remedies
Remedies such as tea tree oil and castor oil for skin conditions can be used to address infected big skin tags but not to remove them.
If it happens that a skin tag gets to the extent of becoming bruised due to constant pressure, a home remedy can be used to avoid infections, including genital herpes and bacterial entry.
Cost of removing large skin tags in groin area
Whether in the groin area, on the back or even on the buttocks, the cost of removing big skin tags will not vary depending on location. Rather, factors such as the number of the tags, type of clinic and things like these will be considered.
[RELATED]
The cost can fall anywhere between $150 and $300. Actual costs will always be confirmed after a doctor has examined the tags.
Is removing large skin tags on buttocks necessary
Big skin tags on the buttocks or any other body part do not pose serious health risks. In fact, they will not even produce swollen lymph nodes.
The problem is that they can be a real cause of discomfort and embarrassment. If the skin tags are not bothering you in any way, you can leave them be. They will fall off the skin with time. However, if you really need them removed, removal at home is ill advised and won’t be effective.

[post_content] => Warts on the genital region and skin tags are among the most common skin conditions today. It is unlikely that you will go your whole life without experiencing a single one of them.
There quite a number of differences that can be identified when comparing these conditions. This should not fool you however. In fact, most untrained persons can't successfully tell one from the other.
Before we get down to examining the most common differences, it is important to point out that pictures and images are a great tool that can help you tell one from the other.
What is the difference between genital warts and skin tags?
The main difference between genital warts and skin tags revolves around the cause and appearance. All warts are caused by HPV virus. This is not the same virus that causes herpes on the penis and genitals. Skin tags, on the other hand, arise when two body parts are in contact with one another and produce friction. This includes friction felt during sexual intercourse. It is a main cause of skin tags on the genitals. Any factor that will contribute to these causes will definitely result in either warts or skin tags.
[RELATED]
When it comes to appearance, skin tags are more like projections which are connected to the skin by a skinny stalk. This stalk can be easily cut with a razor or a pair of scissors. They take the color of the skin. Warts on the other hand are not projections but skin growths. Their mass is evenly distributed. While some may appear a bit raised, most are flattened on the part of skin they occur. Upon touch, they feel very soft and fleshly. Warts too are skin-colored.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; what causes them
Sexual intercourse is the main mode of transmission when it comes to genital warts. An infected person can pass the virus even when they don't show the symptoms. Since it is a viral infection, wart removal can only be done to get rid of the symptoms, namely the the skin growths, but not the virus. In fact, recurrent attacks will continue to occur throughout one’s life.
Skin tags are not typical infections. They in fact will not cause swollen lymph nodes or even pain unless physically injured. When frequent friction is sustained on a part of the body such as the buttocks, inner thighs, under arm and such, a projection will form. It can continue getting bigger with time.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; identifying them in pictures
If you are to take close-up pictures, genital warts will resemble cauliflowers and should not be confused with genital pimples. Areas around the anus, on the penis shaft, vaginal walls, vulva and penis tip are the most probable areas to find them.
[RELATED]
Although they may occur on the cervix, chances are high that they will then spread to the outside of the vagina.
Skin tags are unpredictable in regards to where they will occur. In pictures, they should resemble a literal skin-colored tag.
How to treat skin tags and genital warts
While some treatment methods can be used for both, genital warts may need medically prescribed medications to fight the virus.
Treatments for genital warts aim to inhibit the spread of the causal virus and at the same time get rid of the skin growths themselves.
Skin tags treatment methods only aim to get rid of the growths and not the cause. In both cases, clinical treatment may be necessary where home remedies have failed to work.
[RELATED]
Remedies such as tea tree oil can be tried on both. They are effective especially for skin tags on the face and other sensitive areas. There also are over the counter removal kits which can be used for the same removal purpose.
Are skin tags and genital warts contagious?
Skin tags do not pass from one person to another. They also do not spread to other body parts courtesy of an initial infection.
Genital warts are, on the other hand, very contagious. They can spread to other people or to other body parts. Just like with herpes, the virus takes advantage of open sores or cracks on the skin for entry points. It is for this reason that it is possible to contract herpes on the leg and other unlikely parts such as the shoulders.

[post_content] => Projections that attach to the skin through a thin stalk and take on the color of the flesh are likely going to be skin tags. They can appear on any part of the body but areas prone to friction are more susceptible.
Removal options for these skin growths are varied. It all depends on user preference and the size of the tags. Even if left untreated, they will not develop into serious health conditions. They are a source of discomfort and potential embarrassment however.
What do skin tags in groin area look like in pictures
In pictures, skin tags on groin area resemble literal tags that are skin-colored. In fact, you can compare them to a flesh-colored tick from a distance.
Since the groin area is prone to constant friction, the skin tags can sustain injuries, become irritated and cause pain. Under normal conditions, they should be not itchy or painful. In fact, they may just detach from the skin with time. This can take longer than you may be willing to wait.
What causes skin tags in the groin area?
You may have noticed a tendency of developing the tags in the groin area. In fact, they will usually develop into large tags, as compared to ones on other parts such as skin tags on the neck.
[RELATED]
You will find that as long as the source of friction that led to formation of the initial tag is not addressed, the tag will keep increasing in size. This is the common cause of large tags in the groin area.
Other possible causes include:
Hormonal changes – it is thought that hormonal changes, especially in pregnant women, contribute to the development of the tags on the groin. Adding to the fact that more pressure and friction will be exerted on the groin, the chances of developing tags are multiplied.
Obesity – too much accumulation of fat under the skin causes skin folds. The folds will continuously rub against each other. It will be only a matter of time before skin tags appear.
Use of steroids – steroids work by collecting the pulling tissues of the skin together. (This is a layman's explanation but it will serve). For this reason, they will encourage the formation of skin tags.
Age – age comes with loosened skin due to loss of collagen. This encourages the formation of tags on the skin.
Diabetes – diabetes and other factors that result from insulin disorders are thought to encourage the growth of skin tags.
Any of the above factors can individually cause skin tags. When more than one factor comes together, large tags are bound to form. This is especially true in parts such as the groin.
Are skin tags on groin area sexually transmitted
Skin tags even on the penis or vagina are not transmitted through sexual intercourse. In fact, they are not contagious at all. You should be worrying more about unlikely conditions such as herpes on the fingers where matters of skin issues being contagious are concerned.
[RELATED]
However, bruised and red skin tags especially around the genital area can act as entry points for the causal virus of various STDs and bacteria. Any sore or crack near the genital area will encourage the spread of herpes even where no active sexual intimacy has occurred.
How to remove skin tags in the groin area
You probably don’t find it comfortable to get medical assistance for removal for tags on the groin. In this case, over the counter and home remedies are likely to be the options of choice.
Here are the over the counter options that are available:
Freezing kits – just like clinical cryotherapy, some over the counter kits can be used to remove the tags in the privacy of your home. They come with instructions on how to use.
Electrocauterization – there are all types of over the counter skin tags removal kits these days. In this case, you can use a cauterization tool to kill off the tags by burning them.
Tying them – a TagBand is more user friendly and customizable. However, you can simply use a string to cut off the blood supply into the skin tag. With time, it will fall off.
Cutting them off – although they contain blood vessels, the stalks that join skin tags to the skin are thinner than the tags themselves. For this reason, you can use a pair of scissors to manually cut them off.
Tea tree oil – unlike apple cider vinegar for skin tags, tea tree oil can be used even on the sensitive groin area. It is very mild and in fact will protect from potential infection on injured tags.
Can you remove large skin tags in groin area yourself?
Unless you are confident enough to get medical treatment, you should not let allow large tags to develop. As we saw earlier, the chances of large tags developing in the groin are very high.
All of the self-removal methods that we have discussed above will work for small and averagely sized tags. Large tags are another issue. For the purposes of this article, large tags are anything measuring more than 1 cm in diameter.
[RELATED]
Even if you were to try creams, home remedies or even incisions on large tags on groin, chances are that the methods will fail or you will end up suffering more injuries that will need immediate medical attention.
If you think about it, removing large tags on your own will do more harm than good. Just get medical attention for them. In any case, there are more serious and private things that doctors deal with every day.

[post_content] => In normal cases, warts and skin tags will take on the color of the skin. Moles, on the other hand, can appear black, tan, pink or even red. The important thing is to keep checking that a certain skin growth doesn’t continually change its appearance.
It occasionally happens that moles, skin tags or warts may turn black, with or without treatment. Most people start to worry when that happens, and for a good reason. Skin growths turning black can be a sign of serious problems such as melanoma, a deadly skin cancer. But they can also be indications that a skin growth is finally dying off.
Remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for canker sore treatment, can be used to hasten the healing process and inhibit spread.
What does it mean when a wart turns black?
Pictures and images show that a wart or warts in a cluster can turn black. Here, the entire wart or the whole area covered by a cluster of the warts will also turn black. Basically, it will appear as a large darkened spot or patch.
So what does it mean when a wart turns black? In most cases, it is an indication that a wart has reached its final stages and is finally dying off. This can happen naturally or after treatment.
[RELATED]
Normally, warts last between 6 months and 2 years without treatment to get rid of warts. In that time, the immune system will fight off the virus and cause a natural demise to the warts. Before they are shed from the body, the warts will turn black and fall off the skin.
Plantar warts often turn black before healing. Since plantar warts mostly appear inside the skin of the sole, much like a callus, they will leave a hole behind once healed. It is very important that treatment is continued even after warts have turned black and no longer hurt. Until they have fallen off the skin, they still can be spread.
If a wart turns black and continues to be painful for more than 2 weeks, have a doctor check the same. It could be an infection of some kind.
Note that there is a difference between herpes sores and warts. For example, herpes on the face will form open sores and may not persist longer than warts.
What is the meaning of a skin tag turning black overnight?
You might wake up one day to a skin tag turned black overnight. It shouldn't be something to keep you up at night, though.
For example, the same thing that causes hemorrhoids can turn skin tags black. Body parts prone to a lot of friction such as the anal region are susceptible to black skin tags. As friction and pressure are exerted on the tags, blood vessels are likely to become constricted, leading to blood clots.
Treatment options such as laser, cryotherapy and remedies used against genital skin tags can also cause skin tags to turn black. In fact, any treatment method that works by cutting off blood supply into the skin tag will turn it black.
[RELATED]
Basically, skin tags turning black is an indication that the tag is healed and will fall off the skin in due time. It is not an absolute must that it turns completely black. Some will merely turn reddish before detaching from the skin.
In two weeks or less, a black skin tag should fall off the skin. If that period is exceeded, blackened skin tags can be an indication of some infection. A doctor or a dermatologist should be consulted in that case.

Some moles are black from the very beginning. Some may turn black afterwards. Depending on other factors that we will discuss here, a mole that has turned black can be normal or a sign of melanoma.
The initial cause that resulted in the formation of a black mole can encourage it to turn even darker. For example, continued exposure to UV rays can make moles more darkly pigmented or lead to the formation of other dark moles.
Some moles naturally change color or are multi-colored. Whatever the case, changes should not be frequent or rapid.
Some infections or infestations may cause scarring on the moles and turn them black. For example, scabies in humans is likely to cause some forms of scarring. If they attack a spot where a mole is located, they can contribute to it turning black.
Signs that a mole that has turned black is cancerous
It is important that you get information on the signs that will indicate a mole that has turned black is cancerous. In fact, you might want to compare before and after images/pictures of your moles to identify any observable changes.

For best results, use a full mirror every day after your bath to examine your moles.
Here are the common signs that a mole that turned black is cancerous:
It is not symmetrical. The mole will have two unequal halves
The edges or borders are irregular. Normally, a mole will be circular with well defined borders
Keeps changing color or has multiple colors. Although some normal moles will appear in different colors, they should be consistent and not appear overnight or in patches
Large sized spots than measure more than 6 mm in diameter. If you notice any increment in size and mass, see a doctor immediately. Rapid growth is a common feature in cancerous skin growths
Lastly, a mole should maintain appearance, shape and size for significantly long enough. You should not wake up one morning to find that your mole has suddenly changed in size or color.
How to treat a mole, skin tag or wart that has turned black
It is likely that you are already under some treatment if any of the above named skin growths were to turn black. If not, you may not even need to start treatment.
For skin tags, they are not contagious. If they are not painful or infected, you can leave them to fall off the skin. Remedies such as tea tree oil and castor oil can hasten this process. For warts, you will need to continue treatment even when they have turned black. This is mainly meant to avoid spread. For moles, if you are not certain that they are not cancerous, treatment should be done by a qualified doctor in a clinic after diagnosis.

[post_content] => Common skin growths such as moles, skin tags and warts usually heal on their own even without clinical treatment. Just like canker sores, waiting for them to heal naturally can take longer than you are willing to wait. This is bearing in mind that they can be a source of both discomfort and embarrassment.
Doctors will usually diagnose a skin growth after a physical examination. For moles and warts, a shave biopsy may be needed to affirm that they are not cancerous or infected.
The actual cost of treatment will depend on the location and number of skin growths to be treated. Doctors will discuss the same before going ahead with removal. It is important that you check and see if your insurance plan will cover the cost. Most skin growth removal treatments are considered aesthetic and are not covered by insurance plans.
How do doctors remove moles; what type of doctor removes moles
Even a regular doctor can remove or diagnose cancerous moles. You can consider calling and ask if a certain hospital or clinic offers the removal procedures for moles.
However, a certified dermatologist is the best doctor to see for mole removal. They can remove moles on any part of the body and also advise what to do in case of cancerous moles.
[RELATED]
And how do doctors remove moles? There are about 3 main methods that doctors use to remove moles. They include:
Burning – this is not the literal burning you may be thinking of. Here, a current is run through a wire and used to generate heat. The wire is then used to burn off the top layers of the mole.
Incision – a minor surgery is carried out to shave the moles. Since some moles may be rooted deep into the skin, the doctor may need to remove some surrounding skin. The surgery requires use of a local anesthetic.
Freezing them off – this is a very popular removal technique. It is also used to get rid of warts and skin tags at home. Here, a very cold substance is used to kill the moles off, and they will then detach from the skin with time.
A doctor may also suggest some creams or home remedies such as used for herpes throat treatment to speed up mole removal.
How do doctors remove skin tags; what kind of doctor to see?
Skin tags are easy to remove. In fact, you can do it at home with remedies such as tea tree oil. In case of infected or very large skin tags, you may need to see a doctor for removal.
Skin tags can be removed in general hospitals or private clinics. However, a dermatologist will likely get the job done more effectively, as they are specialists. This is especially true for skin tags occurring on the face or for infected red skin tags.
So, how do doctors remove skin tags? Like moles, skin tags can be removed by cutting them off, burning them, freezing and use of laser therapy. Laser therapy sees the stalk on which the tags attach on the skin poisoned and killed off. With time, the tags will fall off the skin.
[RELATED]
Some doctors will use a combination of removal options for better results. For example, a doctor can freeze the skin tags using liquid nitrogen. After that, they will prescribe a cream, gel or pad containing a corrosive agent. Salicylic acid is a good example of corrosive agents used in such gels and creams.
Clinical methods to remove skin tags fast usually leave a scar. Incision and burning for example will almost guarantee scarring. It is for this reason that freezing and use of salicylic acid is generally preferred.
How do doctors remove warts; genital warts removal in a doctor’s office
If you are certain that it is warts you are dealing with, you may want to visit a doctor’s office for strategic treatment methods. You can succeed in removing even genital warts at home. The problem is that they will keep coming back if the root cause is not addressed.
A doctor will most likely choose to freeze warts, just the same way it is done in skin tags and moles. Laser therapy and burning can also be used but not commonly. Rarely will the warts be surgically cut off, especially in the case of genital warts.
Since the virus that causes warts hides in the body even when there are no symptoms, medications to avoid recurrent outbreaks are usually given in a clinic.
You will also be given some medications or guidelines to ensure that you do not spread the warts to healthy people near you. Unlike skin tags and moles, warts are very contagious.
During treatment, warts will turn black and fall off the body. Even when that happens, medications and treatment should not be stopped until the warts fall off the body completely. It is the same thing that happens when taking medicine for ringworm. You have to keep taking it until the prescribed period is over.
How do doctors remove genital warts?
Unlike plantar warts on the foot, genital warts can be a bit difficult to treat. This is on top of the fact that most people are not willing to get clinical treatment for the same, due to embarrassment.
[RELATED]
Depending on what kind of doctor you have visited, the warts can be burned, frozen, poisoned with laser or trimmed with a scalpel.
You can also be given prescribed medications to fasten the healing process or control spread. Except for in the case of cutting them off, most wart removal methods will require more than one application.
How do doctors freeze remove warts?
To freeze warts, liquid nitrogen is used. Since the substance is extremely cold, it kills off most of the warts and their blood vessels.
There are some kits available that you can use to freeze warts at home. They are not as effective as the procedure done in a doctor’s office.
How do doctors remove moles, skin tags and warts; cost in a doctor’s office
Depending on what type of doctor or clinic you are having the skin growths removed, the cost will vary. On average, the removal cost falls anywhere between $100 and $300.
You can always have the doctor discuss the cost during consultation and after examination.

[post_content] => A mole, skin tag or even a wart appearing anywhere on the skin should generally be painless. Different causes and predisposing factors are responsible for these skin conditions. However, similar causes can turn them painful or make them change in color and shape.
Skin tags will rarely turn into cancer even when painful. Painful or injured warts will increase the chances of spreading but also will rarely end up in cancer. Moles are different. If they become painful and experience sudden and persistent changes in growth, they really should be checked in a doctor's office.
Treatments done at home can be effective but in some cases will end up in painful sores that call for even more medical attention. For people with conditions such as diabetes and hemophilia, practices such as cutting off skin growths should not be done at home. They can lead to excess bleeding or skin ulcers.
What does a painful mole on the back and other body parts mean
A mole is formed when melanocytes bundle in a single spot. Melanocytes are the cells that make the skin appear the way it does in regards to color. Factors such as too many UV rays can force the cells to spread and possibly accumulate in a single spot. When this happens, the affected spot will have a darker pigmentation. That is what a mole is. Other factors such as accumulated blood vessels in a single spot can still result in a red mole.
[RELATED]
Like any other part of the skin, moles can sustain injuries. They have blood vessels and nerve endings. Therefore, any injury sustained on them will cause pain in the mole. Injuries can be caused by cuts when shaving or any external trauma of that kind. Such injuries should heal in 2 weeks or less.
A painful mole can still be a sign of melanoma. This is a type of cancer of the skin that is most deadly. Although only 1 in every 10 or more moles will end up in such cancer, chances should not be taken. Following are the characteristics of normal moles that can help you identify a cancerous mole before it develops into later stages:
Measures less than quarter of an inch
It should have regularly defined edges
Most are round
It should be evenly colored
Some are raised while some appear flat on the skin
Any of the above features should be maintained for a significant period of time. Although most moles keep evolving, there should never come a time that too many changes occur in a very short duration of time.
See a doctor should a painful mole persist more than 14 days.
Can a painful skin tag on buttocks be treated?
It is common for a painful skin tag to appear on the buttocks and other areas where constant friction or pressure is sustained. The same can happen to skin tags on the finger or on the thumb. Such skin tags are prone to picking, catching, and other sources of trauma.
A painful skin tag can also appear to darken overnight. This is mainly caused by clotted blood inside the skin tags. The condition can be painful and worrying. If left untreated, the tag will run out of blood supply and will fall off in less than 2 weeks. It is not a sign of cancer at all.
[RELATED]
When it comes to treatment, the best way to remove a painful skin tag on the buttocks or related areas is incision. Here, the tag will be surgically removed by a doctor, using a scalpel. A doctor may also decide to use a combination of removal techniques such as cryotherapy and burning. All of these options will depend on the location and the size of the tag.
At home, the same can be removed with over the counter kits used for wart removal or with home remedies. The most important thing is to ensure that the injured or painful skin tag does not act as an entry point for bacteria and other infections such as herpes.
What causes a painful wart after treatment?
Warts form when HPV virus is active. They appear as soft raised or flat growths on the affected parts of the body. Without treatment, it can take between 6 months and 2 years for the immune system to fight them off the body.
In normal conditions, warts should not cause pain but are often itchy. In fact, it is the urge to keep scratching them that will ultimately lead to a painful wart.
A wart can also get painful after treatment. Since they are generally very soft, treatment methods can cause slight injuries to the warts. As it is with any other body part, injuries will be felt as pain.
A doctor will most likely choose to freeze the painful wart. This kills both the blood vessels and nerve endings on the wart. Practically speaking, the wart will then be dead and will fall off in a matter of days or a few weeks.
What is the best treatment for genital warts and painful sores?
Since warts are viral, it is practically a guarantee that they will re-appear even after treatment. Most of the available treatment options mainly focus on getting rid of the visible warts but not the cause. The problem is that viral infections never clear out of the body completely after the initial infection.
[RELATED]
Nowadays, doctors are making use of treatment drugs that boost the immune system and in the process may eradicate genital warts and painful sores. For example, Dermisil is gaining a lot of popularity as an immune strengthener. You can ask your doctor for such medications. They generally give you the ability to resist re-current wart attacks and also reduce the chances of developing painful infected warts.
Chances are high that a painful genital wart will be spread to sexual partners. In fact, it is not even necessarily a key factor that you engage in active sexual intercourse to pass the HPV virus, if you or your partner has open wart sores.
Can a painful wart on foot be spread on thumb or finger?
A wart on the foot is referred to as a plantar wart. A painful wart on the foot is referred to as a verruca. As you may suspect, the pain is usually caused by injuries sustained in parts of the feet that the warts appear on.
A plantar wart on the heel is almost guaranteed to be painful, especially when walking. Rather than being raised, such a wart will appear pressed into the skin of the sole and appear more like a scar than a skin growth. With time, it will feel like a cyst and may even alter both posture and gait.
A painful wart on the foot can spread and appear on the thumb or hands. If, for example, you are to walk barefooted in the bathroom or a wet floor, anyone with open sores or cracks in their feet who walks the floor after you will catch the virus upon contact.
The warts can also appear on the fingers after frequenting picking and scratching. Any cracks or openings on the finger will certainly act as entry points for the causal virus for the warts.
You are advised to maintain hygienic practices such as washing your hands with antiseptic soaps after touching or picking at warts. In fact, avoid any chances of touching open warts sores. They are most contagious when infected.
Home remedies to treat painful plantar warts and warts on the finger
Home remedies are a great option, both to treat and to curb the spread of a painful plantar wart. Apple cider vinegar for skin tags for example has antiviral properties. It can be used to stop the spread of the wart virus. Caution should be taken when using this remedy, for it can irritate and cause a lot of pain on open sores.
[RELATED]
Castor oil can also be used with baking soda to keep the warts from spreading. Of all remedies to be used at home, tea tree oil is perhaps the best to use against warts. It is very gentle on the skin but still has the antiviral and anti-inflammation properties.
Aloe Vera is a common ingredient in ringworm medications. It can be applied on painful warts to reduce the chances of spread and infections. You may  that remedies to be used at home work best when used in combinations. For example, you can use essential oils together with cold compress or over the counter removal kits.

[post_content] => Warts develop externally on the skin. Rather than occurring on the testicles, they may appear on the scrotal sac.
There are high chances that you are mistaking another type of skin growth with warts on the testicles. Pimples and cysts are common on the scrotal sac and can have a resemblance with warts.
To be certain, you can take pictures and compare them with images available for genital warts. You can in fact get a diagnosis from an online doctor if you don’t welcome the idea of visiting a clinic.
Can you get warts on testicles?
It is possible but very rare to get warts on testicles. In fact, only 1 in 100 patients will develop these warts. In men, warts mostly appear on the penile shaft and in the regions surrounding the anus. The scrotal sac is least commonly affected.
[RELATED]
Warts on the testicles can occur if you are having a severe attack and open warts or sores. The causal virus is contagious and takes advantage of any cracks on the skin around the genital area.
What do warts on testicles look like in pictures?
In pictures and images, warts on the scrotum will appear as flattened or raised skin growths. They mostly appear in clusters and are shaped like a cauliflower. Unless infected or in final stages of healing, they will take the color of the skin.
Generally speaking, all types of warts are not painful but may get itchy. Pain is an indication that the warts are infected or have sustained some injuries or trauma.
It is not advisable to keeping touching or picking at warts. However, you can still identify them by touch. Upon touch, they will feel fleshy, smooth and sometimes bumpy. Unlike bumps on skin, they will not be located inside the scrotum skin.
Can warts on testicles cause cancer
Warts will not develop into testicular or any other form of cancer. Just like a normal pimple on eye or such conditions, they will heal on their own even with no treatment.
Cancerous growths start inside the scrotal sac, on the testicles. In this case, you will feel a lump which is initially painless. The lump will increasingly grow in mass and with time will become painful.
Can a wart on the testicle spread to other body parts?
Warts of all types are very much contagious. For example, warts on the penile shaft are likely to also spread to the glans or the urethra. Picking at them is the main cause of spread.
The virus responsible for warts on the genitals is different from the one that causes plantar warts or common warts. However, exposure to any warts virus strains can cause infections. For example, touching the genitals with an injured finger or hand can spread the virus and cause common warts.
[RELATED]
Sexual intercourse with an infected person is almost a guarantee that you will develop warts on the genitals. In fact, skin to skin contact is enough to transmit the virus even with no sex involved. This however doesn’t include getting herpes in the mouth after oral sex.
About 40% of people below 40 years are living with causal virus for warts today. The virus can live in the body for years without showing any symptoms. In that period, it still can be transmitted. Even with treatment, the virus cannot be eradicated from the body. For this reason, warts will keep coming back even after treatment.
How to cure warts on testicles
If you have warts on the scrotum, you can easily treat them at home with remedies such as castor oil. Over the counter kits and topical creams containing salicylic acid can also be sued to get rid of the warts on testicles.
If you are not certain that it is actually a wart on testicle you are dealing with, the best idea is that you get a doctor to check the same. In fact, if you have not developed warts on any other genital area, it is probable that you are mistaking another skin condition with warts.
Guide information on skin tag on testicle
Just like warts, skin tags can appear on the scrotal sac but are not common. It is more likely that they will develop on the buttocks or the groin area rather than the scrotum.
Generally, skin tags are projections that are attached to the skin by a thin stalk. They usually result from constant friction sustained on the affected areas.
[RELATED]
A skin tag on the testicle is not harmful. In fact, it will detach from the skin with time. However, it can grow quite large and cause all types of discomfort or even embarrassment. Since skin tags are generally soft-skinned, they can easily sustain injuries and become painful.
How to remove a skin tag on testicle
The best way to remove a skin tag on the testicles is use of tea tree oil. It is a mild but effective home remedy. You can also use a TagBand or a string to choke the skin tag to death.
Freeze kits and topical products might be effective but are likely to cause discomforts when used on the testicles.
Some people will always consider advice from a doctor, even for some simple thing such as a birthmark meaning or a pimple on scalp. As much as it may seem unnecessary, it is actually very advisable. You find that even serious health conditions such as cancer begin with easily ignored symptoms.

[post_content] => It is common for skin growths to be infected, usually by bacteria. In such cases, treatment at home is not advised.
Physical injuries sustained on skin growths such as skin tags and warts will encourage bacteria entry and consequent infections. In such cases, the affected areas will become painful and form pus.
If you are not certain what skin growth you are dealing with, the best thing is to see your primary doctor for a medical diagnosis. For genital skin tags or other warts where you may not be willing to visit a clinic for examination, you can take pictures and images and send them to an online doctor.
Symptoms of infected warts
Generally, warts form as flattened or raised skin growths. They are very soft to the touch and take the color of the skin. Upon close inspection and on pictures, they will resemble tiny cauliflowers. They mostly occur in clusters.
[RELATED]
Below are the symptoms that will help you in identifying infected warts:
Painful warts – in normal cases, warts will not hurt but will itch. Constant scratching or other sources of irritation may injure them and cause pain
Reddened – reddening and inflammation are usual symptoms of infected skin growths
Blood and pus - the immune system automatically moves to kill any harmful bacteria present in the body. Dead cells and bacteria combine to form pus. If warts keep oozing blood and pus, it is a guarantee that they are infected. Pus with no traces of blood is a symptom of a serious infection.
As the infection spreads, other symptoms such as fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes will be experienced. In this case, the infection will have gotten into serious stages that really should be treated by a doctor.
Infected warts on the leg
Infected warts on the leg mostly appear on the plantar part of the foot. They are known as verruca and are often painful when walking or standing.
Due to pressure exerted on the heel and ball of the leg when walking, verruca tends to develop deeper into the skin rather than appear bumpy or flattened like normal warts. They are very common in children especially those who may frequently go barefoot in social areas.
How to treat infected warts on hands and other body parts
Infected warts on the hands are very likely to spread, either to other body parts or to other people. Some home remedies such as castor oil and tea tree oil can be used to treat bacterial infections on warts and also reduce the risk of spread.
You can also try a hot compress. This aids in getting the pus out of the infected areas. The problem is that pus from a wart is very contagious.
It is advised that you get clinical treatment for infected warts especially in children and people with conditions such as diabetes.
In hospitals, doctors administer both antiviral and antibacterial medications. They will also consider removal methods for the infected warts. Such include burning, cryotherapy and laser treatment. Acids and creams may not be advisable to use on infected warts. They can cause further irritations to the already infected and painful areas.
Which is the best infected mole removal?
Infected mole removal should certainly be done by a dermatologist. It is very unwise to try removing a mole that gets infected yourself.
Moles can be removed by laser treatment, freezing, burning or shave excision. Most people prefer the latter method as it is very quick.
[RELATED]
It isn't uncommon to come across many cases of people reporting moles getting infected after shave excision treatment method. Normally, you will be given antibiotics and other medications to take and wash the treated area with. It will heal within days. However, if the edges on the scar appear reddened and quite swollen, it is a sign of infection. In that case, you should get a follow-up appointment.
It is always helpful and appropriate to take images and compare them with infection pictures available online. You can also send some of the infection pictures that you have taken to your doctor who will advise you on the best next move.
Children's infected mole removal at home
It is common for children to get infections on their moles. Depending on the cause, you can treat them at home or get medical help.
If, for example, a mole is infected after an injury or even an infestation such as caused by scabies in humans, you can use regular treatment options at home.
However, if a cause of physical injury cannot be identified, infected mole removal should not in any way be done at home. You may actually be trying to treat melanoma cancer, which is really dangerous.
Professionals advise that you in fact take pictures and images of moles in children to help you identify any sudden change in them. This is the first great step to preventing cancer of the skin that may develop from moles.
Infected skin tag removal and after care to avoid more infection
It is not common to see a skin tag developing an infection. However, in the likely scenario that physical injuries or cuts are sustained on the tags, infections can follow.
Doctors will in most cases choose excision as the best infected skin tag removal method. This is because the method is quick and will avoid cases of the infection spreading further. Red skin tags are mostly removed this way.
[RELATED]
After removal, the area on which the tags were removed can still become infected if the right post-care services are not offered. This is common in tags occurring on the hands.
The best thing to do is go for a follow-up appointment. In this case, the cause of infection will be identified and treated accordingly. If you had the tag removed at home by cutting it off, ensure that the scar is covered with a bandage after an antiseptic or other medication has been applied. You can also use essential oils, such as ones use to get rid of hickeys. They aid in faster healing as well as prevent spread of bacteria.
Symptoms of infected skin tag after removal
Although it is not common, it still is a good idea to get detailed information on infected skin tag removal symptoms.
Pain and swelling are the most common give away symptoms. Naturally, any injured part of the body will be painful and swell a bit. However, if the swelling is to go on for more than 3 days, it definitely indicates an infection.
Other tell tale signs include pus or unidentifiable fluids oozing from the scar. You may also see some red lines or streaks, or happen to develop fever or a chill. If any of these happens, get medical attention.
[RELATED]
If the infection is not serious, you can use an antibiotic on it. Neosporin is a good example. Any cause of friction should also be avoided before and after the spot has healed.
Since canker sores are known to be triggered by trauma including surgical operations to remove a skin tag, you might want to take a canker sore remedy at home. Crushed aspirin paste is a good example.
When to see a doctor for infected warts, mole or skin tag
It is always good to see a doctor especially when you cannot correctly identify the cause of a certain health condition such as bumps on the skin and like. In regards to a mole, skin tag or wart, see a doctor if any of the following is to happen:
You are not certain which form of skin growth it is
Home remedies have not been useful
Skin growths are gaining mass rapidly and experiencing constant evolution
The growths are very discomforting and painful; especially for plantar warts
Skin growths that appear in large clusters or under a short period of time
Other symptoms such as fever and pus are noticed

Although some individuals have a tendency towards developing them more than others, no one is immune. However, just as it is with genital warts and razor bumps, some measures can be undertaken to keep them from growing or coming back after removal.
How to prevent skin tags from growing
It is necessary that their causes be understood in order to know how to prevent skin tags. Generally, the tags appear when some parts of the body experience constant friction. Think of iron fillings, only that they will be attached to the source in this case. Below are the common contributing factors to skin tag development:
Diabetes – diabetic patients have been observed to be more prone to this skin condition. In fact, any factor that will bring about irregularities in blood sugar levels will encourage the formation of skin tags.
Obesity – obese individuals have increased chances of experiencing friction between body parts. They also have the extra skin needed to form the tags.
Pregnancy – both hormonal changes and rapid weight gain in pregnant women are contributing factors.
Steroids – collagen is the layer of the skin that steroids pulls closer together. This encourages formation of skin projections when a source of friction is present.
Age- with age comes lost collagen and therefore looser skin. This is a condition necessary for tags to develop. Aged, diabetic and sexually active men are almost guaranteed to get skin tags on the penis.
Genes – some family lines are more susceptible to skin tags.
Information on how to prevent skin tags
Although it is quite easy to remove skin tags, preventing them from growing is a better approach. Below are some tips and important information on how to prevent skin tags:
Check your dress code
Tight clothes will keep rubbing against the skin. They can also interfere with healthy skin formation. Always ensure that your body gets some space to breath.

Review your diet and meal plans
As we identified earlier, diabetes is closely related to development of skin tags. Try decreasing your intake of processed sugar-containing foods such as snacks and foods with too many saturated fats. Lean more towards foods with vitamins.
Stop smoking
Smoking will give you cancer. But before that, it will first weaken your skin. It is common to see wrinkles on the faces of habitual heavy smokers.
Try some powder
Powders can help keep your body smooth and dry. It is not without a reason that skin tags prefer body areas such as the groin, underarms and neck. You find that such areas are always moist and prone to sweating.
Shed some pounds
If you can, hit the gym and lose some weight. Apart from keeping you free from skin tags, it will also help you manage many other health conditions.

Another way to prevent the tags is to avoid habits such as smoking, excessive use of steroids and other habits that weaken facial skin. Along with that, eat food products such as vegetables, fruits and other sources of vitamins.

[post_content] => As if the weird mood swings and a swollen belly are not enough, pregnancy may also bring along a couple of skin changes including stretch marks and skin tags.
If you are to wake up to some thin, very soft skin projections which are skin-colored and attached to the body by a skinny stalk, it is a skin tag that you will be dealing with. They are common in pregnant women, diabetic individuals, obese people and older ones.
What causes skin tags during and after pregnancy?
A bit like birthmark meanings, it is not well understood what attraction skin tags find in pregnant women. Most professionals link it to changes in hormone levels and rapid gain of weight.
Normally, skin tags develop in parts of the body that are moist and are frequently rubbed against. These include under the breasts, under arms, around the genitals and in the groin region.
[RELATED]
When rapid weight is continuously gained, such as occurs in pregnant women, moist body parts that are constantly rubbing against each other or against clothes are not unusual. Combining this with changes on the skin caused by fluctuating hormone levels, skin tags during pregnancy are very common.
Can a skin tag on the nipple develop during pregnancy?
A skin tag on the nipple during pregnancy is not common. It is more common after pregnancy when breastfeeding. The good thing is that such a skin tag is completely harmless and will not be passed to your baby. The most it can do is get too big and block the nipple or keep the baby from suckling properly.
During pregnancy, skin tags will mostly develop under the breast. It is probable that these will go away after pregnancy.
Are vaginal skin tags during pregnancy and labial skin tags harmful?
If you are experiencing some vaginal skin tags during pregnancy and are wondering if they are harmful both to you and your baby, sit back and relax for now.
There are no health risks associated with vaginal or labial skin tags, both during and after pregnancy. As long as the tags are not causing you discomfort or embarrassment, you can leave them be. It is likely that they will fall off the skin on their own.
[RELATED]
However, skin tags are very soft and delicate. They also contain most features of the skin such as a dermis, pores, nerves and blood vessels. For these reasons, the tags can be very painful if injured. They can also predispose you to vaginal infections including genital warts.
Can skin tags on the breasts and vagina be treated during pregnancy?
You may be worrying so much about benign skin tags or stretch marks that you are unfortunately dedicating little time to more important issues to do with pregnancy.
Skin tags on the breasts and skin tags during pregnancy can be treated even at home. For example, tea tree oil is a very potent home remedy for removing even labial skin tags. It will not only keep the tags away but also protect you from vaginal infections. Additionally, it will not harm your baby or complicate the delivery process.
You can also use essential oils to conceal and prevent stretch marks, very notorious effects of pregnancy.
All in all, you may want to see your doctor when removing skin tags on breasts during and after pregnancy. Some removal methods at home and over the counter products might prove too much to be used on the breasts at that time.
Can skin tags during pregnancy develop on the neck?
Skin tags related to pregnancy can develop on any body part as long as body changes have been experienced on that part.
Some women will generally add weight even on the backs of their necks. Others will develop an excessively oily skin while some will no longer fit in their old clothes.
Taking into account that the skin keeps changing slightly in response to hormonal changes, it is only natural to develop skin tags on neck during pregnancy.
[RELATED]
Unless the removal methods are going to be enough stress to encourage a miscarriage or something along those lines, such a skin tag can be removed even in a hospital.
You will find that most doctors will not advise you to go ahead with skin tags removal during pregnancy. Cases of sudden trauma encouraged by hormonal changes have been reported to cause miscarriages and canker sores on the tongue.
Will skin tags that develop during pregnancy heal after pregnancy?
If you are wondering whether skin tags that have developed during pregnancy will disappear after the nine months are over, the correct answer is probably yes.
Once all the predisposing factors such as rapid weight gain, hormonal changes and such have been eradicated, the skin tags are likely to turn black and detach from the skin.
Just like razor bumps, these types of skin tags are potential sources of discomfort but not harmful.

[post_content] => Most skin conditions are characterized by itchiness. In fact, even some bumps on the tongue may keep urging you to do some scratching.
The funny thing is that the more you scratch on an infected area, the more it becomes irritated. In fact, too much scratching will cause bleeding or open sores.
Genital warts are the itchiest of all. When they occur around the anus, and they usually do, they cause a fierce anal itch that is almost impossible to ignore. A mole can also itch sometimes. So can a skin tag. We will get into details on possible causes in this article.
Do skin tags itch; causes of itching and bleeding skin tags
So do skin tags itch? They actually do. Following are the most common causes of itching and bleeding skin tags:
Being rubbed by clothes, skin piercings or jewelry
Constant picking at, touching or massaging them
Wrong treatment
Some soap, lotion and beauty products brands
Skin patches
Exposure to a new environment
Itching and bleeding skin tags can become infected and very painful. When or even before this happens, you can try any of the available ways to get rid of skin tags.
What happens when skin around a mole or moles themselves itch?
Moles that itch are known as atypical moles. The main difference between them and normal moles is that they can develop into melanoma, a skin cancer that you don’t want to be involved with.
[RELATED]
Normal moles don’t itch. In fact, you can carry them for years on your back without ever realizing that they are there.
If you observe that the skin around mole itches often, you should keep a very close eye on it. Preferably, have a doctor check it.
Cancerous moles that itch or skin around a mole that itches often
At home, you can run a quick diagnosis to determine if moles that itch are cancerous. It can be helpful to keep records of your existing moles for use in future. For example, you can take maintain a routine inspection of the moles after a bath. Taking pictures is even more strategic.
Here are the features to expect in a cancerous mole:
It has dissimilar halves. If you were to place a mirror on the center, the two halves would not look symmetrical
The borders are irregular or blurry
It has multi-colored spots and patches. The colors can keep changing often
It is starting to dwarf a pencil eraser in size and gaining mass fast
It is fast evolving in regards to size or color and looks a bit alien compared to other non-itchy moles
So can a mole itch? Yes it can, and it is not a good sign. You may also notice that such a mole itches sometimes and then stops for a while, but then may start again. With time, it may bleed, harden, form a crust and become painful. In fact, before it even gets to that, have a doctor check it.
Do genital warts itch; what causes itching warts
You may be feeling quite itchy down there and may be suspecting that you have contracted an STD. The truth is that most STDs do itch.
If you are experiencing an itching and bleeding pimple in the pubic area, any of the following conditions can be the cause:
STDs such as syphilis, warts, chlamydia
Anal fissures
Hemorrhoids
Bowel diseases
Yeast infections
It is therefore important that you be sure that it is in fact itching warts that you indeed are dealing with. Here are some features to look for in genital warts:
Soft and fleshy skin growths
Mostly take the color of the skin
Observed closely enough, you could take them for tiny cauliflowers
Largest populations appear on vagina, vulva, anus and the penile shaft. They can also occur on other genital areas such as the urethra and the cervix. However, it is likely that they will spread to the above mentioned areas.
Why do genital warts itch and what causes itching warts
Why do genital warts itch? Warts will not naturally itch, as long as they are not irritated through touch, creams, friction, clothes and other such factors. It is very hard not to irritate them however.
For instance, vaginal warts and penile warts can easily get irritated when taking a bath, urinating, having sex and other actions. Anal warts on the other hand will constantly rub against the buttocks and cause anus itch.
Chances are low that genital warts will develop and fail to itch. In such times, they are easily transmitted and will develop into blisters or sores. In fact, itching is a main symptom of the warts. You find that they may develop and cause no symptoms other than some itchy, soft, tender and burning spots around the genital region.
Do plantar warts itch; warts that itch sometimes
Plantar warts are sometimes known as verruca. They prefer the heel and the ball of the foot.
Due to constant rubbing against footwear or the ground, a wart on that part of the foot may itch sometimes. Pressure exerted on the foot causes the warts to develop inside rather than on the sole. When treated, they leave a small hole on the spot where they previously existed.
[RELATED]
So do plantar warts itch? They absolutely do. In fact, they are also likely to be painful and can even interfere with your posture and gait.
The most common cause of itching and bleeding warts on the foot is friction and constant pressure. The other probable reason why they itch is because they are caused by HPV, a virus which has itchiness as one of its symptoms.
Do genital, common and plantar warts itch; what to do
Most warts will itch, especially when they get irritated or injured. Common warts, the ones that you will find on the hands and rest of the body, are most notorious as far as itchiness is concerned. This is because they are prone to getting rubbed against frequently.
Flat warts, the ones you will find mostly in kids or on the face, are also very itchy. Next in the lineup are warts appearing on or around the genitals. Anal warts are the worst in this category, followed by ones on the vagina and the penis. Plantar warts will also urge you to scratch them often but they will hurt more than they will itch.
Another type of warts that you may also come across is a bit rare but very itchy when it occurs. To identify them, they usually have a dimple on their centers, but take on the color of the skin. You will find them on thighs, abdomen or even the chest. They are very itchy.
What are the best treatments for itchy warts?
Topical creams can help reduce the itchiness caused by the warts. In fact, they will get rid of the warts entirely with time. The problem is that such creams cannot be used on infected or open warts. This can be caused by a sudden trauma, canker sores in the mouth or even skin ulcers.
[RELATED]
Home remedies are the best when it comes to easing and treating itching warts. For example, tea tree oil for warts will reduce inflammation and also aid in quick healing. Others such as aloe Vera and castor oil produce a soothing effect which can help with the burning and itchy sensations produced by itching and bleeding warts.
You can also try disinfectants on the warts. You will find that when they itch, warts are bound to get injured or opened sometime in the near future. You can prevent any infection before it happens with disinfectants.
Itching moles, warts, and even skin tags can be a source of embarrassment and discomfort. The good thing is that any of them can be removed easily in a clinic or even at home. If any of them is infected and especially if they are oozing pus, let a doctor be the one to conduct the removal process.

[post_content] => Have you ever wondered why it is that flowers and some plants are so attractive and nice smelling? Do you find yourself asking why it is that bees spend entire hours buzzing from one flower to another?
The secret behind it all is essential oils. These are natural substances contained in barks, flowers, and even leaves of some plants. They are very aromatic and also contain potential healing abilities. Tea tree oil with castor oil for example has been used as cold sore remedies.
When extracted, these oils readily can be morphed into a nice-smelling gaseous state. You can smell the fragrance in the air once a bottle of essential oil is opened. This is the advantage that doTERRA oil producers and other related companies take advantage of. As it stands, there are in excess of a thousand different types of substances that can be used to come up with an essential oil.
DoTERRA oil for skin tags removal
Other than using doTERRA oils for naturally healthy skin, you can use it to treat skin tags. Skin tags are projections on the skin that are fleshy and skin-colored. They are in no way cancerous or of risk to your health but can be a nuisance and embarrassing. They are common in pregnant women, obese individuals, older ones, and diabetics.
DoTERRA oil therapy for skin tag removal can be done in a variety of ways. First, you can choose to add the oil in your bathing water. Here, just add some drops into a warm water basin. The oil package will most likely come with guidelines on how many drops are to be added, depending on the type of oils used.
[RELATED]
You can also take advantage of the cold/hot compress methods. With these compresses, you just dip a piece of cloth in either warm or cold water and add some drops of the doTERRA oil for skin tag removal that you are using. From there, hold the piece of cloth against the skin tags for 10-15 minutes. You can do this 2-3 times in a day.
The oil can also be added to a lotion and then be applied on the affected area. In fact, you can also use it in a moisturizer and apply even on healthy parts of the skin. You will probably come across the use of essential oils in regards to how to cover a pimple.
Oregano oil for skin tags treatment
Oregano oil is one the several folk remedies used to get rid of common skin growths including skin tags. It can be used on the groin areas, necks or even the underarms. It would be a bad idea, however, to use this or most any other essential oils on sensitive areas such as the eyelids or in the ears.
Steps on how to use oregano oil for skin tags:
The oil works best when used with a string, a skin tag treatment method known as ligation
Hold the skin tag by the bumpy part and tie the stalk by the base
Ensure that there are no loose ends left on the string. These could collect bacteria from your surroundings. The string will remain in position until the tag falls off
Apply the oil to the growths, preferably with a piece of cotton ball
An antibacterial cream or ointment will be needed. Oregano oil will get rid of the skin tag but will not keep bacteria away
Oregano oil has been known to cause allergic reactions to people who don’t find lavender and mint products friendly to their skin. Also, it can cause irritation to the skin when used in very powerful concentrations. To avoid this, mixing it with some olive or coconut oil can help.
How to use doTERRA oil for moles removal
It is likely that you are familiar with moles. There are certain types of skin growths that usually are raised, dark/tan and with regular edges. They rarely measure more than 6 mm in diameter.
Although they often occur naturally and don’t usually pose health risks, rapidly evolving ones have been known to signal cancer of the skin.
If considering mole removal or treatment with essential oils, doTERRA oil for mole removal is a good place to start. Here is how you can use the oil to get rid of the moles:
Warm up some bath water and put some drops of the oil into it
The water can be used on any part of the skin even where moles are not present
Soak a towel in cold or warm water. Apply a few drops of the oil to the towel and then compress it on the moles
The oil can also be used in a lotion or a moisturizer
Oregano oil for moles usage
It has been observed that oregano oil is very powerful in mole removal usage. The problem is that the oil can be irritating to the skin when used in its purest forms. To avoid this, coconut or almond oil can be added.
When using oregano with almond oil, combine them in ratio of 1:8. Ensure that the two have mixed appropriately before use.
[RELATED]
To use it, soak a cotton ball in the mixture and massage the mole with it. Ensure that all the parts of the mole have been covered with the solution. It works best when left to air-dry. After that, rinse the affected area.
Repeat this process once on daily basis. By the end of the first week, you will observe the mole turning black, an indication that it is dying off.
Should the skin on or around the mole get irritated, quit further application. A cleanser ointment can effectively be used to get rid of the oil from the irritated parts.
DoTERRA oil for warts treatment
Warts can be quickly removed in clinics by having them burnt, surgically removed or even frozen. The problem is that they will keep coming back, perhaps more times than you may be willing to keep visiting a doctor.
Luckily, essential oils are relatively effective in removing skin growths like warts.
A DoTERRA oil for warts removal recipe, for example, can clear common warts in a matter of weeks. An effective recipe can include coconut, frankincense and oregano oils. Clove or almond oil can be added into the removal mixture to ensure that no irritations are caused on the skin.
Apply the mixture directly to the warts once in a day. In a period of about 2 weeks, the warts will have cleared.
It is not advisable to use such a recipe on vaginal warts, skin growths around the eyes or bumps on the penis. In fact, ensure that your doctor has been consulted when using essential oils for treatment of skin growths anywhere near the genitals or the face.
Oregano oils for warts removal
If you have been looking at some natural ways to get rid of skin growths and warts, it is likely that you have come across oregano oil for use as a wart remover. It is an essential oil with lots of additional benefits. For instance, some people use it against stomach ulcers and white spots on the tonsils.
[RELATED]
This removal oil is very powerful and will probably irritate your skin if used alone. To avoid this, use some coconut oil to make it more mild while still maintaining its effectiveness. In every 1 unit of oregano oil used, add 8 equivalent units of coconut oil.
In regards to application, you can apply the oil directly to the affected areas. This can be done up to 4 times in a day. For even better results, cover the warts with a bandage.
Like other essential oils, care should be taken when using them on sensitive body parts such as the genitals. In fact, don’t use them on the eyes or on genital warts without proper consultation. You can however try them on ringworm on the neck or scalp. If the warts do not show signs of dying off in 2 weeks, get help from a dermatologist.

[post_content] => The skin is the largest organ in the body. Unfortunately, this means it is exposed to many pollutants and potential injuries. That is the reason for many skin conditions, ranging from white spots on the penile region to ringworm on the scalp and other similar issues. Naturally, the body will always move to rectify unwanted skin growths, which can be caused by infections or be predisposed by identifiable factors.
Skin tags and moles are good examples of benign skin growths that almost everyone will have to deal with at some point in their lifetime. The body will get rid of them on its own, if given enough time. Although they occur and appear differently, it is easy to confuse them. In this article, we will examine the main differences and what causes them.
Skin tag vs mole; what is the difference between the two?
Let’s have a quick breakdown on skin tag vs. mole and their differences:
Color
Skin tags take the color of the skin. They can turn reddish or black, especially when infected or about to heal.
[RELATED]
Moles will, in the majority of cases, take a black coloring. Some will appear brown, tan, red or even pink.
Causes
In regards to what causes skin tags, we can only identify the predisposing factors. Any parts of the body that are prone to friction can develop the tags. Friction can result from clothes, other body parts and so on. Diabetics, pregnant women, older ones and obese individuals show a tendency of developing the tags more frequently.
Moles usually result from an accumulation of the cells that give the skin its pigmentation. Some appear before a child is born but most show up in early stages of development. Moles show a tendency to grow larger and darker in pregnant women.
Risk
Skin tags pose no health risk except in matters related to beauty. They can, however, become infected or injured.
1 in 100 moles will end in melanoma. It is a very deadly cancer of the skin. Such moles show early signs of rapid evolution such as changes in size, color, and blurry borders.
Locations where they occur
You can have a skin tag anywhere on the skin. Common areas where they appear include the underarms, neck, groin and eyelids.
Moles don’t seem to have a preference in regards to where they can appear. It is not surprising to find one on the genitals where it can feel like a bump on the vagina or penis.
Appearance
A skin tag looks like a literal tag hanging on the skin. It has a thin root, or stalk, which is attached to the skin. Most resemble a grain of rice but larger ones can develop to the sizes of grapes or figs. They can develop individually or in clusters.
Moles form a dome shape with smooth tops. Their edges are defined. On average, they don't usually grow past 6 mm in diameter. Rarely will you find them in clusters although they can invade a certain body part in larger numbers.
Who is at risk?
Anyone can get skin tags but they are more common with age. Use of steroids, smoking, eating too much sugar and pregnancy encourage their development.
Moles usually appear on the body before 30 years of age. It is common to have up to 20 of them.
What is the difference between mole and skin tags treatment?
The difference between mole treatment and skin tags treatment is dependent on the current state either is in. For example, moles that are showing signs of skin cancer can only be treated in hospitals with cancer treatment methods such as chemotherapy.
[RELATED]
Skin tags, on the other hand, will only call for a bit more complex removal when infected. Even then, antibacterial medications will do a clean job of it.
Skin tag vs mole medicine
Any of the following methods can be used to get rid of either:
Natural products – in this category, you will find remedies such as tea tree oil and essential oils. They work in a matter of weeks or even days to clear these skin growths. Some in this category can also be used to get rid of cold sores.
Cryotherapy – this procedure makes use of liquid nitrogen to kill the skin growths.
Excision – a skin tag can be cut off easily in a clinic or at home. A mole, on the other hand, requires a bit more complex shave excision surgery.
Laser therapy – laser beams are directed on the affected area to poison the skin growth being removed.
Burning – the skin growths can be burned using an electric current.
Over the counter kits – there are many options in this category. For example, patches and creams containing salicylic acid can be used to digest the layers of the skin growth. Wart Freeze compounds can also be used for the same effect produced by cryotherapy. A Tagband can also be used to ligate a skin tag.
Home remedies for skin tags and moles removal
It is not always necessary that skin tags and moles be treated in clinics. As long as they are not infected and do not show signs of malignancy in the case of moles, home remedies for skin tags and moles can be used.
There are quite a number of options you can choose from. They range from simple banana peels, which you can also use to remove scars, to essential oils such as oregano. You can compare their reviews and choose one that works best for you.
Which is the best skin tag or mole medicine?
There is no single medicine that will work the best in all cases. The best approach is to compare them and weigh the situation you are in.
[RELATED]
For example, tea tree oil is mild enough to remove skin tags on the penis where you may not want some freezing to be done. Surgical removal is fast and effective but you may not want it done on your face, as it might leave a scar.
If you are not certain what medicine or home remedy is best to use, a dermatologist can always help. In fact, you don’t necessarily need to visit a clinic. With modern technology, there is the option of contacting an online doctor and having your case reviewed without ever having to enter a clinic physically.

[post_content] => You may have come across a treatment method known as homeopathy. It is quite old, dating back to before penicillin, World War 1 or even American independence.
The basic idea behind homeopathy is to use the same agent that is causing symptoms of a disease to heal it.
The good or bad thing about skin tags is that they are not infectious. Most professionals associate them with friction caused by body parts and clothes. Predisposing factors include pregnancy, steroids, age, diabetes and obesity.
What is homeopathic treatment for skin tags removal?
Although skin tags are benign, they are not so good looking, especially if they decide to hang by the eyelid or the face. They also can grow quite large and cause other forms of discomfort.

Homeopathic treatment for skin tags makes use of natural products to get rid of them. In this case, the removal remedy will generally poison the skin tag and cause it to fall off the skin.
The advantage of using homeopathy for skin tags removal is that no scarring will be left behind. It also will rarely cause irritation to the skin, so you can use the same on skin tags on the penis or other sensitive areas.
Which is the best skin tag homeopathic remedy for removal?
Thuja Occidentalis has been advertised in many reviews as the best skin tag homeopathic remedy. It is a tree whose extract is believed to be effective against a couple of conditions of the skin.
Like most natural medicine products, the extract will not work overnight. You will be required to use it for up to 3 months to judge its effectiveness.
To use it correctly, you only need to follow the guidelines provided on the package containing the medicine. Just for a heads-up, oral ingestion and using too much of it has been known to cause high blood pressure, headaches and gastric disorders. It also is highly scented.
Which homeopathic remedy for skin tags should you use?
If the natural way is your thing, you may be interested in homeopathic remedies for skin tags. As we have seen, Thuja occidentalis is the common ingredient in such medicines. However, it rarely comes on its own. A couple of products are added to complement its benefits. They include:
Tea tree oil – it is not likely that this remedy will be missing from any list of natural curative remedies for skin conditions. It is known to have anti-inflammation benefits, and in fact can be used against cold sores symptoms.
Cedar – oil extracted from the wood or leaf of this plant is commonly included in skin tag homeopathic remedies. Even in its pure forms, the oil is relatively mild and will rarely cause irritations. It is thought to aid in reducing inflammations.
Apple cider vinegar – it is a mildly corrosive substance. With carrier oil, it can be used to get rid of moles as well as skin tags.
Castor oil – yet another popular skin tag removal remedy. It has a wide range of applications on skin conditions including removal of moles on the nipple.
Oregano oil – you will find this oil being advertised as a cure for different types of skin conditions including warts. It may require coconut oil to make it less irritating to the skin.
How to use homeopathic remedy for skin tags removal

[post_content] => Warts and skin tags share a common feature, namely, the fact that they basically are growths on the skin. Their causes, however, are not in any way related.
Unlike warts, skin tags will not keep coming back periodically. As long as the source of friction that caused them initially is eradicated, they can go away for good. We can compare them to infestations such as scabies in humans. All you need to do is keep away from the external cause and they will be avoided permanently. Warts on the other hand are unfortunately eternal. Once infected with the HPV virus that causes them, they will keep coming and going.
The good thing is that a wart remover kit can be used for both skin conditions effectively.
Can you use wart remover on skin tags
So, can you use wart remover on skin tags? The answer is absolutely yes! The remover usually contains a compound known as salicylic acid.
As you may already know, acids produce a corrosive effect to the skin and other materials. The corrosion occurs when parts of the skin are digested away by the acid. Although this can be very dangerous and harmful where strong acids are used, this effect can be taken advantage of with mild acids.
[RELATED]
This is what happens with wart removers. When applied on warts or skin tags, the acid eats away the skin growths layer by layer. With time, the whole growth will disappear.
It is advised that you use a pumice stone to keep rubbing off the dead skin debris that will form on top of the skin tag. This will speed up the remover process as well as ensure that the acid penetrates inside the skin tags appropriately.
How to use wart remover for skin tags; how it works
Here is how to use wart remover for skin tags:
The first thing you will need to do is ascertain that it is a skin tag you indeed are dealing with. A mole on the face, for example, can be easily mistaken for a skin tag.
Go through some of the available top removal brands available today. Compound-W freeze is a good example.
Use the remover on the skin tags, just as instructed in the user manual. The products can be irritating to the eyes or other sensitive areas. In fact, you are not advised to use the same at home to remove a wart on the eyelid.
The skin tags may take a while before finally going away. The important thing is to follow the provided guidelines. Also, ensure that the remover is not applied on cracked areas or on open sores.
Does wart remover work on skin tags; can you use it?
Does wart remover work on skin tags? Can you use it on other skin conditions apart from warts? Not only is a wart remover effective on skin tags but it can also be used on moles and razor burn.

Although most remover kits work almost exactly the same, differing use guidelines may be provided. Also, ensure that you are not treating a wrongly identified skin condition. If you are not certain, try comparing images and pictures. If that doesn't confirm your suspicion, get a medical diagnosis.
Removing skin tags with a wart remover kit
A wart remover kit can make use of other removal methods apart from salicylic acid. Here are some other ways that you can try when removing skin tags with a wart remover kit:
You can just cut off the tags with a pair of scissors. This method is not advised for large skin tags.
TagBands can be used the same way you can use a string to remove skin tags at home. The good thing is that they are more customizable than strings.
Over the counter freeze kits can be used the same way liquid nitrogen is used in clinics. They are, however, not as effective as clinical cryotherapy.
The remover kit can also come with a cauterization tool. It is simple to use once the provided guidelines are followed.
You may need to consult your doctor if the skin tags are too large. On average, a skin tag should not measure more than 5 mm. Anything larger than that will invite complications when trying to treat it at home. In this case, incision and electric burning are better options.
Using home remedies with a wart remover for skin tags
Remedies such as apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil can be of great help when used with removal kits. As well as speeding up the removal process, they also protect from possible infections.
In fact, such remedies will be the best options to treat skin tags that may be bruised or are causing swollen lymph nodes. Although it rarely occurs, open sores caused by continued friction on the tags can result in injured skin tags.
