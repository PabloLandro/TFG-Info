Ginger
Ginger is well known as a home remedy for motion sickness and upset stomach relief, but clinical studies also show that ginger may have anti-inflammatory properties in addition to helping quell the nausea and vomiting side effects from chemotherapy.
A 2009 study funded by the National Cancer Institute showed that when taken orally and added to conventional anti-vomiting and anti-nausea medications, ginger supplements may help reduce nausea from chemotherapy treatments by up to 40 percent -- with no additional side effects.
But before you stock up on the ginger ale, make sure it's real ginger in that drink -- not ginger flavoring.
Did You Know?
Experts estimate that about 70 percent of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments experience nausea and vomiting side effects.
