Pink Himalayan salt is all the rage recently, but though it might be pretty, is it really that much healthier for you than regular table salt? Below are a few facts about Himalayan pink salt to keep in mind.
Himalayan pink salt is believed to be one of the purest salts in the world – hence its comparatively hefty price tag. The salt gets its characteristic pink color from minerals deep beneath the mountains where it is mined. It is found in the foothills of the Himalayas in Pakistan, and is thought to be the remnants of a shallow sea which dried up several million years ago before the Himalayan mountains were formed.
Pink Himalayan salt is a naturally-occurring sea salt that is estimated to contain over 80 different trace minerals, including iron, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. Many people enjoy its delicate flavor and beautiful color, and while it’s not a good idea to eat too much salt, Himalayan pink salt may be a healthier replacement for regular table salt.
Here are some of the many benefits that have been attributed to this unique type of salt, according to NaturalNewsBlogs.com:
-Detoxifies the body by balancing systemic pH
-Naturally Antibacterial and Antimicrobial properties
-Improves hydration by providing trace minerals
-Lowering incidence of sinus problems, and promoting over-all sinus health
-Improves mineral status of the body
-Reduces muscle cramps by improving minerals and hydration
-Balance blood sugar level
-Helps to Reduce Acid Reflux/Heartburn
-Reduces asthma and allergy symptoms
-Neutralizing electromagnetic radiation
-Reduces stress and increases performance
-Promotes the increased absorption capacities of food elements within the intestinal tract
-Helps balance blood pressure because it provides unrefined, mineral-rich salt in an ionic solution
-Improves sleep by supporting blood sugar and hormone balance
-Acts as a powerful antihistamine
-Supports weight loss by balancing hormones and improving energy
-Supports thyroid and adrenal function
While I would take this extensive list with a grain of salt (pun intended), replacing artificially made and highly processed table salt with this mineral-rich substitute shouldn’t hurt – and may well prove to be a much healthier alternative.
