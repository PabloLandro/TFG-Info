Thoughts You Have While Lifting
Yesterday I was reading this Buzzfeed article, 75 Thoughts Every Runner Has While Out For a Run…so funny and so true! I have written my own version of what I think about while running, and figured I’d have a little fun today and write up my thoughts while lifting at the gym. Let’s see if you can relate to any of them!
Okay, time to warm-up. I really hate warming up. I guess I’ll do some jumping jacks and arm circles or something. Maybe walk on the treadmill.
First up is squats – oh look the squat rack is taken.
Okay, I’ll just do bench press then. Oh look, the benches are all taken.
Stop chatting with your friends and get your set done so I can squat or bench! (My gym is full of high school guys that come in groups.)
*Waiting patientlty by the bench press until the person is done*
Finally, I can get on it.
Okay, what weight did I do last time? I’ll add like 10 lbs.
Crap, this is heavy. What if I can’t get it back up??
*Pushing hard on last rep* Please don’t let anyone be watching my struggling right now.
I did it, phew. Okay onto the squats.
*Feeling bad@$$ doing barbell squats*
Someone asks “How many sets do you have left?” “I just got on.” Now you have to patiently wait like I did!
I hope my shorts/leggings aren’t see through when I squat…probably should have checked first
I wonder what my form looks like…am I squatting deep enough?
Okay, done with that. Next.
Look at that dude doing deadlifts with a rounded back…hurts my back just watching him!
Look at that girl running on 8.0 on the treadmill like it ain’t no thang…I wish…
*Finishing workout*
Time to stretch and foam roll…I probably look like I’m flopping around everywhere on this foam roller.
Must. not. make. weird. face. in. public. (as foam roller hits all the tight and painful spots.)
I guess I’ll do a few planks and then get out of here.
DONE. Time to eat.
Does anyone have a lot of high schoolers go to their gym? They go and it’s so funny because the guys hang out in groups by the weights, and the girls sit in a circle “stretching” or “doing abs” in the stretching area (in reality they are sitting there gossiping and laughing).
What thoughts do you have while at the gym? Any of these? Or am I the only one holding in my pain while foam rolling?

“My Knees Hurt When I Squat”
“My knees hurt when I squat.” This is a common complaint, and one I have heard many times as a personal trainer. Because their knees hurt, people end up not doing squats at all, when in fact, squats can help you get stronger and actually decrease knee pain!
Today we are going to talk about why your knees hurt when you squat, and what you can do to fix it.
Okay, if you’ve had a knee injury in the past, then yeah, that might be contributing to your knee pain (and you should see your PT or doctor to discuss whether you should or should not do certain exercises). However, most people have muscle imbalances and weaknesses that are causing this knee pain.
One of the main culprits is not engaging the core (or simply not having core strength) during the squatting motion. As you squat, you should be hinging at the hips and moving backwards as if sitting into a chair. If you don’t, your torso will lean forward, and your knees will be at an awkward angle, causing most of the load to be on your quads…which leads to the knee pain.
Here’s great info from trainer Kevin Yates:
When you lack proper core and hip strength muscle imbalances often result in the quadriceps and lower back over working. This is one of the main reasons for knee pain during squatting.
Movements like squatting and lunging are not bad for your knees and they don’t cause injuries.
Muscle imbalances are the real problem.
One of my favorite trainers, Tony Gentilcore, has a great post about fixing your squat and avoiding knee pain. His tip, box squats, was something I practiced regularly with my clients.
Basically, you set up a box or bench behind you in the squat rack. Your goal is to squat back and touch the box with your butt before coming back up (do not actually sit on the box and then come up, you are just tapping the box).
Tapping a box or bench helps you with that movement of sitting backwards. Your weight should be on your heels and not your toes during a squat. I’ve talked about squat tips in the past, and how you can improve your form. I’ve mentioned putting a plate under your heels. Why? Because if you have a muscle imbalance or tightness, your heels might be coming up during the squat movement. Elevating your heels a bit helps you get deeper and keep the weight in your heels.
From Tony Gentilcore:
If squatting hurts your knees—and you’re not suffering from an injury—it’s because you’re making your knees do more of the work than the hips. Learning how to utilize the hips during a squat is important if you want to make them more joint-friendly. Box squats can do that.
Squats and lunges are not bad for your knees! That’s a myth similar to that of running being bad for your knees and cracking your knuckles leading to arthritis. Squats and lunges, if anything, help improve your knee health. Start working on your core strength to take the pressure off your quads and knees.
One more thing before I move on to talking about your quads…if you’re having trouble sitting back into your squat, try doing front squats and goblet squats. Since the weight is in front of your body as opposed to on your back, it will make it a bit easier for you to sit back into the squat. I talked about that in this post about squatting tips.
Moving on…another thing that might be causing your knee pain is quad weakness. If your knees hurt during walking lunges or after running, this might be why. In order to fix this, you just need to work your quad muscles a bit. Focus on exercises like the split squat, and progress to a reverse lunge. Avoid doing any forward movements like (duh) forward lunges or walking lunges…just until you build up your strength.
Here’s one of my first YouTube videos showing the split squat.
Similar with the squat, you should be going straight down NOT forward. If you are moving forward as you’re performing this you will probably feel that knee pain. Cues to repeat to yourself are: chest up, shoulders back. Your front heel should stay planted on the floor – if you come up on your toes, step your back leg further back/away from your front leg.
My dad had knee pain during running and leg exercises, but once he started doing more split squats, his knee pain disappeared. He now runs 3 miles most days! Progression ideas for this exercise (once you master the split squat) would be: reverse lunge, front foot elevated split squat, rear foot elevated split squat, step-ups, and walking lunges.
***Remember though, please talk to your PT or doctor if knee pain is something you have regularly dealt with. Of course there could be some underlying issue that is not as simple as a muscle imbalance or lack of strength.***
Do you squat regularly? Have you ever felt knee pain?

Gym Etiquette
I just joined a new gym and so far I love it. It’s big and has probably 30 treadmills, which means I’ll never have to wait again! (knock on wood)
But with a new gym comes new questions. I wanted to get your input on a few things, and then talk about general gym etiquette for those who may just be starting to go or plan on getting a membership for the new year.
Questions:
Okay here are my questions for you gym folks…
At my other gym, when you wanted to use the squat rack, you waited behind the person squatting (kind of a line I guess) and when they were finished you stepped in. Is this normal practice? If I wait behind someone at my new gym will they think I’m a creep?
Do you bring your dumbbells to other places in the gym? We had a room where people took equipment to do circuit type workouts. At my new gym, the way the treadmills are set up, it’d be perfect to bring dumbbells or kettlebells over to do running and strength circuits. Thoughts?
Okay so I though I had more questions but that’s basically it haha. I’d love to hear your input!
General Gym Etiquette
If you plan on getting a gym membership this upcoming year and aren’t sure where to start, here are a few “rules” people tend to follow at the gym. I mean, basically just be courteous and no one will give you the stink eye
Wipe stuff down. Don’t leave your treadmill, bike, mat, bench, etc. without wiping it down. 1) Who wants to touch your sweat and 2) Think of all the bacteria that can be passed around that way. Let’s all try to avoid getting sick so we don’t have to skip days at the gym
Don’t hoard equipment. I know I asked above if I can take dumbbells to a room or the treadmill, but some people take dumbbells, kettlebells, a bench, a box, a jump rope, etc. etc. to their little corner and then the rest of the gym doesn’t have access for a while. If you’re doing circuits, just take what you need for the first circuit, then go exchange it for other stuff as your workout progresses (especially if it’s during peak hours).
Be quick. No one is saying to rush your workout, but don’t take a 5 minute break in between sets either. I hate when I’m waiting for a bench or the squat rack and the person on it is texting during their break, walking around talking to friends and just taking forever in general. When I know people are waiting, I take a short break, and then get right back into it. Plus, that’s a better way to keep your heart rate up anyway!
Ask someone to spot you. Don’t be afraid to do this! Personal trainers and gym staff are there for a reason. If you’re just starting out and unsure of the weight you’re lifting, definitely ask someone to give you a spot. You’ll stay safe and perhaps learn some cues and tips from the trainer who helps you.
Put your stuff away. Nothing peeves me more than when I go to the squat rack and someone left the bar on the rack with multiple weights on it. Why??? You couldn’t take the time to take the weights off?? Be courteous and put things back where you got them…isn’t that something we learned in Kindergarten?
Let people work in with you. If you know you need to do 5 sets on a machine, let the person waiting work in with you. They’ll ask “Can I work in?” and then you just switch on and off. You can also ask people if you can work in. I mean, I know people who find this annoying, but it doesn’t bother me at all. What are your thoughts on this?
I want to hear your thoughts on gym etiquette…what would you add to this list? Or any general tips you’d give beginners?

Cardio Acceleration Workout
Yesterday I was going to run on the treadmill then do a strength workout. Well, as I’m driving to the gym I realize I forgot a sports bra. The worst! There’s no way I can run without one, so while my mom ran 2 miles as her warm-up I just foam rolled and did some stretching. I decided to add cardio into my strength workout, and came up with this workout below:
I wanted to mainly focus on legs, but did some upper body as well with the presses focusing on shoulders and the rows on my back. I’ve never added in cardio while lifting – I typically just like to lift and do cardio separately…boy, was this killer! I was dripping in sweat.
Doing intervals of cardio in between lifts is called “cardio accelerations.” According to Men’s Fit Club:
A study done at UCLA (University of California) showed that cardio acceleration delivers better blood flow and gives you a much better pump and also has shown to increase the rate of recovery because of the addition nutrients and oxygen pumped into the muscles.
Cardio acceleration intervals also create that afterburn everyone always talks about. If you’re not keen on doing treadmill intervals or hill sprints as “HIIT,” then this type of workout is perfect for you!
The step-ups were done on a bench with no added weight – just do them as fast as you can. Harder than it sounds! For the last round, where I wrote cardio of your choice, I did stair sprints.
I think I am going to start doing this type of workout more often, since I think it will have a benefit for me as a runner as well. Not only will I be burning extra calories, I’ll be doing plyometric/explosive type movements as cardio, which will make me a stronger runner.
Have you added in cardio intervals to your strength workouts? What’s your favorite way? I hate mountain climbers!!
Try this cardio acceleration strength workout and burn major calories!

Why You Should Keep A Training Log
Do you track your training – whether it’s lifting, running, cycling, etc.? If not…you should!
Using a training log helps you keep track of your progress. I love being able to look on old notes to see how far I’ve come, as well as what I’ve lost or what weaknesses to work on. For example, a few months ago I can look back and see that I couldn’t do any unassisted pull-ups. Well, now I can do 4.5. Though not in a row…I need a 1-2 min. break in between each one, but still
I keep a training log when it comes to my lifting AND my running. So I want to talk about how you can use one for both of these different activities.

RUNNING LOG
There are many ways to keep track of your running. You can use a good ol’ notebook, or online tools like Google docs or Daily Mile. I try to keep up with Daily Mile but I’m really bad at updating it.
Benefits of keeping a training log for running are:
You’re able to see how consistent you are with training (or inconsistent which has happened to me).
If you’re a numbers person, seeing increasing mileage and paces can help motivate you
You can track how you feel on runs. If you have been feeling a certain way on certain runs, write it down. You may see patterns.
You can track amount of time spent running, as well as cross training and lifting.
Once the season is over, you can review your log and see what you did well vs. what you can work on next season.
The tool I work with is Google docs, because that’s what Coach Marc has me use. His training log is seriously awesome. I am able to see my year in review, my training plan, and each month broken down into miles I’ve ran (based on what I put in obviously).
He has a notes section where I can write how I felt in each run (which he reviews to tweak my plan as time goes on). It’s so funny reading notes from my 2011 log before my first marathon. And also funny to see how my training has progressed so much since then.
Here’s a screenshot of the “year in review” section:
I think it’s cool you can see previous months AND years miles. This version of his is newer from the ones I was using since 2011 which is why my yearly miles don’t show up.
Oh also, you can input what shoes you wear so you can track how many miles they have. No more forgetting when to replace your shoes!
Each month tab on the bottom allows you to input your miles, pace, shoes work, notes and more. See below:
Pretty cool right? The cooler thing is you don’t have to be coached by Marc to have access to this training log. He sells them on his site. He also has a special offer for you all: if you buy the 2015 log, he’ll give you the 2014 log for free, so you’ll be set for the rest of this year and next year. Just mention my blog in the comments of his order form
Even if you don’t order one, start using a running log for yourself. You may be surprised at the results, and you may even improve your running! Make sure to track miles, type of run, pace, how you felt and what sneakers you wore.
Lifting Log
Okay so you don’t run? No problem. A log is just as important in strength training…maybe even more important. You don’t want to be one of those people who goes to the gym day in and day out, does the same workout, and never sees results, right? Not keeping a training log can lead to a plateau.
Here are the benefits of keeping a lifting log:
You can track what weights you use for every exercise. This means as the weeks go by you can steadily increase your weight, as opposed to forgetting what weights you used for what, or staying at the same weight.
You can track what workouts/exercises you do on certain days.
You can track sets, reps, and tempo. If you’ve done the same number of sets and reps for 4 weeks, it’s time to switch it up.
You can write notes about how you felt during lifting sessions. For example, I write down “felt good” so I know that the following week I need to increase my weights. Or I write “Stay” which means to stay at the current weight I’m using because it’s challenging.
For my lifting log I am old school and go with a notebook and pen. I have a small notepad I bring to the gym, but then I transpose everything when I get home to my bigger notebook. Yes I could use an app or the Note app on my phone but I like pen and paper for this.
Here’s what my lifting log looks like:
PS – the middle row is my brother’s weights. I wish I could bench 75 lbs.
Anyways, the information I like to write down is the exercise (and what exercise it was paired with in a set), number of sets, number of reps, tempo if I’m using one, and weights. On the right you see I have W,R,W,R repeated (for weight and rep). That denotes the number of sets. This is my system to remember how many reps I did on a certain set, because if I get to the last one and can only do 8 reps as opposed to 10, I need to remember that for next week. Did all that blabbering just make sense?
I looked up strength training log and a lot of things came up. Find one that works for you. I haven’t used this tool, but BodyBuilding.com offers a custom log creation tool. Check it out!
No matter what your workout is, keeping a log is important. Even if you don’t care about numbers or stats, wouldn’t it be cool to look back in a few years and see how much progress you’ve made? It’s almost like a diary (oh man I don’t even want to read my middle school diary). I look back on my first lifting logs ever and see that I could barely dumbbell press 10 lbs. That makes me feel awesome about how far I’ve come.
Do you keep a training log? Did you keep a diary as a kid?

A Day In The Life
I’ve seen other bloggers do “day in the life” posts and I always like reading them…it’s interesting seeing how other people spend their days and what they do…or is that just me?
So I wanted to write my own on a whim and I hope some of you will use this as a blog post idea and go with it too! I’d love to see what your day looks like
Here’s my day this past Tuesday:
7:00 AM – Alarm goes off. I hit snooze. I always budget in one 10 minute snooze…Usually I’m up at 7:45 but I have an 8 AM cross country practice this morning.
7:10 AM – Actually get out of bed. My routine is brush my teeth, wash my face, put my contacts in, get dressed and then head downstairs.
7:25 AM – Breakfast. Today it’s scrambled egg whites with spinach and an orange. But usually I eat hard boiled eggs in my car on my way to work. Had time to actually sit down and eat today!
7:50 AM – Leave my house to go to practice at a local park. Practice starts at 8, and I just have them do a easy 4 mile loop.
9:20 AM – Leave the park to head to work. I work at my local community college in the Athletics department. I love that they gave me 4 polo shirts that I can alternate on days I’m too lazy to figure out what to wear…like today!
9:30 AM – Sit down at my desk and catch up on emails and social media. I’m not one of those people who sits down and gets to work right away. I need some time to get in the zone and wake up a little. I used to have a classmate in grad school who would worked with me and as soon as I walked through the door in the morning (no joke bags and lunch box still in hand) she’d give me a list of things we needed to complete that day. Let me settle in first!
10:15 AM – Writing this blog post, and then working on client’s twitter account. Also catching up on work emails and send a coaching email to my team regarding what their running mileage should look like this week.
11:07 AM - Finish writing an article I plan to sell, thanks to a workshop I recently took on this topic. I’ll let you know how that goes In between this time and when I leave I’m at the front desk answering questions from students and working on flyers for our department.
So this all happened on Tuesday right? The day before men’s and women’s soccer practice started. And students are coming in to pick up paperwork (like physical papers) because they want to go to try-outs the next day. Why did you wait until the very last minute?!?
12:30 PM – Leave work and drive home. Currently my commute is about 20 minutes, but I’m moving soon and my commute will turn into 40 minutes :’( I love my commute. It’s just one straight long road home passing a few farms. I never have to worry about traffic. And this is also one of my favorite roads to run on.
1:00 PM – Get home and eat lunch before a 1:30 phone call with a client.
1:30 PM – 2:30 PM – Phone call
2:30 PM – Work on schedule tweets for myself and my clients. My Tweetdeck is out of control. I think I have almost 30 columns on the web version and then even more on my desktop. Hey, gotta track #runnerprobs! Work on posting that previous article I talked about to try to sell it.
4:00 PM - Head out for a run with my mom. We did 3 miles and it was so humid from the storms were were about to get. But got it done nonetheless.
4:45 PM - Drive to the gym with my sister to do our leg day workout. Squats, leg curls, leg press, and hip raises.
6:00 PM - Get back home & take a quick shower so I can go to happy hour with a friend!
6:35 PM - Get to happy hour. My best friend and I catch up for a few hours over half priced martinis and guac. I had a “Grapefruit Gimlet” that was delicious! Tequila, grapefruit juice, elderflower liquer (What is this??) and something else. I want to try re-creating this drink this weekend so if anyone can tell me where to get this elderflower stuff and what it is I’d appreciate it
9:30 PM - Get home and watch “The Private Life Of Deer” on Netflix with my sister because we were curious about it. Pretty interesting though we didn’t end up watching the whole thing. Then watched How I Met Your Mother.
11:05 PM - Pass out.
Exciting life I live right?? Most of my day is spent on my computer doing client and blog work. So I really need to be better about reading at night instead of watching Netflix…it can’t be good for my eyes! But sometimes I just need a good laugh from How I Met Your Mother…
What does a day in your life look like? Write a post and leave the link in a comment!
What is the one show that will always make you laugh out loud? For me it’s HIMYM and Friends

Back To Running!
You may have seen on Instagram that over the weekend I got my training log from running coach Marc Pelerin, owner of Train With Marc. He’s also now in my sidebar, so click over to be taken to his coaching website!
I used to (literally) train with Marc, and he provided me with a running plan for over 2 years. He got me through my first half-marathon and marathon!
I’m excited to start working with him again, and along with that, he will be posting here 1-2 times a month with special running tips and guides for you all. He is so knowledgeable and experience, so hopefully now I can break my 5K PR
So today I get back to running and lifting. Last week I went to the gym to lift for the first time in about a month and I was SO SORE for 2 days. Needless to say, I felt out of shape…and yeah it’s time to get back into my routine.
I haven’t seriously ran in a few months. In the early spring I was running up to 4-5 miles with my dad because we thought we were doing a July half marathon which ended up getting canceled. Now I am planning on training for the Philly Half Marathon (anyone else running?).
My main goal is to break my 5K PR this fall. I want to train to get faster. I know this will help me be faster overall and hopefully run a faster half marathon and (eventually) full marathon. I know I had mentioned running a fall marathon but my mom and I decided to just wait until next year. It’s a lot of time and sacrifice and I wanted a break from super long runs.
We also were really hoping we would run NYC Marathon again next year but looks like we won’t complete our 9+1. We were away or busy during recent races and we would need to run literally every race left on their schedule. But this gives us a chance to experience a new fall marathon next year!
Schedule for this week:
Monday: Chest & back
Tuesday: Legs
Wednesday: Shoulders
Thursday: HIIT maybe?
Friday: Off
Saturday: Off
Sunday: Off
Running will be included throughout the week – just not sure yet…depends on my schedule once I get it!
I really cannot wait to get back into running. I know at first it will be hard after taking so much time off but hopefully I won’t be too sore. Oh yeah, and I’m also going to 3 weeks of physical therapy for my shin issues, so maybe I can fix or alleviate those issues early on before real training starts.
What is your current training schedule?
What’s your next race?

Leg Workout For Runners
Last week, I posted a 4 minute leg workout…so quick, you have no excuses! Well, today I wanted to share a lower body workout I did last night that took about 30 minutes to complete. This is perfect for runners because it is working on your balance a bit, and also incorporating cardio (with the thrusters). You’re hitting your quads, glutes, and hamstrings…all the muscle groups you need to work on to be a strong runner! This is the perfect leg workout for runners
Photo Credit: vauvau via Compfightcc
I broke it up into the reverse lunges paired with deadlifts (3 sets), then the other 2 exercises (3 sets). You can do core work at the end too if you’re up to it.
I like doing the reverse lunge right into a single leg deadlift (as opposed to doing 10 lunges then 10 single leg deadlifts) because it is challenging in terms of balance. It will really help develop ankle, hip and core strength.
Here is a video for a barbell thruster in case you’re not familiar:
I wish I could use as much weight as her, but I only used a 35 lb. barbell. This one will definitely get your heart rate up, and helps work on power and explosiveness in the legs.
As always, let me know if you try it out! I’d love to hear your thoughts
Have you tried thrusters?
Do you prefer working quads and glutes, or hamstrings?

Yes, I’m a Personal Trainer, But I Admit That…
I got the inspiration for this post from personal trainer Taylor, who writes at LiftingRevolution.com. She has done a series titled, “10 Jaw Dropping Confessions Of A Personal Trainer” and I loved reading her confessions…mostly because I can totally relate!
Sometimes I feel like, as a trainer, I need to live a certain lifestyle when it comes to healthy and fitness…but I definitely have some confessions of my own
Here we go:
I admit that… I have a crazy sweet tooth and “splurge” on a sweet treat 2-3 times per week. Usually something small, like a small cookie, or piece of dark chocolate. It has definitely gotten the best of me though, and there have been times when I just can’t stay away from the Famous Amos cookies in the vending machine at work!
I admit that… I have a love/hate relationship with cardio. Sure, I love to run…but some days I just don’t want to. Though now that it’s warmer I feel like I will run more, but this past winter I had absolutely no desire to run, and I’m totally okay with that. Though my brother, dad and I did get in a good 2 miler yesterday!
I just hate other forms of cardio like the elliptical, biking, stepper, etc. I just get so bored! I’m all about the weightlifting.
I admit that… I will never be a morning person. I have tried SO many times to wake up and work out in the AM but it’s always been a fail. I have slept in my workout clothes, but that has not made me any less apt to hit snooze. I just have way more energy in the evening. Why force something, right?
I admit that… I’m really not a huge fan of vegetables. I’m pretty sure I will never crave them, and I eat them because, well, I have to. I guess there are some I like over others but I can’t think of any that I would say I LOVE. Just sat here staring at the screen trying to think if there’s one I love…nope, I got nothing. Maybe tomatoes?
I admit that… I view the gym as a playground. I love going to the gym to lift. I rarely don’t feel like going due to energy or anything…it’s just something I look forward to every day because I can’t wait to see what my numbers for the day will be. I could probably spend a decent amount of time there, because I like trying new exercises/machines, and challenging myself on different things. I also love trying new classes! It is kind of like a playground for adults right? Or am I just weird…
Which of these things can you relate to?
Do you like veggies? Give me a vegetable suggestion please!

My Current Training Routine
I have been lifting a lot more recently, and really have increased me strength on several big lifts. I haven’t ran more than 2 miles at a time since the NYC Marathon. I wanted a break from schedule runs, and now run by doing hill sprints 1-2x a week.
During marathon training, I didn’t lift a lot or lift heavy, so it was no surprise that my first day back to lifting I felt pretty weak and was extremely sore the next day.
I have been lifting with my brother, and we are following this 16 week program from BodyBuilding.com. His goal was to gain muscle and mass, and he needed a spotter, so I figured I’d join. My current goal is to gain muscle and strength.
The first day we lifted was tough! I used to be way stronger but was struggling to bench press just the bar (45 lbs). In 4 weeks (“Phase 1″), however, I increased my strength in all the lifts! Here are some examples:
The program is 4 phases of 4 weeks. Currently we are in Phase 2 which is Pyramid Training. We start an exercise at 20-15 reps, then decrease reps while increasing weight. It is certainly challenging!
Here is how our week is broken up:
Monday- Chest & Back
Tuesday- Legs
Wednesday- Off
Thursday- Shoulders
Friday- Full body HIIT/strength
Saturday- HIIT/Hill sprints
Sunday- Off
My mom started the program 3 weeks ago and has also seen similar results. I’m really liking it so far, and like to do muscle group splits as opposed to full-body. It’s a great way to lift heavy multiple days in a row but give other muscles a break. I love going to the gym each week and increasing the weight in order to challenge myself.
I plan to finish out the program, and then see what my running goals are. For now, I’d like to focus on getting stronger and leaner. I just needed a mental and physical break from a running training plan…I’m sure you’ve all been there! I’ll keep you posted on results after 16 weeks
Do you follow a lifting plan/routine?
Are you able to lift regularly while also marathon training?
