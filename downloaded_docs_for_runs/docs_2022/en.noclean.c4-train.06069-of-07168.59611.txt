What are hemorrhoids? Well, if you have had them, than you certainly know what we are talking about. Hemorrhoids are painful abnormally swollen veins in the rectum and anus. They are very similar to varicose veins but in a different area, obviously. Bulging hemorrhoid veins will swell, burn and itch. They can bleed and are very painful and uncomfortable.
The first class of herbal extracts for using in the treatment of hemorrhoids would be the ones that work to sooth the pain and these are also the most commonly used. The most popular herb for hemorrhoid pain treatment is Witch Hazel and you will find this herb on the list of ingredients in virtually all over the counter hemorrhoid creams products on the market. In its astringent form, it is often used to treat sores, bruises and swelling. A sitz bath with Witch Hazel and Calendula can be used for hemorrhoid treatment or you can also use Yarrow, Sage, Bayberry, Oak Bark, and Yellowroot. These combinations of herbs have shown some evidence of being effective as they work to tighten the damaged tissue, stop the bleeding, and begin the healing process.
???	Constant sitting ???	Straining with bowel movements (from constipation or hard stools) ???	Diarrhea ???	Sitting on the toilet for a long time ???	Severe coughing ???	Childbirth ???	Heavy Lifting There are two kinds of hemorrhoids: internal and external. Hemorrhoids are difficult to get rid of completely and tend to recur with less straining than it took to cause them in the first place. Good habits and simple medical treatment usually control hemorrhoids well. Surgery is only recommended in very severe cases.
4. Eating fiber-rich bulking agents such as plantain and Psyllium seed husks to help create soft stool that is easy to pass to lessen the irritation of existing hemorrhoids.
Men and women are equally as likely to get hemorrhoids, and about half the world's population will have had them by the age of 50. They are probably most common amongst pregnant women. This is caused by the pressure of the fetus combined with the hormonal shifts, and these cause the vessels that cause the condition. Fortunately, for women who develop this condition during pregnancy, it is usually temporary and they will go away after pregnancy.
Treatment includes gradually increasing fiber and water in the diet, using creams to help stop itching, and occasional use of stool softeners. Drink plenty of fluids, at least eight glasses per day. Eat a high-fiber diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains. Laser, infrared beam, or electricity is used to cauterize the affected tissues. Cleanse the entire rectal area with warm water after each bowel movement, and use a bulk fiber laxative to soften stools. Many people use bulk fiber supplements daily to prevent recurrences of hemorrhoids. Sitz baths (soaking the rectal area in hot water, in a shallow bath) for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times/day are a simple and effective treatment for both goals. Sclerotherapy. In this procedure, your doctor injects a chemical solution around the blood vessel to shrink the hemorrhoid. Do not delay or try to prevent a bowel movement when the urge is present. Exercise, especially aerobic, may help produce more regular bowel movements. Drink plenty of liquids and eat regularly scheduled meals. Keep the area around the anus clean and dry.
There are also classes of herbs that can be used to make teas or used externally in a sitz bath and some can actually be taken either way. Because the herbs listed below are not as commonly used for hemorrhoids as the ones above and also because they are often associated with use for other conditions, I do not advocate using any of them without further research. Teas used to treat hemorrhoids can contain herbs such as Lady's Mantle, Sheperd's Purse, Raspberry Leaves, Figwort, Collinsonia, Stone root, Rich weed, and Horse Chestnut. Herbs such as White Pond Lilly and Horse Chestnut can be used either internally as a tea or externally in a sitz bath. There are also many Chinese herbs that it is said can be used to treat hemorrhoids such as Chi Hu, Dang shen, Huang Qi, and Xuan shen.
Most problems that come about from hemorrhoids are in the forms of itching and irritation. They are not life threatening, and most of the known cases of this condition should go away within two to four days of an outbreak. Not everyone will always experience the same symptoms, but a lot of people will experience the symptom of finding blood on the toilet paper and in the toilet bowl. This represents an internal form of hemorrhoids. If these become external problems, then there might be lumps and more pain associated with them. You must then consult your physician if pain becomes unbearable.
