32 Safer Uses for WD-40 | Amoils.com
Added January 11, 2012, Under: Environment, Health
WD-40 is a nationally renowned product in the US and has been for many years. There are loads of uses and I will list many of these later in this post. However, some of these suggested applications involve putting WD-40 on your skin to prevent arthritis pain in the joints or using as a lure when fishing. I would not be happy about recommending such practices for a product that is petroleum based.
WD-40’s formula is a actually a trade secret
The product is not patented in order to avoid completely disclosing its ingredients but WD-40’s main ingredients (according to U.S. Material Safety Data Sheet Information) are:
50%: Stoddard solvent (ie mineral spirits – primarily hexane which is somewhat similar to kerosene)
25%: Liquefied petroleum gas (presumably as a propellant – carbon dioxide is now used instead to reduce WD-40’s considerable flammability)
15+% Mineral oil (light lubricating oil)
10-%: Inert ingredients
The German version of the mandatory EU safety sheet lists these safety-relevant ingredients:
60-80%: Heavy Naphtha (petroleum product), hydrogen treated
1-5%: Carbon dioxide
It further lists flammability and effects to the human skin when repeatedly exposed to WD-40 as risks when using the produce. Nitrile rubber gloves and safety glasses should be used. Water is unsuitable for extinguishing burning WD-40.
So you can see from this that WD-40 is certainly not green and should be handled with care. The State of California does not require a Proposition 65 (cancer warning) label on it.
Here are all the different things for which you can use WD-40
1. Protecting silver from tarnishing.
2. Removing road tar and grime from cars.
3. Cleaning and lubricating guitar strings.
4. Restoring and cleaning chalkboards.
5. Removing lipstick stains.
6. Loosening stubborn zippers.
7. Untangling jewelry chains.
8. Removing stains from stainless steel sinks.
9. Removing dirt and grime from the barbecue grill.
10. Removing tomato stains from clothing.
11. Keeping glass shower doors free of water spots.
12. Camouflaging scratches in ceramic and marble floors.
13. Keeping scissors working smoothly.
14. Lubricating noisy door hinges on vehicles and doors in homes.
15. Removing black scuff marks from the kitchen floor.
16. Removing bug guts from the finish on your car.
17. Giving a children’s playground gym slide a shine for a super fast slide.
18. Lubricating gear shift and mower deck lever for ease of handling on riding mowers.
19. Lubricating tracks in sticking home windows, making them easier to open.
20. Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close.
21. Restoring and cleaning padded leather dashboards in vehicles, as well as vinyl bumpers.
22. Restoring and cleaning roof racks on vehicles.
23. Lubricating and stopping squeaks in electric fans.
24. Lubricating wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons, and bicycles for easy handling.
25. Lubricating fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running smoothly.
26. Keeping rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools.
27. Removes splattered grease on stove.
28. Keeping bathroom mirror from fogging.
29. Lubricating prosthetic limbs.
30. Removing all traces of duct tape.
31. Removing crayon from walls. Spray on the mark and wipe with a clean rag.
32. Spraying on the distributor cap to displace the moisture and allow the car to start.
Please remember that this is a petroleum based lubricant and you should wear gloves, safety goggles and be in a well ventilated area when using it.
