4 Simple Ways to Avoid Falling for Cancer Hoaxes
Published by CTOAM on April 9, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Recently, Donald Trump, President of the United States, suggested that the noise from windmills causes cancer. Here at CTOAM, we believe in giving you all the information you need to make educated choices about cancer prevention and cancer care. So here are some simple tips to help you separate fact from fiction! 1. Think Critically When you come across a claim about cancer, the first thing to do is to think critically about it. This means using your common sense and rational brain to figure out if it seems reasonable or not. For starters, just ask some basic questions about the claim and the person (or organization) behind it. For example, when President Trump flippantly mentions that windmill noise causes cancer, you might want to...

Eat to Beat Cancer with Nutraceuticals
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many cancers are profoundly impacted by diet and lifestyle behaviours. For some cancers, preventative actions – like a nutraceutical diet or targeted exercise program – have been shown to reduce the chance of cancer developing by 80%+. What Are Nutraceuticals? Nutraceuticals are parts of foods or supplements that have a proven role in regulating the genes and processes involved in cancer. Each week, new studies emerge that demonstrate the positive impact of nutraceuticals in cancer treatment and prevention. At CTOAM, we have seen remarkable results in our clients after just one week on a nutraceutical diet. But don’t just take our word for it – convince yourself by reading the many peer-reviewed scientific journals, studies, and research-based articles on this subject, and see for yourself. Science-Based Nutrition...

Did You Inherit Cancer Causing Gene Mutations?
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many of us have had a blood relative with cancer. If you inherited certain causing genetic mutations, it can increase your chances of developing cancer as well. Two Types of Inherited Mutations There are two types of inherited mutations that could affect you for cancer. 1. Germline Inherited: These are inherited through the family germline, affecting many generations. They’re relatively rare, connected with causing 10 -15% of cancers. 2. Somatic Inherited: In contrast, the other type of inherited mutation is only present in that person – and not their family. So, with this kind, there is no previous family history of cancer. Most cancers are caused by this type of inheritance. Inherited Mutations with NO Family History This type of inherited mutation occurs when the...

How Genomic Profiling Increases Cancer Patients’ Chances of Survival!
Published by CTOAM on October 3, 2018 1 Comment
In nearly a decade of helping people recover from cancer, CTOAM’s precision oncology specialists have never seen two people with exactly the same cancer. Our specialists have seen people with breast, lung, brain, and prostate cancer, as well as other types of cancer – and, even within the same category, no two people have had the exact same mutations driving their cancer. Therefore, each of our patients has required a unique combination of advanced targeted therapies and nutraceuticals, and sometimes in addition to other treatment interventions. In order to have the best chance of recovery from cancer, your treatment must target your unique genetic mutations. And for that, you need genomic profiling and Precision Oncology’s gene-based approach to cancer care. What is Cancer? Cancer is...

Can Exercise Prevent Cancer?
Published by CTOAM on April 5, 2018 5 Comments
Looking for a good reason to step up your exercise and weightlifting routine? Most of us know that exercise is beneficial for lowering stress and increasing energy. But rigorous exercise and weight training are also proven to help prevent cancer, as well as slowing the progression and metastasis of cancers. Read on to find out what they are – and then get yourself to the gym, stat! 4 Ways That Exercise Prevents Cancer Here are some of the main mechanisms behind how rigorous exercise inhibits cancers: 1. Reduced Angiogenesis Since cancer cells are rapidly reproducing, they need to recruit extra blood vessels to help with their high metabolism. When you exercise with weights, you limit the ability of tumours to hijack blood vessels. This is...
