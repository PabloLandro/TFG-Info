💥 Many think that stretching before a workout can help prevent injuries. However, very little data exists to support this opinion. Stretching can, in certain cases, increase injury risk and will more than likely impair performance when done before a workout. Keep your warm-ups to dynamic movements like plyometrics, jogging, or any other form of warm-up that gets a light sweat going. If you still want to stretch, do so after your workout.

💥 A common thought in the health and fitness industry is that deep squats are bad for your knees. However, virtually no research supports this theory. The anatomy of the knee joint helps stabilize the knee during deep squats and the connective tissue of the knee is rarely challenged past 50% of its peak tensile strength. Keep in mind, however, that any exercise can cause pain or injury when done wrong, so always make sure your form is perfect and use appropriate weights. Check out our article on my website for more details!

💥 Last but not least, use your natural build for a deadlift advantage. Lifters with longer legs and shorter torsos will usually be able to lift more weight in a sumo stance - this is why women are typically better sumo deadlifters than conventional deadlifters. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, stick to conventional deadlifts. If you’re only concerned with building muscle rather than picking a stance for a 1RM, use both types in your training for optimal development.

@Regrann de @themusclephd - 💥 O ZMA tem sido frequentemente apresentado como um impulsionador de testosterona, e embora essa alegação nem sempre tenha sido comprovada, o ZMA tem vários outros benefícios que podem impulsionar a recuperação e a função imunológica de atletas e fisiculturistas. Escolha uma formulação que tenha pelo menos 30mg de zinco, 500mg de magnésio e 10mg de vitamina B6. Alguns indivíduos acharão mais útil usar este suplemento antes de dormir, pois isso pode melhorar a qualidade do sono! - ▪ Fonte: Moëzzi, N., Peeri, M., & Matin, H. (2013).

More people need to realise the scientific facts of stretching. I see too many people spend hours stretching before workouts not knowing there's more effective ways of warming up and getting ready for a workout.
If you are still sceptic about this, just go read up about the Golgi tendon reflex and muscle spindles.
Do activation work before you start your workouts. .

Alongar... PODE Prevenir Lesões?? -
1 - Alongamento pode ajudar na flexibilidade más não na mobilidade.
2 - Mobilidade é a capacidade de uma articulação está forte e estável durante a amplitude de movimento.
3 - Adicionar amplitude de movimento sem força ou estabilidade pode aumentar o risco de lesão.
4 - Alongar antes do treino pode prejudicar a performance como diminuir a força máxima nas articulações e ativação muscular.

I've been saying this for a while. It's pretty common sense. I hardly stretch because I perform functional compound movement workouts and keep myself well balanced. I only stretch when I need to. You will hardly see me doing isolated movements anymore.

Está mais que comprovado através de vários estudos que a velocidade de execução não interfere nos ganhos na musculação. Deixe a forma correta de execução, estabelecer a velocidade da execução (cadencia). 1 - Cargas mais elevada vai mover mais devagar do que carga mais leve. 2 - A fadiga no treino vai interferir na velocidade da execução. Referencia: Estudo de @bradschoenfeldphd Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, abaixo. Thanks @themusclephd Dr. Jacob Wilson.

💥 Many trainers advocate for using slow and controlled lifting tempos as they believe this will lead to greater growth. However, this review found that lifting tempo has no effect on muscle growth. Furthermore, extremely slow tempos were actually less effective for growth than fast tempos. Let the weight, fatigue level, and lifting form dictate your lifting tempo while training.

💥 A common thought in the health and fitness industry is that deep squats are bad for your knees. However, virtually no research supports this theory. The anatomy of the knee joint helps stabilize the knee during deep squats and the connective tissue of the knee is rarely challenged past 50% of its peak tensile strength. Keep in mind, however, that any exercise can cause pain or injury when done wrong, so always make sure your form is perfect and use appropriate weights. Check out our article on my website for more details!

Os ortopedistas piram, mas nenhum estudou indicou que o agachamento profundo gerou lesão na articulação do joelho.

Lembrando que todo e qualquer exercício mal executado torna-se lesivo, daí tamanha importância de um profissional adequado para melhor orientação.

💥 Creatine monohydrate is probably the most effective supplement on the market for athletes and bodybuilders. The monohydrate form has the most research and evidence behind its efficacy and is the one I most recommend. A loading protocol doesn’t appear to be necessary, so taking 5-grams a day should do the trick.

Yall know I'm all about the science. Looks like we are doing tongue curls for our next strength cycle ;) Reposted from @themusclephd - 💥In this ground-breaking study, it was found that pressing your tongue into the roof of your mouth increased power production on isolation exercises significantly more than other tongue positions in the mouth. This may be due to a unique interaction between the tongue and CNS. This also may only work on isolation exercises, more research definitely needs to be done to see if the effect carries over into compound movements. Try it out and let me know what you think!

💥 ZMA has often been purported as a testosterone booster, and while that claim hasn’t always been proven, ZMA has several other benefits that may boost recovery and immune function for athletes and bodybuilders.

💥 The amino sulfonic acid, taurine, is one of the most abundant chemicals in the body. Taurine has been shown to act as an antioxidant and can improve endurance performance and increase repetitions to failure during strength training. However, antioxidants have been shown to impair muscle growth, so bodybuilders may not want to take taurine in high dosages or around their workouts. Endurance athletes will garner the most benefits from taurine supplementation.

💥 This study found that subjects sleeping 8.5-hrs per night lost more fat than subjects sleeping 5.5-hrs per night during a 2-week restricted diet. Both groups lost the same amount of weight, but the 8.5-hr/night group lost significantly more weight as fat. If you’re trying to cut body fat, mild sleep deprivation can impair your progress and can even cause muscle loss.

@themusclephd - 💥 This study compared the effects of consuming 25g of protein to 25g of protein plus alcohol after a workout. It was found that consuming alcohol after a workout severely impaired post-workout muscle protein synthesis. If your goal is to gain muscle, avoid alcohol after your workout and consume alcohol in moderation when you do drink. Have fun but take care of your gains!

This study found that Smith machine bench press offered similar chest activation to free weight bench, but stabilizer activity was much higher in the free weight bench. Free weights should be the primary focus in your training for maximizing overall development, but machines can be used to focus more on individual muscles in a compound movement.

💥 Last but not least, use your natural build for a deadlift advantage. Lifters with longer legs and shorter torsos will usually be able to lift more weight in a sumo stance - this is why women are typically better sumo deadlifters than conventional deadlifters. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, stick to conventional deadlifts. If you’re only concerned with building muscle rather than picking a stance for a 1RM, use both types in your training for optimal development.

☝🏻🤨 BUT, it comes down to quantity and frequency - because #moreisbetter does NOT apply!!
.
A PERFECT example of my favorite response to questions - It DEPENDS - 💥And for the record, look for what will be emerging in the research about ketones AND carbs to SuperCHARGE Performance!!

💥Several studies have found that ingesting carbs before your workout can help improve performance, especially in endurance events. Shoot for 30-60 grams within an hour before your workout to maximize the effect. If you are keto-adapted, large amounts of pre-workout carbs will probably not be best. Stick to 10-30 grams at most if you want to improve performance while remaining keto.

🔷 I think that helping others in need is something that drives me and gives me purpose. My furry friend in this picture is my dog, Manny, and he lived his whole life in a kennel before we found him at the Humane Society. No one else wanted him because he was obese and depressed but what they didn't realize is that he had all of the love in the world to give and just needed someone who would give it back to him. I encourage you, if you have the time and resources, to adopt an animal in need and give them the love they deserve. It will be one of the most rewarding experiences in your life, I promise you.

💥 The researchers in this study found that well-trained powerlifters had deadlift sticking points around 95-degrees of hip flexion – this is typically where the mechanical advantage in the deadlift is the smallest. This means that you need to train movements like block pulls, rack pulls, and RDLs to improve strength in this position and increase your max. Bands and chains are another great option for improving strength in the top half of the lift.

💥Training when you’re sick is a tricky scenario as it’s much easier to overtrain given the amount of stress that’s already on the body. Follow these recommendations to continue training without risking overtraining while you’re sick. For severe infections like the Flu, taking time off is the best route for full recovery.
