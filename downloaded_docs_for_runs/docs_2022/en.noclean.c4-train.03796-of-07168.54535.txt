Fenugreek Extract May Improve Sexual Function in Mature Men
Filed under: Lifestyle — Sarah @ 9:28 am
As males age they experience age related androgen decrease, which can lead to a number of symptoms including a decrease in sexual function. A recent study suggests that taking a fenugreek extract may increase testosterone levels and help reduce symptoms of age related androgen decrease in middle aged and older men.
Participants in the study included 120 healthy men between the ages of 43 and 70. Over the course of 12 weeks, they were given either 600 mg of Fenugreek seed extract or a placebo daily.
At the conclusion of the study, the researchers noted a significant increase in total serum testosterone and free testosterone levels in the Fenugreek extract group, when compared with the placebo. They also noted improvements in sexual function — including increased number of morning erections and frequency of sexual activity — as well as decreased scores on the Aging Male Symptom questionnaire in the supplement group.
Researchers from the University of Sydney, Integrated Health Group, Princess Alexandra Hospital, and Medlab Pty Ltd — all in Australia — conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on January 20, 2016, in The Aging Male.
Previous studies have found a correlation between fenugreek seed extract and digestive health, improved heart health, improving female sexual function, and lowering high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.
Fenugreek has a sweet taste that is often compared to maple syrup and can be added directly to food. It can also be ingested as a supplement.

Eating Protein Throughout the Day May Help Maintain Muscle Mass
Filed under: Exercise — Emma @ 8:47 am
As we age, we naturally lose lean tissue mass (muscle), and that can reduce mobility. A recent study suggests that consuming an even amount of protein at all three daily meals helps build lean tissue mass.
Participants in the study included 60 people between the ages of 50 and 70. They were given either a beverage with a high-quality, milk-based protein or a beverage with similar calories but no added protein for breakfast and lunch over the course of 24 weeks. The portions of the drink were adjusted for the median body mass of the participants.
At the conclusion of the study, the researchers noted an increase in lean tissue mass in the protein group, to the equivalent of 0.6 kg more than the placebo group.
Researchers from FHI University of Limerick conducted the study. It was published on January 1, 2016, in The Journal of Nutrition.
Protein functions as a building block for bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood. It is also a building block for enzymes, hormones, and vitamins. Previous studies suggest that consuming high amounts of protein may help build muscle and increase metabolism.

Zinc May Boost Immune T Cells in Mature Adults
Filed under: Zinc — Sarah @ 9:04 am
Immune T cells are important for almost all of our adaptive immune responses, and T cell function declines as we age. A recent study suggests that zinc supplements may help boost the function of immune T cells in people who live in assisted living facilities.
Participants in the study included 53 people who lived in nursing homes. 58% of the participants (or 31 people) had low zinc levels, which was defined as less than 70 micrograms per dL. Those 31 people were assigned to take either 30 mg of zinc or a placebo daily for three months.
At the conclusion of the study, the researchers found that average serum zinc concentration increased by 16% in the zinc group. They also noted a correlating increase in the number of T cells in those participants, as well as enhancement of T cell function. However, the 30 mg dose was not enough to raise serum levels above 70 ug/dL in people whose initial levels were below 60 ug/dL.
Researchers from Tufts University, Boston University School of Medicine, Hebrew SeniorLife and Harvard Medical School conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on January 27, 2016, in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Zinc is an essential mineral that has been linked to maintaining a healthy immune system, healing wounds, helping with growth, supporting the reproductive system, and improved eye health.
The human body cannot make zinc, so it’s important to get it from food and supplement sources. Zinc can be found in many foods, including oysters, beef, crab, fortified cereals, lobster, beans, yogurt, nuts, milk, chicken, cheese, and oatmeal. You can also consume zinc in a supplement form, but be careful not to take too much. Intakes of greater than 150 mg per day have been associated with negative side effects, such as a weakened immune system.

Unintentional Weight Loss May Increase Risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment
Filed under: Diet & Weight loss — Emma @ 8:53 am
A recent study suggests that increasing unintentional weight loss as people progress from midlife to later life may increase the risk of mild cognitive impairment, which can progress to dementia or Alzheimer’s.
Participants in the study included 1,895 people who were 70 years or older and cognitively normal at the outset of the study. All of them took part in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which started on October 1, 2004. The researchers used medical records to determine maximum weight and height in midlife.
Over a mean follow-up period of 4.4 years, 524 of them developed mild cognitive impairment. 50.3% were men with a mean age of 78.5 years. The mean rate of weight change per decade from midlife to the beginning of the study was greater for participants who developed mild cognitive impairment compared to those who did not.
After examining the data, the researchers determined that a greater decline in weight per decade was associated with a higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment. Specifically, a weight loss of 11 pounds per decade corresponded with a 24% increase in risk of mild cognitive impairment.
Researchers from the Mayo Clinic conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on February 1, 2016, in JAMA Neurology.
Previous studies have identified 6 pillars of a brain-healthy lifestyle. They are regular exercise, healthy diet, mental stimulation, quality sleep, stress management and an active social life. Incorporating all of these into your daily life may help reduce the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment.

Polydextrose Dietary Fiber May Reduce Calorie Intake
Filed under: Fiber — Sarah @ 8:46 am
A recent study suggests that consuming polydextrose dietary fiber may reduce calorie consumption by up to 15%.
For their analysis, researchers from DuPont Nutrition & Health and the University of Oxford examined data from seven studies. In all of the studies, polydextrose was consumed either alone or with other foods.
The separate subjective feelings of appetite reported in the studies were Hunger, Satisfaction, Fullness, Prospective Food Consumption and the Desire to Eat.
In order to be able to make a meaningful comparison of the results obtained using widely differing criteria, the researchers developed a new methodology to estimate changes in appetite before and after a meal. They found that consuming between 6.25 and 25 grams of polydextrose dietary fiber was associated with up to a 15% reduction in calorie consumption. Hunger between meals was also reduced.
The researchers wrote that this was the first study to show that polydextrose reduces the Desire to Eat during Satiation period.
The study was published January 14, 2016, in Nutrients.
Polydextrose dietary fiber is a soluble fiber. Previous studies have linked fiber consumption with lowering total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and regulating blood sugar for people with diabetes.
Soluble fiber can be found naturally in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium. Insoluble fiber can be found in whole wheat and grains, brown rice, fruit, broccoli, cabbage and dark leafy vegetables.

Ashwagandha Root Extract May Improve Sexual Dysfunction in Women
Filed under: Lifestyle — Emma @ 8:44 am
Women with sexual dysfunction experience orgasm disorder and sexual difficulties. A recent study suggests that supplements of ashwagandha root extract may improve sexual function in healthy women.
Participants in the study included 50 women between the ages of 21 and 50 who were given 300 mg of high-concentration ashwagandha root extract or a placebo twice daily for eight weeks. The researchers measured sexual function via the Female Sexual Function Index Questionnaire (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS).
At the conclusion of the study, the ashwagandha root group had significantly greater improvement in the FSFI total score compared with the placebo group. Supplementation was also found to be associated with improvements in arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction.
Researchers from Trupti Hospital and Santati Fertility Center, BVDU Dental College & Hospital, and NSHM Knowledge Campus, all in India, conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on October 4, 2015, in BioMed Research International.
Previous studies suggest that ashwagandha may help with memory, cognitive function and brain health, increase strength, and help with sexual dysfunctions. The best way to consume ashwagandha is by taking a high quality supplement.

Coffee May Lower Risk of Cirrhosis of the Liver and Death From Cirrhosis
Filed under: Antioxidants — Sarah @ 9:15 am
Cirrhosis of the liver occurs when healthy liver tissue is replaced with scar tissue, which stops the liver from maintaining healthy function. A recent study suggests that drinking more coffee may lower the risk of cirrhosis of the liver.
For their review, the researchers examined 1,990 cases with more than 430,000 participants. They found that drinking an additional two cups of coffee daily was associated with a 44% lower risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and a 50% lower risk of death from cirrhosis.
The researchers believe that the protective effects could be due to coffee protecting against the fibrotic and inflammatory processes that can result in cirrhosis. They also hypothesized that coffee may suppress oxidative stress and inhibit tumor necrosis.
Researchers from the University of Southampton and the University of Edinburgh, both in the UK, conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on January 25, 2016, in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.
The health benefits associated with coffee are generally attributed to the powerful antioxidants found in coffee called polyphenols. These benefits include reducing the risk of developing diabetes, prostate cancer, cirrhosis and oral cavities.
One note to coffee drinkers: be careful how you take your coffee. A double latte with whipped cream and three sugars may provide the health benefits seen here, but the high fat and sugar content can have other negative effects.

Type II Collagen May Provide Relief for People with Knee Osteoarthritis
Filed under: Exercise — Emma @ 9:12 am
Knee osteoarthritis can be a crippling disease, hindering movement and causing pain in people who suffer from it. A recent study suggests that taking a type II collagen supplement derived from chicken sternum cartilage may improve knee joint symptoms in people with knee osteoarthritis.
Participants in the study included 234 people between the ages of 40 and 75 years old with a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2. All of the participants had moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis, as diagnosed by physical examination, and had knee pain for three months before the start of the study.
Over the course of 180 days, the participants were given either 40 mg of type II collagen supplements, glucosamine chondroitin (1,500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride and 1,200 mg of chondroitin sulfate) pills, or a placebo. The type II collagen participants were instructed to take two placebo capsules in the morning and two 20mg capsules of type II collagen in the evening. The researchers used the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to assess pain.
The researchers found that the type II collagen group had a significant reduction in their overall WOMAC score when compared with the placebo and the glucosamine chondroitin groups. They also noted significant changes in all three WOMAC subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function.
Researchers from InterHealth Nutraceuticals and the University of California, Davis, conducted the study. It was published on January 29, 2016, in Nutrition Journal.
Approximately 25% of bone structure is collagen. It contributes to bone strength by lending a certain amount of flexibility to the rigid structure, allowing bone to give a little under pressure. Previous studies suggest that type II native collagen from chickens may provide pain relief when exercising.

Unprocessed Milk May Reduce Risk of Asthma in Children
Filed under: Food and Nutrition — Emma @ 9:00 am
Unprocessed cow’s milk has higher omega-3 fatty acid levels than pasteurized, homogenized, and low-fat milk. A new study has found a link between consumption of unprocessed cow’s milk and a reduced risk of asthma, which the researchers attribute to the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3’s.
Participants in the study included 1,133 children living in rural areas in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, and France. The children’s mothers kept records of their nutrition and illness until the age of six. Milk consumption in 934 of the children was assessed via yearly questionnaires, samples of “usually” consumed milk, and serum samples collected at age four. The parents reported asthma diagnoses at age six.
The researchers found that by age six the proportion of children who drank unprocessed farm milk had a significantly lower level of asthma onset than those who did not. They believe that the protective effects are in part due to the higher omega-3 fatty acid content in the unprocessed milk.
The researchers also noted that the beneficial effect of the milk on asthma increased over time and that recent consumption of untreated milk was more relevant than consumption in the first years of life.
Researchers from Ludwig Maximillians Universität Munich in Germany conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on January 11, 2016, in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
Unpasteurized milk is not legal in many states because it may contain harmful bacteria, including E. coli. However, previous studies suggest that it may be associated with reducing symptoms of eczema as well as helping people with asthma. The scientific community is divided on the cost/benefit balance of consuming raw milk.

Vacation Weight Gain May Contribute to Obesity
Filed under: Diet & Weight loss — Sarah @ 9:00 am
Many people consider vacation to be a break from everything — including exercise and eating healthy. In line with this, a recent study suggests that people gain an average of one pound for every one week to three week vacation, which can contribute to “creeping obesity.”
Creeping obesity is the slow gain of body fat over a long period of time, which can lead to increased health problems later in life.
Participants in the study included 122 people between the ages of 18 and 65, with an average age of 32. All of the participants went on one to three week vacations between the months of March and August. All of them came in for three lab visits, during which height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio were measured. The first visit was one week before the vacation, the second one week after vacation, and the third six weeks after vacation.
The researchers found that 61% of the participants gained weight over their vacation, with an average 0.7 pound weight gain. The average weight gain over the entire study period was 0.9 pounds.
They also found that the participants gained weight despite an increase in physical activity during the vacation. This was partially due to increased caloric intake, especially of alcohol, during the vacation. On average, the participants consumed eight alcoholic drinks per week prio to vacation, and 16 drinks per week during vacation. Participants also typically saw a decrease in physical activity in the weeks following vacation.
There were, however, benefits to the vacations including lower stress levels and a small reduction in systolic blood pressure for as long as six weeks post-vacation.
Researchers from the University of Georgia’s College of Family and Consumer Sciences conducted the study. It was published online ahead of print on January 5, 2016, in Physiology & Behavior.
Obesity has a far ranging negative effect on health. Each year, obesity causes approximately 300,000 premature deaths in the United States. The negative health effects associated with obesity include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, metabolic syndrome and sleep apnea.
Improving eating habits and increasing physical activity play a vital role in preventing obesity. It is recommended that we eat five to six servings of fruits and vegetables per day. It’s also recommended that we get at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity every day and, as this study shows, increase that physical activity post-vacation.
