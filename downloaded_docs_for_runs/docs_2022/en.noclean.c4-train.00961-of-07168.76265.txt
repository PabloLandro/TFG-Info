Natural Hemorrhoid Relief
Published January 20, 2009 | By Erin
Believe it or not, there are many different ways you can obtain natural hemorrhoid relief. Your problem exists for a variety of reasons. Many people believe there are only a few distinct factors that contribute to the development of this painful situation. However, that is simply not true. Because there are so many different contributing factors to your most disagreeable situation, there are also a wide variety of helpful recommendations that you can use to give you natural hemorrhoid relief.
You see, diet is a huge part of your problem. If you can find a suitable hemorrhoids diet, that will be a huge part of your solution for natural hemorrhoid relief. Try to eat foods that are high in dietary fiber. Some examples would be wheat bran, fresh fruits and nearly all vegetables. Apples, beets, broccoli, carrots, green beans, oat bran, pears, and whole grains are mostly recommended to give natural hemorrhoid relief. A high-fiber diet is one of the most important considerations when it comes to finding natural hemorrhoid relief.
Now if you decide to use a fiber supplement, start with a moderate amount and then increase your intake gradually. If you take too much at first, this will cause painful bloating, gas, and possibly diarrhea. Frankly, if this happens, it will be the opposite of finding natural hemorrhoid relief. It is always important to read the directions on your fiber supplement to ensure you don’t take more than the recommended amount.
Also, keep in mind that these suggestions should not be used as your only solution. You also need to find a natural hemorrhoids remedy with thorough information and explanation about how it works and if there are valid success testimonials about finding natural hemorrhoid relief.
It’s difficult to wade through all the hemorrhoid treatment possibilities out there. Which one will give you the much needed natural hemorrhoid relief that you’re searching for? Be sure to look for one with a potent blend of natural ingredients that all serve a purpose in helping you to find natural hemorrhoid relief.

Hemroids Home Remedies
Published December 18, 2008 | By Erin
You know what’s funny about the idea of hemroids home remedies? The fact that nine times out of ten, the remedies you are supposed to find around your home are seldom already there. What happened to the days when home remedies meant we actually could use what should already be lying around the house as a treatment? Especially in the case of these specific ailments, it is rare to find hemroids home remedies that are already in your house.
I guess that now days it is different from when we actually used to walk out our back door and pick natural herbs to heal ourselves. Now days we walk out our back door and instead of a meadow of herbs, we find a Walgreens pharmacy. So the term of hemroids home remedies is probably now more accurately describing some remedies you can use in your home without having to pay for an expensive doctors’ visit with expensive antibiotics.
Another reason they call them, ‘hemroids home remedies,’ is that the basic idea behind the cure you use is more often than not an all-natural solution. It’s amazing as we advance more and more with our research. We’re coming to find that some ingredients we used to deem helpful are now quite obviously hurtful. Take tobacco, for instance. We used to use tobacco as more of an alleviant than a recreational drug. Throughout the years it has evolved into a substance packed with man-made chemicals.
We’ve since come to find out how dangerous it is for us. The list goes on and on. My point is that your hemroids home remedies should be all natural to ensure your optimal and long-term health. Doctor’s antibiotics that have been packed with man-made chemicals can never be guaranteed. We hear about drug recalls and law suits all the time. That’s why you should be sure to take care of your situation with all-natural hemroids home remedies.

Hemroids Cures
Published December 17, 2008 | By Erin
When it comes to hemroids cures, it’s important to examine each and every ingredient in your remedy. Let’s be honest, you want to ensure you’re getting the most for your money. More importantly, you also don’t want to waste your time with unnecessary filler ingredients that dilute the blend and end up taking longer to heal your problem.
That is one of the many reasons that I, Hemroid Harry, pride myself on my herbal remedy. We list each ingredient in my remedy, as well as its purpose. And believe me, each ingredient has a purpose. We simply broke down what your problem actually is and created our hemroids cures to attack that problem at every angle. You see, your problem is not caused by only one or two factors. There are several factors that led you to the regrettable situation that put you on this search for hemroids cures.
Weakened veins and constipation are common partial causes. All hemroids cures should include something for those issues. Also, blood circulation is one of the best ways your body is able to remove waste materials and cleanse itself. A blood cleanser is essential in any hemroids cures.
Naturally, we need to do everything we can to make certain our bodies can cleanse properly. Think of your body like a garbage disposal – We are constantly taking in all sorts of crap with the excessive sugar and fats that we consume. If our bodies are unable to easily and naturally flush that out, we end up with big problems. To learn more about exactly how it works, click here.
Regardless of whether or not you use my hemroids cures, be sure to look into a solution that will attack not just one or two, but the many causes of your problem. Also be aware that several hemroids cures will be including unnecessary or ‘filler’ ingredients that will only prolong the solution to your situation. That’s why it’s very important to use a well-rounded remedy such as ours. You don’t have to take my word for it; read these testimonials from satisfied customers.

When Hemorrhoids Shrink
Published December 16, 2008 | By Erin
Like most problems, if you ignore them, they won’t go away. In fact, generally speaking, it’s rather safe to say that the problem will only worsen with time. The same is true of hemorrhoids. If you have ignored them for a prolonged period of time, your hemorrhoids will most likely, at one time or another, get out of control. That is when you not only need a long-term hemorrhoids treatment, you also may want to find out how to first make your hemorrhoids shrink in order to quicken the process.
If you can make your hemorrhoids shrink, it will help your cure to work faster and your relief to come sooner. However, making your hemorrhoids shrink is not necessarily the easiest hurdle to conquer. There are many different theories on how to do it. One way to do it is to perform a retention enema. A retention enema means you retain a small amount of the mixture in the colon overnight.
While it is definitely not the first choice for many, a retention enema is good for many reasons. It helps hemorrhoids shrink and is used to reduce swelling. It also fights infection and relieves the pain and bleeding of hemorrhoids. This specific retention enema should take the soreness out of the area as well as to act as an astringent to make your hemorrhoids shrink.
The formula for a retention enema to help your hemorrhoids shrink is to pour one cup boiling water over two teaspoons powdered White Oak Bark, and two teaspoons powedered Goldenseal and let them steep. Next, strain them and let them cool. Add one or two ounces and retain overnight for internal hemorrhoids. Lay a pack of tea on your external hemorrhoids.
While this retention enema will help your hemorrhoids shrink, it is unfortunately an uncomfortable process. Many choose to avoid such and simply use an oral natural hemorrhoids remedy to make their hemorrhoids shrink as well as to cure them long-term. This oral hemorrhoids natural remedy is highly recommended for lasting treatment and relief.

Do You Have Hemorrhoids or a Fissure?
Published December 16, 2008 | By Aaron
If you are like me, you may have never even heard of a fissure before. I only started learning about them as a result of my research about hemorrhoids. As it turns out, a fissure is incredibly similar to a hemorrhoid. They feel quite alike when it comes to the pain and discomfort. They both also are located in your anus. To be more specific, they are your veins in your anus.
Another similarity between a hemorrhoid and a fissure is that they are both caused by constipation. Constipation creates pressure in your anus veins as a result from excessive pushing in that region. A result is stressed veins in the anus which can lead to either hemorrhoids or fissures.
Both can cause itching, pain and bleeding. The bleeding for a hemorrhoid happens when it bursts from excess pressure or a worn out vein from expanding and retracting constantly from pressure. Bleeding is more common with fissures because they are in fact caused by the passage of hard dry stool that tears the anal lining. Both hemorrhoids and fissures can also be caused by excessive wiping.
The main difference between a fissure and a hemorrhoid is that a fissure is a thin slit-like tear in the anal tissue. A hemorrhoid, however, can be compared to varicose veins. They enlarge and lose their elasticity from excessive pressure which results in saclike protrusions. It is important to note that they are not tumors or growths.
Both hemorrhoids and fissures can be aggravated by sitting or standing for prolonged periods. Even violent coughing, lifting heavy objects and diarrhea can aggravate both unpleasant situations. Interestingly, if you note that they share similar symptoms as well as they are caused by similar root problems, you can further determine that they can also be healed with similar remedies.
Remedies with ingredients that promote vein strengthening, bowel cleansing, and relief with pain and inflammation will be great for both hemorrhoids and fissures. That is why you should check out my natural remedy for both hemorrhoids and fissures.
