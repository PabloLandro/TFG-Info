Weed Delivery Apps. What's Next? Implications for Counseling African American Adolescents With Cannabis Use Disorder
January 7, 2018 Mark Sanders
I just watched a program on MSNBC where they discussed new entrepreneurs who are hoping to make a fortune since California legalized recreational use of marijuana. One person developed a marijuana delivery APP. One of the delivery drivers was a man who quit his job as a delivery person for UPS believing he could make more money delivering marijuana. Another entrepreneur opened a weed restaurant where marijuana is used as a main ingredient in each recipe. The MSNBC host visited a marijuana spa and listened to a customer say she enjoyed "the sensation" of being massaged by an oil which contained marijuana.
In the book the Culture of Addiction and the Culture of Recovery, historian William White, MA describes how drugs go through a cycle from Socially Celebrated (the most approval by society, an example would be expensive alcohol), Socially Tolerated (use is accepted under certain circumstances, an example would be Medical Marijuana), and Socially Prohibited (use of these drugs carry the most stigma and legal consequences, examples include heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines). In the book White points out that in the early 1900's heroin was a socially celebrated drug which dropped to prohibited status as the children of the affluent were dying of overdose deaths (notice how history has repeated itself today). Cigarettes shifted from celebrated to tolerated as it was linked to cancer. Recreational use of marijuana is shifting from a prohibited drug to a celebrated drug as more and more states move towards legalization. What impact will this increased status have on adolescent marijuana use nationwide?
For adolescent African Americans the number one drug of choice is marijuana. In groups I lead they routinely rationalize their use with statements such as, "Marijuana is not addictive. God produced it and everything God produces is good. How could it be bad for you, it grows naturally in the ground? How could it be bad for you? It’s legal?"
My response to these youth has been to introduce science. I tell them that research indicated that 90% of people who drink alcohol or use other drugs do so without becoming addicted to the drug. Approximately 10% of users of any drug including marijuana develop addiction. I tell them that those most vulnerable to addiction are individuals with: family histories of addiction; early age of first use; have histories of childhood trauma etc. (100% of teens I work with). We also discuss the research which describes the link between early marijuana use, psychosis and learning challenges. This info is always received well. I encourage you the reader to think about how you will respond when teens ask you, "How can marijuana be addicting? It’s legal."

An Open Letter to the Hip Hop Community (Rappers): Your Lyrics Can Increase the Risk of Relapse
July 31, 2017 Mark Sanders
Dear Rappers,
The first rap song I ever heard was Rappers Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang. I was a sophomore in college and that song took my college by storm. Music was never the same and in spite of its critics hip hop music has lasted for decades longer than its critics predicted and is now a worldwide phenomenon! Consider that at the time of this writing Jay-Z just signed a Korean rapper to his label. I also give a shout out to how rap music and the success of hip hop artists inspires generations of youth to believe they can succeed. My grandfather picked cotton in the South and once he moved North and secured a good job his philosophy was there's always work at the post office and once hired stay at the job for 50 years and hopefully get a gold watch upon retirement. This generation of rappers has convinced today's youth that they can own the post office and their own Rolex watch company. I'm a baby Boomer and I am inspired by the industriousness and hard work of rappers. My favorite story is of Tupac Shakur. Pronounced dead in 1996, the late rapper produced such a volume of work, i.e. nominated for an Oscar in 2006 and albums are still being released by him over a decade after his death, convincing his fans that like Elvis, Tupac is not dead! I find myself working harder when I think about Tupac and the late Notorious BIG, who at the peak of his success said he wanted to approach is work like an intern, just starting out.
When Hip Hop lyrics are at their best the music has the ability to save lives! I had a relative who was going through the process of divorce and feeling suicidal. A friend forwarded her a you tube video of Lil Wayne singing, "How To Love" She credits that song with changing her life. I want to let you know that lyrics to your songs can keep a certified addictions counselor, such as me, busy countering your drug related lyrics. Many of the adolescent African American Males I counsel initiated drug selling, drug use and are vulnerable to relapse as a result of listening to your lyrics. Many prominent rappers today glorify marijuana smoking, including, Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre, Lil Wayne, Drake, and Gucci Man. Other rappers glorify drinking expensive alcohol as a sign of success, including: Jay-Z, Sean Combs, and Young M.A. While others still talk about the glorification of drug selling even though they're rich including NAS, Jay and Future. Also, many youth have told me that their experimentation with new drugs began after they heard rappers mention theses drugs. i.e. Future (Molly Percocet), Lil Wayne (Purple Drank), a drug that has been known to kill people.
The greatest challenge in my work with young African American males in early recovery is when angry they access the music of their favorite rapper with explicit get high lyrics. The music then puts the youth in the mood to get high. My work involves encouraging them to listen to songs that do not glorify drug use when they are having difficulties. They're also many youth who struggle to successfully complete probation and secure a good job because they struggle to pass a drug test. We have helped many of them successfully complete high school by encouraging them to take "a weed vacation ". During the weed break they were able to clear their head enough to successfully pass the GED Exam. Your words have power. Please join me in being a part of the prevention and recovery solution.
