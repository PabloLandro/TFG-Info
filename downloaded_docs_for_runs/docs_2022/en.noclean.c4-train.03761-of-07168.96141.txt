How Do People Get AIDS?
HIV can spread:
during sex (especially anal sex and vaginal sex)
through sharing needles for injecting drugs or tattooing
by getting stuck with a needle with an infected person's blood on it
HIV also can pass from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.
HIV does not spread through:
pee, poop, spit, throw-up, or sweat (as long as no blood is present)
coughing or sneezing
holding hands
sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses
How Can I Protect Myself?
The best way to protect yourself from HIV is to not have sex (vaginal, oral, or anal) and not share needles.
If you decide to have sex, reduce your risk of getting HIV by:
using a condom every time you have sex (including vaginal, oral, or anal sex)
getting tested for HIV and making sure all partners do too
reducing the number of sexual partners you have
getting tested and treated for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases); having an STD increases the risk of HIV infection
Understanding how HIV spreads can help you make safer choices about sex. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about HIV and if you want to get tested.
