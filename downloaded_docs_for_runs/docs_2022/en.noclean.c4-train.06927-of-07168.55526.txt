The Effects of Drinking Too Much Water
When Excessive Drinking Water Causes More Harm Than Good
According to experts‚Äô advice, drinking 4 litres of water a day is good and beneficial for our health. Have you ever poured 4 litres of water into glasses? How many glasses of water will you get?
Okay, supposed the experts are right, all this water is good for our look and body shape, doesn‚Äôt it make you wonder who will ever get to see the improvement!? Wouldn‚Äôt we be spending most of the day on the toilet, looking fresh, fabulous and fit, but invisible to others as the bladder will be in charge of our daily routine?! What goes in, has to come back out!
Nobody will deny the benefits of drinking water, we all know about the importance of drinking plenty of water. Water is essential, no water ‚Äì no life. But is this matter not overrated? Do you really believe, when celebrities trying to tell us, only with drinking at least 4 litres water a day, they look young and keep fit forever? No Botox, no surgery, water only does the trick! Yeah, how many beauty docs would be jobless?

‚Ä¢ Could Drinking Too Much Water Not Cause More Harm Than Good?
People should only drink when they are thirsty, says Prof. M.Whiteley one of the leading experts on hyperhidrosis in the UK. (Source: MailOnline) We‚Äôre constantly told drinking plenty of water will lead to clear skin and alert mind.
But experts now warn drinking too much fluid is unnecessary and could actually be harmful.

Early symptoms of drinking too much water will occur in kidney problems, but also something particularly embarrassing such as excessive sweating can be early symptoms of drinking too much water.
Professor M.Whiteley, a consultant vascular surgeon at The Whiteley Clinic London, is one of the leading experts in the condition, known medically as hyperhidrosis. Hundreds of patients visit him each year suffering so badly they are considering surgery to remove their armpit sweat glands. But in many cases, they are simply drinking way too much fluid.
‚ÄúIn fact, the first and most important thing I ask them is how much water they consume‚Äù, he told MailOnline. ‚ÄúLots of advertisers advertise water and say you have to drink two or three litres a day. That‚Äôs medically incorrect. If you go to intensive care you will be put on 1.5 litres of fluid per 24 hours‚Äù he explained.
‚Ä¢ So, How Much Water is Good For You?
‚ÄúIf a doctor came along and gave you 2 litres you‚Äôd get heart failure and they‚Äôd be sacked‚Äù Around half a litre of fluid is metabolised from food every day, and most people drink tea and coffee on top of that intake. However, Professor Whiteley says there are people who suffer from hyperhidrosis which is not linked to their average fluid intake per day, who will require treatment beyond cutting down on liquids.
‚ÄúIt is normal to sweat in heat when exercising, or in stressful situations‚Äù, he said. You can read more about hyperhidrosis here: MailOnline
Recently I read about this young American woman, who died of water intoxication! A woman who competed in a radio station‚Äôs contest to see how much water she could drink without going to the bathroom died of water intoxication.
Jennifer S. 28, from Sacramento California, was found dead in her home hours after taking part in the ‚ÄúHold Your Wee for a Wii‚Äù ‚Äì contest in which she could win a Wii video game system.
She said, that she was on her way home and her head was hurting her real bad, she was crying and that was the last that anyone had heard from her. It was not immediately known how much water she consumed.
A preliminary investigation found evidence ‚Äúconsistent with a water intoxication death‚Äù. Initially, contestants were handed bottles of water to drink every 15 minutes. They were small little half-pint bottles, so they thought it was going to be easy.
One participant said he quit after drinking five bottles. ‚ÄúMy bladder couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore‚Äù he added. After he quit, he said, the remaining contestants were given even bigger bottles to drink.‚ÄúI was talking to her and she was a nice lady,‚Äù another contestant said.‚ÄùShe was telling me about her family and her three kids and how she was doing it for kids, to win a Wii Video Game .‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Water is good, water is healthy, water is essential, no question‚Ä¶?
Stop listening to every new release of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô advice‚Äô ‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt torture yourself by pouring down that big amount of water, if your body does not demand it just because of all these wise bits of advice. Some people may need a few litres daily to feel fit, others might be okay with only half as much.

A few months ago I went for an EI Scan, that runs a current through your body and one of the results said that my cells were over hydrated. It certainly gave me food for thought. Too much water is not necessarily a good thing.
