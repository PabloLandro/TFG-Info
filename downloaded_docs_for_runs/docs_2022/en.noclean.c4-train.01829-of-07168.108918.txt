Dr. Deb's Recommended Tools
EMF's affect us all. Unfortunately. Wikipedia explains EMF's this way, "An electromagnetic field is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects. It affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field." EMF's are emitted from WiFI routers, cell phones, computers, microwave ovens, bluetooth devices, etc. Since using the Zyto scan to help people, I've seen EMF's show up as a stressor for most people. EMF's are stressing people's sleep and other areas of their lives like never before. There is much debate as to whether they are harmful to our health or not, but I prefer to be proactive and protect myself. Prevention never hurts and can only help our health.
There are several things I recommend to lower your EMF exposure:
Wear a Q-link protective device. Q-link is backed by research showing it provides protection. Q-link products are used by many professional athletes who testify that they help their concentration. I have worn a Q-link pendant for 10 years now. When I had my first Zyto scan, I was not wearing my Q-link. I scanned for EMF's. Since the initial scan, I scan myself weekly & each time have had my Q-link on. I'm never scanned again for EMF's. That has made me even more confident in my decision to use Q-link as part of my health regimen.
Turn off your wireless Internet at night. We have ours set to go off from midnight until 7 AM. You can program your service to do the same thing. Unfortunately your neighbor's WIFI is probably still a factor but at least there is some distance.
Don't hold your cellphone up to your head.
​When kids are using devices such as iPhones, iPads, etc., put it on airplane mode while they are using it if possible. Limit kids use of these devices.
​Place your cellphone on airplane mode at night (yes your alarm will still work on the phone in airplane mode) or better yet, place your cellphone in another room where you can still hear it should an emergency happen with your college kid. Place it at least 10 feet away from your head.
Get rid of the microwave. It alters the food in a way that is not healthy and exposes you to more EMF's. I've never owned a microwave oven!
