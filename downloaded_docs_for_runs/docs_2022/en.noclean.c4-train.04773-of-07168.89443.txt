Causes of Feeling Cold after Drinking Water
Not everyone experiences the feeling of getting cold from drinking water, but if you do, you’re not alone. There are a few different reasons why this could be happening:
1. Drinking cold water lowers your body temperature.
This is the most common and least concerning cause of feeling cold when you drink water. Cold water naturally lowers the temperature of your body when you drink it, even if you don’t drink a lot of it. This is important for helping you get back to the correct core temperature when you’ve been working out or doing manual labor, but it may not be ideal if you’re just sitting at your desk! For this reason, it’s recommended to drink tepid, or room temperature, water whenever possible to prevent this problem.
2. An over abundance of water in your diet can cause you to have colder hands and feet.
For some people, drinking too much water in a day can make your extremities colder. This is also a fairly normal and natural reaction to drinking cold water, but it can also mean you’re taking in far too much water in a day. Look for other signs of too much water, such as urine that is completely clear or having to urinate more than once an hour. If you notice this in conjunction with your cold hands and feet, you may want to cut back on your daily water.
3. Too much water can cause your metabolism and thyroid to function differently than they used to, leading to a lower core body temperature.
Over time, when you regularly keep up with drinking more water than you need in a day, you may notice your body’s temperature lowering and saying lower. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if it gets too low, it can be. This may also affect your thyroid and your metabolism and make it harder for you to lose weight, since it’s harder to raise your core temperature when you’re working out. If you find this may be happening to you, cut back on the amount of water you’re drinking every day, and drink room temperature water whenever possible—except after a workout.
4. Too much water can affect the way your body absorbs sodium.
If you drink a lot of water, you may not be absorbing as much sodium as you would otherwise. In some ways, this is a good thing; many of us get far too much sodium in our diets, and drinking plenty of water can help keep it flushed out. However, if you’re getting too cold after you have water, this may mean you’re not retaining enough sodium, and your body may be letting you know this. Again, look for clear urine and frequent urination to see if this may be the underlying cause of your problem.
Conclusion
As you can see, it’s not usually anything to worry about if you find yourself suffering from a drop in body temperature when you’ve had a lot of water. Of course, if it does bother you too much, you can always speak to your healthcare provider about it. Otherwise, try drinking room temperature water or cutting back on the amount of water you drink in a day first, to see if this helps solve the problem.
Otherwise, what can be done about this problem? There isn’t really anything else you can plan to do to solve this issue. There isn’t a medication that’s going to make you warm up when you drink cold water, and you don’t want your body to stop functioning the way it’s meant to, anyhow! For the most part, this issue is nothing bad, and you can probably just plan to put on a jacket until you warm up again when this happens to you.
Keep in mind that this could be a sign of other underlying issues if you have any other health concerns. For example, if you notice that your feet are getting cold when they otherwise shouldn’t be and you are also diabetic, this is something you need to talk to your healthcare provider about. Remember that everyone is different and that your experience could vary from that of others. If you have another health problem, always be up front with your doctor about any changes that go on with you physically.
By keeping an eye on your body and what it’s telling you, you can make a big difference in your health and wellbeing. And remember that if everything else is going fine with you physically, there’s no reason to stop drinking your water as you have been, even if it makes you feel a little cold for a while afterward!
