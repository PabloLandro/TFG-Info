#012: Why Pulsed Microwave Frequencies are More Harmful.
by magda
Updated: July 7, 2018
Why pulsed microwave frequencies are more harmful than continuous waves and why we should care. As I read the documents from Dr. Glaser’s archives, I can’t help but think that we are being “dummified”. It seems we know… Read More
