Ginger and Pain Receptors.
Within scientific circles, it has been documented that ginger helps mitigate the pain of arthritis by reducing inflammation. In this process, the active ingredients in ginger, compounds called gingerols, inhibit an enzyme that causes inflammation.
Furthermore, according to research by Professor Roufogalis at the University of Sydney, gingerols have been found to affect pain by blocking the pain pathways directly. The gingerols have a similar structure to capsaicin, the active ingredient of chili peppers, which is a known pain reliever. Gingerols, like capsaicin, act on specific receptors in the body called vanilloid receptors, or VR1, which sit on pain sensory nerve endings. However, unlike capsaicin, which dulls pain receptors only after initially causing pain, ginger can achieve the same effect but without the initial painful response.
Professor Roufogalis concludes that the gingerol structure may be used as a template for the development of new pain relieving drugs acting via the VR1 receptor for controlling pain. In addition to their direct affect on the VR1 receptors, gingerols prevent the aggregation of platelets thus helping to thin the blood, they reduce inflammation, and unlike aspirin, ginger has a calming effect on the intestinal tract.

Boosting Immunity with Ginger.
Called "the Great Medicine" by ancient Indian vaids, ginger has long been touted by herbalists for its cleansing effect on the body, removing toxins and restoring the body's balance.
"Ginger is loaded with virus-fighting substances, including several that act directly against cold viruses."

Promoting Digestion.
Historians say Confucius ate ginger with every meal. This legend has credence due to ginger's enzymatic properties which help break down food.
"Ginger increases digestive movement through the stomach and duodenum, and has also been shown to stimulate several valuable digestive enzymes in the pancreas. The enzymes in ginger bread down protein efficiently and rapidly, leaving the digestive system free of any discomfort.

Ginger and Nixing Nausea.
Of all ginger's effects, its anti-nausea property is probably the best known. From morning sickness to motion sickness, ginger has been used for thousands of years to quell the queasies. Studies have found ginger more effective than the anti-nausea drug Dramamine.

Found to Ease Nausea of Cancer Treatment.
A much anticipated study linking ginger to reducing nausea will be presented next week at the annual meeting for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, found that patients who consumed ground ginger had significantly reduced nausea following chemotherapy. The lead author of the study, Dr. Julie Ryan, added that other forms of real ginger would probably also work to achieve the same results.

In recent years, a great deal of medical research has documented ginger's therapeutic effects. Now, with its culinary popularity also on the rise, ginger can be found in a growing number of forms, many containing the potent compounds of this healthy spice.
Ginger and Morning Sickness.
"Ginger could relieve the nausea and vomiting experienced by pregnant women, say Australian researchers. Ginger does not prevent morning sickness but it may help ease some of the nausea experienced by pregnant women, researchers reported in the April 2004 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Researchers from the University of South Australia in Adelaide gave nearly 300 women either 350mg of ginger or 25mg of vitamin B6 three times per day for 3 weeks. The researchers found that both ginger and vitamin B6, which is sometimes taken to counteract morning sickness, worked equally well at alleviating nausea symptoms. Due to the small sample size, the researchers concluded that more research was needed to determine ginger's risks and benefits."
Put Some Spice In Your Medicine Cabinet.
"Vioxx is off the market and gas is over $2 a gallon, but the last real health deal is still out there and dirt cheap, too - in the spice aisle of the grocery store. The spices of the East - cayenne, turmeric, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon�. Ginger earns its age-old reputation as a stomach-settler and a purifier. It has cholesterol-lowering, artery-degunking antioxidants and anti-fungal, blood-clotting and even cancer fighting properties. You can't make Asian or Indian food without it. Or gingerbread! While the FDA doesn't regulate spices, it categorizes all the above as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) so ban the bland and take your medicine - it's delicious."

Ginger and Menstrual Cramps.
"I noticed you didn't mention on your site that ginger completely soothes menstrual cramps. A few months ago, I was out of Advil and too crampy to go to the pharmacy, which was closed anyway. I looked in my herbal dictionary and ginger was listed as being good for PMS pain. I just grate up about a teaspoonful (or less) and swallow it using water as a chaser. Within about 15-20 minutes cramps are gone, and stay gone for many hours. It works better than commercial pills since they seem to dull pain, where as ginger seems to knock it out. Apparently it relaxes the muscles or something. All I know is it works. " - Eva
