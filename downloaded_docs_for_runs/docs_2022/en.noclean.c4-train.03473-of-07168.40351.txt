WD-40 For Arthritis. … Sure. Why Not?
Filed Under: Stupid Health Tricks
If the big pill companies are years behind a perfect arthritis solution, -improvise in the meantime with Absolutely anything!
Sure, this light penetrating oil lubricates everything else; –why not stuck joints, you LifeHacker.com/LifeHack.org blockheads?!
While you’re at it, -How about Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil for those damn knuckles that won’t stop cracking?
This just in. Arthritis is not squeaky joints.
(Also reported on more than 1 site: WD40 kills bugs Dead, almost instantly; including cockroaches.)
*Please guys, as if it weren’t obvious; Ignore the father-in-law with the brain schrapnel from World War II.
—Don’t Ever put petroleum distillates, especially -penetrating oils!-, on or in your body unless you’re going to die otherwise and it’s your only way out.
Arthritis is also not the result of insufficient “elbow grease”.
–Usually: Rust Dissolver + Human Body = Bad; Arthritis is not a form of rust, either. -Mkay?!!
