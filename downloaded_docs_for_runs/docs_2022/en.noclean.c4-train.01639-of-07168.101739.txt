You probably drink ginger in your juices, eat it in your soups and stir-fry, and sip it in your tea. But looking beyond the root's zingy flavor, the health benefits of ginger are pretty impressive, too.
For thousands of years, people have used ginger to treat a laundry list of ailments—from colds and nausea to arthritis, migraines, and hypertension. Much of the evidence of ginger's effectiveness is simply rooted in medical advice and herbal remedies passed down from generations. But in recent years, researchers have taken an interest in ginger and all the health benefits it may bring. As it turns out, while some of the traditional benefits have little scientific proof to back them up (like the whole cold remedy thing), others hold up in today's world. If you really look into the health benefits of ginger, you'll find that you can actually use the herb to naturally treat a handful of problems.
Here are seven things ginger can do for your health.
1. Relieve muscle pain
Ginger contains a compound called gingerol that has been shown to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. One study published in The Journal of Pain found that eating a little ginger daily helps keep inflammation low and can help ease muscle pain from an exercise-induced injury. A similar study found that ginger taken after exercise may help prevent muscle pain from progressing in the days following a workout.
2. Relieve period cramps
Studies have suggested that ginger is just as effective as ibuprofen (yes, way) in relieving pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea (aka, heavy, painful periods). A recent analysis of all the relevant research concluded that women with dysmenorrhea might find some relief when taking ginger the first three days of their cycle, but that more research needs to be done. Either way, if you suffer from painful periods, it's worth adding ginger to your diet to see if it helps. (Anything's worth a try when it comes to cramps, let's be real.)
3. Reduce arthritic joint pain
Ginger may also be effective in reducing joint pain in those with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, though the research is still a bit mixed.
4. Relieve morning sickness
When it comes to morning sickness, what works for one woman doesn't necessarily work for another, but research does show that ginger can help improve symptoms for some pregnant women.
5. Treat motion sickness
As SELF has previously reported, there's no real explanation for why some people experience motion sickness and others don't. When it comes to treating it, doctors suggest popping a ginger chew or sipping on ginger tea or ginger ale—it helps for some people, and it won't make you drowsy like OTC medications like Dramamine. How ginger works to relieve motion sickness is unclear, but research suggests the reason it helps may be that it has an effect on serotonin receptors in the brain, and also acts directly on the GI system and central nervous system.
6. Ease any type of nausea
Besides pregnancy nausea and motion sickness, ginger can be used to treat just plain old nausea of which you may (hangover?) or may not know the cause. According to the Mayo Clinic, there's also evidence that ginger, when taken with regular anti-nausea meds, may help better relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea. No one's 100 percent sure why it works, but some evidence suggests that ginger helps break up and expel gas in our intestines.
7. Protect against cancer
Ginger has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds that may fight free radicals (intruders that cause damage on a cellular level), and therefore, prevent tumor formation. Research suggests that ginger extract may help prevent colorectal cancer specifically in those with an increased risk, thanks to its impact on the gut.
