It’s not just Bad Food, that may Damage Health. WiFi under Scrutiny.

Hamburg stops WiFi in schools from the 29th November 2014
From the editors of Flensburg Tageblatt:
At six schools in Hamburg the digital age should find their way hampered. City and school board now back the argument: The wireless network WLAN was too dangerous for the health of students.
Learning with Tablet: It will not happen in Hamburg so soon. Too big are the concerns about the health of students.
HAMBURG | The Authority announced by the school after the summer holidays measures to equip the students of three Hamburg district schools and three high schools each with tablet and notebook, are for the time being on ice. Reason is that the wireless Internet access terminals to be enabled by the wireless network WLAN. Both potential health consequences are unclear, and legal frameworks are also unclear.
“Six schools had replaced boards, textbooks, notebooks and pencils with Laptop and Tablet in class,” it said in May in a statement presented by Senator school Ties Rabe. During the two-year project up to 1,300 students, which is about 30 percent of children and adolescents participate in these schools. Now the school board backtracked. “We are currently investigating whether there are data protection or other legal problems,” admitted a spokesman Peter Albrecht.
High waves had the project mainly beaten because of the non-party MPs citizenship Walter Scheuerl with two kids trying to torpedo the project through requests in the citizenry and various reports. They believed the project would transmit data over the wireless local radio networks by means of radiating and receiving extremely high microwave frequencies.
In fact, some doctors criticized recently, the introduction of tablets, smartphones, and wireless media as teaching in schools as “an uncritical acceptance of progress hype”. In an open letter which from about 20 doctors of the “Doctors Working Group Digital Media in Stuttgart”, complained that that the comments made in science and medicine concerning the use of digital media in schools were not being met. “The correlation of the increase of overwork, headaches, ADHD and mental illness with the growing use of digital media is worrying,” said Ulmer psychiatrist and brain researcher Prof. Manfred Spitzer. According to the state of science whose harmfulness was clear that stress could also lead to impaired concentration, in addition to sperm damage to DNA strand breaks and thus cancer.
Manufacturers, as well as the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, were already warning of a body-hugging use of equipment and require minimum distances.
Neither school board nor health authority of the Hanseatic city would respond to such warnings.
Dirk Petersen, environmental expert at Consumer Hamburg , said “There is in our view no reliable information, that it is harmful.” The radiation was simply too small, said some experts. But Ellen Kruse, a spokeswoman for the AG electrosmog the BUND Hamburg, however, criticized this stance: “There are a lot of neutral studies showing that Wi-Fi is very harmful.” She called independent experts who educate in schools look at especially, the combined use of up to 30 students with equipment compounding the situation. The safety of these classes is questionable.
The World Health Organization warned that mobile phones could possibly be carcinogenic. “We are taking the precautionary principle,” she said. However, the Bund was not hostile to progress and encouraged wired internet access in schools.
