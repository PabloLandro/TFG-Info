Skin Tags Removal
Skin tags are small, harmless growths that hang off the skin and look similar to warts. They are typically flesh-coloured or brown, and vary in size from a couple of millimetres up to 5cm wide. Anyone can develop skin tags at any stage in their life, but they’re most common in older people and those with diabetes; pregnant women may also develop them due to hormonal changes. Skin tags can commonly be found on the neck, in the armpits, under the breasts, in the groin area, on the eyelids, or on the bottom, among other places.
Most of the time they are harmless and don’t cause any pain or discomfort. However, depending on where they are located you may find that they rub or snag on your clothing causing some amount of discomfort. In addition to this, skin tags can sometimes be unsightly and can cause the person to feel self-conscious or embarrassed by their presence.
Skin tag or wart?
Skin tags and warts can often be mistaken for one another, and whilst neither is typically painful or cancerous, warts are contagious and can spread easily so it’s best to have them removed by a specialist. There are a few ways that you can tell if you’re dealing with a skin tag or a wart:
Skin tags tend to be smooth and soft, whilst warts are typically rougher with an irregular surface
Warts usually lay flat on the skin, whilst skin tags are knobbly and hang off the skin
Warts are contagious and tend to develop in sudden outbreaks and clusters, whilst skin tags are not contagious and tend to be isolated in their appearance
Skin tags and wart removal
Here at The Canterbury Skin and Laser Clinic our team of dermatology specialists are able to remove skin tags and warts via methods including snip cautery, cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen) and/ or laser treatment. For removal of up to 5 skin tags, the price with the nurse is £150 and with the Consultant is from £350. For liquid nitrogen treatment of up to 5 warty lesions, the price is £150 – £200 with the nurse and from £350 with the Consultant. Skin tag or wart removal is perfectly safe and effective, leaving little to no lasting marks of their existence.
If you’d like to find out more about our skin tag or wart removal options please get in touch and we’ll be happy to answer your questions and book you in for a consultation with one of our skin specialists.
Dermatologists are expert specialists, not only of the skin, but also of allergic conditions such as contact dermatitis, hair problems such as alopecia (hair loss), nail problems such as fungal nail conditions etc.
If you have concerns about any of these areas, please call to make an appointment to see one of our specialists, as we are the only clinic in East Kent with consultant dermatologists heading the team.
