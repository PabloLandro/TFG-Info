Lower Cholesterol – Include rich sources of omega 3 fatty acids in your diet everyday.
Posted by Lisa Nelson, RD, LN on January 27, 2009
The list of benefits associated with omega 3 fatty acids continues to grow. By increasing your intake of omega 3 fatty acids you’ll decrease triglycerides, reduce blood pressure, increase HDL cholesterol, reduce arterial wall inflammation, and the list goes on.
Here are a few steps you can take to increase your omega 3 intake:
1. Eat fish at least twice a week.
2. Add ground flaxseed to foods.
3. Take a fish oil or flaxseed oil supplement. (Discuss all supplements with your MD.)
4. Snack on nuts and seeds rich in omega 3’s, such as walnuts.
All the best,
Lisa Nelson RD
