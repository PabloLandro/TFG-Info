​Cell Phone Facts
Almost everyone has a cell phone nowadays. Most of us can’t imagine living without them. We have to remember that it was only in 2007 that Apple released their first iPhone.
Smartphones are a large part of our lives
While smartphones have made our lives easier in many ways, there are also some side effects. In this blog post, I’m going to answer the old and feared question "do cell phones cause cancer"? Before I do that, let's learn more about cell phones.
The History Of Cell Phones
Many of the early cell phones were car phones. These phones were too bulky and heavy to carry around in a pocket or purse. In 1983, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x arrived on the market. It was the first real mobile phone because it was small enough to carry.
The phone ​weighed 2.2 pounds(1.1kg). You got 30 minutes of talk-time with the device, and it took around 10 hours to charge it.
The world’s first mobile phone call happened on April 3, 1973. Martin Cooper, a senior engineer at Motorola, called his rival and said he was speaking via a mobile phone.

​In the beginning cell phones weren’t designed with consumers in mind. Back then, only wealthy businessmen could afford them. Early cell phones were just for talking. Later on, phone manufacturers began to integrate more technologies into their phones.
The Apple iPhone ​transformed ​the cell phone.​ It went from a verbal communication tool to a multimedia device. We now use our phones for surfing the web, checking emails, and taking photos.
So how do cell phones communicate with each other?
How Cell Phones Work
The cell phone is in its basic form a two-way radio. It consists of both a radio transmitter and ​receiver. When you talk to your friend the phone converts your voice into an electrical signal.
It then transmits the signal via radio waves to the nearest cell tower. The mast receives the signals and passes them on to its base station. From the base station, the calls continue to their destination. Your friend's phone then takes the electrical signal and converts it back to sound again.
Cell phones send radio signals to cell towers
The radio signal from cell phones cannot travel that far. All a cell phone has to do is communicate with its local mast and base station. The base station picks up faint signals and routes them to their destination.
If we didn't have masts, our cell phones had to use large antennas and power supplies. Cell phones use different radio waves so that they don't interfere with each other. But this is not enough if you share frequencies with millions of people.

The solution is to divide the city up into smaller areas, with each one served by its masts and base stations. We call these areas cells. Cells enable the system to handle more calls at once.
The more cells, the greater the number of calls you can make. Therefore urban areas have more cells than rural regions.
So what are the health risks of mobile phones?
Radiation Emitted From Cell Phones
​Since we started using cell phones, scientists have worried about their potential cancer risk. Mobile phones emit radiofrequency energy.
Radiation is a combination of electrical and magnetic energy that travels through space at the speed of light. Another name for it is electromagnetic radiation (EMR).
Cell phones use both long and short wavelength radio waves
There are two broad groups of radiation. Ionizing radiation (IR) is capable of causing changes in atoms or molecules in the body. It can result in tissue damage such as cancer. Examples include x-rays and gamma rays.
Non-ionising radiation (NIR) doesn't cause the same changes as IR. But they can make molecules vibrate and raise the temperature. Examples include:
Ultraviolet radiation
Light bulbs
Microwave energy
Visible light
Infrared radiation
Radiofrequency energy
Cell phones use both safe long-wavelength radio waves and dangerous short-waves. The emitted frequency is between 450-2100MHz, depending on your device or carrier's network.
Although we define these waves as microwaves, they're not as strong as microwave ovens. Microwave ovens produce about 1000 watts of cooking power. Mobile phones use fractions of a watt at most.

The Federal Communication Commission and other organizations regulate the radiation emitted by phones. They measure a cell phone's radiation broadcasting capabilities with the SAR system.
So what exactly is SAR?
What Is SAR?
SAR stands The Specific Absorption Rate. It measures the rate of radio waves that the body absorbs. We measure SAR in units of power per mass (W/kg). Mobile manufacturers conduct SAR testings in worst case scenarios.
Measurements take place at various distances between the phone and the head. This testing simulates the way each user holds their phones. The largest of these measurements define the SAR value of the tested device.
SAR measures the rate of radio waves that the body absorbs during a call
In the United States, phones should have a SAR value below or at 1.6 W/Kg, on a mass of 1 gram of tissue. In Europe, the limit is at 2 W/kg, but in a sample of 10 grams of tissue.
There are several ways to find your device's SAR value. The simplest one is to check your phone's manual. If they don't mention the SAR value in the manual, you can find it on this website. All you need to do is type your model on the upper right corner.
On some cell phones you can get a device's SAR with the following USSD code:
*#07#
So let's look at the cancer risk of cell phone use.
Do Cell Phones Cause Cancer?
Constant exposure to radiation from cell phones may cause health issues. It’s unclear if they create more cancer. Most of the studies show little risk. We lack data for mobile phone use over time periods longer than 15 years.
There is not enough evidence that non-ionizing radiation may increase our cancer risk. The only recognized biological effect of radiofrequency radiation in humans is heating.
There is not enough evidence that non-ionizing radiation may increase our cancer risk
A cohort study in Denmark looked at the brain cancer risk in more than 358 000 cell phone subscribers. The analyses found no association between cell phone use and cancer.
If you don’t use cell phones, your lifetime risk of developing a brain tumor is about 1 in 167. But if you use cell phones, your risk goes up to 1 in 128. That’s still less than a 1% chance you’re ever going to get a brain tumor.
Nobody can make a clear statement on whether long-term cell phone usage is safe or not. Therefore is better to be safe than sorry and reduce our exposure to cell phone radiation.
The biggest risk when it comes to cell phones is the new 5G technology. It is so serious that I have to dedicate a whole section to it.
The Dangers Of 5G
5G is short for “fifth generation.” It is the upcoming mobile technology that will replace 4G. 5G will expand the range of microwave radiation used by consumer devices.
The next generation of mobile technology promises speeds of up to 100 times faster than 4G. It will use higher-end gigahertz range frequencies never deployed before. These frequencies travel much shorter distances than current 3G and 4G technologies.
5G waves cannot penetrate buildings that well. This limitation means that you have to build more antennas closer to each other. The plan is to place cell towers in lamp posts in the cities so that everyone can have 5G.
Adoption of 5G will mean more high-frequency signals in the air
Experts say that we will need to install one new base station for every 12 homes. It requires an estimated one million new base stations per carrier.
Adoption of 5G will mean more high-frequency signals in the air. More transmitters will stay located closer to people’s homes and workplaces. Even if you don’t use a cell phone, you won't be able to escape its effects.
5G technology gives off the same dose of radiation as airport scanners. The effects of this radiation have not yet undergone rigorous long-term testing.
Over 230 scientists from more than 40 countries expressed concerns about the increase of EMF exposure.
Too much EMF may cause serious health risks. During the Cold War, Russians used microwaves as stealth weapons. They beamed the American embassy and gave everybody cancer. If all our devices will use 5G think about all the radiation, we have to deal with.
But that is not the worst part yet.The real reason why our governments want to build 5G is a lot darker and sinister.
How Governments Want To Use 5G To Surveillance Us
Proponents of the 5G network claim that it’s all about improving energy efficiency and making our lives easier. But the truth is that it’s about surveillance. Some say that 5G is also about depopulation, as it is an absolute health nightmare.
Many technologies and policies today use the term "smart." A "Smart Object" is something that interacts with people and other smart objects. All smart things are there to form a global technological grid called the Smart Grid.
The Smart Grid will not happen overnight. It will roll out as technology progresses. One step in this process is to get us addicted to smart devices.
5G will connect our electric devices to the Internet and surveillance us under the Smart grid
The rollout of 5G is another experiment in the weaponization of the Internet. Cell phones and 100 billion wireless devices will be part of the Internet of Things. Soon all our home appliances, cameras, and self-driving cars will be part of this grid.
Smart TVs produced by Samsung can listen to our conversations. Facebook, Google, and Twitter know everything about our lives.
No matter what, do not get a smart meter. Smart Meters use dangerous pulsing microwave radiation technology.
5G will connect them to a digital network which can keep you under surveillance in your own home. It will allow governments to shut off your power if they decide you are using too much of it.
Surveilling us is not the only problem with 5G. Another reason for its use is to control the human mind.
5G And The AI Control Grid
David Icke is a conspiracy expert. He has for years warned about the use of radio technology to control humans with Artificial intelligence. The 5G revolution is all connected with this, too.
The plan is to connect the human mind to the smart grid through microchips in the brain. This Smart Grid will operate at the same frequency band as the human brain and DNA activity.
Human brain activity operates in the low frequency or ELF range between 6 and 8 Hertz. All biological systems connect and run in the 7.83 Hz frequency. Another name for it is the Schumann resonance.
The Smart grid will connect the human mind to AI
DNA communicates through low-frequency electromagnetic waves at 7.83 Hz. Human alpha brain waves also broadcast in this frequency.
Discover how 5G ties to Agenda 21 and total human control. Click to read more.
This band creates states of relaxation, creativity, and meditation. Fear, stress, and anxiety block alpha waves and disconnect us from everything else. Bombardment of our energetic environment with ionizing radiation will destroy this frequency.
The idea is to create ​an enormous electromagnetic prison. This field would then control our mind, emotions, body, and DNA. We would know only what AI tells us we are and nothing more.
From that moment humans will be nothing more than computer terminals. Our minds will respond to the wireless control grid. We are talking about a technological prison cell for every man, woman, and child on earth.
Refuse to use 5G phones and devices and discourage those you know from doing so. We all need to boycott 5G if we want to protect our health and freedom.

8 Steps You Can Use To Avoid Cell Phone Radiation
1. Distance yourself from your phone
2. Avoid using your cell phone when the signal is weak
3. Don't carry your cell phone on your body at all times
4. Don't sleep with your cell phone powered on
5. Use your landline for most conversations
6. Reduce you talking time
7. Prefer non-wireless connections in your home
8. Refuse 5G technology
Action Steps
In this blog post, I tried to answer the question "do cell phones cause cancer"? While there isn't much evidence that cell phones cause cancer it is still better to be on the safe side. Here are 8 things you can do to protect yourself from cell phone radiation.
1. Distance yourself from your phone
Put your cell phone away from your body when you’re not using it. While talking on your cell phone, position the cell phone away from your body as far as possible.
Use the speakerphone mode or wired headphones. Your phone emits most radiation when it rings. Avoid staying too close to it when you make or receive a call. Don’t use Bluetooth when you make calls and replace it with a wired handsfree.
2. Avoid using your cell phone when the signal is weak
Phones use more radiation when the signal is weak, and they attempt to connect to the nearest tower. Avoid using your phone when moving at high speed, such as in cars or trains.
3. Don't carry your cell phone on your body at all times
Keep your distance. Do not keep your cell phone next to your body or in your bra. Cell phones emit radiation continuously, even when you are not actively using them
4. Do not sleep with your cell phone powered on
Don't sleep with your while it sends signals. Set the phone to flight mode or turn it off at night to stop EMF emissions.
5. Use your landline for most conversations
Forward your cell phone to landlines whenever you are at home. Use a corded home landline, not a wireless one. Cordless telephones use electromagnetic microwave technology just like cell phones.
6. Reduce you talking time
Whenever possible, minimize talk time and choose to text instead of making a voice call.
7. Prefer non-wireless connections in your home
Use wires instead of wireless signals when you hook up your devices. Choose an Ethernet cable when you connect your computer to the Internet. Attach your printer, speakers, mouse, and entertainment gear with wires.
Switch off WiFi at bedtime or all together. Log into your router's settings to do this.
8. Refuse 5G technology
Don't buy anything ‘smart’ like ‘smart’ appliances, ‘smart’ heaters, or smart meters. These put high levels of 5G radiation right in your home.
