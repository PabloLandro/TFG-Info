Details of Morphine Side Effects
Morphine helps many patients heal from surgery and physical injuries. It is an effective painkiller when properly used. But abusing this potent drug leads to many morphine side effects. One of the worst side effects of overuse is addiction, a path leading to a downward spiral of other problems.
Why Morphine Is Dangerous
Morphine use can be fatal through overdose. Taking too much of the painkiller or mixing it with other drugs leads to this deadly problem. Overdose can happen the first time you ever abuse morphine or after addiction has already taken over. Whenever it happens, overdose is often fatal.
Addiction is another danger of morphine use. This physical and psychological dependence can happen to anyone who uses the drug outside of the doctor’s advice. But you are more likely to become addicted to morphine when you have a history of using drugs or alcohol, suffer from a mental illness, use more than prescribed or turn to the painkiller recreationally.
There are morphine side effects that you can experience in the short-term or as part of long-term drug abuse. One of the most dangerous of these side effects is breathing problems. While morphine alone can affect respiration, mixing the drug with alcohol or other substances can make breathing even more difficult.
Short-Term Morphine Side Effects
Using morphine can be an intense experience. You may use the drug for its relaxing effects, to help with chronic pain or because you like the euphoric high it gives you. Whether you inject, snort, smoke or take morphine in tablet form, this drug can damage your body in many ways.
Short-term morphine side effects include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Itching
Loss of appetite
Constricted pupils
Constipation
Infrequent urination
Slowed breathing
Irregular heartbeat
Chest pain
Bluing of skin, lips, and nails
Dizziness
Agitation
Confusion
Seizures
Overdose
Overdose brings its own set of side effects. These include vomiting, extreme breathing problems, slow heartbeat, heart attack, seizures and loss of consciousness. Overdose can be fatal if it is not medically treated right away. If it does not lead to death, coma may result.
Long-Term Morphine Side Effects
Long-term use of morphine leads to one major side effect, that of addiction. It also causes damage to your life, job and relationships.
Long-term morphine side effects include:
Lost interest in most aspects of daily life
Many health problems
Financial problems
Drug-seeking behaviors
Stealing and other crimes
Uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms when not using
Development of serious infections and illnesses
Trying to end addiction to morphine is almost impossible without help. If you do not take the drug as you usually do, your body will go into withdrawal. Withdrawal brings its own set of ill effects, making quitting extremely difficult. But with the help of a quality addiction rehab, you can stop using morphine and end your addiction without the worst withdrawal side effects.
