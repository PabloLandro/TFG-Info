Fish and Cholesterol
Will Eating Fish Lower Your Cholesterol?
If you enjoy fish, as I do, then the fish and cholesterol lowering connection will interest you.
Yes, the oils found in fish will help improve your cholesterol readings. However, this is a bit of a misnomer.
Rather than lowering your total cholesterol, eating fish is more likely to balance out your cholesterol by lowering triglyceride levels. Many studies have been conducted which have shown the effectiveness of fish oil for bringing down triglycerides.
Fish and Dieting
I believe that everyone, whether or not they have high cholesterol should incorporate fish into their diet. Fish contains high levels of the nutrients that help us feel better and support mental health, both of which are very important when dieting.
The South Beach Diet is a great diet because of its emphasis on fish. It includes many wonderful recipes for fish that make it easy to stick with.
A Broad Based Approach
It is important to realize however, that fish or fish oil supplements are not a cure all for high cholesterol.
Because of the many benefits of fish oil, everyone can improve their health by taking fish oil supplements.

If you are serious about lowering your cholesterol, you will need to take a broader approach. An approach that includes increasing fiber consumption, decreased saturated fat consumption, and a more active lifestyle are necessary for bringing down those cholesterol levels.
Increasing your consumption of fish or taking fish oil supplements is only step number one and is by far the easiest step.
The most effective thing you can do to lower your cholesterol is to increase your consumption of fiber. Visit our page on superfoods to learn more about what fruits and vegetables can do for lowering your cholesterol.
You will find that the combination of fish oil and increased fiber intake will help bring those cholesterol readings in line.
Remember, the connection between fish and cholesterol lowering is misunderstood by most people. However, this type of broad based approach has been proven over and over again.
