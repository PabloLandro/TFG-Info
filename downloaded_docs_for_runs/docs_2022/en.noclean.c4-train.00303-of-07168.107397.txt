If you have seen people with lamps that look like pink salt in their homes or bedroom, thatâ€™s exactly what they are â€“ salt lamps.
Himalayan salt lamps are not just fashionable decor pieces. They have been known to provide many health benefits, including helping to reduce allergies, calming and soothing the body and cleansing the room of allergens.
Want to learn more? Take a look at what Himalayan salt lamps might be able to do for you.
How Himalayan Salt Lamps Work
Himalayan salt lamps work for two reasons â€“ the salt they contain and the heat thatâ€™s generated by the light bulb fixated inside of the lamp.
The actual salt helps to absorb different allergens and particles that may be floating around in the air, which is why so many people with allergies love them for helping to purify their bedroom and the rest of their house.
Once the salt absorbs the particles and water from the air, it needs to return water vapor back into the environment in your home, which is exactly what happens when you switch your lamp on.
The heat activates the ions found in the salt, which helps to release negative ions into the air and help keep your lungs clear.
The Best Locations for Salt Lamps
Where should you place your Himalayan salt lamp within your home? The great thing is you can experience health benefits in just about any room of your home you want to use one in.
However, because the pink salt can absorb so much moisture, itâ€™s recommended that you do not use them in damp environments, such as bathrooms and basements. Keep salt lamps only in the drier areas of your home where you spend the most time like your bedroom, living room and office. That way you can reap the most and best benefits.
You can, of course, keep them anywhere in your home you like. And having more than one of these beautiful babies in your home is highly recommended if you want to receive the most healing benefits.
The Many Benefits for You
There are quite a few potential health benefits of using a Himalayan salt lamp in your house. First of all, they can help to cleanse the air in your home. This is often the reason most people will get these types of lamps.
You can use them to remove harmful toxins and other allergens from the air. This can help to keep your lungs clear, help to prevent respiratory illnesses like the common cold and uncomfortable reduce allergy symptoms.
Another benefit of cleansing the air is that it can naturally deodorize it, helping it to smell a little better inside your bedroom or other room. Himalayan salt lamps have also been known to help balance out moods for some people.
Using a Himalayan Salt Lamp in your environment can help boost your mood, give you natural energy during the day and help relieve stress and anxiety. Similarly, this can also be helpful for many people suffering from insomnia.

My salt lamp relaxes me so much. Iâ€™m awake aloof through the nights and I keep this on in the night. Itâ€™s bright enough that you can see where youâ€™re going but also weirdly dim. I think itâ€™s the colour. It makes the brightness less harsh. Itâ€™s so nice.
