Joram Dymisster December 02, 2017 Health News, Nutritional Supplements, Wellness
We all have been there. The stomach pang stars out lightly, slowly and silently; then your stomach feels like its swirling inside a cement mixer then comes the up and down sensation like you are riding on a very steep roller coaster. But the point is we want to stop the nausea right at the beginning. We don’t want to feel like we are just on the verge of vomiting 24 hours a day. The thought of food totally turns our stomachs. When these signs occur we know we are having some serious nausea.
What is Nausea
Oh boy! Now we are going to define nausea? Let’s give a working definition so we know what we’re dealing with. Nausea is a sick feeling in the upper stomach which is called “as nausea” or “qualm”. Nausea is the feeling of having to vomit quite forcibly but it doesn’t always accompany the feeling of vomiting. You can force a vomit and dry out all the acid in the stomach to relieve nausea. Or you can take natural remedies to be rid of nausea. If the feeling of vomiting is prolonged it will cause an electrolyte imbalance which leads to dehydration. The common symptoms of nausea are:
A strong pukish sensation and uneasiness
Weakness
Stomach Pain
Fret
Anxiety
Wooziness
Dizziness
Dry Heaves
Possible Causes:
Migraine
Stomach Infection
Motion Sickness
Food Poisoning
Depression, Revulsion and Worry
Drug Abuse
Chronic Fatigue
Excessive use of Alcohol
Appendicitis
Too Much Caffeine
Chemotherapy
Diabetes
Head Injury
Pregnancy
Gerd
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Kidney Stones
Menstruation
Ulcers
Sun Stroke
Stress
Vertigo
Certain Medications
Fear of Heights
Now, we know what the symptoms and causes of nausea are let’s find out how to cure it through different treatments.
Ginger
Ginger is an age old remedy to curing nausea. It can either be added to tae or chewed directly from a piece of ginger. Ginger is the classic cure for nausea and it can help with so many ailments. You can take ginger in so many forms to help you with an upset stomach. It can be taken in gingersnaps, ginger tea, and gingerbread. If you are traveling instead of taking travel sickness pills or patches take crystallized ginger or ginger sticks. Don’t take ginger ales unless they have real ginger content. Usually today’s ginger ales are made without curative ginger. Warning: Children under two years of age should not be given Ginger.
Acupuncture
In theory, if you apply pressure at certain points on your body this will relieve nausea. For instance, apply pressure to your wrist with your thumb. You can either apply the pressure yourself or use a nausea band for this purpose. It’s speculated that activating the trigger points release neurotransmitters like endorphins and serotonin. Which will blocks chemicals that make the person feel sick.
Lemons are You Sure
You would think that lemons would surely make you vomit if you had nausea because of all the tartness and acid they contain. It would seem like lemons would make your stomach more bitter than it already was. But lemons really do help with nausea. Squeeze a lemon and extract all the lemon juice out of it. Mix the lemon juice with some water and drink it periodically; it will help alleviate the nausea it will also remove the urge to vomit. Smelling the sliced lemon after a while will help you feel better.
Peppermint you have to be Kidding
Come on peppermint isn’t that what made you sick in the first place because you ate too much peppermint candy? Now, it’s being said that peppermint will cure nausea? It’s reported that if you suck on a piece of peppermint candy or drink peppermint tea that you will cure nausea fast!( This had to be researched as to why peppermint cures nausea.) Peppermint is a plant found in all of the 48 states of the United States. The peppermint candy may relieve the nausea because of menthol and other compounds. These chemicals have antispasmodic effects that can help relieve indigestion and peppermint oil is a muscle relaxant. This ability of peppermint oil may help relieve cramping associated with nausea and other gastrointestinal issues. University of Adelaide, in Australia, found that a mechanism in peppermint may relieve gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel syndrome.
Ahhh a Cold Compress
If you soak a washcloth in cold water or freeze an ice pack for hours then apply it to the patient. The posture of the patient will determine where the cold compress is to be placed. If the person is sitting up then place the cold compress on the back of the neck. If the person is lying down then put it below the neck. This will relieve nausea. A cold compress is a natural treatment to relieve nausea.
Exercise
Exercise helps Nausea?It has been noted that exercise causes nausea but it heals it? There are certain exercises that you may do to relieve nausea. Lay your head down flat and bend your knees (without a pillow). Make sure you are breathing properly. If you choose to sit against a wall then bend your knees and put your head between them making sure you breath properly.
Back exercises
Will help nausea as well. Lay down a mat and lie down straight without bending any part of your body. Lift your upper body and allow your back to arch. Now, stretch as you incline your head as far back as you can. Make sure the area beneath your chin is facing the ceiling.
Neck exercises
What in the world does neck exercises have to do with curing nausea? Well, supposedly neck exercises do help cure nausea. They are easier to perform then back exercises. Here’s how:
You can do this while sitting or standing. Bend your head so that the neck touches the chest; keeping this position for 10-15 seconds but make sure you are breathing properly. Next, follow this with tilting your head to the left (don’t roll your head to the left but tilt it left. Like you are touching your shoulder with your ear.) Then repeat the movement to the right. It’s critical you don’t roll your neck for this will increase the dizziness and nausea. So, exercising can reverse nausea.
Milk Toast
When you think of drinking milk for nausea you think it would make the nausea worse not better. But contrary to this notion milk with toast can stop the nausea. Warm up one cup of milk and break pieces of toast into it. Add unsalted butter to the mix. Eat it slowly don’t consume it quickly. The dry texture of the bread absorbs acid in the stomach and the milk and toast combination settles the tummy down. Warning: It should not be eaten by those suffering from the stomach flu or gastroenteritis.
Chamomile Tea
The tea keeps coming back! People do develop nausea due to psychological reasons as well. (too much stress, worry and anxiety can all help cause nausea.) It has been found that chamomile tea is a natural cure for nausea. It carries some tranquilizing effects that can cure anxiety and stress. This tea will also stop the cramps and contractions in the stomach caused by repeated vomiting.
