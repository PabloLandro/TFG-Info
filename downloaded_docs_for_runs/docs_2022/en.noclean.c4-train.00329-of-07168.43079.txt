Papers finding adverse biological effects or damage from Wi-Fi Frequencies
WiFi (also known as or WLAN) is a wireless network involving at least one WiFi antenna connected to the internet and a series of computers, laptops and/or other wireless devices communicating wirelessly with the Wi-Fi antenna. In this way, each such wireless communication device can communicate wirelessly with the internet. The signal is generated using pulsed microwave radio frequencies which are damaging to our health.
Wi-Fi systems at home and work expose whole bodies and environments to continuous radiofrequency radiation as they are typically in the on mode day and night. Safety guidelines are based on short term exposure of 30 minutes. There is increasing concern among scientists about the cumulative effects of long term exposure as they are finding broad effects on living organisms. Effects are seen in the immune system, the nervous system and the reproductive system.
Wi-Fi radio frequencies used are typically in the range of 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz. All modems will feature 2.4ghz but most newer systems now feature both 2.4ghz AND 5.0ghz – that is two layers of microwave radiation. These frequencies penetrate living organisms and target cell structures causing alterations in calcium movement across membranes. These seemingly small calcium shifts result in changes in electrochemical gradients and cell function. These can cause dysregulation of the cells which can ultimately affect the whole organism.
Wireless or Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Radiation (RF EMR) affects biological systems. Some biological effects of RF EMR appear to be mediated by an increase in free radicals, mediated by calcium channel membrane alterations. Studies show that WiFi radiation causes oxidative stress, sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG changes, apoptosis (cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and calcium overload.
In the past decade there has been a massive increase in Wifi use and is now installed in most homes, businesses, shops, cafes, pubs, hotels, airports, even schools, hospitals, GP and dentist surgeries, despite warnings that wireless radiation is damaging to health.
Wireless signals are becoming stronger as communications companies provide booster systems to give faster speeds and more coverage using wireless microwave radiation, so that wifi can be used in all parts of your home and garden, business etc.
Wi-Fi is an Important Threat to Human Health – Professor Martin L Pall
Martin Pall, PhD (2018) has written a review of 23 controlled scientific studies on non-thermal Wi-Ft radiation and health related effects in animals, human cells and in humans. He documents sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric abnormalities with EEG changes, endocrine changes, oxidative stress, cellular DNA, ptosis (cell death) and calcium overload. He notes that pulsed waves, which are typically used in wireless devices are much more damaging to cellular structures and effects are non-linear meaning there is not a typical dose response curve. Dr Pall also highlights research showing these effects can be cumulative and irreversible. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118300355?via%3Dihub

2015 International Scientists Appeal to U.N. to Protect Humans and Wildlife from Electromagnetic Fields and Wireless Technology
In May 2015, a group of over 200 scientists from 39 nations who have authored more than 2,000 articles on this topic appealed to the United Nations to address “the emerging public health crisis” related to cell phones and other wireless devices. These scientists state that “the ICNIRP guidelines do not cover long-term exposure and low-intensity effects, and are “insufficient to protect public health.”
Many people do not realise that there is a safer and healthier way to access the internet in your home, workplace or school. Most broadband connections come into your home using a phone line or fibre optic cable – you can eliminate or reduce the need for wifi by connecting your computer, laptop, device to the internet using an ethernet cable (usually supplied with modem). Not only is this better for your family’s health, but a wired connection is more secure and faster than a wireless connection.
Popular devices emitting wifi and wireless radiation in your home:
Internet Routers
Laptops & PCs (wifi can be disabled)
Mobile & Smart Phones
Cordless (dect) phones
Tablets
Smart televisions
Smart watches, gadgets & devices
Virtual assistants
Bluetooth
Some gaming devices
Some home energy monitoring systems and some alarm systems
Smart meters, smart lights, wireless door bells, smart appliances etc
You should also be aware that many new appliances are being manufactured with wireless chips (for the Internet of Things) whether you want them or not. So your new television is likely to have wifi capability. If you do not want that, you will need to access the settings and disable wifi.
To reduce radiation from wifi in your home and work you can do the following:
Simply use a wired ethernet connection (usually comes with modem or available in computer shops or Argos) and disable wifi option on your router/modem and PC/laptop. In some cases, you may need to contact your service provider to ask them to turn off the wifi facility if your router/modem does not have a on/off button.
Disable wifi and bluetooth on your smart phone . Better to keep your smart phone on airplane mode until you need to use it.
Do not go with an internet provider who supply a landline telephone service using VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). This enables phone calls to be made through the internet, but it means you can not use the phone if the internet is turned off. If there are problems with your internet or power cuts, you will not be able to use your landline.
If you must use Wifi, we suggest:
If system uses 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz, then turn off one of these. Two signals are not needed;
Turn off wifi at the router/modem when not in use;
Turn off wifi at night time to reduce your family’s exposure.
Wifi In Schools
In a school setting, and in particular if tablets are in use, then many wifi routers are needed with extremely strong signals transmitting pulsed radiation throughout classrooms. Children are most vulnerable to the damaging effects as their bodies and skulls are smaller and they absorb more radiation than an adult.
Public warnings and calls for a ban on WiFi in schools have been made by scientists and doctors and some countries have taken steps to implement precautionary measures by removing or reducing Wifi in schools. No such precautionary measures are being taken in Irish schools as the Government and Department of Education refuse to heed these warnings and are encouraging and supporting full implementation of Wifi in schools.
Speak to your children’s school about wifi if they have it. Ask them to switch to safer wired connections. SEE MORE HERE – WIFI IN SCHOOLS
Wireless Broadband and WiMax
WiMax is described as “Wifi on Steroids”, and has the power of a wireless router for a whole town or city. WiMAX uses centrally placed masts (like mobile phone towers) to transmit high-speed internet across towns and the countryside. In order to transmit over a really large area of land, the WiMAX towers are allowed to operate at power levels way above those of WiFi transmitters.
Ireland is adhering to outdated ICNIRP safety guidelines created in the 1990s, before WiFi was widely adopted. They do not reflect the current collective power, scope and uptake of wireless technology by 5 billion users. There is no monitoring and measuring the radiation levels of wifi or RF radiation in your home, school, etc.
