Mosquito-Borne Illnesses Directory
Besides itchy, red bumps, mosquitoes may leave more than just their bite. They spread illnesses like the West Nile virus, malaria, and the Zika virus. Symptoms range from mild, flu-like symptoms to life-threatening fevers. Mosquito-borne illnesses have links to birth defects like encephalitis and microcephaly. Common protections are repellents and nets. Another protective method against mosquitoes is eliminating standing water, a common breeding ground. Treatments include vaccines, viral medicines, and more. Follow the links below to find WebMD's comprehensive coverage about mosquito-borne illnesses, treatments, how they spread, and much more.
