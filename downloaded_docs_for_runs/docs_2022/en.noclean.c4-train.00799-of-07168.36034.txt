Marijuana is addictive.
by: Debbie Wicker
Dear Joshua,
Contrary to popular belief, marijuana can be addictive for some people and if you're smoking everyday you may be one of the people who becomes addicted to it.
Marijuana is a drug that effects your brain every time you smoke it, and because our brains are so adaptive your brain has adapted to having Marijuana everyday. The craving for weed happens any time you don't smoke so you smoke it again, kind of like a nicotine addiction with cigarettes.
In order to quit, you're like going to have to change your social life fairly significantly because likely most everyone you hang out with smokes weed a lot too.
Here is an excerpt from the page from the Quit Weed product that we recommend on this site:
"Are You Physically Addicted To Weed?"
"A regular marijuana smoker will experience many physical symptoms when they quit.
Thing is, most smokers believe weed has no physical effects at all
This is another reason why so many have trouble quitting…
Sure, the ‘marijuana habit’ is mostly psychological
However, contrary to the common belief, modern scientific findings are now showing us that marijuana actually can create physical withdrawals in your body, that smoking weed relieves
This is creating your vicious cycle
You might even notice these physical symptoms when you stop smoking
Do you?
Have you noticed the common things like:
- Not being able to sleep easily without weed
- Problems with eating regularly / hunger pains
- Feeling ‘sluggish’ or having a lack of energy
- Even a physical feeling of ‘something missing’
- Feeling unfulfilled, or even flat-out depressed…
By removing toxins in your body, you can eliminate cravings and even physical withdrawals
This way of quitting is easier than trying to fight your own thoughts, feelings and desires created in psychological addiction. Smokers now have a real method to follow in order to quit weed…
What Is The Best Way To Quit?
The proven method to quit weed is to deal with your body & mind
Re-establish the way you actually think about weed – and give your body a marijuana detox
This isn’t a long process and is great for your health
It is also the most successful method to quit smoking pot
Once you think about marijuana differently, and detox denies your body of any cravings or withdrawals, you will find yourself turning down weed offered to you, much more naturally
A good feeling… Imagine this:
YOU having a clear mind and increased energy. Total focus, motivation, clarity. Better health. Deeper relationships, more money, and a new ability to turn down weed easily, and finally get ahead in life…
No matter how difficult it is right now…
When you have control, you can smoke weed less and on your own terms – or not at all…
With this new ability, even people that smoke marijuana daily for years, can quit permanently
Or just cut back to once a month… Remember, you will be in control of your addiction for once, and you will have the power to make that decision, and you will keep this power forever."

Okay so the comment before mine stating how you can physically become addicted to cannabis is bull.
True your body can build up somewhat of a dependency for it, but it's more of a mental addiction depending on past trauma or just general bad habits.
I smoked the stuff from the age of 14 to 19. Started out as just having a bit of fun with my mates to smoking every single day, to then smoking away my issues and emotional problems. although I never actually felt like my body was telling me I had to smoke it, it just felt easier to do so.
I've now stopped smoking and started dealing with my problems head on, emotion is coming back and my heads clearer than ever. bottom line is weed isn't physically addictive to all them god praising dumbos and them people that were to ignorant to do their own research... morons seriously. there is nothing wrong with smoking a ton of bud as long as you are not smoking it for the wrong reasons. it's all but a state of mind thing. peace out.
