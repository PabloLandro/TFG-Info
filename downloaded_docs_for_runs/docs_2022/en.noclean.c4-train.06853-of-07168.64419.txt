If you’re not sure how you should cope with your hemorrhoids, keep reading. Many hemorrhoid sufferers do not how to treat them when they form. That is why a little research goes a long way when treating them.
If you’re looking to a long-term solution to your hemorrhoids, try adding more fiber to your diet. Nutrients that are high in fiber can include leafy vegetables, oatmeal or breads made with whole grains. The fiber will soften your stools, decreasing the strain that causes hemorrhoids.
You can lessen the chance that you will develop external hemorrhoids by paying some extra attention to your hygiene routines for that area of your body. Try using a wet wipe after every bowel movement and choose a clean soft tissue for regular wiping.
Too much straining during bowel movements can cause hemorrhoids. Making a diet change to one with more water and fewer processed foods will make it easier to pass stools. Squatting, instead of sitting, during a bowel movement also reduces the amount of straining required to defecate. Buy a small stool or use a wood box for your feet while sitting on the toilet. Hemorrhoids are less common in countries where people squat instead of sitting.
To ease your concerns regarding hemorrhoids, make sure you understand what they are. Learn more about hemorrhoids if you suffer from them or have a loved one that does. Basically, a hemorrhoid is a bundle of swollen and sensitive nerves.
Many hemorrhoids are caused by overexerting sphincter muscles, causing chronic irritation. For this reason, you should take care not to strain excessively during bowel movements, and you should also take steps to strengthen and tone your muscles overall for better health and strength.
If you think you might be constipated, try taking a walk prior to going to the restroom. This can prepare your body for your next bowel movement. This will help you not to have to strain as you have a movement, reducing your risk of hemorrhoids or the condition getting worse. Walk for 10 to 15 minutes, as briskly as you are able.
Water is a surprising and soothing treatment for hemorrhoids. Sit in lukewarm water for up to ten minutes per day, then apply a cool compress to the area. Toilet baths, which can be bought in most drug stores, can be helpful.
Try adding more high fiber foods to your diet. Fiber will assist in keeping your stools soft. If your stools are soft, you will not need to strain when going to the bathroom, and will therefore spare yourself significant pain. Fiber supplements and fruits can soften your stool.
Always make sure you’re drinking enough water. If your body needs more water, it absorbs water from stools. Your stool will harden and cause you to be constipated. Make sure that you consume the daily recommended amount of 32oz of water per day, and then dehydration will not occur.
Now that you obtained some basic knowledge on treating hemorrhoids, you will be able to develop your own plan for success and alleviate your hemorrhoids at home. Look for additional resources and try different methods until you find one that works well for you.
