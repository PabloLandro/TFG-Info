Cholesterol and Vascular Disease Part 5: Non-Statin Cholesterol Medications
September is National Cholesterol Education Month. In support of this important educational initiative we are republishing our six part series on cholesterol and the role it plays in cardiovascular disease.
Note: Seventy-one million American adults have high cholesterol, but it is estimated that only one-third of them have the condition under control.
Previously, in Part 4 of this blog series on cholesterol we spoke about the statins. This week we will look at other cholesterol medications. Another very effective method for decreasing LDL is by combining a statin with other drugs.
Medications
One of the most effective add-on medications is Ezetimibe. This medicine works by blocking cholesterol absorption in our small intestine. It’s not just the cholesterol we eat that is blocked; more importantly it’s the enormous amount of cholesterol that is recycled daily between our liver and intestine. At this point, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a reduction in heart attack and stroke by using Ezetimibe. Still, many lipid specialists (me included) believe that future trials will demonstrate its importance in particular patient populations.
Another important class of cholesterol-lowering drug is called the bile acid sequestrants. Welchol is the most commonly utilized of these medications. By blocking the reabsorption of bile acids in our intestine our liver is forced to produce more bile acids from their precursor, cholesterol. Interestingly, WelChol also has the added benefit of lowering blood sugar and increasing HDL. Patients with very high triglycerides should be careful of this medication because it can increase triglycerides further. Like Ezetimibe, WelChol is best used in combination with a statin.
Niacin, vitamin B3, is also often used in cholesterol management. It’s best known for its impact on raising HDL and lowering triglycerides. Niacin also has an effect on LDL however. It increases LDL particle size, and by so doing, can actually decrease LDL particle number. Niaspan is the pharmaceutical version of niacin that is most commonly utilized by the physicians. It’s method of action is poorly understood and quite complex. Like WelChol and Ezetimibe, niacin is also best used in conjunction with a statin.
Fenofibrates represent yet another class of medications that is used for cholesterol management. Their dominant effect is to lower triglycerides and raising HDL. At this point clinical trials have not found them to be effective in decreasing cardiovascular events, but they are improving lipids and lipoproteins.
The active ingredients in fish oil, DHA and EPA, can also have an effect on lipids and lipoproteins. They can lower triglycerides, increase HDL, and sometimes increase particle size and by so doing decrease particle number. In patients with very high triglycerides, fish oils can at times increase LDL cholesterol. Their method of action is also quite complex and beyond the scope of this blog.
Diet and Exercise
In managing cholesterol abnormalities we should never neglect the value of diet and exercise. A healthful diet will unquestionably improve your lipid and lipoprotein profile. Even when taking a statin, a healthful diet must be maintained. In fact, there is a specific dietary program called the Portfolio Diet that is geared specifically to lower cholesterol. Exercise can also benefit your lipid and lipoprotein profile. Daily exercise for 30-60 min. can significantly decrease your LDL particle number, increase your HDL, and lower your triglycerides. The bottom line, if you’re physically capable, exercise every day.
A few other cholesterol management strategies are either in the pipeline, or utilized only in very high risk patients. They will be the subject of our next blog post, Part 6 in this series, Cholesterol and Vascular Disease.
