Hi Jelila! I had a session with you about a year ago in Bali and my life has changed so much since then! Thank you again for the experience! Nicole
It’s one week since my session and I have never felt peace like I do now. No scattered thoughts, no upset. I feel blessed with new ideas and a general feeling of peace and calm and the possibilities of the new. Susan
Thank-you so much for helping us both! Can’t believe the difference we both see and are aware of – it’s amazing! We really are ourselves now. Love and Best Wishes, Wendy
Hey Jelila, some months ago, my boyfriend and I had the reprogramming sessions with you. We are both still very very grateful. The session really changed our (love)life in a great positive way. We are pretty sure, that there was a reason, to travel to Bali and to Ubud. And that reason was, to meet you ;o) Thank-you so much! Love&Light, Fabi

Crystal healing – Published in Bali Advertiser and Holistic Bali
Jelila provides my first healing session, and arrives at the door, blonde and fairylike bearing a guitar and a big bag of crystals. She talks about the resonant vibration of crystals due to their highly organized molecular structure, and adds that “Just as having a positive person around you raises your vibrations – it’s the same with the right combination of crystals.”
Jelila has a background in yoga, meditation and energy healing and you can join her classes at Yoga barn. She also practices crystal healing which she describes as “A complex art form, based on an intuitive sense of your present energy, aura and life,” and adds “It is non invasive and harmless, the worse thing that can happen is nothing.”
We start with an aura reading, and each of my chakras is assigned colours, shapes and sounds. My rational mind does not understand, but her observations are unerringly accurate, and deep from my subconscious, she unearths an extremely irrational fear. Right she says we are going to fix this. She guides me through a visualization, or re programming as she calls it, and then explains that she will use a combination of crystal energy and sound healing to integrate this transformation.
I close my eyes as she drapes strings of crystals over me, and soon become aware of a powerful tingly sensation around my head, it feels like my hair is standing on end. I assume Jelila is doing some kind of energy healing but when I open my eyes I see she is busy placing crystals around my feet. The feeling is so intense I can’t help laughing – “What’s happening to my head,” I ask, “That would be the detoxifying crystals I put on your pillow,” she answers. By now Jelila is softly playing the guitar and singing, her beautiful voice flutters around me. It’s extraordinarily soothing to be sung too and lulls me into a warm and cosy state. Afterwards I feel happy, serene and kind of floaty. More than anything I feel completely liberated from an irrational fear that had been holding me back. No doubt I could have sat in an office with a psychiatrist and progressed to this point after weeks on the sofa talking about my childhood – but therapy is much more enjoyable when you are covered in crystals and sung to! Jelila also designs healing necklaces and has recorded a range of CDs.

Posted on August 18, 2013 by Jelila
Want to find a Spiritual Teacher?
Spiritual Teacher? Are you a Yoga Teacher, Spiritual Teacher, or Healer? Or do you want to be? How do You Blossom? Have you Found Your Spiritual Mojo? Do you have deeper questions?
Are you needing access to deeper information that helps you to help others?
Advanced programmes provide wisdom and knowledge and a framework for helping others. These picks are for you:
.
The Yoga Chord – 1.2m of rainbow Crystals, 20 different kinds – harmonises you as you wear it or relax with it on your body. The programmed Crystals allow you to do Crystal Healing with no prior experience…
Before bec oming a Spiritual Teacher, I was a Yoga Teacher. Having practised yoga for 8 years, I became a teacher of Kundalini Yoga when I moved to Ubud, Bali, in 1997. Later, the owner of Bali Buddha, a local wholefood restaurant, asked me to do a crystal healing for him – I became a Healer overnight, as I discovered my natural talent for Crystal Healing – though later I learned Crystal Healing the hard way – practise!
My natural talent for Crystal Healing grew, and I was initiated as an Advanced Light Language practitioner – a very advanced form of healing using colour light and sacred geometric shapes. I learned Crystal Healing through doing it – practise! – though it was also a process of remembering what I seemed to already innately know. I used quartz crystals, rose quartz, amethyst, and a range of pebble crystals that I loved, placing them on and around my client’s body to move the energy, release negativity, and create transformation. Later, I developed my own crystal healing tools – starting with The Yoga Chord – a rainbow of crystals on a metre-long strand, which I programmed to do healing. I loved crystals so much, that I ended up developing my own method, and my own range of crystal healing necklaces – tools to make the process simpler, more fun, convenient, easier. My book, Power of Crystals book, below describes my simple method of Crystal Healing, I hope it makes it easier for you to understand the basic functions of healing with crystals, and get started with Crystal Healing straight away!

The Power of Crystals Book – Jelila’s way with Crystals – easy to understand and use for Personal Wellbeing or for Healing Others.

SPIRITUAL WARRIOR?
Posted on August 18, 2013 by Jelila
You’re a Spiritual Warrior!
Menu .Store .Contact Reviews Packages
Spiritual Warrior? Would you like to reveal your Exquisite Nature through access to More Advanced techniques, tools, programmes and processes? That bring more transformation in a shorter time – and at a deeper level – bringing the rapid change with the results you are looking for? Here are some suggestions for you!
Reveal your Exquisite Nature as you gently release the old negativity you no longer need, becoming ‘Lighter’
The Reprogramming: Talking briefly about your issues – being gently guided to discover your exact hidden blocks – and then using a simple yet powerful process to release them quickly and simply – to reveal your Exquisite Nature!
That’s The Reprogramming! The change is permanent – it’s a form of artificially induced experiential life learning – during the process you will discover for yourself the meaning of what you blocked and release all the stuff around it – instantly feeling better! – getting powerful results!
The deepest quickest most powerful way of releasing, you are a conscious partner in your own transformation in this kind of session. ‘Like doing years of therapy in just a few hours!’ ‘Amazing Healer’ ‘Wonderful!’ ‘2 Hour Life Changer’ ‘Worth $10,000’.
Deeper Intuitive Session.
Energetic Enhancements: this deeper kind of Intuitive session, where you are laying down relaxing with Energy Healing, allows you to access a series of deep negative beliefs – and release them – freeing you. ‘The Big Clear Out’. Energetic Enhancements lets you release stuff you have been holding on to, so you immediately feel better. Includes Crystal Healing, Sound Healing and Energy Work. ‘Helped me make enormous changes in a short time’. ‘Astonishingly good!’ ‘Loved your singing!’
Power & Confidence CD Journey – Are you ready to go deeper? – into a meditation state deeper than perhaps you’ve ever experienced? Would you like to listen to this magical dolphin meditation song-story that helps you release old negativity and fears, activating your power and confidence? As Jelila’s ‘angelic, soothing voice’, lulls you into a deep sense of peace – If you can stay present for long enough, and don’t fall asleep, you’ll hear the story of Atlantis as you’re guided there, to meet the dolphins – and remember your ancient Atlantean/Lemurian initation. Would you like to re-activate capabilities that you’ve become scared to use? Feel less fearful? Feel more powerful and in control, as you listen to this ‘deeply peaceful music’? Power & Confidence CD Journey
Jelila says: I grew up as a Spiritual Warrior, maybe like you – wondering – why is the world like this, and how can we change it? I battled to understand and eventually made great breakthroughs, like The Reprogramming™, The Gift of Harmony™ and Alien Wedding™. It is my hope that these Advanced spiritual processes help you make great breakthroughs – and blossom your hearts desires…
.
Detox Negativity CD Journey – Would you like to have a CD that simply and quickly releases your negative feelings – anytime you feel bad? Would you like to listen to Jelila’s simple uplifing song, and feel elevated and better every time? Useful, relieving music – releases any bad feelings – listen anytime you feel ‘bad’ to detox and release negative feelings and immediately feel better. ‘I felt better straight away, as soon as I listened!’ Detox Negativity CD Journey
Communication Necklace – Do you sometimes feel you can’t express yourself? How would it feel to share your creativity more without fearing criticism? Do you feel your inner child is ‘hurt’? Do you lack nurturing and find it hard to get what you need in relationships?
Simply wearing your Communication Crystal Healing Necklace ‘brings comfort and relieves negativity’ to your Inner Child – it works at a deep level, bolstering your confidence and helping you feel good.
Crystals include: Blue Lapis Lazuli – the vibration of truth, Turquoise – the ‘purifier’, Rose Quartz to sooth you and smooth your communications – would you like to counteract your loneliness? and Pearl which has a ‘miraculous quality’ and brings you ‘divine wisdom’ – resolving and bringing solutions that would never enter your head!
Did you know it is guaranteed for 10 years against breakage? Return for free replacement any time.

The Gift of Harmony Transformation Course – a ‘few amazing days’ that permanently transform the ‘bullying ego’ within you from being a domineering maniac, into a benevolent provider and enable positive new mental thought patterns, helping relationships.
Did you want to get rid of your negative thoughts – at the root? Would you like to ‘get off the work treadmill? Achieve work-life balance? As you balance your ‘Inner Masculine’ – the working part of you – it transforms from ‘domineering maniac’ to ‘benevolent provider’ – transforming your life. Would you like more emotional balance? More success in relationships? Would you like to learn how to create ‘Successful Relationship Transactions’ leading to ‘Successful Relationship Moments’? You’ll learn it in the course, helping create a happy successful love relationship with your partner in a way that is ‘so helpful, yet easy to do’.
How about your uncertainty? Would you like to feel more clear? Would you like to understand and know your purpose in life? As the ‘dissenting’ part of you is won over and comes back on board, you wonder ‘why didn’t I ever do this before?’
Would you like to release your inability to say ‘no’ to your family and friends? Feel more empowered and balanced in your family? Feel more safe? Feel more comfortable? This course shows you how. ‘Radical, incredibly transforming, and brilliant’ – you’ll get new deep inner programs – positive ones!

The Gift of Harmony Book – buy ‘the spiritual book I wish I’d had to read 20 years ago’! It’s about four key characters that you have inside of you, and how they are meant to work together. ‘Understand what’s really going on inside of you, and why you feel so much inner conflict – in this great book!’
Unfortunately the 4 parts of you usually don’t work together at all, and so you spend 80% or more of your time and energy fighting amongst these four parts within yourself! Which is why you feel stress, inner conflict, procrastinate, and have trouble getting things done!
After you’ve read the book, the next step is, The Gift of Harmony Transformation Course – which actually does bring these four parts of you together! Read the book and see how the 4 characters are at work in you! And then do the Course – it’s your ‘powerful step to the next level’…!

Did you want to get rid of your negative thoughts – at the root? Would you like to ‘get off the work treadmill? Achieve work-life balance? As you balance your ‘Inner Masculine’ – the working part of you – it transforms from ‘domineering maniac’ to ‘benevolent provider’ – transforming your life. Would you like more emotional balance? More success in relationships? Would you like to learn how to create ‘Successful Relationship Transactions’ leading to ‘Successful Relationship Moments’? You’ll learn it in the course, helping create happy succcessful love relationship with your partner in a way that is ‘so helpful and yet easy to do’.
How about your uncertainty? Would you like to feel more clear? Would you like to understand and know your purpose in life? As the ‘dissenting’ part of you is won over and comes back on board, you wonder ‘why didn’t I ever do this before?’
Would you like to release your inability to say ‘no’ to your family and friends? Feel more empowered and balanced in your family? This course shows you how. ‘Radical, incredibly transforming, and brilliant’ – you’ll get new deep inner programs. Did you know The Gift of Harmony Transformation Course uses Jelila’s powerful modality ‘The Reprogramming’ to quickly deliver a brand new mindset – that stays?
