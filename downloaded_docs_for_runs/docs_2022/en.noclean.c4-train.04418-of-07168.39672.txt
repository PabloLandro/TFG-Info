Morphine Addiction Treatment
There are many dangerous and addictive drugs in the world. Some of them are illegal, while others require a doctor’s prescription. Morphine is one of these drugs. Because of its addictive nature, morphine addiction treatment is extremely important.
What Is Morphine?
This drug is a potent opiate pain reliever. Doctors use morphine to help treat mild to severe pain. They typically administer the drug in medical offices or hospital settings.
While morphine is extremely effective at relieving pain, it also has a high potential for abuse. Taking the drug only a few times can lead to an intense physical dependence. Although getting it requires a prescription, some people buy it illegally.
What Are the Risks of Taking Morphine?
Several risks come with taking morphine. The biggest one is the chance of developing an addiction. People who take morphine on a regular basis are very likely to build a tolerance to it. The higher that their tolerance is, the more morphine that they have to take to feel the effects.
Morphine also comes with numerous side effects. Some of the most common include:
Dizziness
Sleepiness
Constipation
Loss of appetite
However, these side effects don’t represent all of the risks. Taking large doses of morphine can cause many other problems too. Some of these include memory loss, confusion, shallow breathing and anxiety.
Morphine Addiction Treatment Options
There are a lot of morphine addiction treatment programs available to people. The key is that they find the one that addresses their main areas of concern. In general, however, they benefit from multiple treatment steps when it comes to morphine.
People who go straight into outpatient rehab are more likely to relapse than those who start with residential rehab. Morphine is extremely addictive, and outpatient care provides a lot of freedom. Without the tools to control their disorder, they’re more likely to relapse.
However, outpatient rehab is still a key step in treating addiction. Instead of starting with an outpatient program, people should start with inpatient care. Once they learn to control the disorder, they can move on to outpatient treatment.
Therapy also plays a big role in morphine addiction treatment. Both individual and group therapy are good programs. These types of therapy help people get to the root cause of their addiction quickly.
Substance Abuse Stems From Underlying Conditions
We strongly believe in the Syndrome Model of Addiction. This model focuses on the belief that addiction stems from underlying causes and conditions. Studies show that certain behaviors can shift the brain’s emotional state and ability to function.
Using the model, rehab centers can focus on treating multiple areas of addiction. The three main areas are loss of control, cravings and addiction-related consequences. Treating these three areas helps people avoid relapse after rehab.
