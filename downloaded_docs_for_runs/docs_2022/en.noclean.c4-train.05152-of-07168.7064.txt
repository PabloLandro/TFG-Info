After Crown and Bridge Appointments
Dental crowns and dental bridges usually take two or three appointments to complete. In the first visit, the teeth are prepared and impressions of the teeth are taken. Temporary crowns or bridges are placed to protect the teeth and maintain space while the custom restoration is being made. Since the teeth will be anesthetized, the tongue, lips and roof of the mouth may be numb. Please refrain from eating and drinking hot beverages until the numbness has completely worn off.
Occasionally a temporary crown may come off. Call us at Carney Family Dentistry Phone Number 601-992-3351 if this happens and bring the temporary crown with you so we can re-cement it. It is very important for the temporary to stay in place, as it will prevent other teeth from moving and compromising the fit of your final restoration.
To keep your temporaries in place, avoid eating sticky foods (gum), hard foods, and if possible, chew on the opposite side of your mouth. It is important to brush normally, but floss carefully and don’t pull up on the floss which may dislodge the temporary. Pull the floss out from the side of the temporary crown.
It is normal to experience some temperature and pressure sensitivity after each appointment. The sensitivity should subside within a few weeks after the placement of the final restoration. Mild pain medications may also be used as directed by our office.
If your bite feels uneven, if you have persistent pain, or if you have any other questions or concerns, please call our office at Carney Family Dentistry Phone Number 601-992-3351.
After Tooth Extraction
After tooth extraction, it’s important for a blood clot to form to stop the bleeding and begin the healing process.That’s why we ask you to bite on a gauze pad for 30-45 minutes after the appointment. If the bleeding or oozing still persists, place another gauze pad and bite firmly for another 30 minutes. You may have to do this several times. If the bleeding continues, you can bite firmly for 30 minutes on a Lipton tea bag which will help induce clotting.
After the blood clot forms, it is important not to disturb or dislodge the clot as it aids healing. Do not rinse vigorously, suck on straws, smoke, or drink alcohol for 72 hours. These activities will dislodge or dissolve the clot and delay the healing process. Gentle brushing can be done on the teeth next to the extraction site. Limit vigorous exercise for the next 24 hours as this will increase blood pressure and may cause more bleeding from the extraction site.
After the tooth is extracted you may feel some pain and experience some swelling. An ice pack or an unopened bag of frozen peas or corn can be applied to the area and will help keep swelling to a minimum. The swelling usually subsides after 48-72 hours.
Use the pain medication as directed. Call the office at Carney Family Dentistry Phone Number 601-992-3351 if the medication doesn’t seem to be working. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to take them for the indicated length of time, even if signs and symptoms of infection are gone. Drink lots of fluid and eat nutritious soft food on the day of the extraction. You can eat normally as soon as you are comfortable.
It is important to resume your normal dental routine after 24 hours. This should include brushing and flossing your teeth at least once a day. This will speed healing and help keep your mouth fresh and clean.
After a few days you will feel fine and can resume your normal activities. If you have heavy bleeding, severe pain, continued swelling for 2-3 days, or a reaction to the medication, call our office immediately at Carney Family Dentistry Phone Number 601-992-3351.
After Dental Fillings
When an anesthetic has been used, your lips and tongue may be numb for several hours after the appointment. Avoid any chewing and hot beverages until the numbness has completely worn off. It is very easy to bite or burn your tongue or lip while you are numb.
It is normal to experience some hot, cold & pressure sensitivity after your dental filling appointment. Injection sites may also be sore. Ibuprofen (Motrin), Tylenol or aspirin (one to two tablets every 6-8 hours as needed for pain) work well to alleviate the tenderness. If pressure sensitivity persists beyond a few days or if the sensitivity to hot or cold increases, contact our office at Carney Family Dentistry Phone Number 601-992-3351.
You may chew with your dental fillings as soon as the anesthetic completely wears off.
If your bite feels uneven, if you have persistent pain, or if you have any other questions or concerns, please call our office at Carney Family Dentistry Phone Number 601-992-3351.
