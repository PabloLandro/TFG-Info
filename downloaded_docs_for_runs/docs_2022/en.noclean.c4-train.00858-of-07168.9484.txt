Drinking Carrot Juice for Skin That Glows and Eyes That Shine
There are many benefits in drinking carrot juice regularly. This page will explain how you can use carrot juice to improve both your skin and eye health.
Vitamin A Skin Benefits
While a good basic moisturizer is important, it’s the nutrition you provide internally, through your diet, that make the biggest difference to your skin tone.
Even a mild vitamin A deficiency can cause dry, rough skin, blemishes and poor wound healing. Low vitamin A intake has also been associated with many skin problems, including acne, rashes, eczema and psoriasis.
Vitamin A is involved in tissue growth throughout the body and helps promote healthy skin renewal. Carrots are rich in both pro-vitamin A beta-carotene and alpha-carotene and are an excellent vegetarian source of this important nutrient.
Try drinking carrot juice every second day for a couple of weeks and you’ll likely see a real improvement in your skin’s tone and texture. Many people on health forums describe their skin as glowing once they start making carrot juice regularly.
Antioxidant Skin Protection
UV light and environmental pollutants can damage your skin and break down collagen, leading to wrinkles and other signs of skin aging. The beta-carotene, alpha-carotene and other carotenoids and antioxidants you receive when you drink carrot juice are an valuable line of defense for your skin against this free radical damage.
People with low antioxidant intake in their diet put their skin at real risk of irreversible oxidative damage. You don’t have to drink just carrot juice, other orange colored vegetables and leafy greens are also good sources, but the freshly extracted juice of carrots is one of the best ways to flood your body with antioxidants.
Carrot Juice, Collagen and Vitamin C
While carrots aren’t as high in vitamin C as some energy foods, a glass of carrot juice provides vitamin C in a highly absorbable form. Along with being a powerful antioxidant, vitamin C assists in the creation of collagen to help prevent wrinkles and maintain healthy skin tone.
There’s little point in putting bovine collagen in face creams on the outside of your skin, when you can create your own collagen far more effectively by simply getting enough of the right health nutrients like vitamin C.
Adding fruits high in vitamin C like kiwifruit or lemon juice when you make your carrot juice can also greatly enhance its potential to protect and improve your skin.
Cleanses the Liver
An overworked, unhealthy liver is forced to try and get rid of excessive toxins any way it can. One of these ways is through the skin, which can be the cause of a lot of skin problems. By providing good nutrition to your liver, you can ease the elimination burden on your skin.
If you have skin problems, getting your liver healthy is one of the first places to start. Cut down on junk foods that tax the liver so much and give it a chance to do its job. Most importantly, provide it with the nutrients to get healthy again.
If you drink it often, carrot juice can be an excellent liver cleanser and healer. Adding other vegetable juices like beetroot and celery can enhance its cleansing effects even more and give the liver a chance to recover and work efficiently again.
An overworked liver is also associated with eye problems. The liver is responsible for converting retinol into retinaldehyde, the form of vitamin A used for healthy vision in the retina.
Difficulty seeing in low light is a well known early warning sign of low vitamin A intake. But preventing night blindness is just the start of what drinking carrot juice can do for your eyes.
Drinking Carrot Juice for Healthy Eyes
Alongside all the potential vitamin A, carrot juice provides some very important antioxidants involved in keeping your eyes healthy.
Beta-carotene is probably the best known of the carotenoids and carrot juice obviously has this health nutrient in abundance. It also has high levels of alpha-carotene, which some researchers believe to be an even more powerful antioxidant that beta-carotene.
More important for the eyes are lutein and zeaxanthin. This is because they provide protection specifically for the macula – the central area of the retina involved with focus and fine detail. Whilst carrots don’t provide levels of lutein and zeaxanthin anywhere near say spinach or goji berries, these nutrients are once again a highly absorbable form and if you’re having carrot juice regularly you should be getting a good intake.
Eating just one carrot a day is recommended for reducing your risk of developing macular degeneration (the leading cause of blindness in America) by up to 40 percent. Imagine what regular carrot juice drinking can do for your eyes.
Even if you’re not concerned about potential eye problems later in life, drinking carrot juice regularly will likely make a big difference in the quality and clarity of your vision.
If your eyes are tired and sore, or you are just not seeing details and colors like you used to, regular carrot juice has the nutrients you need for healthy eyes and better vision.
Juicing Carrots
Obviously you need a good juicer to make carrot juice. If you don’t already have one, this high juice yield masticating juicer that I have gets about double the juice out of a couple of carrots than my old centrifugal one used to.
Cheap juicers are false economy. If you enjoy the eye and skin benefits of drinking carrot juice and other fresh juices, it pays to get a high quality juicer that will last.
Make up your carrot juice, or a combination of juiced fruits and vegetables like carrots, at least every second day for the most beneficial effects on your health and appearance. Many people say they both feel and look amazing when they sip a glass of carrot juice daily.
To get started here are four great tasting and detoxifying carrot juice recipes I like to make up regularly.
There’s one other important factor to be aware of when drinking carrot juice for better skin and healthy eyes though. It’s the type of carrots you’re juicing. Learn why these really should be organic carrots if you value your health here.

Be very careful when juicing “spinich” it’s very high in acid and can cause kidney-stones, best to avoid. or use in moderation, no problem when cooking it!
Happy juicing :)

Carrot juice works to fight cancer and it saved my dad’s life. I juice every other day and my website explained it all. I drink one full glass and I had him drink 3 full glasses daily when he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Good day. Im going to invest in a good juicer because i have to drink carrot juice for my skin and my dry eyes. I thought i would try the natural way for a change.i bought the v8 juice carrot and mango , it made me feel alittle better with my skin issues but i am still struggling with eczema.the dr. Gave me restates for dry eyes i thought i had an allergie but he said i still had an infection in my eyes. Some kind of bacteria.i used to have alot of tears but dont now. I dont understand that. Im 67 yeats old and was always healthy always healthy eating organic food. Why is the gov.making the farmers grow fake food? I saw strawberry’s last night at the vegie stand from florida in n.y. It said non gmo but they didnt look right to me so i didnt purchase them. Looking forward to reading the news letter. Thank you.Nancy Dawson
