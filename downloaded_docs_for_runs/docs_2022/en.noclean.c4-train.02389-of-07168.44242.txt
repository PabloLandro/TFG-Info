Fish Oil – Facts and Benefits
share on:FacebookTwitter Google + Tumblr
Fish oil seems to have become a big hit with the press in the past few years and has been dubbed as the superfood that can improve overall health and fight serious diseases by enhancing your immune system.
It is the best source of Omega 3 fatty acids, the type of fat that’s considered great for your health since it plays an important role in hormonal production in your body. Its hardly surprising that Omega 3 is one of the hottest supplements around, with research backing its use and effectiveness.
Omega 3 fats contain two particular types of fat:
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
Docosahexaenoic (DHA) which provide a variety of health benefits.
Here are some great facts about fish oil and how it can help improve your health:
#1 Fish Oil Improves Your Cholesterol
Both fish oil and oily fish are considered to be great for your cardiac health. As a matter of fact, its now recommended that you consume two to three servings of oily fish per week.
Omega 3 is known to be great for enhancing the good cholesterol or HDL cholesterol. Not just this, its also known to lower LDL cholesterol. What it means is that it can improve HDL to LDL cholesterol ratio. By improving your cholesterol levels, it can strengthen your heart condition and lower the risk of heart disease and strokes.
#2 Fish Oil Fights Inflammation
Studies indicate the inflammation plays an important role in some of the most serious conditions including heart disease, cancers, stroke, diabetes and even brain disease.
Chronic inflammation results from lifestyle related issues and it can be treated by changing your diet and having certain foods. One of the best examples of such foods is fish oil or oily fish. One of the main reasons that fish oil helps combat inflammation is that it tips the scale in favor of omega 3. Its important to keep in mind that an imbalance between omega 3 and omega 6 that favors omega 6 spurs inflammation.
#3 Fish Oil Reduces Blood Pressure
High blood pressure is another serious health problem that can lead to heart disease and other complications. Fish oil can help reduce plaque built up in your arteries. It can also help thin the blood which helps in improving blood flow and reducing high blood pressure.
According to a recent research, it was found that fish oil supplementation can reduce blood pressure on an average by 3-4mm Hg.
#4 Fish Oil Improves Brain Health
Yet another proven fact is that fish oil is just great for your brain health. Omega 3 consists of DHA that is known to be great benefit in brain development in children, brain health in adults and reducing cognitive decline or brain disease in the elderly.
#5 Fish Oil and Blood Sugar Levels
Controlling blood sugar levels is if great importance to ensure good health. Out of range blood sugar levels can result in fat gain, cell damage, diabetes and can even prove fatal. Fish oil is a great resource to help manage your blood sugar levels. Fish oil can help improve Insulin sensitivity, thereby controlling blood sugar levels. This is of great significance in people who suffer with diabetes and obesity.
#6 Fish Oil and Weight Loss
For quite some time people actually believed that eating more fat would make them fat. However, this is not true. Omega 3 fatty acids are a perfect example of this. They can actually help you lose weight bu increasing the production of fat burning hormones in your body. And fish oil is the best source of Omega 3 fatty acids.
#7 Fish Oil and Arthritis
Arthritis is a highly common bone disease. RA or Rheumatoid Arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects the auto-immune system caused by excessive inflammation.
As mentioned above, fish oil can be a great help in reducing inflammation. This is why fish oil can be a great help in reducing symptoms of pain in patients who suffer from RA.
Foods High In Omega 3
As mentioned above fish oil is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids. Oily fish happens to be the best dietary source. Apart from this, there are a couple of other foods that are a great source of such fats. These include:
Walnuts
