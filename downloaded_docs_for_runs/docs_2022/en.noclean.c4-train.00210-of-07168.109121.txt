Lose Weight And Cure Anything #2

In my last "lose weight and cure anything" (check it out if you haven't seen it) the ingredients were honey and cinnamon. This time the ingredient is baking soda.
LOSE WEIGHT: adding ¼ teaspoon of baking soda to 1 gallon of water raises the pH of the water to 7.0, drinking this flushes all toxins and acids, Total body weight in pounds, divided by one half, equals the amount of water needed daily in ounces, (example: 100 pounds divided by 2 = 50 ounces a day)
KIDNEY DISEASE: kidney disease is often caused by diabetes or hypertension, this results in your body having a hard time getting rid of acids. Orally taking baking soda helps reduce the rates and slow down the disease.
CANCER: baking soda helps reduce the pH of acidic tumors without upsetting the pH of the blood and healthy tissue, this helps remove or prevent any tumors.
HEARTBURN: stir half a teaspoon of baking soda into half a cup of water and drink an hour or two after meals.
DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS: adding one cup of baking soda to bathwater helps soothe itchiness and irritation. paste made of baking soda mixed with a little water and dabbed on sunburn, insect bites, allergic rashes, and skin exposed to poison oak/ivy reduces discomfort.
NATURAL DEODORANT: . Simply mix about a teaspoon of baking soda with enough water to create a milky liquid, and rub it on your feet and underarms.
ORAL HEALTH: Baking soda is a popular ingredient in toothpastes and mouthwashes since it has been shown to enhance plaque removal. You could just dip your toothbrush into baking soda so you don't have to buy the expensive toothpaste, it works just the same.
ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE: , sodium bicarbonate buffers the lactic acid that builds up in hard-working muscles, delays fatigue and enhances athletic performance.
READ: Topical use of baking soda is safe and nontoxic. Oral use is also safe, provided you do not exceed the recommended doses, as this could upset the body’s acid-base balance. Larger amounts can cause temporary nausea and diarrhea.
