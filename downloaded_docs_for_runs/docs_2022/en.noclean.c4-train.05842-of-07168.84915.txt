Vaping may not sound so bad, until you bring up the fact that one vape pod has nicotine equal to twenty cigarettes. This means that you can get addicted in less than a week of using one.
Vape pens have risen to a $1 billion industry over the past decade, and with more than 460 different vape brands, they can be hard to miss. One of the most popular is the Juul. Vape pens were originally made to help smokers quit smoking. Many people consider them a better alternative since they do not produce ash or a smoky smell. Most adults using them use normal cigarettes and vape pens, but this is not about adults. This is about the vast number of teens being exposed to vaping and how it is affecting their bodies.
Vaping is becoming a national epidemic in the U.S. Teens are getting their hands on them easier and easier. Some high schoolers even vape in class without their teachers noticing. The act of vaping is seen as a fun, harmless way of smoking that doesn’t seem to affect teens in any way.
​
This is not the case. To understand why vaping is a problem, we first have to understand how vape pens work. A vape pen heats up liquids or solids to a vapor as a person inhales it. The vapors produced have flavors that make the vapor taste good, but the flavors used in these liquids have various harmful chemicals inside of them, such as formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a chemical linked to coughing, chest pain, and even cancer. These flavors include bubblegum, cotton candy, and dessert, making them even more desirable to kids and teens.
Once you combine all of these things (harmful chemicals, kid/teen attracting flavors, and high nicotine levels), vape pens seem less like a toy and more like a pretty unforgiving item. In conclusion, do not vape. It has become more consequential than anyone ever thought it would be. This has been Alex Eaton of the Summit Academy Independence Journalism staff.
