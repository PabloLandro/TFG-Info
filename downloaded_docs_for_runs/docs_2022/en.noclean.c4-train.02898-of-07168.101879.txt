@SkinTags
What are skin tags?
Skin tags are extremely common. They are small bits of skin that protrude from the surrounding area, usually formed in areas with restricted movement or where clothing is tight, such as the underarms, neck, eyelids, groin and breasts. They are neither contagious nor harmful, and in general they aren’t known to be painful. With that said, they can be rather unsightly, which is why some people seek to have them removed. When they form in areas that are quite visible, it can have a negative effect on your confidence and self-esteem. In some cases, skin tags tend to fall off on their own over time without you realising, but you should never attempt to remove them yourself as you risk complications and infection.
Skin tag removal
There are a number of techniques that can be used to remove a skin tag. At Health & Aesthetic Clinic, we use electric cauterisation. This is a process that involves the electronic heating of a needle that is then used to burn the cells of the skin tag so that it can be safely removed from the skin. This is performed under a local anaesthetic so as to eliminate any pain and make the whole experience as comfortable as possible for our patients. Side effects are extremely rare with such a routine procedure, but you may be left with a small white scar in place of the skin tag, if anything.
