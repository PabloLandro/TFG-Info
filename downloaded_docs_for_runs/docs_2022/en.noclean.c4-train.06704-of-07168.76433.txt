Posted in Moles Skin Tags Warts, Reviewed & Updated on March 31, 2018
In normal cases, warts and skin tags will take on the color of the skin. Moles, on the other hand, can appear black, tan, pink or even red. The important thing is to keep checking that a certain skin growth doesn’t continually change its appearance.
It occasionally happens that moles, skin tags or warts may turn black, with or without treatment. Most people start to worry when that happens, and for a good reason. Skin growths turning black can be a sign of serious problems such as melanoma, a deadly skin cancer. But they can also be indications that a skin growth is finally dying off.
Remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for canker sore treatment, can be used to hasten the healing process and inhibit spread.

Normally, warts last between 6 months and 2 years without treatment to get rid of warts. In that time, the immune system will fight off the virus and cause a natural demise to the warts. Before they are shed from the body, the warts will turn black and fall off the skin.
Plantar warts often turn black before healing. Since plantar warts mostly appear inside the skin of the sole, much like a callus, they will leave a hole behind once healed. It is very important that treatment is continued even after warts have turned black and no longer hurt. Until they have fallen off the skin, they still can be spread.
If a wart turns black and continues to be painful for more than 2 weeks, have a doctor check the same. It could be an infection of some kind.
Note that there is a difference between herpes sores and warts. For example, herpes on the face will form open sores and may not persist longer than warts.
What is the meaning of a skin tag turning black overnight?

For example, the same thing that causes hemorrhoids can turn skin tags black. Body parts prone to a lot of friction such as the anal region are susceptible to black skin tags. As friction and pressure are exerted on the tags, blood vessels are likely to become constricted, leading to blood clots.
Treatment options such as laser, cryotherapy and remedies used against genital skin tags can also cause skin tags to turn black. In fact, any treatment method that works by cutting off blood supply into the skin tag will turn it black.

In two weeks or less, a black skin tag should fall off the skin. If that period is exceeded, blackened skin tags can be an indication of some infection. A doctor or a dermatologist should be consulted in that case.
Important information on a mole turned black
Some moles are black from the very beginning. Some may turn black afterwards. Depending on other factors that we will discuss here, a mole that has turned black can be normal or a sign of melanoma.
The initial cause that resulted in the formation of a black mole can encourage it to turn even darker. For example, continued exposure to UV rays can make moles more darkly pigmented or lead to the formation of other dark moles.
Some moles naturally change color or are multi-colored. Whatever the case, changes should not be frequent or rapid.
Some infections or infestations may cause scarring on the moles and turn them black. For example, scabies in humans is likely to cause some forms of scarring. If they attack a spot where a mole is located, they can contribute to it turning black.
Signs that a mole that has turned black is cancerous
It is important that you get information on the signs that will indicate a mole that has turned black is cancerous. In fact, you might want to compare before and after images/pictures of your moles to identify any observable changes.

It is not symmetrical. The mole will have two unequal halves
The edges or borders are irregular. Normally, a mole will be circular with well defined borders
Keeps changing color or has multiple colors. Although some normal moles will appear in different colors, they should be consistent and not appear overnight or in patches
Large sized spots than measure more than 6 mm in diameter. If you notice any increment in size and mass, see a doctor immediately. Rapid growth is a common feature in cancerous skin growths
Lastly, a mole should maintain appearance, shape and size for significantly long enough. You should not wake up one morning to find that your mole has suddenly changed in size or color.
How to treat a mole, skin tag or wart that has turned black
It is likely that you are already under some treatment if any of the above named skin growths were to turn black. If not, you may not even need to start treatment.
For skin tags, they are not contagious. If they are not painful or infected, you can leave them to fall off the skin. Remedies such as tea tree oil and castor oil can hasten this process. For warts, you will need to continue treatment even when they have turned black. This is mainly meant to avoid spread. For moles, if you are not certain that they are not cancerous, treatment should be done by a qualified doctor in a clinic after diagnosis.
