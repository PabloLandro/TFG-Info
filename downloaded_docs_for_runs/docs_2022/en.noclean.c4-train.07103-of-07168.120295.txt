Using a cotton ball that has been soaked in witch hazel, apply to the area for up to 10 minutes. Alternatively, add the witch hazel into a warm bath.
Bowel Movements
One of the major causes of hemorrhoids is excessive straining during evacuation. Staying hydrated by consuming more water and cutting back on refined or processed foods is an easy way to soften and ease your bowel movements.

Using alternating ice and heat can be the simplest way for you to help your hemorrhoids at home. The alternation of extreme temperature causes the hemorrhoids to shrink and disappear. You should put ice on the hemorrhoid for about 10 minutes daily, then use moist heat for about 20 minutes.
Products Containing
If you have hemorrhoids, avoid using hygiene products containing oils, dyes and fragrances. Even short term exposure to products containing these additives can cause pain, itching or swelling of the hemorrhoids.
You may not know it, but you may be able to find all-natural hemorrhoid treatments right in your own kitchen. An ice pack, for one, is an easy solution. When you use an ice pack you can decrease any soreness you have that is caused by your hemorrhoids. When applied to the affected area, ice packs will lower the build up of your hemorrhoids.
Bowel Movements
During bowel movements, straining too hard can cause hemorrhoids. Making a diet change to one with more water and fewer processed foods will make it easier to pass stools. Assuming a squatting position may make it easier to avoid straining while having a bowel movement. You need a small stool to keep your feet comfortable when you are on the toilet. In places where people squat instead of sitting down for bowel movements, hemorrhoids are uncommon.
Whole wheat bread can improve a hemorrhoid condition. You can also get rid of redness and irritation. Next time you’re preparing a sandwich, grab the whole wheat bread instead of refined white bread.
If you have a better understanding of hemorrhoids, you’ll realize that you don’t have much to worry about. Find out as much as you can about this condition. Hemorrhoids are bundles of nerves that swell and become sensitive.
Witch Hazel
If you do not want to visit your doctor and pay for a costly prescription medication, there are many all-natural treatments that can be administered in the comfort of your own home. After a bowel movement, take a warm bath and add sitz to the water. Try to avoid scratching your hemorrhoids. Instead of scratching your hemorrhoids, apply witch hazel to them. Witch hazel will stop the hemorrhoids from itching for a little while. Also ensure that you are getting enough fiber in your diet, as well as the recommended eight cups of water per day. By doing this, you will not have to push too hard when having a bowel movement.
Now that you’ve read this entire article, you should be better prepared to treat the painful symptoms of hemorrhoids. The preventive measures can result in your permanently putting hemorrhoids in the past.
