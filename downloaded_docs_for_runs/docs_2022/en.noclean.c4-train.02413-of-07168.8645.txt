Reduce Inflammation and Boost Brain Health With Wild Caught Omega-3 Fish Oil
Top 5 Health Benefits of Fish Oil
Fish oil is one of the most popular supplements on the market, and for good reason. Rich in monounsaturated fats, it fuels your body and supports cardiovascular health. Diabetics take fish oil to keep their blood sugar levels stable. Athletes use it to fight inflammation and recover faster from training. Seniors who take fish oil have stronger bones and manage arthritis pain more easily.
The human body can not produce DHA and EPA, the most important fatty acids. Thus, they need to be obtained from food. Fish oil is an excellent source of omega-3s and comes in a convenient pill or liquid form. From reduced risk of heart disease to sharper cognitive function, its benefits are amazing. Let's go over the top reasons why you should take fish oil and how it benefits your health:
Relieves Arthritis Pain †
Studies indicate that fish oil is just as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief, but without unwanted side effects. This supplement not only relieves pain, but also lowers inflammation in the joints and tissues. It's particularly good for arthritis patients, athletes, and people with inflammatory conditions.
Supports Healthy Cholesterol Levels †
Fish oil supplements reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL (good) cholesterol. The FDA has actually approved fish oil as an alternative treatment for high cholesterol. This nutrient helps reduce heart disease risk and improves cardiovascular health in as little as one month!
Fights Depression †
The omega-3 essential fats in fish oil may relieve anxiety, depression, mental fatigue, and nervous disorders. According to Dr. Michelle Price Judge, this supplement may help protect women from post-partum depression and lift their mood. Other studies have found that fish oil improves depressive-like, anxiety-like, and cognitive behaviors in mice. These findings can be applied to humans as well.
Prevents Cancer †
A growing body of research suggests that fish oil can even prevent breast, colon, and prostate cancers. It also increases the effectiveness of conventional cancer drugs and speeds up healing. A 2013 study has shown that fish oil supplements inhibit cancer cell growth and reduce inflammation while minimizing the side effects of chemotherapy.
Supports Eye Health †
According to health experts, fish oil supplements protect people from age-related vision loss, cataracts, and macular degeneration. They may also reverse age-related eye disorders and improve vision. Research shows that people with omega-3 deficiency have a greater risk of eye diseases.
Deficiency Warning Signs
Omega-3 essential fatty acids are crucial to your health. Even the slightest deficiency can affect muscle and bone function, brain health, blood pressure, and mood. Low levels of omega-3s in the body have been linked to: †
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease
Poor memory
Chronic fatigue
Depression
Infertility
Impaired immune function.
Dry Skin, hair and nails
Painful Joints
Memory “Fog”
Crave Fatty Foods
This nutrient is available in supplement form (as fish oil), but also occurs naturally in certain foods, such as tuna, salmon, and other cold water fish. Be sure that your fish oil is from 100% wild caught fish to insure quality and health benefits. Whether you want to keep your heart healthy, lose weight, ward off cognitive issues or just create a healthier you, fish oil can help!
