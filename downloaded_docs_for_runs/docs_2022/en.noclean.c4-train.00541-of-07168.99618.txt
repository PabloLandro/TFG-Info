Purity and value are assured as Xtend-Life professional product management controls the quality from harvesting and processing, right through to your door. Many other fish oils are shipped thousands of miles before being processed and packaged.
No doubt you’ve heard that while blood cholesterol is an important factor in heart health, doctors have been perplexed by the fact that many heart patients have normal LDL cholesterol levels, while other individuals with higher cholesterol go on to lead relatively healthy lives. The difference is triglycerides levels, which determine the danger posed by higher LDL cholesterol levels. Lower triglyceride levels (not more than twice the HDL level) render LDL cholesterol much less harmful.
So keeping triglycerides under control is extremely important for cardiovascular health. We offer a several strategies for cholesterol control without dangerous statin drugs
Arguably, the most effective of these strategies is supplementing with DHA and EPA Omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oils.
The DHA component of fish oil Omega 3 is vitally important to maintaining memory and the neurological development of children. Xtend-Life fish oil is high in DHA, the primary Omega 3 in our brains. Most other fish oils are primarily EPA.
Nonetheless, many people are wary of taking fish oil supplements because of concerns about contaminants. Most of our oceans are polluted with toxins such as heavy metals and PCBs, and the fish we eat and those that the oils are harvested from contain varying amounts of these toxins.
Fortunately, Xtend-Life Omega 3 DHA Fish Oil is a 50/50 blend of hoki oil in its natural triglyceride form and a concentrated molecularly distilled tuna oil in an ethyl ester form. Both are exceptionally pure and easily absorbed by the body because these omega-3s maintain a natural molecular shape. No synthetic triglycerides are found in our oil, as Xtend-Life products are as natural as nature itself. Our hoki oil has naturally high levels of DHA, which is further enhanced during the purification process. Hoki is caught in the pristine Southern Ocean and is naturally free of contaminants.
Pure, contaminant-free Omega 3 fish oil
