Not everyone will agree with our list, but we hope it will provide readers with a clear overview of some of the best mods on the market. We will be updating the top box mods article as we review more devices going forward. Please take into consideration that there are many new mods coming out on a daily basis, therefore it might take a while for the best ones to make it onto our list.
Vaping involves inhaling water vapor through a personal vaporizer or electronic cigarette. E-cigarettes are generally seen to be a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes, which are known for their harmful carcinogenic chemicals.

A vape pen is a portable, non-combustible pen-shaped device used for inhaling a variety of e-liquids such as e-liquid (electronic liquid) and concentrates. Some also allow you to vape dry herbs as well. Vape pens are the most common type of vaporizers in the market and they come in a variety of sizes and thickness. They utilize whatever liquid or dry herb of your choosing and conducts it, heating the product inside the vape pen instead of combusting it with a flame source. This allows you to carry a discreet, all-in-one device with a pure flavor brought by conduction.
“I have the same conversation with every student we catch vaping,” said Scott Carpenter, the dean for discipline at Cumberland High School in Rhode Island. “I say, ‘If I handed you a cigarette would you smoke it?’ And 100 percent of them look at you like you’re absolutely crazy for even suggesting that they’d do that.”
I’ve got a decent collection of these tanks and a few mods as well now. Been vaping since June and love the reviews on this site the way they’re done. Love that you test most coils and let everyone know where the flavor sweet spot is.

Size matters when it comes to atomizers. Deep dish atomizers are for people who vape throughout the day and want to minimize loading, or those who like extended sessions. Shallow atomizers are better for moderate use.

The Exxus Mini Vaporizer by Exxus Vape is the smallest vaporizer of its kind, but this unit delivers a great-tasting vape that larger vaporizers find it difficult to duplicate. Don’t let the 4 inch tall by 1 inch wide size of the Exxus Mini fool you. It can hold its own against the best vaporizers on the market.

A vape mod is a power source, essentially a case that contains one or more rechargeable batteries, that supplies electricity to a vaping atomizer. They are also referred to as “vapor mods”. The term “mod” has its origins in the early years of e-cigs, where hobbyist vapers “modified” existing electrical hardware (cases, batteries, wiring, etc.) for custom use as vaping hardware.

The coil is one of the most important aspects of vaping. It decides battery life, flavor, clouds, and overall functionality of the user’s vape. These coils are measured in electrical resistance as ohms (O). Typically, the higher electrical resistance you have, the longer your battery will last and vice versa. Usually, a vape pen’s coil will be around 1.0-3.0O, but there are coils that a user can purchase that go as low as 0.15O for massive clouds. Coils also hold a wicking element such as cotton, silica, quartz, or ceramic to properly conduct the product. They also come in all types of varieties and some users even go as far as wrapping their own coils, as known as “building”.

For the price, it’s easily one of the best vape pen starter kits on the market right now. The T20 tank utilizes two different types of coils. One of them is 0.8-ohm coil and the other one is 1.6 ohms.
Temp control has not been universally adopted by vapers. Those who use TC tend to swear by it, but many other vapers use TC only sporadically or not at all. Since most mods now contain regulating chips, however, and since it’s no more expensive for manufacturers to include temp control technology in their chips, TC has largely taken over the vape mod marketplace.
While convection vaporizers heat materials with hot air that’s blown through the heating chamber, conduction vape pens directly heat the material on the surface of the heating element. Users who value vapor purity over all else should find a portable vaporizer with convection heating, or a desktop vaporizer. Vaporizer pens are better suited for decent hits on-the-fly. That said, vape pen vapor is much purer than the smoke produced by water pipes, joints, and pipes.
“If I had a pack of cigarettes in my room as a kid, that would have been discovered, here we’re dealing with, first of all, what’s a Juul?” said Michael McAlister, the principal at Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, Calif. The school has about 1,600 students, but parent education nights on the issue have turned out only about 70 people. Yet, out of 53 suspensions last year, 40 were for vaping devices.
OVP S is a simple version of the OVP. This model is a single temp high output battery. 650 Mah capacity is leaps above the 280mah batteries. Difference? It will out last by double, the competition between charges.
The internal lithium-ion battery provides power to the vape pen and causes it to conduct any liquid or dry herb of your choosing. The battery also houses any functions for all-in-one devices such as a power button and/or temperature control buttons. Pen-shaped vape pens usually carry on average a 700 mAh battery capacity. With a high electrical resistance coil in your atomizer, these batteries can last hours before it needs another charge.
