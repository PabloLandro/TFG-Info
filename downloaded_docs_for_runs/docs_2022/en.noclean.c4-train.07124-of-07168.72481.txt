Tests for:
HIV
HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus) is a serious viral infection that is spread through body fluids, including through sexual intercourse, and this includes vaginal, anal and sometimes oral sex. HIV can also be spread by needle stick contamination, by sharing needles, receiving surgical treatment in foreign countries (where sterilization of equipment may not meet the standards of developed countries) and sometimes it can be passed from the mother to a child during the birth process or through breast feeding.
HIV is found in the bodily fluids of an infected person which includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat or urine. It thrives inside a persons body, however does not survive long outside the body.
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a contamination of the liver brought about by the hepatitis B infection. It is extremely infectious (100 times more infectious than HIV) and is easily transmitted through unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs.
A great many people who contract hepatitis B don’t have side effects. In the event that side effects do occur they can be seen one to six months subsequent to coming into contact with the infection. The disease can continue for a long time and quietly cause extreme liver damage, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer.
Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is a blood-borne liver infection, a vital organ of the body. There are many ways to catch hepatitis C. It’s possible to catch it through having unprotected sex.
Syphilis
Syphilis is caused by bacteria known as Treponema pallidum that can be passed on during sex.
The Serious Big Four Screen
Additional Information
These are the four “serious” sexually transmitted infections that can have life-altering consequences. They can all be tested using a blood finger prick test from day 28 onwards after a potential exposure.
This screen would be suitable for people who have experienced a needle stick injury or who are particularly worried about infections that can have life-altering consequences.
A discreet Test kit is dispatched simply at your given address.The sample is forwarded to the laboratory using our self addressed envelope. Results are sent via a text message.
If you test positive for any of these “Big Four” infections then we will work out the best next course of action for you, which may lead to us recommending that you see a healthcare professional (doctor or nurse) face to face.
We will provide you with clear information on all the options available to you, including a list of local NHS sexual health (genito-urinary or GUM) clinics. We will be here to support you along the whole pathway from testing to the final resolution of the issue.
