[post_content] => Warts on the genital region and skin tags are among the most common skin conditions today. It is unlikely that you will go your whole life without experiencing a single one of them.
There quite a number of differences that can be identified when comparing these conditions. This should not fool you however. In fact, most untrained persons can't successfully tell one from the other.
Before we get down to examining the most common differences, it is important to point out that pictures and images are a great tool that can help you tell one from the other.
What is the difference between genital warts and skin tags?
The main difference between genital warts and skin tags revolves around the cause and appearance. All warts are caused by HPV virus. This is not the same virus that causes herpes on the penis and genitals. Skin tags, on the other hand, arise when two body parts are in contact with one another and produce friction. This includes friction felt during sexual intercourse. It is a main cause of skin tags on the genitals. Any factor that will contribute to these causes will definitely result in either warts or skin tags.
[RELATED]
When it comes to appearance, skin tags are more like projections which are connected to the skin by a skinny stalk. This stalk can be easily cut with a razor or a pair of scissors. They take the color of the skin. Warts on the other hand are not projections but skin growths. Their mass is evenly distributed. While some may appear a bit raised, most are flattened on the part of skin they occur. Upon touch, they feel very soft and fleshly. Warts too are skin-colored.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; what causes them
Sexual intercourse is the main mode of transmission when it comes to genital warts. An infected person can pass the virus even when they don't show the symptoms. Since it is a viral infection, wart removal can only be done to get rid of the symptoms, namely the the skin growths, but not the virus. In fact, recurrent attacks will continue to occur throughout one’s life.
Skin tags are not typical infections. They in fact will not cause swollen lymph nodes or even pain unless physically injured. When frequent friction is sustained on a part of the body such as the buttocks, inner thighs, under arm and such, a projection will form. It can continue getting bigger with time.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; identifying them in pictures
If you are to take close-up pictures, genital warts will resemble cauliflowers and should not be confused with genital pimples. Areas around the anus, on the penis shaft, vaginal walls, vulva and penis tip are the most probable areas to find them.
[RELATED]
Although they may occur on the cervix, chances are high that they will then spread to the outside of the vagina.
Skin tags are unpredictable in regards to where they will occur. In pictures, they should resemble a literal skin-colored tag.
How to treat skin tags and genital warts
While some treatment methods can be used for both, genital warts may need medically prescribed medications to fight the virus.
Treatments for genital warts aim to inhibit the spread of the causal virus and at the same time get rid of the skin growths themselves.
Skin tags treatment methods only aim to get rid of the growths and not the cause. In both cases, clinical treatment may be necessary where home remedies have failed to work.
[RELATED]
Remedies such as tea tree oil can be tried on both. They are effective especially for skin tags on the face and other sensitive areas. There also are over the counter removal kits which can be used for the same removal purpose.
Are skin tags and genital warts contagious?
Skin tags do not pass from one person to another. They also do not spread to other body parts courtesy of an initial infection.
Genital warts are, on the other hand, very contagious. They can spread to other people or to other body parts. Just like with herpes, the virus takes advantage of open sores or cracks on the skin for entry points. It is for this reason that it is possible to contract herpes on the leg and other unlikely parts such as the shoulders.

[post_content] => In normal cases, warts and skin tags will take on the color of the skin. Moles, on the other hand, can appear black, tan, pink or even red. The important thing is to keep checking that a certain skin growth doesn’t continually change its appearance.
It occasionally happens that moles, skin tags or warts may turn black, with or without treatment. Most people start to worry when that happens, and for a good reason. Skin growths turning black can be a sign of serious problems such as melanoma, a deadly skin cancer. But they can also be indications that a skin growth is finally dying off.
Remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for canker sore treatment, can be used to hasten the healing process and inhibit spread.
What does it mean when a wart turns black?
Pictures and images show that a wart or warts in a cluster can turn black. Here, the entire wart or the whole area covered by a cluster of the warts will also turn black. Basically, it will appear as a large darkened spot or patch.
So what does it mean when a wart turns black? In most cases, it is an indication that a wart has reached its final stages and is finally dying off. This can happen naturally or after treatment.
[RELATED]
Normally, warts last between 6 months and 2 years without treatment to get rid of warts. In that time, the immune system will fight off the virus and cause a natural demise to the warts. Before they are shed from the body, the warts will turn black and fall off the skin.
Plantar warts often turn black before healing. Since plantar warts mostly appear inside the skin of the sole, much like a callus, they will leave a hole behind once healed. It is very important that treatment is continued even after warts have turned black and no longer hurt. Until they have fallen off the skin, they still can be spread.
If a wart turns black and continues to be painful for more than 2 weeks, have a doctor check the same. It could be an infection of some kind.
Note that there is a difference between herpes sores and warts. For example, herpes on the face will form open sores and may not persist longer than warts.
What is the meaning of a skin tag turning black overnight?
You might wake up one day to a skin tag turned black overnight. It shouldn't be something to keep you up at night, though.
For example, the same thing that causes hemorrhoids can turn skin tags black. Body parts prone to a lot of friction such as the anal region are susceptible to black skin tags. As friction and pressure are exerted on the tags, blood vessels are likely to become constricted, leading to blood clots.
Treatment options such as laser, cryotherapy and remedies used against genital skin tags can also cause skin tags to turn black. In fact, any treatment method that works by cutting off blood supply into the skin tag will turn it black.
[RELATED]
Basically, skin tags turning black is an indication that the tag is healed and will fall off the skin in due time. It is not an absolute must that it turns completely black. Some will merely turn reddish before detaching from the skin.
In two weeks or less, a black skin tag should fall off the skin. If that period is exceeded, blackened skin tags can be an indication of some infection. A doctor or a dermatologist should be consulted in that case.
Important information on a mole turned black
Some moles are black from the very beginning. Some may turn black afterwards. Depending on other factors that we will discuss here, a mole that has turned black can be normal or a sign of melanoma.
The initial cause that resulted in the formation of a black mole can encourage it to turn even darker. For example, continued exposure to UV rays can make moles more darkly pigmented or lead to the formation of other dark moles.
Some moles naturally change color or are multi-colored. Whatever the case, changes should not be frequent or rapid.
Some infections or infestations may cause scarring on the moles and turn them black. For example, scabies in humans is likely to cause some forms of scarring. If they attack a spot where a mole is located, they can contribute to it turning black.
Signs that a mole that has turned black is cancerous
It is important that you get information on the signs that will indicate a mole that has turned black is cancerous. In fact, you might want to compare before and after images/pictures of your moles to identify any observable changes.
[RELATED]
For best results, use a full mirror every day after your bath to examine your moles.
Here are the common signs that a mole that turned black is cancerous:
It is not symmetrical. The mole will have two unequal halves
The edges or borders are irregular. Normally, a mole will be circular with well defined borders
Keeps changing color or has multiple colors. Although some normal moles will appear in different colors, they should be consistent and not appear overnight or in patches
Large sized spots than measure more than 6 mm in diameter. If you notice any increment in size and mass, see a doctor immediately. Rapid growth is a common feature in cancerous skin growths
Lastly, a mole should maintain appearance, shape and size for significantly long enough. You should not wake up one morning to find that your mole has suddenly changed in size or color.
How to treat a mole, skin tag or wart that has turned black
It is likely that you are already under some treatment if any of the above named skin growths were to turn black. If not, you may not even need to start treatment.
For skin tags, they are not contagious. If they are not painful or infected, you can leave them to fall off the skin. Remedies such as tea tree oil and castor oil can hasten this process. For warts, you will need to continue treatment even when they have turned black. This is mainly meant to avoid spread. For moles, if you are not certain that they are not cancerous, treatment should be done by a qualified doctor in a clinic after diagnosis.

[post_content] => Common skin growths such as moles, skin tags and warts usually heal on their own even without clinical treatment. Just like canker sores, waiting for them to heal naturally can take longer than you are willing to wait. This is bearing in mind that they can be a source of both discomfort and embarrassment.
Doctors will usually diagnose a skin growth after a physical examination. For moles and warts, a shave biopsy may be needed to affirm that they are not cancerous or infected.
The actual cost of treatment will depend on the location and number of skin growths to be treated. Doctors will discuss the same before going ahead with removal. It is important that you check and see if your insurance plan will cover the cost. Most skin growth removal treatments are considered aesthetic and are not covered by insurance plans.
How do doctors remove moles; what type of doctor removes moles
Even a regular doctor can remove or diagnose cancerous moles. You can consider calling and ask if a certain hospital or clinic offers the removal procedures for moles.
However, a certified dermatologist is the best doctor to see for mole removal. They can remove moles on any part of the body and also advise what to do in case of cancerous moles.
[RELATED]
And how do doctors remove moles? There are about 3 main methods that doctors use to remove moles. They include:
Burning – this is not the literal burning you may be thinking of. Here, a current is run through a wire and used to generate heat. The wire is then used to burn off the top layers of the mole.
Incision – a minor surgery is carried out to shave the moles. Since some moles may be rooted deep into the skin, the doctor may need to remove some surrounding skin. The surgery requires use of a local anesthetic.
Freezing them off – this is a very popular removal technique. It is also used to get rid of warts and skin tags at home. Here, a very cold substance is used to kill the moles off, and they will then detach from the skin with time.
A doctor may also suggest some creams or home remedies such as used for herpes throat treatment to speed up mole removal.
How do doctors remove skin tags; what kind of doctor to see?
Skin tags are easy to remove. In fact, you can do it at home with remedies such as tea tree oil. In case of infected or very large skin tags, you may need to see a doctor for removal.
Skin tags can be removed in general hospitals or private clinics. However, a dermatologist will likely get the job done more effectively, as they are specialists. This is especially true for skin tags occurring on the face or for infected red skin tags.
So, how do doctors remove skin tags? Like moles, skin tags can be removed by cutting them off, burning them, freezing and use of laser therapy. Laser therapy sees the stalk on which the tags attach on the skin poisoned and killed off. With time, the tags will fall off the skin.
[RELATED]
Some doctors will use a combination of removal options for better results. For example, a doctor can freeze the skin tags using liquid nitrogen. After that, they will prescribe a cream, gel or pad containing a corrosive agent. Salicylic acid is a good example of corrosive agents used in such gels and creams.
Clinical methods to remove skin tags fast usually leave a scar. Incision and burning for example will almost guarantee scarring. It is for this reason that freezing and use of salicylic acid is generally preferred.
How do doctors remove warts; genital warts removal in a doctor’s office
If you are certain that it is warts you are dealing with, you may want to visit a doctor’s office for strategic treatment methods. You can succeed in removing even genital warts at home. The problem is that they will keep coming back if the root cause is not addressed.
A doctor will most likely choose to freeze warts, just the same way it is done in skin tags and moles. Laser therapy and burning can also be used but not commonly. Rarely will the warts be surgically cut off, especially in the case of genital warts.
Since the virus that causes warts hides in the body even when there are no symptoms, medications to avoid recurrent outbreaks are usually given in a clinic.
You will also be given some medications or guidelines to ensure that you do not spread the warts to healthy people near you. Unlike skin tags and moles, warts are very contagious.
During treatment, warts will turn black and fall off the body. Even when that happens, medications and treatment should not be stopped until the warts fall off the body completely. It is the same thing that happens when taking medicine for ringworm. You have to keep taking it until the prescribed period is over.
How do doctors remove genital warts?
Unlike plantar warts on the foot, genital warts can be a bit difficult to treat. This is on top of the fact that most people are not willing to get clinical treatment for the same, due to embarrassment.
[RELATED]
Depending on what kind of doctor you have visited, the warts can be burned, frozen, poisoned with laser or trimmed with a scalpel.
You can also be given prescribed medications to fasten the healing process or control spread. Except for in the case of cutting them off, most wart removal methods will require more than one application.
How do doctors freeze remove warts?
To freeze warts, liquid nitrogen is used. Since the substance is extremely cold, it kills off most of the warts and their blood vessels.
There are some kits available that you can use to freeze warts at home. They are not as effective as the procedure done in a doctor’s office.
How do doctors remove moles, skin tags and warts; cost in a doctor’s office
Depending on what type of doctor or clinic you are having the skin growths removed, the cost will vary. On average, the removal cost falls anywhere between $100 and $300.
You can always have the doctor discuss the cost during consultation and after examination.

[post_content] => A mole, skin tag or even a wart appearing anywhere on the skin should generally be painless. Different causes and predisposing factors are responsible for these skin conditions. However, similar causes can turn them painful or make them change in color and shape.
Skin tags will rarely turn into cancer even when painful. Painful or injured warts will increase the chances of spreading but also will rarely end up in cancer. Moles are different. If they become painful and experience sudden and persistent changes in growth, they really should be checked in a doctor's office.
Treatments done at home can be effective but in some cases will end up in painful sores that call for even more medical attention. For people with conditions such as diabetes and hemophilia, practices such as cutting off skin growths should not be done at home. They can lead to excess bleeding or skin ulcers.
What does a painful mole on the back and other body parts mean
A mole is formed when melanocytes bundle in a single spot. Melanocytes are the cells that make the skin appear the way it does in regards to color. Factors such as too many UV rays can force the cells to spread and possibly accumulate in a single spot. When this happens, the affected spot will have a darker pigmentation. That is what a mole is. Other factors such as accumulated blood vessels in a single spot can still result in a red mole.
[RELATED]
Like any other part of the skin, moles can sustain injuries. They have blood vessels and nerve endings. Therefore, any injury sustained on them will cause pain in the mole. Injuries can be caused by cuts when shaving or any external trauma of that kind. Such injuries should heal in 2 weeks or less.
A painful mole can still be a sign of melanoma. This is a type of cancer of the skin that is most deadly. Although only 1 in every 10 or more moles will end up in such cancer, chances should not be taken. Following are the characteristics of normal moles that can help you identify a cancerous mole before it develops into later stages:
Measures less than quarter of an inch
It should have regularly defined edges
Most are round
It should be evenly colored
Some are raised while some appear flat on the skin
Any of the above features should be maintained for a significant period of time. Although most moles keep evolving, there should never come a time that too many changes occur in a very short duration of time.
See a doctor should a painful mole persist more than 14 days.
Can a painful skin tag on buttocks be treated?
It is common for a painful skin tag to appear on the buttocks and other areas where constant friction or pressure is sustained. The same can happen to skin tags on the finger or on the thumb. Such skin tags are prone to picking, catching, and other sources of trauma.
A painful skin tag can also appear to darken overnight. This is mainly caused by clotted blood inside the skin tags. The condition can be painful and worrying. If left untreated, the tag will run out of blood supply and will fall off in less than 2 weeks. It is not a sign of cancer at all.
[RELATED]
When it comes to treatment, the best way to remove a painful skin tag on the buttocks or related areas is incision. Here, the tag will be surgically removed by a doctor, using a scalpel. A doctor may also decide to use a combination of removal techniques such as cryotherapy and burning. All of these options will depend on the location and the size of the tag.
At home, the same can be removed with over the counter kits used for wart removal or with home remedies. The most important thing is to ensure that the injured or painful skin tag does not act as an entry point for bacteria and other infections such as herpes.
What causes a painful wart after treatment?
Warts form when HPV virus is active. They appear as soft raised or flat growths on the affected parts of the body. Without treatment, it can take between 6 months and 2 years for the immune system to fight them off the body.
In normal conditions, warts should not cause pain but are often itchy. In fact, it is the urge to keep scratching them that will ultimately lead to a painful wart.
A wart can also get painful after treatment. Since they are generally very soft, treatment methods can cause slight injuries to the warts. As it is with any other body part, injuries will be felt as pain.
A doctor will most likely choose to freeze the painful wart. This kills both the blood vessels and nerve endings on the wart. Practically speaking, the wart will then be dead and will fall off in a matter of days or a few weeks.
What is the best treatment for genital warts and painful sores?
Since warts are viral, it is practically a guarantee that they will re-appear even after treatment. Most of the available treatment options mainly focus on getting rid of the visible warts but not the cause. The problem is that viral infections never clear out of the body completely after the initial infection.
[RELATED]
Nowadays, doctors are making use of treatment drugs that boost the immune system and in the process may eradicate genital warts and painful sores. For example, Dermisil is gaining a lot of popularity as an immune strengthener. You can ask your doctor for such medications. They generally give you the ability to resist re-current wart attacks and also reduce the chances of developing painful infected warts.
Chances are high that a painful genital wart will be spread to sexual partners. In fact, it is not even necessarily a key factor that you engage in active sexual intercourse to pass the HPV virus, if you or your partner has open wart sores.
Can a painful wart on foot be spread on thumb or finger?
A wart on the foot is referred to as a plantar wart. A painful wart on the foot is referred to as a verruca. As you may suspect, the pain is usually caused by injuries sustained in parts of the feet that the warts appear on.
A plantar wart on the heel is almost guaranteed to be painful, especially when walking. Rather than being raised, such a wart will appear pressed into the skin of the sole and appear more like a scar than a skin growth. With time, it will feel like a cyst and may even alter both posture and gait.
A painful wart on the foot can spread and appear on the thumb or hands. If, for example, you are to walk barefooted in the bathroom or a wet floor, anyone with open sores or cracks in their feet who walks the floor after you will catch the virus upon contact.
The warts can also appear on the fingers after frequenting picking and scratching. Any cracks or openings on the finger will certainly act as entry points for the causal virus for the warts.
You are advised to maintain hygienic practices such as washing your hands with antiseptic soaps after touching or picking at warts. In fact, avoid any chances of touching open warts sores. They are most contagious when infected.
Home remedies to treat painful plantar warts and warts on the finger
Home remedies are a great option, both to treat and to curb the spread of a painful plantar wart. Apple cider vinegar for skin tags for example has antiviral properties. It can be used to stop the spread of the wart virus. Caution should be taken when using this remedy, for it can irritate and cause a lot of pain on open sores.
[RELATED]
Castor oil can also be used with baking soda to keep the warts from spreading. Of all remedies to be used at home, tea tree oil is perhaps the best to use against warts. It is very gentle on the skin but still has the antiviral and anti-inflammation properties.
Aloe Vera is a common ingredient in ringworm medications. It can be applied on painful warts to reduce the chances of spread and infections. You may  that remedies to be used at home work best when used in combinations. For example, you can use essential oils together with cold compress or over the counter removal kits.

[post_content] => Warts develop externally on the skin. Rather than occurring on the testicles, they may appear on the scrotal sac.
There are high chances that you are mistaking another type of skin growth with warts on the testicles. Pimples and cysts are common on the scrotal sac and can have a resemblance with warts.
To be certain, you can take pictures and compare them with images available for genital warts. You can in fact get a diagnosis from an online doctor if you don’t welcome the idea of visiting a clinic.
Can you get warts on testicles?
It is possible but very rare to get warts on testicles. In fact, only 1 in 100 patients will develop these warts. In men, warts mostly appear on the penile shaft and in the regions surrounding the anus. The scrotal sac is least commonly affected.
[RELATED]
Warts on the testicles can occur if you are having a severe attack and open warts or sores. The causal virus is contagious and takes advantage of any cracks on the skin around the genital area.
What do warts on testicles look like in pictures?
In pictures and images, warts on the scrotum will appear as flattened or raised skin growths. They mostly appear in clusters and are shaped like a cauliflower. Unless infected or in final stages of healing, they will take the color of the skin.
Generally speaking, all types of warts are not painful but may get itchy. Pain is an indication that the warts are infected or have sustained some injuries or trauma.
It is not advisable to keeping touching or picking at warts. However, you can still identify them by touch. Upon touch, they will feel fleshy, smooth and sometimes bumpy. Unlike bumps on skin, they will not be located inside the scrotum skin.
Can warts on testicles cause cancer
Warts will not develop into testicular or any other form of cancer. Just like a normal pimple on eye or such conditions, they will heal on their own even with no treatment.
Cancerous growths start inside the scrotal sac, on the testicles. In this case, you will feel a lump which is initially painless. The lump will increasingly grow in mass and with time will become painful.
Can a wart on the testicle spread to other body parts?
Warts of all types are very much contagious. For example, warts on the penile shaft are likely to also spread to the glans or the urethra. Picking at them is the main cause of spread.
The virus responsible for warts on the genitals is different from the one that causes plantar warts or common warts. However, exposure to any warts virus strains can cause infections. For example, touching the genitals with an injured finger or hand can spread the virus and cause common warts.
[RELATED]
Sexual intercourse with an infected person is almost a guarantee that you will develop warts on the genitals. In fact, skin to skin contact is enough to transmit the virus even with no sex involved. This however doesn’t include getting herpes in the mouth after oral sex.
About 40% of people below 40 years are living with causal virus for warts today. The virus can live in the body for years without showing any symptoms. In that period, it still can be transmitted. Even with treatment, the virus cannot be eradicated from the body. For this reason, warts will keep coming back even after treatment.
How to cure warts on testicles
If you have warts on the scrotum, you can easily treat them at home with remedies such as castor oil. Over the counter kits and topical creams containing salicylic acid can also be sued to get rid of the warts on testicles.
If you are not certain that it is actually a wart on testicle you are dealing with, the best idea is that you get a doctor to check the same. In fact, if you have not developed warts on any other genital area, it is probable that you are mistaking another skin condition with warts.
Guide information on skin tag on testicle
Just like warts, skin tags can appear on the scrotal sac but are not common. It is more likely that they will develop on the buttocks or the groin area rather than the scrotum.
Generally, skin tags are projections that are attached to the skin by a thin stalk. They usually result from constant friction sustained on the affected areas.
[RELATED]
A skin tag on the testicle is not harmful. In fact, it will detach from the skin with time. However, it can grow quite large and cause all types of discomfort or even embarrassment. Since skin tags are generally soft-skinned, they can easily sustain injuries and become painful.
How to remove a skin tag on testicle
The best way to remove a skin tag on the testicles is use of tea tree oil. It is a mild but effective home remedy. You can also use a TagBand or a string to choke the skin tag to death.
Freeze kits and topical products might be effective but are likely to cause discomforts when used on the testicles.
Some people will always consider advice from a doctor, even for some simple thing such as a birthmark meaning or a pimple on scalp. As much as it may seem unnecessary, it is actually very advisable. You find that even serious health conditions such as cancer begin with easily ignored symptoms.

[post_content] => It is common for skin growths to be infected, usually by bacteria. In such cases, treatment at home is not advised.
Physical injuries sustained on skin growths such as skin tags and warts will encourage bacteria entry and consequent infections. In such cases, the affected areas will become painful and form pus.
If you are not certain what skin growth you are dealing with, the best thing is to see your primary doctor for a medical diagnosis. For genital skin tags or other warts where you may not be willing to visit a clinic for examination, you can take pictures and images and send them to an online doctor.
Symptoms of infected warts
Generally, warts form as flattened or raised skin growths. They are very soft to the touch and take the color of the skin. Upon close inspection and on pictures, they will resemble tiny cauliflowers. They mostly occur in clusters.

Genital warts are the itchiest of all. When they occur around the anus, and they usually do, they cause a fierce anal itch that is almost impossible to ignore. A mole can also itch sometimes. So can a skin tag. We will get into details on possible causes in this article.

Being rubbed by clothes, skin piercings or jewelry
Constant picking at, touching or massaging them
Wrong treatment
Some soap, lotion and beauty products brands
Skin patches

Itching and bleeding skin tags can become infected and very painful. When or even before this happens, you can try any of the available ways to get rid of skin tags.
What happens when skin around a mole or moles themselves itch?
Moles that itch are known as atypical moles. The main difference between them and normal moles is that they can develop into melanoma, a skin cancer that you don’t want to be involved with.
[RELATED]
Normal moles don’t itch. In fact, you can carry them for years on your back without ever realizing that they are there.
If you observe that the skin around mole itches often, you should keep a very close eye on it. Preferably, have a doctor check it.
Cancerous moles that itch or skin around a mole that itches often
At home, you can run a quick diagnosis to determine if moles that itch are cancerous. It can be helpful to keep records of your existing moles for use in future. For example, you can take maintain a routine inspection of the moles after a bath. Taking pictures is even more strategic.
Here are the features to expect in a cancerous mole:
It has dissimilar halves. If you were to place a mirror on the center, the two halves would not look symmetrical
The borders are irregular or blurry
It has multi-colored spots and patches. The colors can keep changing often
It is starting to dwarf a pencil eraser in size and gaining mass fast
It is fast evolving in regards to size or color and looks a bit alien compared to other non-itchy moles
So can a mole itch? Yes it can, and it is not a good sign. You may also notice that such a mole itches sometimes and then stops for a while, but then may start again. With time, it may bleed, harden, form a crust and become painful. In fact, before it even gets to that, have a doctor check it.

Hemorrhoids
Bowel diseases

Soft and fleshy skin growths
Mostly take the color of the skin
Observed closely enough, you could take them for tiny cauliflowers
Largest populations appear on vagina, vulva, anus and the penile shaft. They can also occur on other genital areas such as the urethra and the cervix. However, it is likely that they will spread to the above mentioned areas.
Why do genital warts itch and what causes itching warts
Why do genital warts itch? Warts will not naturally itch, as long as they are not irritated through touch, creams, friction, clothes and other such factors. It is very hard not to irritate them however.
For instance, vaginal warts and penile warts can easily get irritated when taking a bath, urinating, having sex and other actions. Anal warts on the other hand will constantly rub against the buttocks and cause anus itch.
Chances are low that genital warts will develop and fail to itch. In such times, they are easily transmitted and will develop into blisters or sores. In fact, itching is a main symptom of the warts. You find that they may develop and cause no symptoms other than some itchy, soft, tender and burning spots around the genital region.
Do plantar warts itch; warts that itch sometimes
Plantar warts are sometimes known as verruca. They prefer the heel and the ball of the foot.
Due to constant rubbing against footwear or the ground, a wart on that part of the foot may itch sometimes. Pressure exerted on the foot causes the warts to develop inside rather than on the sole. When treated, they leave a small hole on the spot where they previously existed.
[RELATED]
So do plantar warts itch? They absolutely do. In fact, they are also likely to be painful and can even interfere with your posture and gait.
The most common cause of itching and bleeding warts on the foot is friction and constant pressure. The other probable reason why they itch is because they are caused by HPV, a virus which has itchiness as one of its symptoms.
Do genital, common and plantar warts itch; what to do
Most warts will itch, especially when they get irritated or injured. Common warts, the ones that you will find on the hands and rest of the body, are most notorious as far as itchiness is concerned. This is because they are prone to getting rubbed against frequently.
Flat warts, the ones you will find mostly in kids or on the face, are also very itchy. Next in the lineup are warts appearing on or around the genitals. Anal warts are the worst in this category, followed by ones on the vagina and the penis. Plantar warts will also urge you to scratch them often but they will hurt more than they will itch.
Another type of warts that you may also come across is a bit rare but very itchy when it occurs. To identify them, they usually have a dimple on their centers, but take on the color of the skin. You will find them on thighs, abdomen or even the chest. They are very itchy.
What are the best treatments for itchy warts?
Topical creams can help reduce the itchiness caused by the warts. In fact, they will get rid of the warts entirely with time. The problem is that such creams cannot be used on infected or open warts. This can be caused by a sudden trauma, canker sores in the mouth or even skin ulcers.
[RELATED]
Home remedies are the best when it comes to easing and treating itching warts. For example, tea tree oil for warts will reduce inflammation and also aid in quick healing. Others such as aloe Vera and castor oil produce a soothing effect which can help with the burning and itchy sensations produced by itching and bleeding warts.
You can also try disinfectants on the warts. You will find that when they itch, warts are bound to get injured or opened sometime in the near future. You can prevent any infection before it happens with disinfectants.
Itching moles, warts, and even skin tags can be a source of embarrassment and discomfort. The good thing is that any of them can be removed easily in a clinic or even at home. If any of them is infected and especially if they are oozing pus, let a doctor be the one to conduct the removal process.

[post_content] => Have you ever wondered why it is that flowers and some plants are so attractive and nice smelling? Do you find yourself asking why it is that bees spend entire hours buzzing from one flower to another?
The secret behind it all is essential oils. These are natural substances contained in barks, flowers, and even leaves of some plants. They are very aromatic and also contain potential healing abilities. Tea tree oil with castor oil for example has been used as cold sore remedies.
When extracted, these oils readily can be morphed into a nice-smelling gaseous state. You can smell the fragrance in the air once a bottle of essential oil is opened. This is the advantage that doTERRA oil producers and other related companies take advantage of. As it stands, there are in excess of a thousand different types of substances that can be used to come up with an essential oil.
DoTERRA oil for skin tags removal
Other than using doTERRA oils for naturally healthy skin, you can use it to treat skin tags. Skin tags are projections on the skin that are fleshy and skin-colored. They are in no way cancerous or of risk to your health but can be a nuisance and embarrassing. They are common in pregnant women, obese individuals, older ones, and diabetics.
DoTERRA oil therapy for skin tag removal can be done in a variety of ways. First, you can choose to add the oil in your bathing water. Here, just add some drops into a warm water basin. The oil package will most likely come with guidelines on how many drops are to be added, depending on the type of oils used.
[RELATED]
You can also take advantage of the cold/hot compress methods. With these compresses, you just dip a piece of cloth in either warm or cold water and add some drops of the doTERRA oil for skin tag removal that you are using. From there, hold the piece of cloth against the skin tags for 10-15 minutes. You can do this 2-3 times in a day.
The oil can also be added to a lotion and then be applied on the affected area. In fact, you can also use it in a moisturizer and apply even on healthy parts of the skin. You will probably come across the use of essential oils in regards to how to cover a pimple.
Oregano oil for skin tags treatment
Oregano oil is one the several folk remedies used to get rid of common skin growths including skin tags. It can be used on the groin areas, necks or even the underarms. It would be a bad idea, however, to use this or most any other essential oils on sensitive areas such as the eyelids or in the ears.
Steps on how to use oregano oil for skin tags:
The oil works best when used with a string, a skin tag treatment method known as ligation
Hold the skin tag by the bumpy part and tie the stalk by the base
Ensure that there are no loose ends left on the string. These could collect bacteria from your surroundings. The string will remain in position until the tag falls off
Apply the oil to the growths, preferably with a piece of cotton ball
An antibacterial cream or ointment will be needed. Oregano oil will get rid of the skin tag but will not keep bacteria away
Oregano oil has been known to cause allergic reactions to people who don’t find lavender and mint products friendly to their skin. Also, it can cause irritation to the skin when used in very powerful concentrations. To avoid this, mixing it with some olive or coconut oil can help.
How to use doTERRA oil for moles removal
It is likely that you are familiar with moles. There are certain types of skin growths that usually are raised, dark/tan and with regular edges. They rarely measure more than 6 mm in diameter.
Although they often occur naturally and don’t usually pose health risks, rapidly evolving ones have been known to signal cancer of the skin.
If considering mole removal or treatment with essential oils, doTERRA oil for mole removal is a good place to start. Here is how you can use the oil to get rid of the moles:
Warm up some bath water and put some drops of the oil into it
The water can be used on any part of the skin even where moles are not present
Soak a towel in cold or warm water. Apply a few drops of the oil to the towel and then compress it on the moles
The oil can also be used in a lotion or a moisturizer
Oregano oil for moles usage
It has been observed that oregano oil is very powerful in mole removal usage. The problem is that the oil can be irritating to the skin when used in its purest forms. To avoid this, coconut or almond oil can be added.
When using oregano with almond oil, combine them in ratio of 1:8. Ensure that the two have mixed appropriately before use.

To use it, soak a cotton ball in the mixture and massage the mole with it. Ensure that all the parts of the mole have been covered with the solution. It works best when left to air-dry. After that, rinse the affected area.
Repeat this process once on daily basis. By the end of the first week, you will observe the mole turning black, an indication that it is dying off.
Should the skin on or around the mole get irritated, quit further application. A cleanser ointment can effectively be used to get rid of the oil from the irritated parts.
DoTERRA oil for warts treatment
Warts can be quickly removed in clinics by having them burnt, surgically removed or even frozen. The problem is that they will keep coming back, perhaps more times than you may be willing to keep visiting a doctor.
Luckily, essential oils are relatively effective in removing skin growths like warts.
A DoTERRA oil for warts removal recipe, for example, can clear common warts in a matter of weeks. An effective recipe can include coconut, frankincense and oregano oils. Clove or almond oil can be added into the removal mixture to ensure that no irritations are caused on the skin.
Apply the mixture directly to the warts once in a day. In a period of about 2 weeks, the warts will have cleared.
It is not advisable to use such a recipe on vaginal warts, skin growths around the eyes or bumps on the penis. In fact, ensure that your doctor has been consulted when using essential oils for treatment of skin growths anywhere near the genitals or the face.
Oregano oils for warts removal
If you have been looking at some natural ways to get rid of skin growths and warts, it is likely that you have come across oregano oil for use as a wart remover. It is an essential oil with lots of additional benefits. For instance, some people use it against stomach ulcers and white spots on the tonsils.
[RELATED]
This removal oil is very powerful and will probably irritate your skin if used alone. To avoid this, use some coconut oil to make it more mild while still maintaining its effectiveness. In every 1 unit of oregano oil used, add 8 equivalent units of coconut oil.
In regards to application, you can apply the oil directly to the affected areas. This can be done up to 4 times in a day. For even better results, cover the warts with a bandage.
Like other essential oils, care should be taken when using them on sensitive body parts such as the genitals. In fact, don’t use them on the eyes or on genital warts without proper consultation. You can however try them on ringworm on the neck or scalp. If the warts do not show signs of dying off in 2 weeks, get help from a dermatologist.

[post_content] => It isn't really a matter of debate that a doctor can remove skin growths or common infections such as toenail fungus easily enough. The problem is that you will likely have to part with more than $100. Chances are high that scarring will also be left behind.
Moving away from the issue of finances, skin growths such as warts or even skin tags will keep coming back even after you have had them removed. These factors combined, over the counter options provide a more strategic option.
Do OTC wart, skin tags and moles removal products work?
Top reviewed over the counter wart removal kits and products produce effective results even for skin tags and moles as long as they are used correctly.
It is natural to be skeptical when it comes to over the counter products. Luckily, the basis on which such top reviewed products work is largely understood. You will not have to worry about hidden ingredients or wasting your money on garbage products.
Which are the best over the counter removal medications?
Creams are the most popularly used over the counter wart removal medications. The secret behind their effectiveness is a compound known as salicylic acid. When an acid is applied on the skin, it works by corroding the top layers. This can be a bit scary but only when dealing with strong acids.
[RELATED]
Salicylic acid is very mild. In fact, it is not even used in its purest forms. In regards to the best OTC removal medications for warts, go for creams or ointments containing 17% of the acid.
Some other ingredients you can look for include alcohol, ascorbic acid and castor oil. Castor oil can in fact be used with baking soda against corns and calluses.
Which over the counter wart removal cure to buy?
If you are stuck with not knowing which the best OTC freeze product to use against warts is, here are some of the features you can look for:
Ease of use
A product that that doesn’t need too many precautions and preparations is better suited. Remember that you will be using it for a couple of days or weeks.
Customer reviews
Wart Mole Vanish, Dr. Scholl’s Freeze and Compound W are good examples of top reviewed freeze compounds. You can start from there and see what other users have to say about a removal product that has your attention.
Duration taken to work
Of course you're too smart to go for a product that claims to work overnight. On the other hand, a product that requires more than 4 weeks to work may not be the one to settle for. 2-3 weeks will do.
Sensitivity
Most of the available products will are not to be applied on sensitive areas such as eyelids but will work for hands and hardy body parts.
Which is the best over the counter skin tags removal product?
OTC products used against warts also work on skin tags. However, there are additional options in the case of skin tags removal. You can choose from any of the following:
Wart removers
The same salicylic acid that corrodes warts will have the same effect on skin tags. Remember to look for products containing 17% of the acid and ones that have been top reviewed.
[RELATED]
TagBand
Since a skin tag attaches to the skin through a stalk, a string can be tied at the point of attachment to literally choke off the tag. The problem is that it can get a bit cumbersome and painful to tie the tag with a thread. The TagBand device provides a more friendly and customizable option.
Tea tree oil
Although there are other remedies that can work, tea tree oil is perhaps the best. It will neither leave scars behind nor will it irritate your skin. To add on that, the oil has been known to fight fungal infections and can be used against white spots on nails.
Homeopathic remedies
All natural removers have been included in this category. Their main selling point is based on the claim that they clear off skin tags and leave no evidence in form of a scar behind. Since there are an awful lot of them available today, the best approach is to see what previous users have to say about them. Amazon.com client reviews section can help.
Which is the best over the counter mole removal and cure?
Like warts and skin tags, there are quite a number of over the counter mole removal and cure products. We will need not repeat the main mode of action.
Unfortunately, OTC removal products for moles have not had a lot of success. This is the part that you will really need to read what previous users have to say.
Amolis is a good example of an OTC mole remover. Most of its users affirm that it really works. In fact, you can use it against the other two skin conditions that we have discussed above. The important thing is to follow guidelines provided by the producer.
[RELATED]
Another such product is Tag No More. While it has been noted to require patience before desired results can set in, a significant population of clients did find it effective enough.
You can check out reviews for other OTC mole removal products such as tea tree oil. The best place to get genuine reviews is on external sites such as Amazon. As you will find out pretty soon, testimonials on the official product websites will rarely say something negative about the product they are attempting to sell.
Other over the counter skin tag, mole and wart removal options
The products we have been discussing so far are best used for growths on hands, neck and such hardy areas. For a genital wart, mole on face or skin tag, you will have to consider twice before using such products. In any case, you don’t want some acid, however mild, finding its way to your genitals or eyes.
That brings us to freezing the skin growths at home. Over the counter, you can purchase a freeze kit that works almost similarly to liquid nitrogen used in clinics for freezing skin tags and moles.
Such freeze kits make use of butane. It comes in spray which you can apply directly on the growths. The drawback with this cure option is that it may require quite a number of applications before being effective as needed.
The nitrogen used in clinics is about 3 times colder than OTC freeze kits. This enables it to penetrate deep into the skin and produce effects faster.
So which is the best over the counter removal product?
Some people will tell you that over the counter remedies are overrated. Others will tell a tale of the many such products they have tried without success.
For instance, remedies such as castor oil are sometimes advertised as potential syringoma treatment. If you are to ask any professional, they will confirm that syringoma hasn’t shown much response to such remedies, or even to clinical medications.
[RELATED]
The point we are trying to drive home is that a product about which a few people are saying effusively nice things may not work all that well for you. However, many genuine reviews confirming that a product is actually effective can be relied on.
If you are certain that the skin condition you are aiming to treat is not a case of infection or symptoms of an underlying health condition, you can try any top rated over the counter available product. More specifically, try some of the products we have mentioned here and other top rated ones that you will come across on genuine reviews. A bit of patience is necessary and a lot of sticking to the provided guidelines by the manufacturer.
If all those fail to work, your dermatologist will provide a way forward. In any case, skin tags, moles and warts are easy to get rid of.

[post_content] => The rectal area is the region in and on the anus. Discussing skin growths or conditions affecting such an area, especially skin tags and warts, can be stigmatizing and embarrassing.
The biggest problem with rectal skin tags and warts is that they are notoriously itchy. There is no way you can ignore them or completely overcome the urge to do some scratching. If that will not be embarrassing enough, it will invite all types of issues related to hygiene on top of irritating them further.
What causes rectal skin tags?
Although some similarities are shared between rectal skin tags and skin tags on other areas, the former differ a bit. A penis skin tag will not encourage the development of another one on the rectal area even after sex. In short, they are not contagious.
[RELATED]
In regards to causes, friction and moisture occurring on the rectal area is to blame. Any of the following will encourage their development:
Hard stool – passing hard stool is mostly associated with hemorrhoids but can also produce skin tags. It is always recommended that you address any issue contributing to constipation.
Anal sex – we need not go to the details in this case. Without lubes and such things, too much friction will be experienced in the rectal area.
Pregnancy – a couple of changes that take place during and after pregnancy encourage skin tags, not only on the rectal area but also other body parts such as the groin.
Identifying rectal skin tags in pictures
It can be quite demanding if you are to identify rectal skin tags without touching them. In this case, you can try taking some pictures and compare.
On pictures, you are likely to observe a loose skin projection that takes the color of the skin. There may be several of them in a cluster or just a single one. Unlike hemorrhoids, skin tags will be on the skin and projected outwards. Think of what a skin-colored rice grain or a grape would look like.
Rectal skin tags removal
Even when on the rectal area, the tags will not be contagious or get to develop into complicated genital infections. The problem is that they may interfere with anal hygiene. They are also prone to injuries and in that case encourage genital infections. This is not even mentioning the issue of pain and itching.
Use of remedies such as tea tree oil, also used for a cold sore on chin, is definitely not an option. Even if such remedies have been known to be effective, the rectal area is far too sensitive for such products.
Using a TagBand or a dental floss to ligate the skin tags is a better option. This can be done at home, to address the issue of stigmatization.
If you are open to clinical removal, a doctor can get rid of the tag quite easily. This can be achieved through surgical removal, compounds to freeze skin tags or burning. A quick surgery is much better, since then you will not need more than one appointment.
Laser treatment can be used when the tags are not responding to other treatments or when surgery is not an option. It is more effective in demanding treatments such as syringoma removal.
What causes rectal warts?
Rectal warts are a type of genital warts. They appear on or in the anus. In initial stages, you will hardly observe any symptoms, not even pain or itchiness. In fact, you may not even notice that they are there.
[RELATED]
Without treatment, rectal warts will gain mass and may even spread to other genital areas. They will also be prone to injuries and irritation. This will end in a painful, bleeding and itchy rectal area. On pictures, large rectal warts will resemble cauliflowers. They usually form in clusters and are very soft upon touch.
Rectal warts treatment and removal
Over the counter rectal warts treatment products are not recommended. Instead, topical medications will be prescribed by a doctor to get rid of them.
Some medications will need to be applied in a clinic while others are to be taken at home. The warts usually start showing signs of healing after 2 weeks.
Large rectal warts removal surgery
If the warts have grown too large, they will rarely respond well to topical medications. This also happens for warts too deep inside the rectal area.
In such cases, a doctor will most likely opt for a surgery to remove them. Such a surgery will not take long and the patient will be released on the same day after the operation.
Other removal methods such as freezing, burning and use of laser can also be possibilities. The problem with these is that several appointments will be needed.
How to prevent rectal skin tags and warts
For skin tags, prevention revolves around avoiding causes of friction on the rectal area. Measures such as not wearing too tight clothes and taking regular showers can help.
[RELATED]
Pregnant women should ensure that delivery occurs in a clinic or under the supervision of a professional. Sudden pressure sustained during delivery encourages rectal skin tags.
Just like nail fungus and such, warts are infections. This means that their cause is identifiable. Therefore, prevention measures revolve around containing the HPV strain that causes them. Anal sex, for example, will transmit the virus.
Warts are more common in people with low immunity. This can be encouraged by diseases such as diabetes and HIV. In such cases, see your doctor for prescription medication meant to contain the virus.

[post_content] => The area around and in the anus fosters the development of several skin growths and conditions. These include warts, hemorrhoids, anal fissures and skin tags.
Any of these conditions can be confused with another. For this reason, you may need to browse through available images and pictures for comparison.
Guides and information on perianal skin tag causes
Perianal skin tag causes revolve around factors that encourage a lot of friction to the areas around the anus. Any of the following factors will encourage them:
Pregnancy – changes in hormonal levels endured during pregnancy are a common cause of skin tags. During delivery, a lot of friction and pressure will also contribute.
Anal sex – the walls of the anus are bound to endure a lot of rubbing. This will certainly create the friction we identified as the main cause of skin tags.
Constipation – just the same way it causes hemorrhoids, it will encourage tags to form on the skin of the anal walls.
Obesity – this need no explanation. It has everything to do with pressure sustained on the buttocks when siting.
Perianal skin tags removal
Perianal skin tags removal is best done in a clinic. In this case, a doctor will perform a quick surgery to cut off the tags. It is a simple operation and a patient will be given leave on the same day the operation is done. Some post care services will be needed to ensure that the area doesn’t become infected.
[RELATED]
If you are not open to surgery, the same method used to freeze off moles can be used. If all those fail, laser therapy will be considered. It is more effective for clustered skin tags and when surgery is not open to consideration.
Perianal skin tags removal at home
You may be considering options to remove perianal skin tags at home. Well, there will be difficulties in achieving that. The fact that they are perianal means that the use of over the counter creams and products is advised against. Even remedies such as tea tree oil, which show so much success in treating conditions such as cold sores in the mouth, are not encouraged.
The best option in treating such skin tags at home is to use a TagBand or a dental floss to ligate them. Since this may obviously present a challenge unless you are spectacularly flexible and have strategically placed mirrors, you can have a friend or partner help you to place the ligation. Either that, or you can go to a doctor who is not only more qualified to do this, he is likely to be less horrified by the procedure than your friend or partner.
Guides and information on Perianal warts symptoms
Perianal warts symptoms are rarely felt until the warts have grown in size or have spread. In fact, an outbreak can occur and naturally heal without you ever noticing. It is common in guys with a very active immune system.
Just like skin fungus will keep spreading without treatment, perianal warts too will appear on other body parts courtesy of the initial development.
When they occur, perianal warts symptoms and common features include:
Fleshy growths around the anus
The growths can be flat or raised
Clusters will continue to form from the initial growth
With close inspection and as seen on on images, the growths will share resemblance with tiny cauliflowers
Normally, the growths will not hurt, itch or bleed. The reverse happens when they become irritated and infected.
Perianal warts treatment and removal
Perianal warts treatment is quite demanding. The problem is that you cannot apply some essential oils or cover them with a duct tape just like that. No one is willing to try options such as a syringoma cream, which contains an active acid, on their genitals. Such attempts will invite other more serious infections of the genitals.
[RELATED]
Luckily, there are a couple of prescription medications that are quite effective for small and young warts. Some will be applied by the doctor while some are to be taken routinely at home until the warts clear off.
A doctor may choose to have the warts removed by surgery. This is the fastest and most effective method. They can also be poisoned with laser beams or frozen. Warts that do not respond to topical medications are removed this way.
Over the counter perianal warts and skin tags removal
If you are considering some over the counter removal options for perianal skin tags and warts,  very few options will be open for consideration.
Well, someone may suggest a remedy such as tea tree oil. In any case, it works perfectly on white spots on toenails or even warts on hands. These are hardy body parts however. It is not the same with the anal area.
For a penis skin tag or one on the anus, the best over the counter removal product is a TagBand device or a dental floss. You can also try a freezing kit for sole and small skin tags.
In the case of perianal warts, freezing at home will work, but only for very small warts. You can use such a method when the warts are identified in very early stages.
Other than that, just have a doctor treat them or wait for them to go away naturally. The important thing to remember is that they are very contagious, both to other people and to other genital areas.
Prevention information for perianal skin tags and warts
For skin tags, avoid habits that will encourage rubbing against the anal area. Avoid wearing tight clothes and thongs for example. You can review the causes identified above again to know what to avoid.
[RELATED]
In the case of warts, they will keep coming back even after treatment. Since the body naturally fights active HPV, measures to improve the immune system like healthy lifestyles and not smoking will help. Sex is the main way in which warts are spread. You may want to avoid that or take the necessary safety measures. The problem with warts is that they can be contracted after skin to skin contact even when sexual intimacy is not involved.
Also, it can help to get tested for warts or any related condition. In this case, a doctor may prescribe some medications that work by containing the causal organism.

[post_content] => Half an hour is usually enough for a doctor to get rid of a sickening skin tag that has been troubling you. A bit longer may be needed for a mole or for warts, especially ones occurring on the genitals and such areas. However, it is a guarantee that you will not leave a dermatologist’s clinic with a skin growth you went to get surgically removed.
But who is willing to keep going back to clinics even for small skin tags and removing moles that can be treated at home?
What is a skin tag, mole or wart removal kit?
A remover kit generally refers to a combination of tools or remedies meant to treat a certain skin growth or condition at home. They can be bought over the counter or made at home.
Buying a remover kit is a better option. This is because top reviewed kits have been tested and will almost certainly work. The problem is that you may still be needed to see a doctor for large or infected skin conditions or for ones on eyes and genitals. Removal kits are only recommendable for skin tags under arms, moles on the hand and things along these lines.
[RELATED]
But before buying, some information on the best one to use and when to use it is of importance. This is to ensure that you don’t waste your money or end up worsening the condition.
Reviews for best skin tag removal kit
Perhaps the best way to get rid of skin tags at home is to ligate them. This involves tying them at the base with a thread. The process is however somehow cumbersome and can become painful. To avoid all that, a TagBand device is a much better option. A top reviewed TagBand device should definitely be among your top options.
Freezing is another way that skin tags can be removed at home. Although the available remover kits that work by freezing the tags are not as effective as clinical cryotherapy, they can be effective for small skin tags. Bearing in mind that skin tag removal cost depends on the number of tags removed, freezing the small ones that will respond is a cost saving move.
Finally, a remover kit may be based on creams or ointments that contain acid as the major ingredient. Natural removal kits use Thuja Occidentalis as the main ingredient. Salicylic acid works by digesting the skin growths to be removed. When considering such a remover kit, you definitely need to check reviews provided by users. Many of these kits, unfortunately, do not prove to be effective.
How a wart removal kit works according to reviews
According to reviews, a wart removal kit should work by killing the outer layers of the wart. With time, the wart will stop any further growth and ultimately die off.
For warts, removal kits that require application of an ointment or a cream on the warts are most commonly used. They will always come with full instructions and even photos to guide you on how to use them for best results.
[RELATED]
As you may learn at some point in this process, warts can prove hard to get rid of. It is for this reason that patience and a lot of research will be needed before buying a wart remover kit. A good place to get genuine reviews by other users is on chat forums or on official websites for retailers like Amazon.com.
The other option you may find helpful is the use of a freezing kit. Freezing is supposed to deprive the wart off oxygenated blood. With time, a frozen wart will fall off the skin. This is a better plantar wart removal method than creams and ointments.
When to use a wart removal kit product
For common, flat and plantar warts, removal kits can be used. In fact, you can make your own and use it on them.
When it comes to genital and warts around the eyes, caution should be taken when using removal kits. In fact, only use freezing kits in such cases.
Large warts will rarely respond to remover products. They are also very contagious. In such case, surgery or laser therapy will be needed. Consult a doctor if remover kits are not effective enough.
Which is the Best Mole removal kit product?
Unlike skin conditions such as skin fungus, moles are not contagious. They however have been observed to be more common in those who are genetically predisposed towards them.
When it comes to buying a mole removal kit that will work, the best approach is to go with products containing 17% of salicylic acid.
[RELATED]
Compound W Freeze and Mole & Wart vanish are good places to start with. There are of course many other related removal kits. But as we have seen, most will not work as well as you would expect. Always remember, reviews from other users and details provided on forums will help a great deal.
Caution should be taken when treating moles with remover kits. Although only about 1 in 100 moles will show signs of cancer, taking chances is unnecessary. Learn all the signs of malignant moles and consult a doctor when the signs are observed.
How to make a skin tag, mole and wart remover kit
You can easily make a removal kit at home with the following remedies:
Tea tree oil – mild but effective. Can also be used for a cold sore on the lip.
Duct tape
Apple cider vinegar
Castor oil + baking soda
Aloe Vera
Such a removal kit will be effective on small skin tags, tiny moles and warts that have just formed. Like all the other removal products mentioned so far, ones made at home should not be used on sensitive areas. This includes removing benign genital white spots and the like.

[post_content] => Warts disappear on their own after the intervention of immune system. It is estimated that 1 in 5 warts will be gone in 6 months while only 3 in 10 warts will persist after 2 years.
Common warts usually appear as flesh-colored or pink raised lumps. Some are white. To differentiate them, look for firm, rough and small parts of the skin that are elevated. They often appear on fingers and hands. Common warts are very common indeed. The chances of developing them at one point in life are set at 75%.
Most people, however, don't find them appealing and will go for a treatment option. Luckily, there are many options you can choose from in relation to wart treatment.
How to get rid of common warts on hands with a duct tape
Duct tape is an often-used option for how to get rid of common warts on the hands, especially on a finger. The first thing you will need to do is purchase the duct tape itself. This can be done locally over the counter.
[RELATED]
Next, identify the size of the wart you want to remove and measure a duct tape piece that will cover it completely. Before applying it, ensure that the affected part is cleaned and well dried with a wash cloth dedicated to that purpose only. In fact, replace the wash cloth the next time you need to use it. Apply the duct tape on the wart and wait for 6 days, a period after which you will repeat the process.
Using duct tape for common wart treatment on a finger, on the leg and basically any other body part will work best when used with salicylic acid, as discussed below.
Common wart treatment and removal
Salicylic acid and duct tape are perhaps the most effective common wart removal methods that will always work. For best results, the two should be used at the same time.
First, soak the affected area in warm water for about 5 minutes. This helps soften the warts so that the salicylic acid can seep into the skin.
Gently rub the wart with a pumice stone to get rid of the surface dead skin
Apply the salicylic acid directly to the entire wart
Cover the wart with duct tape and leave it for 6 days
When this period is over, remove the duct tape, soak the wart in warm water and repeat the pumice stone procedure. It is advisable that you use a new pumice stone or disinfect the current one you are using. Otherwise, you will keep the wart-causing virus in cycle.
Keep repeating the process until nothing of the wart remains. This procedure can take up to 2 months to completely get rid of the wart. It is however very effective and will leave only a minor a scar.
Common wart removal on legs and on hands
Warts occurring on less sensitive parts like on fingers, on feet and on hands can be removed with over the counter gels, patches, ointments and pads. This is because most people are flexible enough to wait for these products to work, bearing in mind that such body parts are less likely to draw attention.
Over the counter common wart removal products such as Compound W or Duofilm can take some time to get rid of common wart but are effective in the end.
Most of them make use of salicylic acid. When applied, the acid will keep corroding the wart gradually. Eventually, you will barely notice the bump that used to be there. Again, you will be required to keep using a pumice stone to get rid of the dead skin layers of the wart. This method will require patience.

However, neither clinical treatments nor over the counter options will work on their own. In fact, a doctor may advise you to keep using over the counter common wart treatment methods while still going for clinical appointments.
Keep comparing before and after images or pictures to know if a common wart removal option you are using is working. If not, you can always approach your doctor for further guidance.
How to get rid of common warts; clinical treatment
Since some warts do not respond to over the counter treatments, you may want to visit a clinic to have them removed by a doctor. Any of the following procedures can be options on how to get rid of common warts in a clinic:
Use of liquid nitrogen to freeze the warts. In liquid form, nitrogen is a very cold substance that kills the blood vessels inside the warts. Lack of nutrients leads to the warts falling off after some time. This method may require several appointments to work effectively.
Laser treatment therapies that see the warts poisoned with carbon dioxide
Minor surgeries that will have a doctor cut off the warts with a scalpel. This is not common, since warts may still recur. Cutting off skin tags is a better option, since skin tags are not caused by a virus, unlike warts.
The warts can also be removed with an electrically operated needle.
Some acids including salicylic acid can be applied directly to the warts to break them down layer by layer.
Injections with an antiviral medicine can also be used when other treatments have failed. Antiviral medications will kill the virus responsible for occurrence of the warts, especially severe vaginal herpes. This method may not be used during pregnancy.
To ‘boost’ the immune system, an antigen can be injected into the body. This arouses disease fighting body cells and in the process promotes self-heal from warts. It is not often done in people with weak immunity, diabetes or during pregnancy.
Common wart treatment with a home remedy
Common warts on the feet or even on sensitive areas such as the genitals can be removed with a home remedy. Although it can be hard to tell whether the home remedy you are using indeed removed the warts or they just ended up healing naturally, before and after pictures can still help you keep track of the improvement.
Any home remedy from this list can be used for common wart treatment. In fact you can use a combination of them to hasten the healing process.
Castor oil and baking soda
Tea tree oil - it can also be used to remove a skin tag on the nipple
Pineapple juice
Garlic
Apple cider vinegar – it has antiviral properties which may get rid of the HPV virus causing warts. Herpes on the finger or other less sensitive parts can be treated with this home remedy. Caution should be taken since strong solutions can cause corrosion to the skin.
Banana peel
Vitamin E and C pastes
Honey
Bee propolis
Aloe Vera - aloe Vera is also very defective in curing skin infections. A ringworm cream containing this product for instance will almost certainly work effectively.
Paste made from aspirin
How to get rid of common warts; understanding the causes
Sometimes, vaguely understanding a disease is the main cause of spread and severe infections. Common warts are caused by a virus. The virus can be spread from one person to another and from one part of the body to another.
[RELATED]
One of the ways in which the spread can be avoided is by getting treatment when the symptoms arise. Another way is by maintaining personal hygiene such as not sharing foot wear and underwear or other inner clothing. In fact, the chances of getting a wart on foot by wearing another infected person’s shoes are more than 70%.
If you have any reason to suspect of having contracted common warts or are experiencing the symptoms, the best thing is to visit a clinic and have a doctor run a diagnosis. You can also take pictures and images of the affected skin part and send them to an online doctor.

[post_content] => It is likely that you will get plantar warts at least once in your life time. These are a type of warts that appear on the feet. They are related to another type of warts known as palmer warts, which appear on the hands.
HPV virus is the virus behind occurrence of warts. However, the particular type of HPV virus that causes genital warts is different from the one responsible for plantar warts.
Calluses are easily taken for plantar warts and vice versa. They are not the same however. Although warts are contagious, they are not spread through wart seeds as some people would have it. The black dots that develop on warts are actually tiny vessels of blood. Due to pressure applied on them when walking, plantar warts are bound to acquire a flattened appearance. You are advised to see a doctor if you have doubts about which type of skin lesion you are dealing with.
What causes plantar warts and their symptoms?
What causes plantar warts? Three main strains of the human papillomavirus are known to cause this type of warts. They are spread after bare skin comes into contact with an infected area. Naturally, the body’s immune system will fight off the virus and prevent it from developing any further. In cases that this fails, the warts will develop.
So far, a vaccine against plantar warts has not been developed, unlike the case with genital warts. They can however be treated in a clinic or at home with particular home remedies.
[RELATED]
Children below the age of 16 years and above the age of 12 years are most affected. They also can occur in older people but not frequently. Predisposing factors include:
Weak immunity – The immune system is supposed to fight off any invasion by HPV virus. In children with weakened immunity resulting from one reason or another, the chances of getting infected with plantar warts are heightened.
Communal places– If an infected child for example touches a certain area in a playground or in a shared shower, they are bound to spread the virus to other children who have skin contact with the infected areas.
Skin traumas – Injuries on the skin caused by certain illnesses, cuts and other forms of injuries will act as entry points for the HPV virus.
Symptoms
Painful thickened areas on the foot
Tight lesions with black spots
Smooth parts of the foot that may be yellow, brown or grayish in color
Crowded firm lesions which are known as mosaic warts
Plantar warts prefer parts of the feet where most pressure in usually exerted. For this reason, they tend to be flat in shape due to constant pressure applied on them when walking.
Home remedies for plantar warts removal
Plantar wart home remedy removal options are numerous. You can choose any one of them depending on the mildness of the wart or the availability of the needed equipment. It is good to note that warts will almost certainly go away on their own. The problem is that this may even take up to months or years. Although they are harmless and non-cancerous, warts can be discomforting and bring about self-confidence issues. Here are the available plantar wart home remedy removal options:
OTC treatment kits
There are a couple of OTC kits that you can use to get rid of plantar warts at home. They work best for small warts which may not have turned black. Most of them make use of a type of acid known as salicylic acid. Depending on the kit, lactic acid can also be included.
Compound W is a good example. Others include Wart-Off and Freezone. The basic idea is to get rid of the outer part of the wart (keratin). This will continuously wear off the whole wart.
Ensure that the specific guidelines provided on how to use the particular wart removal kit that you have chosen are followed. Additionally, you are not recommended to use salicylic acid in infants for a prolonged duration of time.
Home surgery
Surgery is best done in a clinic. However, you can do a minor one at home. The outer part of a wart is usually not painful. Therefore, you can cut it with a sharp blade and apply a bandage on it.
[RELATED]
Apple cider vinegar
Apple cider vinegar is a popular home remedy for warts and skin tag removal. It is advisable that you use it with an essential oil such as coconut oil.
It works by burning the wart off layer by layer. It is important to note that apple cider vinegar will have the same burning effect on healthy bare skin. If you are to use it, ensure that it has been applied only on the wart to be removed. You can get more information on how to remove a wart with apple cider vinegar online.
Banana peel
Ripe banana peels are perhaps the most effective yet inexpensive plantar warts removal home remedies. All it requires is a small portion of ripe banana peel to be placed on top of the wart. If you have access to tea tree oil, apply it to the peel to avoid contamination.
Don’t use green banana peels. In fact, bananas which have ripened to the extent of being brown are best.
Super glue
Some people are flexible enough to use super glue for wart removal. I do not recommend this option however. The idea behind it is that super glue will peel a wart gradually and leave no scar afterwards.
Urine
Yes, you heard that right. It is said that urine can actually treat plantar warts. The science behind it is simple. Urine is acidic in nature. If it is to be applied constantly on a wart, the same will peel off layer by layer.
Duct tape
Duct tape is a common plantar warts home remedy. You can buy it in a local health store. Just cover the wart with for about a week. After that, remove the tape and soak the feet in water for about 20 minutes. Using a pumice stone, debride the wart a couple of times per day, until the wart is completely gone.
Clinical plantar wart treatment and surgery
With warts occurring in clusters (mosaic warts); the best approach is to have them treated by a doctor. Plantar wart treatment in a clinic can be done through the following options:
Freezing
Commonly referred to as cryotherapy, this form of plantar wart treatment method involves freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen. The method can be uncomfortable and in some cases painful. Your doctor will take you through the process and administer an anesthesia if necessary.
Surgical removal
A minor surgery can be performed on the wart to remove it completely. An electric needle will be used for the surgery. It is not a common plantar wart removal procedure and is usually painful. It also is likely to cause scarring. Again, you will have your doctor talk you through the procedure, to address any concerns you might have.
[RELATED]
Acid removal
Salicylic acid is most commonly used for plantar wart removal. The acid works by peeling off the layers of the wart gradually. It can also stimulate the body’s immune system to fight off the HPV virus responsible for plantar warts.
Your doctor may choose a different type of acid for plantar wart removal. It is important that you specifically get prescribed for and treated by a doctor. Use of acid for warts removal causes burning effect and can also burn other parts of the body not intended.
Laser removal
In this plantar wart treatment method, a pulsed dye is used to kill the tiny blood vessels that cluster and may have turned black in a wart. It will require you to visit a clinic several times to get the whole wart cleared. Additionally, this treatment method is painful and can leave a scar on the treated part of the skin.
Oral medications
There are no specific oral tablets of any other form of medication that can specifically be used as a medicine to cure plantar warts. However, oral medicine can be taken to boost immunity. The medicine can also be injected or applied externally on the infected part.
Vaccines
Genital and anal warts are commonly prevented against through HPV vaccines. For plantar warts, vaccines are not effective hence not commonly used for plantar wart treatment.
Which is the best way to get rid of plantar warts?
Now that we have discussed the various options there are on how to get rid of plantar warts, which one of them is the best?
Well, it will always depend on the situation and individual circumstances to decide what will work best for you. For example, small warts can be removed with home remedies effectively enough. In fact, you can leave them be if they are not causing discomfort or pain.
For persistent/clustered warts and ones with painful black dots, it will be for the best if they get treated in a hospital. The problem is that most of the available clinical warts removal methods are bound to cause scarring.
[RELATED]
In case you or your child has a wart and requires removal services, visit a clinic and you will be advised on how to get rid of it. This is helpful if you are to open to or not familiar with the use of home remedies. For bleeding warts, red/swollen ones and large indistinguishable warts, avoid home remedies and treatment. This also includes warts that persist or reappear even after treatment.
Generally, burning and freezing off warts are the best way to remove warts. All the same, it will depend on your preferences and what your doctor advises.
Plantar warts removal at home through prevention
Here are some of the ways you can get rid of plantar warts through prevention. They include:
Avoid damp feet
Maintain feet hygiene, especially by changing socks daily and washing your legs
Avoid walking barefooted especially in shared/public showers
Ensure to check your children for any symptoms of plantar warts
Avoid shared shoes and socks
Cover injured parts of the feet. This may apply but not necessarily to injuries caused by open razor bumps.
Get professional advice on skin growths and lesions that won’t go away or keep increasing in size.
Final thoughts
Plantar and warts in general are not of any health risk especially in regards to cancer. In fact, most of them will go away on their own.
It is easy to get rid of plantar warts, both with home remedies or in a clinic. The most important thing is to weigh your options and go forward with the best option open for you.

[post_content] => Warts on the genital region and skin tags are among the most common skin conditions today. It is unlikely that you will go your whole life without experiencing a single one of them.
There quite a number of differences that can be identified when comparing these conditions. This should not fool you however. In fact, most untrained persons can't successfully tell one from the other.
Before we get down to examining the most common differences, it is important to point out that pictures and images are a great tool that can help you tell one from the other.
What is the difference between genital warts and skin tags?
The main difference between genital warts and skin tags revolves around the cause and appearance. All warts are caused by HPV virus. This is not the same virus that causes herpes on the penis and genitals. Skin tags, on the other hand, arise when two body parts are in contact with one another and produce friction. This includes friction felt during sexual intercourse. It is a main cause of skin tags on the genitals. Any factor that will contribute to these causes will definitely result in either warts or skin tags.
[RELATED]
When it comes to appearance, skin tags are more like projections which are connected to the skin by a skinny stalk. This stalk can be easily cut with a razor or a pair of scissors. They take the color of the skin. Warts on the other hand are not projections but skin growths. Their mass is evenly distributed. While some may appear a bit raised, most are flattened on the part of skin they occur. Upon touch, they feel very soft and fleshly. Warts too are skin-colored.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; what causes them
Sexual intercourse is the main mode of transmission when it comes to genital warts. An infected person can pass the virus even when they don't show the symptoms. Since it is a viral infection, wart removal can only be done to get rid of the symptoms, namely the the skin growths, but not the virus. In fact, recurrent attacks will continue to occur throughout one’s life.
Skin tags are not typical infections. They in fact will not cause swollen lymph nodes or even pain unless physically injured. When frequent friction is sustained on a part of the body such as the buttocks, inner thighs, under arm and such, a projection will form. It can continue getting bigger with time.
Difference between genital warts and skin tags; identifying them in pictures
If you are to take close-up pictures, genital warts will resemble cauliflowers and should not be confused with genital pimples. Areas around the anus, on the penis shaft, vaginal walls, vulva and penis tip are the most probable areas to find them.
[RELATED]
Although they may occur on the cervix, chances are high that they will then spread to the outside of the vagina.
Skin tags are unpredictable in regards to where they will occur. In pictures, they should resemble a literal skin-colored tag.
How to treat skin tags and genital warts
While some treatment methods can be used for both, genital warts may need medically prescribed medications to fight the virus.
Treatments for genital warts aim to inhibit the spread of the causal virus and at the same time get rid of the skin growths themselves.
Skin tags treatment methods only aim to get rid of the growths and not the cause. In both cases, clinical treatment may be necessary where home remedies have failed to work.
[RELATED]
Remedies such as tea tree oil can be tried on both. They are effective especially for skin tags on the face and other sensitive areas. There also are over the counter removal kits which can be used for the same removal purpose.
Are skin tags and genital warts contagious?
Skin tags do not pass from one person to another. They also do not spread to other body parts courtesy of an initial infection.
Genital warts are, on the other hand, very contagious. They can spread to other people or to other body parts. Just like with herpes, the virus takes advantage of open sores or cracks on the skin for entry points. It is for this reason that it is possible to contract herpes on the leg and other unlikely parts such as the shoulders.
