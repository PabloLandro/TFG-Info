Vaccines and Pregnancy: The Criminal Conspiracy to Create Autism
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D, CTTH The CDC has been given an annual budget of over $11 billion dollars to spend (R), which is provided under the auspices of protecting the American public from various health care threats, but are they really doing that? There’s plenty of incriminating data available to prove that they’re doing just the opposite of that. Consider the following facts: 1) Executives within the CDC, including Dr. Frank DeStefano, are alleged to have cooked research data in order to conceal a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in black children, according to Dr. William Thompson, who has been given whistleblower protection status for bringing this fact to light. The study in question was published in 2004 in the Journal of Pediatrics, and has not been retracted despite the admission by Dr. Thompson that the paper is fraudulent. This is highly important since many pro-vaccination pediatricians will point to this study as “proof” that the MMR vaccine doesn’t cause autism, and is therefore “safe and...

Inflammatory Disease Epidemic: The Convergence Point of EMF, GMOs, and Vaccines.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D, CTTH The US spends more per capita on healthcare than any other nation on the planet(R), at over $1 Trillion/year with costs growing. Over 3/4 of those costs are related to the treatment of chronic disease, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, diabetes, alzheimers, autism, cadiovascular disease, etc.(R) The rates of all such diseases are growing, not decreasing, so obviously the true causes of these problems aren’t being addressed. If you were to try and describe virtually all forms of degenerative disease with just one word, that word would be “inflammation”. (R) The research is very clear about this fact. When examining the prime factors behind the surge in inflammatory issues there are principally 3 things that stand out as different about today versus 25 years ago. Those 3 things are the widespread consumption of RoundUp laden genetically modified food and wheat (R)(R), wireless technology (R), and a surge in the number of vaccines given relative to years past (R). The biological effects of...

VERY IMPORTANT! Yet another research scientist comes forward describing the links between vaccines and chronic illness, including autism.
Around August 2014, information came out revealing that a whistleblower had proof that the CDC was actively cooking data to conceal the link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This ongoing story continues to be one of the most censored and important health stories today. I originally reported on this subject here. Now, we have another whistleblower on the scene. Dr Judy Mikovits, PhD is a Biochemist, cellular and molecular biologist with over 30 years of scientific expertise. She has directed programs on HIV, cancer, epigenetics, and neuroimmune disease, with a focus on development of novel drug and diagnostic technologies. Dr. Mikovits holds a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from George Washington University. Her dissertation was on HIV latency and mechanisms of immune activation in monocytes. Dr. Mikovits was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Molecular Virology at the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, National Cancer Institute under Dr. David Derse. Over the past 26 years, she has published 51 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, and worked as a government scientist...

Mandatory Vaccines for Californians: A Prelude To Mandatory Vaccines for ALL Americans
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D., CTTH Those who value freedom of choice and the right of self determination were dealt a major setback in California recently with the passage SB277, which awaits Governor Jerry Brown’s signature for passage. Governor Brown is expected to sign it, despite heavy opposition. SB 277 is a law that removes personal and religious exemptions from those who wish to avoid vaccinations for their children enrolled in public schools. Only MD’s may provide exemptions, and the list for who shall receive said exemptions is very limited. Proponents of the bill argue that parents will still be able to choose not to vaccinate their children, they’ll just have to homeschool or send them to private schools. Tax rebates for those who won’t be using the government services (public schools) will not be issued. How many low income families can afford not to have both parents work, or can afford to send their children to private schools? Obviously, this affects the lower income population more so than...

200 Evidence-Based Reasons NOT To Vaccinate – FREE Research PDF Download!
Quick Download Link Here. The media, your pediatrician, politicians and health authorities like the CDC and FDA claim that vaccines are safe and effective. So why do hundreds of peer-reviewed studies indicate the opposite is true? Read, download, and share this document widely to provide the necessary evidence-based counterbalance to the pro-vaccination propaganda that has globally infected popular consciousness and discussion like an intractable disease. It is abundantly clear that if the present-day vaccine climate, namely, that everyone must comply with the CDC’s one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule or be labeled a health risk to society at large, is to succumb to open and balanced discussion, it is the peer-reviewed biomedical evidence itself that is going to pave the way towards making rational debate on the subject happen. With this aim in mind, GreenMedInfo.com has painstakingly collected over 300 pages of study abstracts culled directly from the National Library of Medicine’s pubmed.gov bibliographic database on the wide-ranging adverse health effects linked to vaccines in the today’s schedule (over 200 distinct adverse...

Measles Hysteria: How the Government Seeks Ownership of Your Children
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. “Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship to restrict the art of healing to one class of Men and deny equal privileges to others; the Constitution of the Republic should make a Special privilege for medical freedoms as well as religious freedom.” -Benjamin Rush, MD, Founding Father of America At the time of this writing there have been 100 cases of measles reported by the CDC, affecting primarily the VACCINATED population. As of January 24th, 2015 it was reported that 52 out of 80 measles outbreak cases had been vaccinated with the measles vaccine. While there is clear evidence that some of the measles virus infections are from the vaccine itself, there is still no word yet from “officialdom” on the full extent of vaccine transmitted measles virus infections from this outbreak. In a more sane world, one would expect that a careful analysis of what strain of measles virus is...

Synergistic Destruction: How Vaccines and GMOs Converge to Fuel Autism and Neurodegenerative Conditions
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. There is a lot of debate as to what is the cause, or better yet, causes of autism. This post isn’t intended to cover all of the variables which fuel autism. It is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of chief mechanisms related to how consumption of Monsanto’s RoundUp, by way of consuming genetically modified corn, soy, canola oil, sugar beets, or any other “RoundUp ready” crop, as well as vaccines may fuel microglial activation, a leading factor in all neurodegenerative conditions, including autism (1)(2)(3), Alzheimer’s(4)(5), ALS(6)(7), Parkinson’s(8)(9), non-situational depression(10)(11), and virtually all forms of chronic illness. While this post is more directed towards the discussion of autism, the reality is that all of the factors that I discuss below are unquestionably major factors of consideration in all neurodegenerative conditions. What is microglial activation? In short, the microglia are the resident immune cells within the central nervous system. They are known to exist in two different states, and while in the “surveillance...

Study Shows Vaccines Increase the Rate of Death in Infancy
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. The prime argument that proponents of vaccination use it that mass vaccination prevents disease, and those who oppose vaccination are often portrayed as “unscientific” and, even worse, “unfit” to be parents by the mainstream media. Despite the many requests over the years for the CDC to perform a large scale study comparing the health status of the non-vaccinated against the vaccinated, the CDC has refused to do so. My personal belief is that they won’t do it, because they know what the results would be, and that is, the unvaccinated would be shown to have far less chronic illness than the vaccinated. Smaller studies (1), which are conveniently ignored by the mainstream media, support the notion that the unvaccinated population is a healthier population. Full exposure of this information, which would come from a large scale CDC study, would have a crushing blow on the vaccination industry. It would be a landmark study which helped shape the entire health care field, there’s...

The debate is over: The MMR vaccine can cause Autism, and the CDC is engaged in a criminal conspiracy to cover up this fact.
By: Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. For years, proponents of vaccines have claimed that there was no evidence showing a direct link between vaccines and autism, despite the mountain of evidence which contradicted their claims.(1) The proponents of vaccines would cite studies published in the Journal of Pediatrics which appeared to refute any link between vaccines and autism, and even more vociferously deny any link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, ultimately ruining the career of Dr. Andrew Wakefield over his findings of a link between autism and MMR in a very heavy media smear campaign. Well, we now have proof that the chief authors of the 2004 study, including executives within the CDC, which alleged no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, conspired to cook the data, in order to deny the link. How do we know that? One of the authors, Dr. William Thompson, of the Journal of Pediatrics 2004 research paper which alleged no link between MMR and autism has come forward and...

Why isn’t the mainstream media reporting the revelations of this major governmental whistleblower?
“The lack of major news media coverage of possibly the biggest government whistleblower revelation since disclosure of the Tuskegee Experiment in 1972 [InfoPlease.com] suggests more than fraud at the highest levels of the Centers For Disease Control (CDC) as well as major vaccine makers, it suggests the nation’s news agencies are complicit in portraying a government view that there is no link between vaccination and the unexplained rise of autism. Only alternative news sources are covering the story so far which broke on August 8 when a Brian S Hooker, a Simpson University researcher published a report in the journal Translational Neurodegeneration that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine was shown to increase the risk for autism 3.4 times among young black boys. Dr. Hooker suggests the vulnerability of young African American boys to autism from vaccinations may result from their low vitamin D levels given their dark skin pigmentation. The prevalence of autism in African Americans is nearly 25% higher than that of whites.” Read more...

Why Polio Like Outbreak In Southern California Is Destined To Be Common, and Why the Medical Establishment and Government Are Destined to Make the Problem Worse
02/24/14 By: Dr. Buckley The mainstream media is reporting an outbreak of a “polio like” illness in Southern California, which has reportedly affected up to 25 children over the last year. “A mysterious illness doctors are comparing to polio has struck down up to 25 children in California over the past year, leaving them with paralyzed limbs and a bad prognosis. The children, aged between two and 16, all suffered paralysis of the arms or legs and some experienced respiratory difficulties. ‘What’s we’re seeing now is bad. The best case scenario is complete loss of one limb, the worst is all four limbs, with respiratory insufficiency as well. It’s like the old polio,’ Keith Van Haren, a pediatric neurologist at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto, California, told USA Today.” It sounds scary, I know, but it’s time for you to get “street wise” to the deception about what’s the real driving force behind what is sure to be more “outbreaks” going forward. You’ll notice that a couple...

CDC Forced To Release Documents Showing They Knew Vaccine Preservative Causes Autism
By Dave Mihalovic Feb 23, 2014 PhD Scientist and Biochemist Reveals Hidden CDC Documents Showing Thimerosal In Vaccines Increase Neurologic Disorders The CDC has been shunning the correlations between thimerosal and neurological disorders for a very long time. Although the FDA gave a two year deadline to remove the mercury based preservative from vaccines after the neurotoxin was banned in 1999, it still remains to this day in 60 percent of flu vaccines. A vaccine industry watchdog has now obtained CDC documents that show statistically significant risks of autism associated with the vaccine preservative, something the CDC denies even when confronted with their own data. For nearly ten years, Brian Hooker has been requesting documents that are kept under tight wraps by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His more than 100 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have resulted in copious evidence that the vaccine preservative Thimerosal, which is still used in the flu shot that is administered to pregnant women and infants, can...

Mumps Outbreak Amongst Those Vaccinated Against Mumps At Fordham University
(Dr. Buckley’s note: If this would have occurred against the unvaccinated, it would have been national news. Outbreaks among the vaccinated occur far more frequently than you are led to believe by the mainstream media.) Friday, February 21, 2014 NEW YORK (WABC) — The outbreak of the mumps at Fordham University has spread from one campus to another. There are now 13 reported cases, 12 at the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx and one at the Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan. The symptoms are similar to the flu, but the virus can also cause painful swelling. All of the infected patients had the mumps vaccine, but doctors say it’s not 100 percent effective. Infected students have been either isolated or sent home. – UHS saw 1 case in January, 4 cases on Feb. 18; 3 cases on Feb. 19 and 5 cases on Feb. 20. – All the students with suspected mumps infections have either returned home or have been isolated from other residents during the infectious phase...

Well-Child Visits to Pediatricians Linked to Increased Flu – Like Illness, Large Study Reports.
Date: February 12, 2014 New research shows that well-child doctor appointments for annual exams and vaccinations are associated with an increased risk of flu-like illnesses in children and family members within two weeks of the visit. This risk translates to more than 700,000 potentially avoidable illnesses each year, costing more than $490 million annually. The study was published in the March issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. “Well child visits are critically important. However, our results demonstrate that healthcare professionals should devote more attention to reducing the risk of spreading infections in waiting rooms and clinics. Infection control guidelines currently exist. To increase patient safety in outpatient settings, more attention should be paid to these guidelines by healthcare professionals, patients, and their families,” said Phil Polgreen, MD, MPH, lead author of the study.
