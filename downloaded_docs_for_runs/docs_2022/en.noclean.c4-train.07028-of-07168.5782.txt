Why You Should Start Drinking Your Own Urine
From the title of this post I know you're thinking how disgusting it would be to drink your own urine. You might also be thinking "Is there any good reason for drinking urine?" Advocates of drinking urine claims it is beneficial to one's health and it is a miraculous elixir while for most other people, it is bodily waste that should strictly confined to the toilet bowl.The question now should be if it is actually safe to drink urine. From my study of microbiology in the university, urine secreted from the kidney is sterile if the kidney is not infected. Uncontaminated bladder urine is also normally sterile. However, the urethra contains normal harmless bacteria, hence normal voided urine contain small amount of bacteria.

Drinking urine for medicinal purposes can be traced to societies in ancient Egypt, China, Hindu and Aztec histories. Many believe that Proverbs 5:15 "Drink water from your cistern, and running water from your own well" (King James) is evident that urine was used in Bible times. Wrong! The Hebrew word bohr, translated as cistern means waterpit. It was an artificial underground cavity usually used for storage of water. They were to dug down to tap natural underground water, and are usually designed to catch and retain rainfall or run off from springs.
I do hear of urine therapy. Using urine to treat ailment. That is using your own urine internally or externally as a way to aid or sustain your heath. This may involves drinking, injecting, massaging with-, and/or bathing in- urine. It is an ancient practice that is used today, not only in times of sickness, but also in times of good health for preventive health maintenance. It has been claimed to have proven helpful in a great number of varying illnesses, ranging from a simple cold and a throat-ache, to tuberculosis and asthma, from minor skin problems such as itching to major skin problems such as eczema, psoriasis and even skin cancer.
There have been reports of individual who have use their own urine to sustain their health.
Sylvia Chandler, 63, mother of two, claims drinking a pint of her own urine every day for the last 20 years has kept her fit and sprightly. She swears in Closer that her own wee is the elixir responsible for her slim frame and youthful demeanor, and claims she hasn't needed to visit a doctor in over a decade.
UK Couple Drinks Own Pee To Treat Depression, Brighten Eyes, And Clear Skin. Couple Bex Long and John Dixon did the unimaginable on UK television show ITV. They drank their own urine. The couple believes that drinking their own urine has a myriad of health benefits, none of which have been scientifically proven. And they decided to prove what they say is true by downing a champagne flute of their own pee live on the air. The couples believes the liquid waste cures depression, and also clears their skin, brightens their eyes, and aids in the healing of cuts and burns.
During the NBC Nightly News on October 16, 1992, Tom Brokaw reported that, "In Egypt, rescue workers found a 37-year old man alive in earthquake rubble. He survived almost 82 hours by drinking his own urine. His wife, daughter and mother would not and they died."
British hiker Paul Beck was stranded in the Spanish mountains for six days - and survived by drinking his own urine. The 33-year-old slipped and dislocated his hip while walking. As he waited for rescuers to find him, he tried to exist on powdered chocolate and raw oats, but eventually resorted to urinating into a cup and drinking a few drops a day. He said:"It was pretty awful but in all I did it around five times to keep myself hydrated."
Yachtsmen Mark Smith and Steven Freeman spent 11 days stranded in the South China Sea after their boat capsized and put their survival down to urine.
These examples are few of the many people who so say have benefited health-wise from urine intake.
Scientists says "urine is just a byproduct of the filtering of blood. It's not just excess water. When blood cells, filled with oxygen and nutrients go through the liver, the poisons and toxins get pulled out and are eliminated with a bowel movement. This filtered and cleaned blood go to the kidneys where excess nutrients get taken out of the body. Plasma ultra filtrate (Urea) contains perfect ratios of nutrients, urea, enzymes, hormones, vitamins, antibodies and minerals.
