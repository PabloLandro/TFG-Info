Are "16 of 27 Ingredients in Tide Pods Also in Pediatric Vaccines"? You Decide
I recently ran across this claim in a mom's group:
I decided to fact-check this claim. I went to Tide's ingredient page for Tide Pods, and the Vaccine Excipient and Media Summary. Here's the visual summary.
(click to embiggen).
Here it is in text form, with a bit of additional text. The little syringe glyph is the original author's way of signifying her claim that the chemical is in vaccines.
water. ( 💉 ) -- in Tide Pods, only in one pediatric vaccine (Rotarix)
alcoholethoxy sulfate -- In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
linear alkylbenzene sulfonate -- In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
propylene glycol ( 💉 ) -- In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
citric acid ( 💉) NOT in Tide Pods, NOT in pediatric vaccines. Citric acid is an ingredient in the BCG vaccine (not routinely given to children in the US) and citric acid monohydrate is in a flu vaccine, Fluad, approved for use in those over 65.
sodium hydroxide ( 💉) NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods. IS an ingredient in the rotavirus vaccine RotaTeq, used to balance pH. See https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/toxic-myths-about-vaccines/
borax ( 💉) NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods, and IS NOT an ingredient in vaccines.
ethanolamine ( 💉) NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods (monoethanolamine citrate is) NOT an ingredient in vaccines.
ethanol ( 💉) is NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods. It is NOT and ingredient in vaccines.
alcohol sulfate ( 💉) is NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods. It is NOT an ingredient in any vaccine.
polyethyleneimine ethoxylate ( 💉) in Tide Pods. It is NOT an ingredient in any vaccine.
sodium fatty acids ( 💉) are NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods. One or more fatty acid salts are (see list below):. NONE are ingredients in any vaccine.
Idiquaternium ethoxysulfate NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
protease ( 💉) In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines .
diethylene glycol; NOT an ingredient in Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
Laureth 9 NOT in Tide Pods. NOT in vaccines.
alkyldimethylamine oxide NOT in Tide Pods. NOT in vaccines.
fragrance is an ingredient in Tide Pods. It is NOT an ingredient in vaccines.
amylase ( 💉) IS in Tide Pods. It is NOT an ingredient in vaccines.
disodium diaminostilbene disulfonate IS in Tide Pods. It is NOT in vaccines.
DTPA ( 💉) NOT in Tide Pods. NOT in vaccines.
sodium formate ( 💉) In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
calcium formate ( 💉) In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
polyethylene glycol 4000 ( 💉) In Tide Pods, NOT in vaccines
mannanse is not an ingredient in Tide Pods. mannanase, an enzyme, is. NOT an ingredient in vaccines
liquid blue. ( while not this color. Yellow # 5 and lakedye is in vaccines ) 💉 "Colorant" is listed as a Tide Pod ingredient. No pediatric vaccines contain dyes. Yellow #5 and lake dye are in the adenovirus vaccine, which is only authorized for at-risk military personnel.
dimethicone NOT in Tide Pods NOT in vaccines.
--------- List of Fatty acid salts
NS SOAP Sodium soap of partially hydrogenated tallow fatty acid: Emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of synthetic rubber and resin, wetting agent or defoamer for wettable powder
SS-40N Sodium soap of stearic acid : Emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of synthetic rubber and resin
KS SOAP Potassium soap of partially hydrogenated tallow fatty acid: Emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of synthetic rubber and resin.
OS SOAP Hydrogenated tallow fatty acid: Emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of synthetic rubber and resin
FR-14 Potassium soap of oleic acid: Foaming agent for foam rubber
FR-25 Potassium soap of castor oil: Foaming agent for foam rubber
ICTEOL K-50 Potassium oleate: Laundry detergents as adjuvant to reduce foaming and aid in hardness removal.
Source: https://chemical.kao.com/sg/products/class/c020706.html
The claim arose I believe at the beginning of 2018, but it's been repeated just now in another group:
I decided to look at the claim a different way, by comparing what Tide lists as ingredients to ingredients of vaccines published by the CDC.
Then I went to the Pink Book and found the media and excipient list
Then I compared the two
Tide Pod list of ingredients.There are 26 ingredients. only one (water!) is also in vaccines.
This was easy, if a bit time-consuming to debunk. Overall, I feel sorry for the finger-biting mommy pictured above. She is worrying over nothing.

That list that starts "There is no science that shows vaccines may cause Autism, except in all these government published studies which show vaccines may cause Autism."
You maybe have seen it on Facebook or on neighborhood discussion groups, or similar. The first part looks like this:
I believe the list was compiled and shared by Marcella Piper-Terry (see footnote for Piper-Terry's claim to anti-vaccine fame) from either her own Facebook page, or the organization she started, but as you can see it pops up a lot. In other words, it's been uncritically shared -- usually with missing links that may have been intact in the original list. I am not sure if Piper-Terry's list was just the first 24 URLs, or the complete list of 56.
First point: very few if any of these are "government published studies". The URLs do indeed end in ".gov" but the studies aren't "published by the US government. PubMed is an index, not a publisher. Having a paper indexed in PubMed used to be a mark of quality, but that hasn't been true for at least two decades. So right off the bat, whoever compiled this list is misinformed, or has the intent to mislead the users of this list.
I decided to number the list (to keep track) and see how many of them were well-known, well-debunked papers.
Link #1 = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/ This resolves to Geier DA, Hooker BS, Kern JK, King PG, Sykes LK, Geier MR. A two-phase study evaluating the relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccine administration and the risk for an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in the United States. Transl Neurodegener. 2013 Dec 19;2(1):25. doi: 10.1186/2047-9158-2-25.
First, about two of the authors, David Geier MD, Mark Geier (his son) and access to the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). They had access on to October 9-10 2003 and February 29-30, 2004.The Geiers describe their VSD exploits in this presentation. Their access to the VSD was covered by federal regulations governing human subjects research, because the VSD consists of individual, identifiable patients' medical records. This is called IRB approval. They had to get IRB approval from each of the health maintenance organizations that had shared information with the VSD. This is not a trivial matter. To do so, the Geiers submitted their research plans to each of the HMOs. While they had access to the VSD, the Geiers did not comply with their previously-stated research aims.
Jeannine Santolini MD, who was at that time the director of the office charged with oversight of human subjects research, summarized the Geiers violation of research ethics as follows, in a February 13, 2004 letter to the IRB directors that approved the Geiers' use of their data in the VSD. (full text: Download Geier IRB letter
In summary, during the first visit the researchers conducted unapproved analyses on the datasets and on the second visit attempted to carry out unapproved analyses but did not complete this attempt. This analysis, had it been completed, could have increased the risk of a confidentiality breach. Before leaving, the researchers renamed files for removal which were not allowed to be removed. Had it gone undetected, this would have constituted a breach of the rules about confidentiality.
In short, the Geiers' conduct when given access to the VSD is an appalling breach of ethics, and taints every paper they publish using VSD data.
On to the paper: even if we ignore the Geiers' breach of research ethics , it is a garbage dump of a paper. The first phase used the publicly-available dataset, Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) to find reports of autism after thimerosal vs. thimerosal-free vaccination with one vaccine (DTaP) in 1998 to 2000. The DTaP vaccine is given to infants starting at 2 months. The second phase of the paper uses the VSD dataset, for an entirely different vaccine , Hepatitis B, for a different time frame (1991-1998), again looking for autism In 1991, the US began recommending universal vaccination against HepB at birth. At that time, multi-dose vials of HepB vaccines contained thimerosal; after 2000, the multi-dose vials protected from contamination by thimerosal were phased out, in favor of single-dose (and more expensive) vials. The vaccines are different, the time frames are different, and there is no connection between subjects in phase one and phase two. It's meaningless.
This paper has no clear assessment of risk, or theoretical explanation, of the risk of autism from early infancy/childhood exposure to tiny amounts of ethyl mercury from immunization. Further, multiple high-powered studies have failed to find an association between early infancy/childhood exposure to tiny amounts of ethyl mercury from immunization and the subsequent diagnosis of autism.
Does this paper "show vaccines may cause Autism? No, it does not.

Junk “science” thoroughly debunked in 2011. It is a shame that it's still being cited. See a few of the criticisms below:

http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/06/11/speech-impairment-and-autism-inseparable/"The "vaccination rate" (they have a very odd definition) goes up dramatically in the first two years of the study. The "autism+SLI rate" does not. If there were a real association between the two, it would be clear in those first columns of data.

First, notice the list of authors and compare them to the list of authors of paper #1. We have established that Geier père et fils have shoddy research ethics. How about the first author, Brian Hooker?
Well, here are a few things about Hooker. He has an autistic son, whose behavioral difficulties Hooker exploited in the propaganda film Vaxxed, of which Hooker was a central character. Hooker was a participant in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding (OAP) (part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program), alleging his son's autism was caused by thimerosal in vaccines and exposure to the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, but his account of his son's "vaccine injury" has changed over time.. Hooker's OAP claim was denied. In 2014, Hooker published "“Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young african american boys: a reanalysis of CDC data,”" . An epidemiologist found his paper extremely flawed. The paper was withdrawn and ultimately retracted. He, like his co-authors the Geiers, has shoddy research ethics.
A critique of the paper from Skeptical Raptor
It presents no original data that support a hypothesis that vaccines (or thiomersal in vaccines) cause autism.
They critiqued 6 well-designed, epidemiological studies, Andrews 2003, Hviid 2003, Madsen 2003, Price 2010, Stehr-Green 2003, and Verstraeten 2003. For each paper, the Gaiers and their antivaccine ilk co-authors, try to invent these nonsensical conspiracy theories that somehow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pharmaceutical companies, or something controlled the outcomes.
For example, for the Verstraeten study, the Geiers reference an article that is more of a summary, and complain that it shows no data. In fact, the real Verstraeten study, published in Pediatrics, included all of the data. The Geiers absolutely cherry-picked a short summary of the Verstraeten study rather than examining the fully published article. This is laughable, except for those who “believe” in the Geiers’ conclusions, won’t look that deeply.
Skeptical Raptor goes on to reference an article at Forbes,
"Apparently, these authors have been making these outlandish claims about the efforts of the CDC to squash, hide, or destroy data regarding vaccines and autism. This pathetic paper is hardly their first trip to the rodeo (always enjoyed that metaphor). Earlier in 2014, Emily Willingham, Ph.D., a Forbes‘ science writer and expert in autism, deconstructed and dismissed a huge portion of these authors’ previous attempts to slander the good name of the CDC. Apparently, the data in this paper, such as it is, has been an almost 10 year crusade by the authors, especially Brian Hooker, to make their case. Except, they’re using zombie data. They bring it up one year, it gets crushed by the skeptics and scientists, it dies. Then Brian Hooker, using the magic of reanimation, zombifies the data so that it is presented again, as if it was new. It gets crushed again, and then we repeat it.
According to Dr. Willingham, various combinations of the author group for this antivaccination paper brought up the same trope in 1999, 2000, 2004 2005, 2009, and of course this year (and this paper isn’t the first time this year that they have tried to make this nonsense claim about the CDC). Honestly, reading Dr.. Willingham’s article, it’s almost like a comedy, if it weren’t so serious.
Finally, Dr. Willingham really tries to slam the door on this ignorant trope about the CDC hiding data that’s presented by this antivaccination group of authors:"
Doesn’t matter, really. What does matter is that the information it contained is not new in 2014. It wasn’t new even in 2005. What matters is that in 1999, last century, it was preliminary, an opening analysis from a study that continued on through two phases and . What matters is that in the ensuing 15 years after those preliminary data were submitted for a conference presentation, in the second decade of this century, the accumulation of evidence worldwide showing no link has been compelling. Indeed, it is was so substantial by 2002 that the American Academy of Pediatrics retired that year a recommendation that thimerosal be removed from vaccines, a recommendation made in 1999 in spite of no evidence of harm.

Using blood products from typically developing children and autistic children, the authors claimed to have found a protein unique to the measles vaccine in more than half of the autistic children.
This finding has never been replicated. As Paul Offit wrote on page 45 of Autism's False Prophets,
...a closer look at Singh's science revealed two critical flaws: children with autism didn't have nerve damage and, according to measles experts, the test that Singh had used to detect measles antibodies didn't detect them.
Other leading scientists have criticized Singh's research.
Multiple studies in multiple countries with tens of thousands of subjects have repeatedly failed to find an association between measles vaccine and autism.

http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/12/08/and-global-warming-is-caused-by-the-decr/ In particular, note:
the authors are plotting ASD incidence in each year (1991-2008) against total aluminium content for the pediatric schedule *in that year*. Not (as you might expect) the aluminium exposure for the ASD cases themselves, according to the pediatric schedules of 6 to 21 years previously, but no, that same year.
In effect they are looking for a correlation between the number of people who developed ASD decades earlier, and the number of vaccinations given to other children, in the current year. This is an interesting model of causality!

Here is another way the Geiers revealed their unethical behavior: The IRB for this study consisted of both authors; the senior author's wife;' Lisa Sykes, whose son was a patient of the Geiers, and was a co-author with the Geiers' Mark Geier’s business partner; Kelly Kerns, who was a petitioner in the OAP, and and Clifford Shoemaker, who was chair of the patient steering committee in the OAP and a a vaccine injury lawyer. In this paper, the Geiers claim that the sources of mercury in the patients' bodies could come from prenatal exposure (via exposure to anti-D immune globulin, which until 2003 was preserved with thimerosal, and the child's own amalgam fillings (which don't emit measurable mercury, as this study shows). The Geiers used hair analysis and/or a "chelation challenge" to test for the presence of mercury in the body of the 8 patients in this study. With respect to mercury, hair analysis has not been shown to be sound science. "The use of a chelating agent before testing—"provoked testing"—should be considered a scam. Anyone told that a urine-mercury level produced after taking DMPS represents a toxic state is being misled."In short, this is another garbage paper from the Geiers.

Another Geier production. Let's talk about Paul G. King. He has a PhD in analytical chemistry, and is now a consultant who "finds and implements cost-effective regulatory-compliant solutions for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries." Up until 2004, all of his publications were technical, relating to his employment. Starting in 2004, he started writing about an "American mystery disease" -- a myriad of disorders that he blamed on thimerosal in vaccines. I do not know why he became convinced that autism was "mercury toxicity" He joined the Geier's 501(c)3 "Coalition for Mercury Free Drugs" -- usually referred to as CoMeD-- as an officer in 2007. (Tax reports for CoMed are analyzed here). While Dr. King may have had a great deal of expertise in chemistry and manufacturing issues, he has no expertise in autism or in immunology.
This paper also claimed that exposure to mercury (at levels unspecified) "dysfunctions similar to traits defining/associated with ASDs". It simply isn't true.

First, note the publication date on this paper: 2013. Thimerosal as causal in autism had been investigated and dismissed in many robust studies in many nations before that time: (Hviid 2003, Institute of Medicine 2004, Andrews 2004, Frombonne 2006, Thompson 2007, Schechter 2008, Price 2010) Why? Why, if the Geiers and their associates were the scientists they claimed to be, would they not accept that their surmise that thimerosal was causal in autism was incorrect, and move on? Could it have anything to do with their sources of income?

This is one of the more risible papers in the list.
From Kev Leitch at LeftBrain/RightBrain
The rest of the paper is a rogues gallery of debunked and fringe science. Helen Ratajczak cites the Geiers numerous times, DeSoto and Hitlan, Nataf and Rossignol to name but a few. This isn’t a paper so much as an advert for the sort of poor science that was examined in the Autism Omnibus proceedings and roundly rejected by the Special Masters. For goodness sake, she even cites David Ayoub of the Black Helicopter infamy.
David Gorski MD addresses Ratajczak's claim that "human tissue" in vaccines can cause genetic mutations leading to autism:
If there were scientific data that convincingly suggested a hypothesis, even one as implausible as the one above, I’d think about it and possibly even conclude that this is an area worthy of investigation. There were no data presented. There weren’t even studies cited that convincingly supported Ratajczak’s assertions.... How on earth did this get through peer review? Obviously, the peer reviewers of Dr. Ratajczak’s article were either completely ignorant of the background science (and therefore unqualified) or asleep at the switch.... The vast majority of what is discussed, however, is pure vaccine pseudoscience.

This is not a study at all, but the author's opinion on a different speculative article
A word here about the journal, Medical Hypotheses. It started out as a useful idea, a repository for speculative thinking in medicine, but at the latest, 2009 (two years before this article) the journal had degraded into publishing pseudoscience.

One of the theories proposed for vaccines causing autism in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was that thimerosal in vaccines was causative. A leading world expert in mercury toxicity and in autism, Patricia Rodier, PhD, testified at length on the Bernard et al. papers. Her testimony is summarized here: Rodier on Bernard et al. and environmental causes of autism . In short, Bernard et al. were wrong on the effects of mercury toxicity and wrong on the toxicokinetics of mercury.

Link # 16 = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17674242, which resolves to Geier DA, Geier MR.A prospective study of thimerosal-containing Rho(D)-immune globulin administration as a risk factor for autistic disorders. J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2007 May;20(5):385-90.
A brief introduction to the need for Rho(D)-immune globulin: People may or may not have a specific antibody on their red blood cells, the Rhesus antibody. When a person's blood of one type is mixed with the opposite type, illness may occur. This happens in pregnancy when a mother carries a baby of the opposite blood type, requiring a specific medication, Rho(D)-immune globulin. The brand names were RhoGAM, BayRho ,and WinRho. From 1968 until 2001, these products may have had a few millionths of a gram of thimerosal, used as a preservative. At some point prior to 2000, the idea that exposure to thimerosal could cause autism emerged. One source of thimerosal exposure was for women to receive thimerosal-preserved Rho(D)-immune globulin during and after pregnancy. WinRho never contained thimerosal; BayRho has been thimerosal-free since 1996, and RhoGam became thimerosal-free in 2001. It had a 2-year dating period, so the last possible thimerosal exposure was in 2003.
In 2003, Mark Geier MD was an expert witness in a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program case, Weiss v. HHS. The Special Master in the case, Laura D. Millman, referred to Geier as "a professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise, and experience" and listed nine other cases in which Geier's expert testimony was given "no weight." In 2006, Geier was the only expert witness retained by the plaintiffs to testify as to both general and specific causation. in Doe v. Otho-Clinical Diagnostics, the manufacturer of RhoGam. The claim of harm was that the Doe infant developed autism following thimerosal exposure from the mother's RhoGam shots. Judge James A. Beaty barred Geier's testimony, referring to the previous vaccine court cases and finding:
When subjected to extensive cross-examination, Geier could not point to a single study that conclusively determined that any amount of mercury could cause the specific neurological disorder of autism.
Geier's conclusion that the peer-reviewed literature he has relied upon supports his theory that autism can be caused by thimerosal is flatly contradicted by all of the epidemiological studies available at this time.
With that background in place, note that this study was published in 2007. Dr. Geier's former multi-state medical practice was called "Genetic Centers of America". The Geiers also founded a non-profit, the Institute for Chronic Illnesses, which operated as the Institutional Review Board for this and other studies.(See Link #9 for more discussion.) So here, the Geiers approved their own study, on their own patients. The paper makes no internal sense, with the "controls" being a different population than the subjects. Of particular interest relative to the paper's central assertion (that exposure to thimerosal in utero raising the risk of autism) is a later, much more robust study, Miles JH, Takahashi TN. 2007. Lack of association between Rh status, Rh immune globulin in pregnancy and autism, found no evidence for increased risk of autism from prenatal exposure to thimerosal.

This is the speculative paper that link # 14 was responding to. The author is contending that conjugate vaccines may somehow unbalance vulnerable recipients' immune systems, and thus cause autism. This is not a study. Autism is not an immune system disorder.

Holmes et al. (2003) is one of the weakest of the weak reeds advanced for the argument "mercury exposure causes autism".
The most complete analysis of the flaws in Holmes et al. (2003) was written in 2005 by Prometheus, an academic biological scientist who blogs pseudonymously at Photon in the Darkness.

The first flaw in the study is the authors' acceptance of the idea of "excretion into the hair". Mercury is excreted into hair, but in levels that cannot be calibrated to blood levels. The second flaw is the data collection methods (the hair used in the study ).
The third flaw is that the study found that the autistic children had lower hair mercury levels than the neurotypical controls. Rather than accepting that data, the authors went on to spin "tooth fairy tales" to explain why that might be so (the idea that autistic children had impaired mercury excretion). The fourth flaw in the study involves the hair analyzed: the samples had been in storage under unknown conditions for a median of five and a half years.
It was, when published, a footling study. The fact that it is still cited demonstrates the citee's devotion to a myth, and lack of scientific integrity.
One more thing you should know: Holmes et al. 2003 authors' affiliations are given as Safeminds. Safeminds is an acronym for Sensible Action For Ending Mercury Induced Neurological Disorders. Do you think the authors had an ideological point to make?

In this study, the authors used highly-inbred mice, and "subcutaneously injected with thimerosal-mercury at a dose which is 20× higher than that used for regular Chinese infant immunization during the first 4 months of life." The mice behaviors were then evaluated. Mice are a poor model for autism. This study was a waste of mice.

We've discussed the Geiers, Brian Hooker, Janet Kern, and Paul King. Who is Lisa Sykes? She is closely associated with the Geiers, serving on the board of CoMeD (see these notes on the organization). She has an autistic child, whose autism she blames on the thimerosal-containing RhoGam injections she received while pregnant.She filed suit against the manufacturer, Bayer, but eventually withdrew the suit in 2008. Shortly after the suit was withdrawn, a very well-done study determined that thimerosal exposure in pregnancy (through RhoGam injections) did not raise the risk for autism.
This paper is a production of the Geiers' Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs (CoMeD). It was also funded in part by the Selz Foundation and the Dwoskin Family Foundation, two anti-vaccine organizations.
The paper's weaknesses were explored in depth by an epidemiologist at More bad epidemiology from Dr. Brian S. Hooker and friends

Ty Bollinger Steals Ginger Taylor's List, Renumbers It, and Markets It to his Fans
Ty Bollinger released an anti-vaccine video series, The Truth About Vaccines, (TTAV) in April of 2017. (Bollinger is best known for patient-killing cancer quackery). As a part of the "educational" outreach, Bollinger released a renumbered, pirated copy of Ginger Taylor's list, calling it "130 Studies Linking Vaccines to Neurological and Autoimmune Disorders Common to Autism."
This is the URL I used to access the list:
https://go.thetruthaboutvaccines.com/wp-content/uploads/130-STUDIES-LINKING-VACCINES-TO-NEUROLOGICAL-AND-AUTOIMMUNE-ISSUES-COMMON-TO-AUTISM.pdf
(click on all images to see full-size)
Bollinger is again hawking the video series:
So I went through the TTAV list systematically. Whoever made the list used some sort of numbering application that was inconsistent. Whenever there was a number that did not refer to a specific paper, I entered "missing". There are no missing papers -- they correspond exactly to Taylor's list (with one exception -- Taylor had the retracted Mawson paper as her #2 in 2017. See Chad Hayes MD on the problems with the paper). There are just numbers with no corresponding papers.
Here's a visual example of the "missing" phenomenon
Taylor numbers 1 to 30 are analyzed in order at this link: http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2017/05/are-there-131-papers-that-support-vaccineautism-causation.html. NONE of the papers establish that vaccines have anything to do with autism, or "neurological and autoimmune disorders common to autism".

The Actual Amount of Aluminum in the Neonatal Vitamin K Injection (Protect Your Baby! Get the Shot!)
Have you seen this image going around? You need to know it is mistaken fearmongering, and the Vitamin K shot protects your baby from catastrophic bleeding.
There is only, at most,
0.05 millionths of a gram of aluminum
in the Vitamin K injections
given to newborns.
Most Americans are not fluent in the metric system, but at least are familiar with the size of a liter, from soft-drink packaging.
The measurement given is "100 mcg per liter". mcg is the abbreviation for microgram, or one millionth of a gram.
One single grain of sugar weighs about 625 mcg, or micrograms.
One liter of the Vitamin K preparation would have the equivalent of 1/6 of a grain of sugar's worth of aluminum.
Each Vitamin K vial is 0.5 milliliters (one thousandths of a liter), so it would take 2,000 vials to even get to 100 micrograms of aluminum.
But why is there even that tiny amount of aluminum in there?
Pediatrician and science communicator Dr. Vince Iannelli explains, in his excellent Vaxopedia article Does the Vitamin K Shot Contain 100mcg of Aluminum?
"Keep in mind that aluminum isn’t even listed as an ingredient of vitamin K. But according to FDA rules, “Applicants and manufacturers must use validated assay methods to determine the aluminum content in parenteral drug products.” ."
And like many other IV fluids, another ingredient of vitamin K, 5% dextrous hydrous (sugar water), does often contain some aluminum, about 17.3mcg/L. These small amounts of aluminum are present “because practically all materials used to manufacture containers for pharmaceuticals contain Al.” From aluminum oxide in glass components to aluminum used as catalysts to make plastics, it is hard to avoid aluminum. But as we have learned that premature babies could get total parenteral nutrition for prolonged periods of time and be exposed to too much aluminum, the FDA has taken steps to limit this exposure."
The label reads "aluminum". Is it elemental aluminum or something else?
It's something else. It's an ionic form (or an aluminum salt), because elemental aluminum isn't soluble. In living organisms, Al is present as its salt Al3+
The main concern is the evaluating amount of aluminum present (as Dr. Iannelli explained above), so that patients are not inadvertently overexposed to aluminum.
The Vitamin K injection protects your baby from potentially catastrophic bleeding in the brain and elsewhere

May 24, 2010: Andrew Wakefield Struck off the UK Medical Register. He's Still Harming Autistic People
Today in history: 2010: Andrew Wakefield struck off the UK's register of physicians.
Sarah Boseley, The Guardian's health editor, wrote on May 24, 2010,
"Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who triggered anxiety among parents over his suggestion of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, was struck off the medical register today for offences relating to dishonesty and failing to act in the best interests of vulnerable child patients."
Backstory: Jeremy Laurance writing at The Independant, looking back at February 1998: I Was There When Wakefield Dropped His Bombshell
"The Royal Free took a different tack. It decided to deal with the inevitable press interest head on. It called a press conference before a panel of five doctors, led by Professor Arie Zuckerman (a virologist and dean of the medical school, but not an author of the paper), who were carefully selected to present a balanced view. All were eminent in their own fields but, fatally, each had a different opinion.
The five had rehearsed the press conference in advance and agreed the line they would take, which was to recommend continued use of the MMR vaccine pending further research. Under questioning, however, this carefully constructed consensus fell apart."
On April 19, 2008, Owen Dyer published "Wakefield admits fabricating events when he took children’s blood samples" in the British Medical Journal (BMJ)
The doctor whose study triggered a collapse in public confidence in the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine told a disciplinary panel last week that he made up details of his son’s birthday party—at which he took blood samples from several children—when giving a speech in California....
The GMC’s charges against Dr Wakefield include allegations that, in 1998 while a consultant at the Royal Free Hospital, London, he unethically paid children at his son’s 10th birthday party £5 (€6; $10) each to give blood samples he wanted for his research.
Last week the GMC panel saw video footage of a speech Dr Wakefield gave in 1999 at a meeting of parents of autistic children called by the Mind Institute of the University of California, Davis, where he jokingly described children fainting and vomiting after giving blood.
“Two children fainted, one threw up over his mother,” he told his laughing audience in the clip. “People said to me, you can’t do that—children won’t come back to your birthday parties. I said we live in a market economy; next year they’ll want £10.”
But Dr Wakefield told the GMC panel that he had made up these details to amuse his listeners. “It was the end of a long and rather exacting talk for the parents, and it was an attempt to introduce a little bit of levity,” he said. “It was a quip, just a story. The way these stories are told, if the audience responds you tend to respond back. So the story was told. But it had no bearing on the truth at all.”
ON January 11, 2011, Brian Deer began publication of a many-part series on the extent of Wakefield's iniquities, with Piltdown medicine: the missing link between MMR and autism in the British Medical Journal.
At first, the comparison may feel disconcerting. The Piltdown scandal lay in fossils, while the MMR scare rested on the status of young children. But the parallels are striking. The modus operandi was essentially the same: the dishonest representation of pre-assembled artifacts. The dramatis personae, meanwhile, were similar in their conduct: they contrived, or they were duped, or they failed to act.
This week, the BMJ begins a series which lays bare the MMR scandal in detail never published before. Drawing on interviews, documents, and properly obtained data, collected during seven years of inquiries, we show how one man, former gastroenterology researcher Andrew Wakefield, was able to manufacture the appearance of a purported medical syndrome, whilst not only in receipt of large sums of money, but also scheming businesses that promised him more. His was a fraud, moreover, of more than academic vanity. It unleashed fear, parental guilt, costly government intervention, and outbreaks of infectious disease.
Notwithstanding Brian Deer's devastating series, after Wakefield was struck off, a wave of support gathered for him on both sides of the Atlantic, using various lies to cover up his many misdeeds. In 2012, Matt Carey published "Andrew Wakefield’s many statements that MMR causes autism" at the blog LeftBrain/RightBrain Autism.
The problem for Mr. Wakefield’s supporters is that Mr. Wakefield did not limit his discussion to the Lancet. As already noted, he held a press conference to announce his results and has made many more statements over the years. More to the point, Mr. Wakefield *did* say that the MMR causes autism.
Here is a collection of Mr. Wakefield’s statements which range from suggesting a possibility that the MMR causes autism to outright claiming that he “has shown” that the use of the MMR vaccine causes autism.
Mr. Wakefield’s patent application states clearly and unequivocally that the MMR vaccines has “been shown” to cause “pervasive developmental disorder”
In 2012, I wrote a post here on the outcome of a hearing for one of Wakefield's colleagues, "What the UK High Court's Ruling on John Walker-Smith Means and Doesn't Mean", which I post part of as follows:
On March 3, 2012, Mr. Justice Mitting of the UK's High Court of Justice ruled that the UK's General Medical Council (GMC) had acted improperly in Professor John Walker-Smith's hearing on charges of serious professional conduct, and therefore he quashed both the finding of serious professional misconduct and the sanction of erasure. (You can find the entire ruling at http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/503.html.)
It's important to be very clear about what this ruling means. Mr. Justice Mitting did not find that Professor Walker-Smith's actions were medically necessary or ethical. The ruling does not exonerate Walker-Smith. That was not what the hearing was about. Mitting was only ruling on the conduct, the decision-making, of the GMC's Fitness to Practice panel. More broadly, Mitting found aspects of the GMC's procedures to be flawed.
And Mitting's ruling has nothing to do with the retraction of the 1998 paper. It's still retracted. It does not validate Andrew Wakefield's integrity, or affect the likely outcome of Andrew Wakefield's defamation suit in Texas, (see below).
Mr. Justice Mittings wrote in his opinion:
"There is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [Wakefield's] hypothesis, that MMR vaccine and autism/enterocolitis are causally linked."
Many more details of Wakefield's fraud and perfidy came out after the GMC hearing. I wonder if Mr. Justice Mitting silently took that into account in his ruling -- that Walker-Smith was not a party to Wakefield's unscrupulous doings and in effect, was betrayed by Wakefield.
Nevertheless, Wakefield enthusiasts and fans continue to insist that the Mitting ruling "exonerated" Wakefield. Here are two more looks at the matter.
Legal scholar Dorit Rubenstein Reiss, at Skeptical Raptor:
"Does Walker-Smith’s decision exonerate Andrew Wakefield? The decision, if read generously, can cast doubt on one set of findings against Wakefield–that he subjected some of the children to invasive tests that were not clinically indicated. It leaves untouched, however, the rest of the charges found proved against Wakefield, and in fact, reinforces several of the allegations–for example,that Wakefield conducted research without ethics committee approval, that Wakefield included misrepresentations in the paper, and that Wakefield did not disclose conflicts of interests. It’s anything but an exoneration, and the charges against Wakefield, as the GMC concluded, amount to serious ethical violations."
Joel Harrison for Every Child by Two: Expert Commentary Series Andrew Wakefield Has Never Been “Exonerated”: Why Justice Mitting’s Decision in the Professor John Walker-Smith Case Does Not Apply to Wakefield by Joel A. Harrison, PhD, MPH August 1, 2016
This paper will show that Justice Mitting’s decision in no way exonerated Wakefield, that even with regard to John Walker-Smith, the decision was based on a procedural error, not factual innocence. In addition, despite what antivaccinationists have written, Justice Mitting’s decision also made clear that he considered the research showing no relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism to be established science.
In February of 2018, Julia Belloz reviewed the evidence against Wakefield in "20 years ago, research fraud catalyzed the anti-vaccination movement. Let’s not repeat history", published at Vox on the 20th anniversary of the publication of the infamous, retracted paper.
What’s more, when a British investigative journalist Brian Deer followed up with the families of each of the 12 kids in the study, he found, “No case was free of misreporting or alteration.” In other words, Wakefield, the lead author of the original report, manipulated his data. (See the pop-up chart in this report for details.)
Wakefield also had major financial conflicts of interest. Among them, while he was discrediting the combination MMR vaccine and suggesting parents should give their children single shots over a longer period of time, he was conveniently filing patents for single-disease vaccines. Even more absurdly, the General Medical Council (the UK’s medical regulator) found that he had paid children at his son’s 10th birthday party to donate their blood for his research. (In deciding to take away his UK medical license, the GMC said Wakefield acted with “callous disregard for the distress and pain the children might suffer.”)
In the spring of 2017, there was an outbreak of measles in Minnesota, largely (95%) in the Somali community. In previous years, Wakefield had traveled to Minnesota and spread the myth to the Somali community there about the MMR-autism connection. " U.S.-born children of Somali descent (Somali children) accounted for 55 (85%) of the cases. "
On February 28, 2018, Jonathan D. Quick MD, MPH, and Heidi Larson published The Vaccine-Autism Myth Started 20 Years Ago. Here's Why It Still Endures Today in Time Magazine.
"Stunningly, the vaccine-autism myth still persists. It was amplified by the British media during its early years, later by celebrity endorsement and more recently by worldwide social media. Wakefield has continued his own relentless personal campaigning, moving well beyond the initial MMR vaccine scaremongering to attacking the CDC in his controversial film Vaxxed. The film was pulled before screening at the Tribeca Film Festival but found its way into independent theaters in the U.S. and Europe. Europe’s four-fold increase in measles cases and 35 measles-related deaths in 2017 — due largely to people not getting vaccinated — also reflects how Wakefield’s vaccine-autism scare can spark vaccine refusals that lead to debilitating and fatal cases of measles."
Can we at last put the vaccine-autism myth behind us?

Are there 131 Papers That Support Vaccine/Autism Causation? Papers 1-30 Evaluated.
In a Scribd document called "130 Research papers supporting Vaccine/Autism Causation", Ginger Taylor makes the following claim:
Mainstream research has found that vaccines and their ingredients can cause the underlying medical conditions that committed physicians and researchers are commonly finding in children who have been given an autism diagnosis. These conditions include gastrointestinal damage, immune system impairment, chronic infections, mitochondrial disorders, autoimmune conditions, neurological regression, glial cell activation, brain inflammation, damage to the blood–brain barrier, seizures, synaptic dysfunction, dendritic cell dysfunction, mercury poisoning, aluminum toxicity, gene activation and alteration, glutathione depletion, impaired methylation, oxidative stress, impaired thioredoxin regulation, mineral deficiencies, impairment of the opioid system, endocrine dysfunction, cellular apoptosis, and other disorders.
We will ignore that few or none of the "medical conditions" Taylor lists are exclusive to autism, or are included in the diagnostic criteria for autism. This is the Nth iteration of a "list of papers supporting the vaccine-autism link" that Taylor has published. I've lost count of the iterations. I first debunked Taylor's list back in August 2013, when she only had 76 papers on the list.
Ginger Taylor, the person who has been publishing these lists, has been a loud voice in the "vaccines do too cause autism" movement, and has been since 2004. She has been known to make much of her "scientific background" as a marriage and family therapist but she actually was a paid political operative. Nonetheless, this list keeps being cited, mostly by the scientifically naive, as "proof" that vaccines can be causal in autism, and latterly, that the CDC is covering something up.
By 2016 the list was up to 124 papers, and while I wrote about the list, two science bloggers did the heavy lifting of analyzing the papers. The Logic of Science blog, written by a PhD candidate in biology, published Vaccines and autism: A thorough review of the evidence. Then at Stories from the Trauma Bay, a physician who is a trauma surgeon published 124 papers that DO NOT prove vaccines cause autism.
Before we set off on looking at each of the papers, let me remind readers (or tell readers for the first time) about some background. The US has, as many countries do not, a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). That is to say, the US recognizes that, very rarely, someone getting a vaccine might suffer an injury, from the vaccine itself or from the process of being vaccinated, and has set up a compensation program, funded by a surcharge on all vaccines. Starting in about 2001, parents began filing claims with NVICP that their children's autism had been caused by vaccines. Claims went from a few hundred a year to thousands. In 2002, NVICP, acting with a panel of parent-claimaints and their attorneys (the Petitioners Committee), agreed to hear test cases, selected by the petitioners, on their three theories on how vaccines could be causal in autism:
Theory 1: a combination of MMR and Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines could cause autism
Theory 2: Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines alone could cause autism
Theory 3: MMR vaccines alone could cause autism.
These collectively were known as the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. http://www.vaccinateyourbaby.org/safe/autism/omnibus_proceeding.cfmThe Petitioners Committee selected three test cases for each of the theories -- children whose cases they thought best made the case for their argument. However,the Petitioners Committee agreed, in 2008, that the test cases and hearings on Theory 1 would suffice for Theory 3 as well. Both documents and hearings on the three theories were exhaustive. On February 12, 2009, NVICP found that Theory 1 was not supported by the weight of the evidence including expert testimony. On On March 12, 2010, NVICP found that Theory 2 was not supported by the weight of the evidence including expert testimony.
Now, science isn't decided by legal rulings. However, these rulings were supported by science. The other thing about the NVICP is that the standard of evidence required in cases adjudicated there is much less than in other courts -- 50% plus a feather (the Althen standard).
Another ground-laying episode: there are hierarchies of evidence: how strong a claim is. Logic of Science's pyramid is one of the clearest I've found, so I'm sharing it here.
The image is of a pyramid. Let me lay out the levels, from strongest to weakest:
Level 1: meta-analyses and systematic reviews
Level 2: Randomized controlled trials (RTCs)
Level 3: Cohort studies
Level 4: Case-control studies
Level 5: Cross-sectional studies
Level 6: Animal trials and in-vitro studies (the short version is that both animal studies -- studies using living animals such as mice and monkeys -- and in vitro -- studies using cells grown in containers (hence, in vitro, Latin for glass) -- do not generally translate robustly to humans. The failure rate may be as hhigh as 97%.
Level 7: Case reports, opinion papers, and letters
Studies specifically on the relationship between the vaccine ingredient thimerosal and autism:
a cohort study with 446,695 children that compared those who received vaccines with thimerosal to those who received vaccines without thimerosal (Hviid et al. 2003).
a cohort study with 124,170 children (Verstraeten et al. 2003)
a case-controlled trial with over 1,000 children (Price et al. 2010)
a meta-analysis with 1.2 million children (Taylor et al. 2014),
These studies make a very strong case that thimerosal does not cause autism. So do the studies that show that autism rates did not drop after thimerosal was removed from vaccines (Madsen et al. 2003; Schechter and Grether 2008).
On to the studies that Ms. Taylor claims "support the vaccine-autism link". ( This is going to be long. )
I used this numbering system "131 papers number: X. 124 papers number: Y. 72 papers number: Z", because Ms. Taylor likes to shuffle the order of the papers from iteration to iteration. It helps me keep clear which papers are new and which are just in a different order.

Are there 131 Papers That Support Vaccine/Autism Causation? Papers 31-60 Evaluated.

2016 and 2017: Pediatric Vaccines in Namibia and Lesotho Safe and Effective
Mass hysteria or mass psychogenic illness: There's something about mass vaccination campaigns that sets off people reporting "vaccine injuries". It happened in the African countries of Namibia and Lesotho in the last 12 months (see below) but it has also happened in elsewhere around the world. Here are a few examples:
In the African country of Chad, in 2013, there were reports of widespread illness following immunization with a meningitis vaccine, MenAfriVac®. A group of independent experts investigated, and reported that the children fell victim to a well-known syndrome, mass psychogenic illness. MenAfriVac® did not cause the symptoms.
There is the ever-popular lie that "maternal tetanus vaccines are a secret sterilization program", most recently promoted in 2014 after a Kenyan mass vaccination drive. The US organization MaterCare spread the story, but did little to retract it when it was proven false. For thorough debunkings: see Tom Whipple covers the history of the HCG-laced tetanus vaccine lie at The Catholic Herald, in The unkillable Catholic vaccination conspiracy; Genevieve Holmes at Rational Catholic; David Gorski at Science-Based Medicine; Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence; Dr. Jen Gunter debunks Kelley Brogan's mendacious claims; and Snopes.
In 2011, female children in a small New York town, LeRoy, started exhibiting neurological symptoms. Some blamed the children's symptoms on vaccines, but the NY state Health Department review pointed out that most of the children's vaccines were years in the past. Neurologist Steven Novella made a convincing case that the children were suffering from mass psychogenic illness. A peer reviewed article makes the case for social media spreading contagion.
This kind of contagious thinking may be operating in two African countries... or just be reported in the US by people opposed to eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases (that is, anti-vaccine activists).
In 2016, the African country of Namibia responded to ongoing measles and rubella outbreaks by mounting a mass vaccination campaign for people aged 9 months to 39 years, including innovative outreach to remote communities. The campaign provided a first dose of vaccine for those born after 2012, a second dose of vaccine for older persons. Then there was some buzz in anti-vaccine social media accounts that this campaign had resulted in a large number of deaths. This turned out to be (as usual) inaccurate. The reporting in the Namibia press was a little confusing. In August, 2016, there was an article in "Parents Sue Over Vaccine Deaths", in which it was reported that in the 10-year span since 2006, 21 babies died after receiving the vaccines given in infancy. Below is the WHO table of vaccines recommended by Namibia (click to enlarge, or refer to the link). In the Namibian press, there seems to have been some confounding of deaths from the vaccines given in early infancy (Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, Oral polio vaccine, a pentavalent vaccine against Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) and Hepatitis B, and a rotavirus vaccine, given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), with the 2016 measles-rubella campaign, which were not given to very young infants but those 9 months and above.
A few weeks later, the Namibian published an article by Cornelia Ndifon, who sought to allay worries for Namibian parents:
deaths in children following immunisation in Namibia were first reported in 2006; and from that time, 21 children have suffered “complications of vaccinations and subsequent death”. As sad as it may seem, over the period of 10 years, it comes to two deaths out of thousands immunised per year, making it extremely less likely that the deaths were a direct result of the vaccination, but most probably a random and coincidental event.
Of the seven alleged vaccine-related deaths from vaccine 2014-2016 in Namibia, two are alleged to be from the 2016 measles-rubella campaign. However, there is reasonable doubt that vaccines caused both deaths:
Harare-based WHO vaccines consultant Jain Sujeet [ed: Sujeet Jain of WHO], who is in Namibia to assist with investigations, said one of the infant deaths reportedly linked to the measles and rubella vaccination might be a result of bacterial meningitis.
Another African country, Lesotho, has also been suffering epidemics of measles and rubella. (Size note: Lesotho is about the size of San Bernardino County, California, with roughly the same population density. However, the per capita income for San Bernardino is about $16,900; while it is about $2,200 for Lesotho.) In Lesotho, a mass vaccination campaign was launched February 13 2017, to last until February 24. The campaign included: immunizing against measles, rubella and polio, deworming, and vitamin A supplementation. Lesotho is a monarchy and the campaign was launched by Her Majesty Queen 'Masenate Mohato Bereng Seeiso. Two other important facts about Lesotho: first, the burden of AIDS: The percentage of adults living with HIV/AIDS in Lesotho is 23.10% while in The United States it is 0.60%. Second the number of deaths of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in Lesotho is 50.48 while in The United States it is 6.17.
On April 6, 2017, the Lesotho Times reported that:
The Ministry of Health embarked on a nationwide measles and rubella vaccination campaign in February targeting children aged from 9 months to 14 years. The 14-day campaign immunised 533,546 children which represented 79 percent of the targeted children.
However, hundreds of parents have since claimed their children were adversely affected by the vaccines with side-effects that include severe body rashes, high fever and coughing.
Four children have reportedly died from the side effects, with the latest dying at Queen ‘Mamohato Memorial Hospital a week ago. However, there has not yet been any postmortem confirming the virus as the cause of death.
I am more than a little dubious about the quality of the Lesotho Times article, written by Pascalinah Kabi, as it also included the claim that the 2016 Namibia immunization campaign "killed tens of children in Namibia", which as we have seen is a false claim.
WHO's Sujeet Jain investigated the Namibia vaccine issues, and is also involved with the Lesotho investigation. He is quoted as saying "looking into the possibility that some of the children scared of injections would have anxiety problems" -- this gets back to the issue of mass psychogenic illness.
Now I am about to present an blunt and painful exposition of infant mortality in low-resource countries, specifically about the numbers of Lesotho children who might be expected to die in any one time period. In a private message, a public health professional laid out the following chilling, but accurate calculations (I have paraphrased the statements):
In Lesotho, of 1,000 live births, 70 babies die before their first birthday
Of those 1,000 live births, an additional 20-30 die before their 5th birthday (under 5 mortality is 90-100 per 1,000 live births)
Assuming that the age distribution of the Lesotho children vaccinated was equal, that means that of the 533,000 Lesotho children vaccinated in the 2017 campaign:
of the 533,000 kids vaccinated, about 10,000 were under 12 months of age; given the mortality rate, about 700 would die in a year, therefore 60 or so in a given month
Of the surviving children, approximately 300 would also be expected to die, so (tragically) there would be about 200 children between 9 months and 5 years of age who die in Lesotho in every two week period. The vaccine campaign lasted two weeks. It pains me immensely to say this, but how can we say that the four children who died during this campaign are a change in the rate of expected deaths?
Any child's death is heartbreaking. Remember that deaths and injuries from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) are far, far, far more likely than from vaccines, even in low-resource countries. True vaccine injuries are extremely rare.

Anti-Vaccine Activists are Heinous Ghouls, #693,104
February 6, 2017 Updated: See Below
Katie McQuestion was a 26-year-old newly-wed radiology technician when she tragically died of undiagnosed sepsis, on January 2, 2015. Her family has joined with The Rory Staunton Foundation to advance awareness of sepsis, particularly in children and young adults. Here is her mother's account of Katie's illness and death. She wrote:
...the hospital took a chest x-ray for pneumonia, which was negative, and they tested for both influenza and strep which were negative....
Katie exhibited all the signs of sepsis, yet no one diagnosed it.
Our message to everyone is to Think Katie First when confronted with the symptoms of sepsis. Education of healthcare workers is critical, they should know the symptoms of sepsis the same as they know heart attack symptoms.
Not two weeks after her death, the vile anti-vaccine cult started lying about her cause of death, and her family's reaction, and has not stopped or apologized. Anyone familiar with the anti-vaccine movement should not be surprised.
The exploitation of Katie's death seems to have started with a fake news release, written by one Sean Adl-Tabatabai at the click-bait site YourNewsWire.com 1 (update Feb 6 2017: the article has been yanked. The Wayback Machine Version.
Health Care Worker Dies From Forced Flu Shot

Woman dies of sepsis after getting flu shot; CDC claims it as flu death, urges public to get vaccinated
Monday, January 19, 2015 by: Jonathan Benson, staff writer
A Wisconsin radiology technician who was recently forced by her employer to get a flu shot died just days later after contracting sepsis, according to reports.
It's true that Mrs. McQuestion was a radiology technician; every assertion after that (and the rest of the article) is a lie. According to her family, she voluntarily got the flu shot (as sensible people do), weeks before she fell ill.
Takeaway:
Don't read or link to YourNewsWire or anything published by Sean Adl-Tabatabai
Don't read or link to NaturalNews
Spread awareness of sepsis in young adults, to honor Katie McQuestion.
Watch Katie's mother's video on her death, and the signs of sepsis.

Pseudotherapy in Prison: Moral Reconation Therapy
Today I ran across a very troubling article, The Scientology-Based "Re-Education" Program for American Prisoners, Sponsored by Goldman Sachs. The author, Sarah Beller, wrote:
I wanted to find out more about this strange book that has been forced on a million people in the prison system, this book that uses terms and ideas from Scientology and tells people that their immoral personalities are responsible for their substance use, their incarceration and their unhappiness.
But for an organization that purports to seek to help as many people as possible, Correctional Counseling keeps its materials mighty close to its chest.
The similarities between Scientology and the Moral Reconation Therapy:
I wondered what Goldman Sachs had to do with this heavily-Scientology-influenced company.
The much-heralded “social impact bond” (SIB) uses money from private funders to pay for public policy programs.
The very first SIB private funder was Goldman Sachs, which contributed $7.2 million to launch the Adolescent Behavioral Learning Experience (ABLE) in Rikers Island for kids aged 16 to 18.
Goldman Sachs and the team it employed chose MRT as the treatment model.
Beller went on to write:
So in a sense, MRT was the perfect choice for a Goldman Sachs-government partnership program: Its underlying logic props up the structural status quo, which ultimately benefits the very bankers funding it. Interestingly, one of the early studies “proving” MRT worked was paid for by a Koch brother (conducted by the Koch Crime Institute).
Beller closes by asking
Instead of shooting money into pseudo-rehabilitative, pseudo-Scientology “treatments,” couldn’t we put it toward more helpful things? Like bail reform: 79 percent of people in Rikers have not been convicted of anything; they’re only there because they can’t afford bail. Or a cause for which Abe Bergman, whose son underwent MRT, is now a public lobbyist: supportive housing for people with mental illness.
I can think of some other ones too, like remediating prisoners' literacy rates.
85 percent of all juveniles who come into contact with the juvenile court system are functionally illiterate. So are 60 percent of all prison inmates.
Inmates have a 16 percent chance of returning to prison if they receive literacy help, as opposed to 70 percent for those who receive no help. This equates, according to the study, to taxpayer costs of $25,000 per year per inmate and nearly double that amount for juvenile offenders (California & New York spend over $200,000 per year on juveniles in their juvenile justice systems).
The article was published at The Influence, with which I was unfamiliar.
The Influence is a journalistic publication covering the full spectrum of human relationships with drugs and potentially addictive behaviors. We explore the nature of addiction and the various responses to it, as well as political, scientific and cultural aspects of our field. We aim neither to promote nor to demonize drugs, and we approach our subject open-mindedly, with respect for different lifestyles.

Why Is Facebook So Poor At Preventing Harassment?
(click to enlarge)
Back in March, I told you about the relentless harassment of Allison Hagood. Her harasser, Heather Ann "Frau" Murray, has even turned up in my comments
Facebook has again failed to protect its users.
It turns out that my main harasser and her fellow harassers are creating fake profiles using my and other activists’ names, and using those profiles to report posts that mention names even in conversations between friends.
So, Facebook has created a system in which no one may ever refer to anyone by a name under any circumstances, ever, even in conversations between friends.

From Orac Knows on April 1, 2016: An antivaccine activist explains how she uses Facebook reporting algorithms to harass and silence pro-science bloggers
So, yes, Ms. Murray, through her own copious statements, regularly reveals herself to be anti-Semitic as hell, and a Holocaust denier, to boot. I’d love to see her come here and spew her bigoted pseudohistory. I guarantee you that, as is the case with antivaccine loons, she can’t repeat a claim that I haven’t heard and analyzed many times before. In any case, I feel the need for a shower after that, so much so that I’ll just leave you this link if you want to see more of her blatant anti-Semitism, other than this last example I’m posting here:
OK, so from my perspective (and that of most people who do not share her bigoted views), Ms. Murray is a despicable, contemptible woman. That isn’t the reason I posted this, although posting this did give me an excuse to emphasize just how nasty she is, something I failed to do last time. (I don’t know what I was thinking then.) Far more important, however, is that she is now explaining how she targets pro-science advocates. A series of comments from her from a super-secret closed Facebook group have found their way into the “wrong” hands (i.e., ours)
