Who Invented WD40 in 1953?
Posted on November 14, 2015 November 15, 2015 Authormarcia chung
Its been said… “If you want it to move and it doesn’t, get WD40. If you don’t want it to move, and it does get duct tape.” We all know what duct tape is, but what is the main ingredient of WD-40?
Early one Sunday morning I discovered some vandals spray painted all around the sides of my neighbor’s new beige truck with red paint. After delivering the bad news to Martin, and his crazy level dropped to a tad above normal, it was agreed there was nothing to accomplish until Monday morning. Just then… And only then, Martin’s little girl came out and shouted “Why don’t you get the WD-40 out of your tool box and clean it off?”
It removed the unwanted paint beautifully, and did not harm the original paint job on Martin’s new truck. Impressive! WD-40 who knew? ‘Water Displacement #40’.
The product resulted in a search for a rust preventative solvent and degreaser that would protect missile parts. WD-40 was created in 1953 by three technicians at the San Diego Rocket Chemical Company. WD-40’s name comes from the project seeking for a ‘water displacement’ compound. They were successful with the fortieth formulation, thus WD-40.
The Convair Company bought it in bulk to protect their atlas missile parts. Ken East (one of the original founders) says there is nothing in WD-40 that would hurt you. When you read the “shower door” part, try it. It’s the first thing that has ever cleaned that spotty shower door. If yours is plastic, it works just as well as glass. It’s a miracle! Then try it on your stove top … Viola! It’s now shinier than it’s ever been. You’ll be amazed at many uses, and what WD40 is made from. WD-40 uses:
1. Protects silver from tarnishing.
2. Removes road tar and grime from cars.
3. Cleans and lubricates guitar strings.
4. Gives floors that ‘just-waxed’ sheen without making them slippery.
5. Keeps flies off cows.
6. Restores and cleans chalkboards.
7. Removes lipstick stains.
8. Loosens stubborn zippers.
9. Untangles jewelry chains.

17. Lubricates noisy door hinges on vehicles and doors in homes.
18. It removes black scuff marks from the kitchen floor! Use WD-40 for those nasty tar and scuff marks on flooring. It doesn’t seem to harm the finish and you won’t have to scrub nearly as hard to get them off. Just remember to open some windows if you have a lot of marks.
19. Bug guts will eat away the finish on your car if not removed quickly!
20. Gives a children’s playground gym slide a shine for a super fast slide.

31. Removes splattered grease on stove.
32. Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging.
33. Lubricates prosthetic limbs.
34. Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell).
35. Removes all traces of duct tape.
36. Folks even spray it on their arms, hands, and knees to relieve arthritis pain.
37. Florida ’s favorite use is: ‘cleans and removes love bugs from grills and bumpers.’
38. The favorite use in the state of New York , WD-40 protects the Statue of Liberty from the elements.
39. WD-40 attracts fish. Spray a little on live bait or lures and you will be catching the big one in no time. Also, it’s a lot cheaper than the chemical attractants that are made for just that purpose. Keep in mind though, using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing are not allowed in some states.
40. Use it for fire ant bites. It takes the sting away immediately and stops the itch.
41. WD-40 is great for removing crayon from walls. Spray on the mark and wipe with a clean rag.
42. Also, if you’ve discovered that your teenage daughter has washed and dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry, saturate the lipstick spots with WD-40 and rewash. Presto! The lipstick is gone!
43. If you sprayed WD-40 on the distributor cap, it would displace the moisture and allow the car to start.
The basic ingredient is FISH OIL.
