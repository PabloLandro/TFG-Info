Facts and fables about breastfeeding
If you want to breastfeed, you will soon hear a lot of fables about breastfeeding that might make you doubt. For example that you do not have enough milk, that it is very impractical, it always hurts and you get hang busts from it. These are all fables! So before you let yourself be fooled, read all here facts and fables about breastfeeding.
8 Fables about breastfeeding
You get chest breasts
This is perhaps the best news! You do not get any hanging breasts from breastfeeding. What can change the shape of your breasts is the pregnancy itself and your age. Through the pregnancy you make glandular tissue that later disappears, so your breasts can become a bit slack and they can also relax due to the hormonal changes.
You do not need contraception as long as you are breastfeeding
Many people think that you can not become pregnant if you are fully breastfeeding, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Since you are ovulating two weeks before your first menstruation, you can already be fertile without noticing it. If you still want to postpone the next child, it is best to use contraception during breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding always hurts a little
Breastfeeding should not hurt. Maybe you feel some discomfort the first few days, but after that it should be easier. If you feel persistent pain or discomfort, something is wrong, such as nipple gaps. In most cases, the pain is caused by an incorrect fitting technique. Ask your midwife or a lactation consultant how to apply properly.
There are many women who do not have enough milk
Whether you have cup A or cup D: every woman can have enough milk. In fact, most women even produce a little too much milk. Is your baby falling off? That is not because there is not enough milk, but because the installation technique is not correct. This means that the baby can not drink the breast properly.
You can not eat anything when you are breastfeeding
If you are breastfeeding, it is not necessary to avoid certain foods. It is often said that you should delete oranges, chocolate, cabbage, onions or sharp herbs from your diet because they would cause cramps. Totally not true! Make sure you eat healthy and varied. Incidentally, you have to leave the alcohol for a while.
If you are breastfeeding, you must drink a lot of milk
It is not necessary to clock away liters of milk to get enough calcium that you 'pass on' to your baby again. You can get enough calcium from your daily diet as long as you eat healthy and varied. Your body also absorbs calcium better from food when you breastfeed.
If your baby has cramps or diarrhea, you should stop breastfeeding
When your baby suffers from cramps it is not necessary to stop, your breastfeeding is even the best medicine!
Nutrition is nowadays just as good as breastfeeding
No matter how much manufacturers do their best: artificial food is not as good as breastfeeding. In breastfeeding are antibodies that protect your baby against infections and diseases from birth to later in life. In addition, breastfeeding is fully geared to the needs of your child. Nutrition is tailored to the general need of children.
You can decide whether or not to breastfeed. What is true and what should you quickly forget about facts and fables about breastfeeding
