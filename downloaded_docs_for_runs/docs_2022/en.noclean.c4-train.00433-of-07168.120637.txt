Could a cell phone give you brain cancer?
Dr. Ed Friedlander, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Answered Feb. 6, 2014
42 years experience in Pathology
I say no. Anyone who's scientifically literate will recognize that this ongoing business is fueled by politicians and fearmongers. The statistics seem nothing more than the usual junk that's generated by retrospective studies (people's beliefs color their memories), the radiation isn't the kind that damages genes, and in the big study more cancers were on the opposite side.

Can there be a link between cell phone use and brain cancer?
Dr. Sivakumar Jaikumar, University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio Answered May. 2, 2013
23 years experience in Neurosurgery
Good question. Depends on what you read. In the 80's cigarette smoking was not considered harmful. One never knows, what the future research will show. If you have a blue tooth device, would use it. Read more...

Woke up this a.M. And found that my cell phone had been under my pillow all night. Should I be concerned about health risk from accidentally sleeping on it? Mom died of brain cancer, so I worry.

Relax. It takes a lot more than sleeping on a cell phone for a night to cause brain cancer; the distance from phone through pillow also decreases exposure.- another reason not to worry. The association of cell phone use and cancer is still pretty flimsy. Don't worry, be happy. Read more...

No risk. I wouldn't be concerned at all. The whole two-decades story of scared from cell phones and brain cancer showcases the crazy results that bad studies get from recall bias. Tell people that something causes cancer and they'll remember using it. One big study showed more cancer on the side opposite to where the folks held the cell phones. They don't produce the ionizing radiation that's dangerous. Read more...

What to do if I only use my cellphone, maybe, once a week, or even month. Am I at risk for brain cancer?
Dr. Robert Wascher, Creighton University School of Medicine Answered Aug. 11, 2013
31 years experience in Surgery - Oncology
Not likely. As i discuss in my book (a cancer prevention guide for the human race), the occasional use of cell phones does not appear, at this time, to be linked to a significantly increased risk of developing brain cancer. Read more...

Can the use of cell phones greatly increase my risk of getting brain cancer?
Dr. Gurmukh Singh, University of Pune – Armed Forces Medical College Answered Jul. 13, 2012
47 years experience in Pathology
Not greatly. It is not clear if use of cell phones increases the risk of brain cancer. It is unlikely that there is a "great" increase, as a large increase would have been picked up in the studies already conducted. Read more...

Unclear. Like many other epidemiological links, this one depends on your perspective. My personal view is that the link between cell phone use and brain cancers is extremely weak, but i can't believe cell phone use is good for you. Read more...

Are cell phones linked to brain cancer/tumor?
Dr. Ed Friedlander, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Answered Feb. 1, 2014
42 years experience in Pathology
I say "No" This stuff has been thrown around for almost 30 years without any mechanism that makes sense (the radiation from a phone isn't the wavelength that damages genes). Epidemiology by survey, especially retrospective studies, generates many false-positive alleged links; in one huge study, there were more cancers on the opposite side. Enjoy technology and stop worrying. Read more...
