Birth Control:
It's Up to Me!
This booklet describes your birth control choices. Birth control
methods work in different ways to prevent unplanned pregnancies.
Each of the different methods has advantages and disadvantages.
The most effective method for you will be the one that you are
comfortable with and can use correctly all of the time. As you read
the information in this booklet, keep in mind that:
Some methods contain hormones and others do not.
Some methods are more effective than others.
The length of protection for each method varies.
Some methods only last for one sex act, some last for
one week, some a few months or a few years, while
others are permanent.
Only certain methods help protect you from the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually
transmitted infections (STIs).
You can choose to use more than one method.
All of the methods are most effective if you
use them correctly and consistently. All of the
methods are most effective if you use them
This is only an introduction to each birth
control method. Your Family PACT provider
can help you find a birth control method that
works best for you.
Before choosing a method,
ask yourself the following
questions:
When do I plan to have a family?
How would I feel about a surprise or
unplanned pregnancy?
Do I have more than one partner?
What method(s) does my partner like to use?
Do I have a health problem that would prevent
me from using a certain method?
Do I need a method that can be kept private
from others?
These are personal questions. Your answers will help you find the
right birth control method for you. You can talk with your Family
PACT provider if you have any questions. All discussions will be
private and confidential. No one else will be told what method
you choose to use.
How do birth control
methods work?
To understand how birth control methods work, it's important
to understand how pregnancy occurs.
Sperm are made in a man's testicles (balls). The
sperm move up a long tube that leads to the penis.
When a man gets sexually excited, fluid that
contains sperm comes out of the penis just before
and when he ejaculates (cums). There are about
50 million sperm in this fluid and these sperm can
stay alive inside a woman's body for up to 5 days!
Each month an egg is released from a woman's ovary. After the egg
leaves the ovary, it moves down the fallopian tubes.
When a man and woman have sex, sperm from the
man's penis swim through the cervix, into the uterus
and up the fallopian tubes. If a sperm joins with an
egg, this is called fertilization. If the fertilized egg
attaches to the uterus, the woman may become
pregnant.
Birth control methods prevent pregnancy in one or more ways. Birth
control can work by:
Stopping the egg from coming out of the ovary,
Stopping the sperm from fertilizing the egg, or
Keeping the fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus.
Emergency Contraception Pills
It is good to pick a birth control method that you can use all the time.
But sometimes accidents happen. Emergency Contraception (EC)
is especially for these times. These pills are made of hormones like
the ones made by a woman's body. You can take EC pills to prevent
pregnancy after unprotected sex. The sooner you take them, the
better they work. Some people refer to this birth control method
as the "morning-after pill," but EC is effective up to 5 days after
unprotected sex!
EC can prevent pregnancy by:
Stopping the egg from coming out of the ovary,
Stopping the sperm from fertilizing the egg, or
Keeping a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus.
You can use EC if you had sex and :
You didn't use your birth control
method correctly.
Your birth control method failed.
You didn't use any form of birth
control.
Someone forced you to have sex.
If you are thinking about using EC, keep in mind that:
EC will not work if you are already pregnant.
EC does not cause an abortion. EC is not the same as an abortion.
EC does not replace a regular method of birth control. It is only
used for emergencies. (If you are having sex, use one of the
methods listed in this booklet.)
You do not need a doctor's exam or Pap smear to get it.
You can get EC before an accident happens. Ask your Family PACT
provider to give you EC in advance so you will have it when you
need it.
If you are 17 or over, you can buy EC from a pharmacy without a
prescription. If you are 16 and under, you need a prescription to
get EC. Family PACT covers the cost of EC when it is prescribed
by your Family PACT provider.
Pill
Ring
Hormonal Methods
Hormonal methods contain hormones like the ones made by a
woman's body. These hormones are called estrogen and progestin.
Hormonal methods prevent pregnancy by changing the levels of
hormones in a woman's body. This change in hormone levels prevents
pregnancy by stopping the egg from coming out of the ovary, by
stopping the sperm from fertilizing an egg, or by keeping a fertilized
egg from attaching to the uterus.
Advantages:
Very effective if used correctly.
Easy to use.
Birth control pills may
decrease the risk of cancer
of the ovary and the
uterus.
The pill, patch, and ring
may make periods
more regular and
reduce cramps.
Do not interrupt sex.
Disadvantages:
No protection from HIV
or other STIs.
Need a prescription.
Hormones may cause
side effects. These
side effects include
headaches or
changes in your
breasts, menstrual
cycle, weight, or mood.
You can choose from several types of
hormonal methods. Although all hormonal
methods work in a similar way, they have
some differences.
Patch
Injection
Implant
Pill
You take one tablet by mouth every day.
Works best if you take the pill at the same time every day.
Makes periods more regular.
Can get pregnant as soon as you stop using the pill.
Ring
You put a soft, rubber ring in your vagina and take it out
three weeks later.
There is nothing to remember on a daily basis.
Put in and taken out of your vagina with your fingers.
Can get pregnant as soon as you stop using the ring.
Most women who use the ring don't feel it once it is in the
vagina.
Patch
Like a small bandage, you put it on your skin and change it
once a week for three weeks.
There is nothing to remember on a daily basis.
Can get pregnant as soon as you stop using the patch.
May become loose or fall off, and may irritate the skin.
Injection
Your health care provider gives you a shot that lasts for 12
weeks.
There is nothing to remember on a daily basis.

skin in your arm that works for 3 years.
There is nothing to remember on a daily basis.
A health care provider must put the rod in and take it out.
Can get pregnant as soon as you stop using the implant.
Intrauterine Contraception
Intrauterine contraception (also known as IUC or
IUD) is a small, T-shaped piece of plastic that is
placed inside a woman's uterus by a clinician.
The IUC stays in place until a clinician takes it
out. This method of birth control works by stopping the sperm from
fertilizing an egg and/or by keeping a fertilized egg from attaching to
the uterus.
Advantages:
Very effective.
Easy to use.
Long-term protection.
Can get pregnant as soon
as you stop using IUC.
Can be used while
breastfeeding.
Disadvantages:

or other STIs.
Must be put in and
taken out by a clinician.
Once a month, check
the strings to make
sure the IUC is still in
place as instructed
by your provider.
Copper Hormonal
You can choose from two types of IUC methods. Although
each IUC method works in a similar way, they have
some differences.
Copper
A T-shaped device with copper on
the outside.
Lasts for ten years.
Can cause heavier bleeding or
cramping.
No hormonal side effects
Hormonal
A T-shaped device with hormones inside.

Barrier Methods
Barrier methods work by stopping the sperm from fertilizing the egg.
Barrier methods can either be used alone or with another method of
birth control for more protection.

Can be used with other
birth control methods.
Only use them when
you have sex.

Allergies or
irritation can
occur (rare).
You can choose from four types of barrier
methods. Although each barrier method works
in a similar way, they have some differences.
Diaphragm
Cervical Cap
Male Condom
A latex (natural rubber), polyurethane (man-made rubber), or lambskin
(natural material) that is rolled on to a man's erect penis before sex begins.
Anyone can buy them without a prescription.

Foam
Suppository
Spermicides
Spermicides come in many forms: film, foam, jelly, sponge, and
suppositories. Spermicides are placed in the vagina before sex begins.
All spermicides work by killing the sperm. Spermicides can either be
used alone or can be used with another method of birth control for more
protection. Spermicides are often used with a barrier method.
Advantages:
No hormonal side effects.
Easy to use.
Anyone can buy them
without a prescription.
Provide extra lubrication
during sex.
Can be used while
breastfeeding.
Can get pregnant
as soon as you
stop using
spermicides.

Not as effective as other birth
control methods.
Must put them in the vagina
before sex and use more
every time you have sex.
May irritate the vagina
or the penis.

the cervix.
Put it deep into the vagina with your fingers or an applicator.
Must wait 10 to 15 minutes before having sex.
Natural Methods
Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) and
Natural Family Planning (NFP)
These methods are ways that a woman can use to keep track of the
monthly changes in her body. By checking changes in temperature and
cervical mucus, she can tell when she is at risk of getting pregnant.
During this time, she must use another birth control method or she must
not have sex.
Advantages:
No hormonal side effects.
Does not affect periods.
Disadvantages:
Depending on how it is used, it may
not be as effective as other methods.
It can be hard to tell when a woman
is at risk of getting pregnant.
Cannot be used by women with
irregular periods or who have
no periods at all.
You must learn how to use it
correctly.
Works best with partner support.
No protection from HIV or other
STIs.
Need to abstain (not have sex) or use
another form of birth control during the
times you could get pregnant.
Lactation Amenorrhea
Method (LAM)
When a woman exclusively breastfeeds her baby (no bottle-feeding),
she is unlikely to get pregnant. There is nothing to buy and nothing
to use. Breastfeeding causes the body to release hormones that stop
the egg from coming out of the ovary. A woman can use this birth
control method for up to six months after giving birth to a baby.
In order for this method to be effective, a woman must:
Not have had a period since the baby was born.
ONLY breastfeed (no bottle feeding) every time her baby wants to be fed.
Breastfeed at least every 4 hours during the day.
Breastfeed at least every 6 hours during the night.
Pumping the breasts does not count as breastfeeding.
Advantages:
Effective if done correctly.
Can be used right after the
birth of a baby.
No hormonal side effects.
Health benefits for both
mother and baby.
Disadvantages:
May be difficult to breastfeed
as often as needed.
Women are advised to only use
LAM for up to six months.
No protection from HIV or
other STIs.
Sterilization
Both men and women who do not want more children can have a
procedure to make them sterile. Sterilization is a permanent method of
preventing pregnancy. If there is a chance that you will want children
later, choose another method.
Advantages:
Very effective.
No more worries about
pregnancy.
The procedure is quick and it
goes not take long to get
better.
No long term side effects.
May decrease the risk of
cancer of the ovary.
Nothing to remember or buy.
Tubal ligation or Micro-inserts-
Sterilization procedures for a woman.
The tubes that carry the eggs from the
ovaries to the uterus are closed.
Disadvantages:
No protection from HIV or
other STIs.
If you change your mind
later, it may not be
possible to reverse it.
There may be a small
chance of infection
or bleeding after the
procedure.
Vasectomy -
Sterilization procedure for a man.
The tubes that carry sperm from
the testicles to the penis are closed.
Protecting Yourself
from STIs
STIs are infections that you may get by having sexual contact with the
mouth, penis, vagina or anus of someone who has an STI. They can cause
serious problems if they go untreated. STIs can cause women and men to
become sterile (unable to have children). Symptoms of STIs include:
Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina.
Bumps or sores on the penis or vagina.
Pain during urination.
Pain in the lower abdominal area.
Even if you don't have any of these symptoms, you could still have an
STI. Many people who have an STI have no symptoms at all. If the
method you choose does not protect you from STIs, consider also using
a male or female condom.
For more information on protecting
yourself from STIs, or to find
STIs, talk to your
health care
provider.
