Are genital herpes sores like canker sores on the genital area?
Dr. Steven Machtinger Dr. Machtinger
1 doctor agreed:
Ony superficially: Genital herpes is a highly contagious sexually transmitted disease (std) caused by the virus herpes simplex type 2 (hsv2). It's related to the virus that causes cold sores or fever blisters in your mouth: hsv1. Canker sores are small ulcers on your tongue or the lining of your cheeks that are probably autoimmune in origin. We don't think cankers are of viral origin because they're not contagious. ...Read more
