Is abreva good for genital herpes?
Dr. Hunter Handsfield Dr. Handsfield
Not so good: Docosanol (Abreva) has little if any effect against herpes outbreaks. It somewhat inhibits the virus in the lab, but has little benefit in shortening outbreaks. (The same is true for all creams or ointments, such as acyclovir or penciclovir, even though these are far more potent than docosanol against the virus.) Effective treatment requires oral therapy, e.g. valacyclovir or acyclovir. ...Read more

Is Valtrex (valacyclovir) or zovirax better for cold sores?
Dr. Joel Gallant Dr. Gallant
1 doctor agreed:
Either: I'm assuming you're talking about oral Valtrex (valacyclovir) and zovirax (not zovirax cream). Both are effective, but Valtrex (valacyclovir) is more convenient, because it doesn't have to be taken as frequently. My favorite way to treat cold sores is to have the patient take 2 grams of Valtrex (valacyclovir) at the very first sign of an outbreak, and then 2 grams 12 hours later. That two-dose course will shorten the duration of infection. ...Read more
