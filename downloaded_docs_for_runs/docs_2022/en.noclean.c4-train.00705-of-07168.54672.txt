URINARY TRACT INFECTION -UTI- IN MEN Meaning
An infection present in the urine and the organs that make up the urinary system are considered to be a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). This involves an infection in the following organs - the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Commonly infection occurs in the lower organs such as the urinary bladder and the urethra.1
Such infections need immediate medical attention as if left untreated they can cause permanent damage to the kidneys.1
As per Ayurveda, all urinary tract infections are discussed under a broad term called Mutrakricchra (Difficulty in urination) that covers the conditions of kidney and urinary tract infection.2
Incorrect diet and lifestyle habits (excessive exercise, alcohol, fish, excessive cold food and drink, dry food that lack oil, depression, fear) can vitiate all doshas in bodies. The vitiated doshas with low digestive fire produce undigested toxins in the body called ama. Ama mixes with doshas and blocks mutra vaha srotas (channels of urine). This leads to symptoms such as yellowish urine (peetamutrata), burning sensation while urinating (sadahmutra pravruti), swelling in bladder (mutrendriya gurutwa), etc.3
