Dangers Involved With Morphine Abuse
The narcotic pain reliever morphine is extremely strong and is a very effective medication for relieving pain whether a patient needs it for short term use or for managing acute chronic pain long term. Because morphine has euphoric properties, the drug is often used recreationally. Morphine is highly addictive and addiction and overdose are risks a person takes if they intentionally abuse or misuse the narcotic medication.
In recent years the misuse and abuse of pain medications has skyrocketed and the amount of people throughout the United States that have become addicted to pain pills has reached epidemic proportions sadly. Many different pain medications are being abused including the misuse of oral morphine. Morphine is available in regular short acting tablet form which is usually administered every 4 hours but also comes in an extended released tablet or capsule form that's long acting used in relieving pain around the clock.
Brand Names for Morphine

Abusing Extended Release Long Acting Formulas of Morphine
Morphine is an opioid medication that's habit forming and when misused or intentionally abused, can lead to addiction. Taking high doses of morphine or any narcotic can cause breathing problems, extreme drowsiness, coma and even death which most people that abuse narcotics don't realize. It's true that many people have become dependent on morphine and other pain medications as a result of injury or illness but, there's an enormous amount of people that are addicted to them today due to intentional abuse.
Morphine is a schedule II controlled substance and the risk of an overdose is especially high because long acting medications are often abused. The timed release formulas of morphine are often crushed and snorted, chewed and swallowed, or crushed and dissolved and injected when they're intentionally abused. This causes a high dose of morphine to be rapidly released and absorbed into the blood stream at one time which can and has led to a fatal overdose.
Morphine Information
The key to prevention is education and it's important to expand your knowledge so that you understand the side effects of morphine, dangerous effects of morphine when abused, morphine withdrawal symptoms and symptoms of a morphine overdose.
Morphine Side Effects can include nausea, vomiting, constipation, lightheadedness, dizziness, drowsiness, decreased appetite, loss of weight, dry mouth, sweating, weakness, headaches, nervousness, mood changes, confusion, problems with sleep, flu like symptoms.
Serious Morphine Side Effects can include breathing problems (slow, shallow or irregular), fast or slow heartbeat, seizures, hallucinations, blurry vision, fainting, hives, rash, itching, tightness in throat, problems swallowing, swelling (arms, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs).
Physical dangerous consequences of morphine abuse can be extremely dangerous and if a person takes high doses of a narcotic especially if the person isn't use to it can result in breathing difficulties, extreme drowsiness, coma and possibly death.
Morphine Withdrawal Symptoms can include anxiety, diarrhea, sleep problems, increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, increased breathing, increased heart rate, muscle spasms and severe flu like symptoms. The symptoms of morphine withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and distressing but not life threatening.
Morphine Overdose Symptoms can include breathing problems (slow, shallow or irregular), sleepiness, loss of consciousness, limp muscles, cold and clammy skin, slow heartbeat, blurry vision, nausea, and fainting. Remember, a morphine overdose should be taken very seriously and can easily lead to death. High doses of morphine can cause life threatening respiratory depression.
Combining Morphine with Other Substances
It's also not uncommon for a person that abuses drugs like morphine to also drink alcohol or take other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, vitamins or maybe even nutritional supplements. There are always special precautions that people have to take when they are taking medications like morphine and they have to be taken seriously. Combining drugs together, vitamins or even herbal products can be dangerous depending on the medications a person is taking that's why it's so important not to take someone else's medicine or to share your own with others.
