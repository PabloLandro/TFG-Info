Rutin is an ingredient that can be helpful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Weakened, thin blood vessels are generally linked with hemorrhoids.

Give some natural remedies a try before you spend money on pricey hemorrhoid treatments. After you have a bowel movement, soak for about 15 minutes in a sitz bath.

You can also reduce irritation by eating plenty of fiber, and drinking plenty of water. This will make it easier for you to avoid straining during your bowel movements.
Though it may come as a surprise, lifting heavy items can lead to hemorrhoids. Your body’s strain is similar to the strain that you make when you’re forcing a bowel movement. If you are frequently troubled by hemorrhoids, stay away from heavy lifting in general, even between flare ups.
Lose Weight

Simple warm water can be one of the easiest and best treatments to relieve hemorrhoid symptoms. Use warm water on your rectum for around ten minutes per day and then put a cold towel on the hemorrhoids. Consider purchasing a toilet bath. This can be found in the majority of pharmacies.
Consume a diet that is rich in fiber. If you eat a good deal of fiber, you will have softer stools. If your stools are soft, you will not need to strain when going to the bathroom, and will therefore spare yourself significant pain.
