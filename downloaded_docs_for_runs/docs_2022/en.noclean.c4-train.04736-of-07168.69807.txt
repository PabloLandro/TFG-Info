Genetic Testing
What is Genetic Counseling?
Watch this video to learn more about genetic counseling and what genetic counselors can for you and your family.
Your genes may predict your risk of cancer, and certain genetic tests may help your doctors provide better screening or treatment options. If you have certain types of cancers, or cancer in your family, you may be at higher risk. We can help. Genetic testing is available through many of the Arizona Oncology cancer centers in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Tucson and Southern Arizona, and Flagstaff, Sedona and Northern Arizona. Find a location convenient to you.
Hereditary Cancer
All cancers are caused by the accumulation of genetic mutations, but not all cancers are caused by an inherited genetic mutation. About 5-10% of cancers are caused by an inherited genetic mutation. Genetic counseling may be recommended for families with a pattern of certain cancers (breast/ovarian or endometrial/colon) or cancer at younger ages, to see if the cause was inherited. Learn more about Hereditary Cancer Panel Testing.
There are also families who have multiple people with cancer but no identifiable genetic mutation. In these cases, the cancer is familial, likely due to a combination of shared environment and shared genetic factors. Members of these families may still be at a higher risk of cancers even with negative results during the genetic testing process. For these reasons, it is important to know your family cancer history and to share this information with your healthcare providers. A healthcare provider can then decide whether you need increased screening based on family history alone.
Arizona Oncology’s Genetic Risk Assessment Program
Arizona Oncology’s Genetic Risk Assessment and Testing program offers personalized cancer-risk assessment and discussion of risk reduction strategies with a certified genetic counselor. Our goal is to guide you through the process of deciding if genetic testing is right for you. We will evaluate your family history, provide knowledgeable guidance about cancer risk, detection and prevention, and can help you interpret the results of genetic testing. Genetic counseling is available at our locations throughout Arizona including Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tucson, Flagstaff, Northern Arizona and Southern Arizona.
