Foods that Help Relieve Hemorrhoids
By Hendra KharismaPosted on December 1, 2007
A high fiber diet obtained from raw fruits and vegetables is what you need to follow for eliminating and for preventing constipation and is what you need to prevent and cure hemorrhoids.
If you have not been eating a lot of fiber, you need to add fiber slowly to your diet especially if you add it by using bran. Increase your use of bran or other bran cereals over a couple of weeks.
If you add fiber to your diet with fruits and vegetables, you can add them freely without much problem. However, since your stomach will not be used to it, you may experience more gas for a week or two.
Here are some of the foods to start using:
Juices
Juices are good for hemorrhoids but especially dark berry juice mixed with equal parts of apple juice. The dark berry juices to use are:
1. Cherries, blackberries, blueberries
These berries contain ‚Äúanthocyanins‚Äù and ‚Äúproanthocyanidins‚Äù which reduce hemorrhoidal pain and swelling by toning and strengthening the hemorrhoidal veins. Drink at least one glass of this juice mixture each day.
2. Red and black currant berries
Currants are high in Vitamin C, rutin, and minerals. This makes their juice valuable in clearing hemorrhoids. They also have a small amount of the fatty acid GLA, which produce prostaglandin that control body pain. Drink 1-2 glasses a day of red or black currant berries.
Iron foods
Here are the foods that contain iron to help you build up your blood or to keep iron in reserve, if you ever need it.
* Chicken liver, steamed crab
* Kelp
* Prunes
* Dried apricots
* Sunflower seeds
* Pistachios
* Cashews, almonds, sesame seeds
* Baked potatoes
* Cooked Swiss chard
* Raisins
* Cooked broccoli
* Tuna
* Cantaloupe
Cantaloupes are one of the best foods you can eat. It has a good source of vitamins and minerals. It has a high beta-carotene level and has anti-clogging properties.
Ginger, garlic, and onion
Add these three herbs to your diet. Each one of these helps to break down fibrin. Fibrin is a natural substance that helps to repair breaks in tissue, organs, and arteries. However, there are times that your body may over react and deposited too much fibrin causing inflammation in the arteries and especially in the hemorrhoid area.
Oils
At every meal, use olive oil, flax seed oil, and apple cider vinegar in your salad. In your soups, use olive and flax seed oil or other food dishes where they is appropriate. Or at the end of each meal take your capsule of fish oil.
Fish oil is probably one of the most important oils to use daily. Go to my newsletter to read the article I wrote about this nutrient.
Use the following foods to help reduce hemorrhoidal bleeding:
* Alfalfa
* Dark green leafy vegetables
* Blackstrap molasses
* Flax seeds ‚Äì are high in omega-3 oils, which reduce inflammation and pain. They are also high in fiber.
* Lima and butter beans are high in iron, which help to build more blood. If you have bleeding hemorrhoids, adding lima beans to your diet would be a good choice.
There you have it. Plenty of remedies that can give you temporary relief, reduce bleeding, reduce swelling, eliminate itching, and cure or prevent your hemorrhoids.
