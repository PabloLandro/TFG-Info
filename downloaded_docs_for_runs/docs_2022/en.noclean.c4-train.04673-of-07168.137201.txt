Genetics are also thought to be a contributing factor as is age, weight gain and obesity. They affect both men and women but are more frequently seen in women and are normally more common as we get older.
The tags are thought to form when folds of skin rub together (hence the increase in risk following weight gain and the subsequent increase in skin folds). Therefore they tend to affect certain areas of the body such as under the arms, breasts, eyelids, neck, groin or buttocks in particular.
As we said, skin tags are completely harmless flaps of skin that are not dangerous and don’t cause any pain of discomfort in most cases. They are formed from loose collagen fibres (a type of natural protein) and blood vessels which are surrounded by skin. Whilst not usually painful they are, more often than not, unsightly and, depending on where they are, can often affect self-confidence and self-esteem. They can also catch on clothing or jewellery which can cause pain and bleeding when you least expect it.
