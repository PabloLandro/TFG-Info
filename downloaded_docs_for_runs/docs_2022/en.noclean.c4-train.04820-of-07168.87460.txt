On the flip, the convection vape pens blow extremely hot air through the material that turns it into vapor. A mesh screen, usually made of glass or metal is used to contain the vaping material. The convection style vape pens usually offer better flavor and taste. However, they can be more expensive and take longer to heat up.
Threading – These are the threads on the top of the battery in which you screw on your atomizer. Most vape pens have some kind of threading, usually 510, eGo, or both. There are some rare alternatives that we will discuss later.
Some of the models are 3 in one vape pen and come with interchangeable parts or multi-function parts that can be used for vaping more than one type of material. If you think you may want to experiment, this type would be the best for you.
Vaping marijuana through a vaporizer pen has become extremely popular, as you don’t need to burn the leaves as you would by smoking a joint. A 2007 study published in the journal Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics showed that vaping cannabis is a safer and more effective method of THC delivery than the traditional joint or bong smoking. However the same study indicated that many users reported that vaporized marijuana felt much more potent, so do be careful.
The main difference between this type of vaporizer pen is that this is used for getting high. Wax is a highly concentrated cannabis product that contains tetrahydrocannabinol aka THC. These pens usually contain a coil that comes in contact with the wax and turns it into vapor.
Note: There is no industry standard term for the liquid used in electronic cigarettes. The term e-liquid is used interchangeably with e-juice, vape juice, or vape liquid. The base components are the same for each of these terms.
If you are just starting out and want to see how easy it is to make the switch from tobacco to vape check out our starter kits such as the Smok Alien Baby or the Smok V8. For more advanced vapers, take a look at our box mods, such as the Sigelei Fuchai 213 Plus or the Tesla Steampunk Nano, to customize and maximize your vaping experience.
If you get an authentic vapor pen, rest assured that you will get decent performance. But some vaporizer pens are very cheap, and you get what you pay for. Cheaper vape pens take too long to heat up, are fragile and can even burn the material. When using cheap vapor pen, you get a burnt taste. That’s why we recommend investing in a decent vaporizer, made by a reputable manufacturer. The best vaporizer pens will give you great flavor and nice throat hits.
If you’re new to vaping, then you are probably wondering what it is all about. In the following guide will we explain what e-liquid is and how to choose a good e-liquid for you. If you’re new to vaping, then you are probably wondering what it is…
Although eGo’s and 510’s are the universal standard, you might find a vape pen that uses a different connection. Since many people were buying parts for their vape pens from various manufacturers, some companies use unique threading to prevent this from occurring.
Every vape pen consists of two parts: a battery and a heating chamber (a tank or a bowl, depending on the material that you use). The battery supplies the power to the coil in the chamber, which, in turn, heats up the material, creating vapor which is then inhaled through the mouthpiece. Best-rated vape pens don’t burn the vaping material; instead, they slowly cook it until it reaches its evaporation point.
While convection vaporizers heat materials with hot air that’s blown through the heating chamber, conduction vape pens directly heat the material on the surface of the heating element. Users who value vapor purity over all else should find a portable vaporizer with convection heating, or a desktop vaporizer. Vaporizer pens are better suited for decent hits on-the-fly. That said, vape pen vapor is much purer than the smoke produced by water pipes, joints, and pipes.
The Series 3X is available in three different colors – gunmetal, red, and charcoal. Don’t let its minimalistic design confuse you; this is a top-notch dry herb vape pen, one of the best on the market. The flavor is spot on, and the buzz it delivers is pretty much unrivaled when it comes to portable loose leaf pens.

Can someone help me. I just received my ipv4 S and I’m using it with my kanger subtank mini. I cannot fire up and constantly receive low resistance. Sometimes even the message short. Batteries are legit and fully charged, hit + and – keys to try and set but can’t really get it past. 006. Cleaned the 510 connection as well. Is it the tank itself because I have the Smok TFV4 coming.

Battery life is a major factor in choosing any electronic device these days. Since you’ll use the vape pen as a portable device, you don’t want the battery to die when you need a vape. Vape pens that support bigger batteries are also bigger in size, so there’s a tradeoff.

Wax Pen – A wax pen enables portable vaping of waxy oils. Wax vape pens offer a discreet way to dab on-the-fly. Most wax pens are pen shaped, but device’s like the Source Orb 4 utilize powerful mod batteries enabling intensely flavored, large-sized vapor clouds.

E-cigarettes deliver nicotine through a liquid that is heated into vapor and inhaled, cutting out the cancer-causing tar of combustible cigarettes. But vaping liquids contain additives such as propylene glycol and glycerol that can form carcinogenic compounds when they are heated. Diacetyl, a chemical used to flavor some vape “juice,” has been linked to so-called popcorn lung, the scarring and obstruction of the lungs’ smallest airways. A study published in the journal Pediatrics in March found substantially increased levels of five carcinogenic compounds in the urine of teenagers who vape.

In the most recent data, British health officials have found that vaping is at least 95% safer than smoking. They say it is the nicotine addicts, but smoking kills. For that reason alone, many people are making the switch. Vaping is not 100% safe but the name of the game is harm reduction.
A lot of beginners get confused when they try to fill their vape pen for the first time. That’s understandable because the question isn’t really HOW to put juice in a vape pen – it’s WHAT pen are you using. A number of manufacturers have switched to a top-fill system in the recent years. This means that their tanks have a tiny hole at the top that can be opened and e-liquid poured in that way. Others still use the bottom-fill system – the whole tank needs to be unscrewed, tipped over, and then filled.
WARNING: Proposition 65 Be aware that our monthly ZampleBox products and products sold on zamplebox.com may contain nicotine, a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.
Flowers and dry herbs have been used for relaxation as well as medicinal purposes for thousands of years. The popularity of vaping dry herbs is still on the rise, and that’s where dry herb vape pens come in handy. Dried and ground flowers and herbs are put into the chamber of a vape pen. Then the chamber is heated to anywhere between 300 F and 450 F, which vaporizes the ingredients of the material. The vapor is then inhaled.
The latest salvo: A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics found five cancer-causing toxins in the urine of 16-year-olds who inhaled e-cigarette vapor, and a second study found, yet again, that e-cigarettes encourage teens to begin smoking traditional cigarettes.
The AL85 by SMOK puts all the things people love about the Alien, in a much smaller package. Capable of pumping out 85 Watts using a single 18650 battery, this mod fires down to 0.1 ohms. Much like its predecessor, the AL85 has carbon fiber decals and a side-firing switch.
The touchscreen interface has been improved and is more sensitive than ever. Swipe and tap with ease to adjust your settings. The mod features a hidden USB port and a rugged stainless steel 510. The Asmodus Colossal is a dependable stealthy device complete with all the essential safety features.
But their use has been surrounded by debate, focusing on the lack of evidence regarding the harms associated with their long-term use, as well as their potential to act as a gateway into smoking among teens.

Temp control has not been universally adopted by vapers. Those who use TC tend to swear by it, but many other vapers use TC only sporadically or not at all. Since most mods now contain regulating chips, however, and since it’s no more expensive for manufacturers to include temp control technology in their chips, TC has largely taken over the vape mod marketplace.
