Health Ranger Mike Adams And The Death of Steve Jobs
22 Comments Posted by beatis on October 7, 2011
As was to be expected, it didn‚Äôt take Mike Adams long to inform the world of the cause of Steve Job‚Äôs death. It was of course, as it always is, conventional cancer treatments ‚Äì chemotherapy and radiation in particular ‚Äì and not cancer, for in Mike Adams‚Äôs world-of-miracles-that-never-happen, there is no such thing as dying from cancer.

9 Questions that Stump Every Pro-Vaccine Advocate and Their Claims ‚Äì Plus 9 Answers and Some Counter Questions
43 Comments Posted by beatis on May 8, 2010
Although the article referred to in this post is about vaccines and not cancer, we still think it is very relevant, as it clearly shows the methods applied by many altmeds to discredit science and scientists.
On his website, David Mihalovic, who describes himself as a naturopathic medical doctor specializing in vaccine research, asks 9 questions about vaccines which he claims no vaccine-expert can answer.
Well, Mark Crislip on Science-Based Medicine does answer them ‚Äì and at the same time presents some counter questions to be answered by David Mihalovic.

Sodium Bicarbonate Really Works‚Ä¶ for H1N1 influenza!
16 Comments Posted by cryptocheilus on December 18, 2009
Oh, my. We overlooked something. ‚ÄòRespected‚Äô woo-meister Dr Mercola proposes another use for Sodium Bicarbonate! As he believes, it cannot only cure cancer, but is also a good for ‚Ä¶.. treating H1N1 influenza!
In 1918 and 1919 while fighting the ‚Äòflu‚Äô with the U. S. Public Health Service it was brought to my attention that rarely anyone who had been thoroughly alkalinized with bicarbonate of soda contracted the disease, and those who did contract it, if alkalinized early, would invariably have mild attacks.
Miracles do happen!

We have spent a lot of energy here to debunk Tullio Simoncini‚Äôs baking soda therapy as a cure for cancer.

Cancer Metastasis According to the Gospel of Tony Isaacs on Curezone
17 Comments Posted by beatis on November 6, 2009
Doll made of liver cancer cells
Many proponents of alternative medicine claim that surgical removal of cancer is very dangerous because it will cause the cancer to spread. Therefore, they strongly advise against any kind of surgery in case of cancer.
On Tony Isaacs‚Äôs Curezone, a forum member is asking advice on how to treat advanced liver cancer. The patient in question ‚Äì the forum member‚Äôs mother ‚Äì has previously undergone surgery. But according to Tony Isaacs it is precisely surgery that causes cancer to metastasize:

Stephen Serenelli‚Äôs Scientology Cancer Diet Experience: Read It And Weep
5 Comments Posted by beatis on October 4, 2009
On October 26, 2004, Stephen Serenelli died of bowel cancer.
Initially he was treated conventionally, but under the strong influence of his wife Eileen and Ian Shillington, a naturopathic doctor and Scientologist, he decided to follow alternative treatments only.
The alternative treatments made him feel weak and miserable and resulted in his tumour becoming inoperable. This almost certainly shortened his life considerably and seriously compromised his quality of life. The fact that the alternative treatments wore him out so much may have decreased his survival time even more.
Shortly before his death, Serenelli wrote a letter to his ND Ian Shillington. Serenelli also kept a diary during his illness.

Is It True That Only 2 Or 3 % Of Cancer Patients Survive Chemotherapy?
165 Comments Posted by beatis on September 2, 2009
No, it‚Äôs not true: currently, the average cancer cure rate is close to 60%.
Some time ago I happened to read a discussion on Tony Isaacs‚Äôs Curezone, on the best treatment for breast cancer. The thread was started by a woman who had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.
Tony Isaacs‚Äô partner Luella May suggested the forum member paint her breasts with iodine to combat the cancer and advised strongly against surgery and all other forms of conventional cancer treatments:

Tullio Simoncini: Of Rodents, Research and Baking Soda
4 Comments Posted by beatis on August 9, 2009
In the stats of this blog I can see from which pages people clicked to get to our blog. Sometimes I take a peek at these pages, as I did last week.
It landed me in a discussion on the ‚Äòcancer therapy‚Äô of Tullio Simoncini, which included some rather opinionated proponents of our Italian friend. A blog member named Byron stated that there was no evidence to prove Simoncini wrong, so I decided to tell them that research showed that sodium bicarbonate does nothing to stop cancer growth and was found even to stimulate it, giving the relevant link on our blog.

Alternative Medicine and Why It Seems To Work
1 Comment Posted by beatis on June 27, 2009
Very rarely have alternative treatments or medication been able to show any therapeutic value. Yet countless people swear by it and are convinced they can‚Äôt do without.
The mysterious placebo effect has everything to do with this. But what is it and how does it work? Harriet Hall explains.
