4 Simple Ways to Avoid Falling for Cancer Hoaxes
Published by CTOAM on April 9, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Recently, Donald Trump, President of the United States, suggested that the noise from windmills causes cancer. Here at CTOAM, we believe in giving you all the information you need to make educated choices about cancer prevention and cancer care. So here are some simple tips to help you separate fact from fiction! 1. Think Critically When you come across a claim about cancer, the first thing to do is to think critically about it. This means using your common sense and rational brain to figure out if it seems reasonable or not. For starters, just ask some basic questions about the claim and the person (or organization) behind it. For example, when President Trump flippantly mentions that windmill noise causes cancer, you might want to...

Eat to Beat Cancer with Nutraceuticals
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many cancers are profoundly impacted by diet and lifestyle behaviours. For some cancers, preventative actions – like a nutraceutical diet or targeted exercise program – have been shown to reduce the chance of cancer developing by 80%+. What Are Nutraceuticals? Nutraceuticals are parts of foods or supplements that have a proven role in regulating the genes and processes involved in cancer. Each week, new studies emerge that demonstrate the positive impact of nutraceuticals in cancer treatment and prevention. At CTOAM, we have seen remarkable results in our clients after just one week on a nutraceutical diet. But don’t just take our word for it – convince yourself by reading the many peer-reviewed scientific journals, studies, and research-based articles on this subject, and see for yourself. Science-Based Nutrition...

Did You Inherit Cancer Causing Gene Mutations?
Published by CTOAM on February 18, 2019 | Share your thoughts
Many of us have had a blood relative with cancer. If you inherited certain causing genetic mutations, it can increase your chances of developing cancer as well. Two Types of Inherited Mutations There are two types of inherited mutations that could affect you for cancer. 1. Germline Inherited: These are inherited through the family germline, affecting many generations. They’re relatively rare, connected with causing 10 -15% of cancers. 2. Somatic Inherited: In contrast, the other type of inherited mutation is only present in that person – and not their family. So, with this kind, there is no previous family history of cancer. Most cancers are caused by this type of inheritance. Inherited Mutations with NO Family History This type of inherited mutation occurs when the...

Supposed “Cure” for Cancer is Unlikely – But Precision Oncology Brings Hope
Published by CTOAM on February 1, 2019 1 Comment
A news story broke the other day, claiming that a team of Israeli scientists had found a complete cure for cancer that would be available within a year. Sounds incredible, right? There’s only one problem: anytime you see something that claims to be a cure for cancer, you should always approach it with skepticism. The idea of a ‘complete cure for cancer’ is fundamentally problematic when you understand what cancer actually is. Science Based Medicine explains: “Cancer is not one disease, but a category including many related diseases. Different cancers involve different tissues, different mutations, and different behaviors and features. While some treatments are effective against a variety of cancers, there is no one treatment effective against all cancers (let alone a cure for all...

CAM Risks | Alternative and Complementary Medicine for Cancer Treatment
Published by CTOAM on October 3, 2018 1 Comment
Have you ever wondered…what is alternative medicine for cancer? And what about complementary treatment? Is it helpful or harmful…or is it more complicated than that? And how do you tell which is which? And how do alternative medicine for cancer and complementary treatment differ from standard cancer care and Precision Oncology? There’s a lot of confusion about the topic of alternative medicine and complementary treatment, especially in regards to cancer. You might have already seen it pop up in the media, where it’s commonly referred to as CAM – an acronym that stands for Complementary and Alternative Treatment. Many people are unaware of the risks associated with CAM. They assume that a ‘natural’ solution must be better, or at least won’t harm them. But in...

How Genomic Profiling Increases Cancer Patients’ Chances of Survival!
Published by CTOAM on October 3, 2018 1 Comment
In nearly a decade of helping people recover from cancer, CTOAM’s precision oncology specialists have never seen two people with exactly the same cancer. Our specialists have seen people with breast, lung, brain, and prostate cancer, as well as other types of cancer – and, even within the same category, no two people have had the exact same mutations driving their cancer. Therefore, each of our patients has required a unique combination of advanced targeted therapies and nutraceuticals, and sometimes in addition to other treatment interventions. In order to have the best chance of recovery from cancer, your treatment must target your unique genetic mutations. And for that, you need genomic profiling and Precision Oncology’s gene-based approach to cancer care. What is Cancer? Cancer is...

What if Better Cancer Treatment Already Exists?
Published by CTOAM on September 30, 2018 | Share your thoughts
What if there were already better cancer treatment options? Better than standard chemotherapy and radiation? There are! We now have more accurate tests and treatments that help cancer patients live longer than standard cancer care. These treatments have already been approved for use in Canada and have recently become part of standard care in the UK. They’re also already used in most top cancer hospitals in the US, like the Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, and John Hopkins. But, most are not yet available through Canadian public healthcare. It could take upwards of 10 years for these lifesaving treatments to become offered through Canadian public healthcare. That’s where CTOAM comes in. Cancer Treatment Options and Management (CTOAM) is a Canada-based company that specializes in providing Precision Oncology...
