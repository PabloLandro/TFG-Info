Hi, I wonder if DDFs product "intensive holistic lightener" is any good. I have some small red dots in my face and I want to get rid of them. Ive also seen that Clinique has a pen for post acne marks but I dont know if it works or not.
Or if you know any other product that you can buy in Europe please let me know!

Hi and welcome to the board! I am a frim believer in the efficacy of DDF products and so would definitely recommend getting the holistic lighter for hyperpigmentation. I pretty cleared all of my red marks with their 10% glycolic acid toner, but my marks were fairly prominent so I wouldnt recomment this solution unless you have a lot of pigmentation.
Just a word of warning, the holistic lighter that your interested in is fine for getting, but DDF are also advertising another lightener that is not holistic and has a chemical called hydroquinone in it. This chemical is banned in most european countries and is has been likned in some studies to the onset of cancer or permanent facial scarring. I believe that it is because of this that it is so hard for us Europeans to gett DDF products! So just a heads up if you are browsing lightening products always make sure that hydroquinone is NOT one of chemicals that has been intsalled within it.
