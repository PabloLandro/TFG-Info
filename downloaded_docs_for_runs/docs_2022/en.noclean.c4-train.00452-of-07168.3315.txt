>Morphine Overdose
Morphine is the principal constituent of opium and can range in concentration from 4 to 21 percent. Commercial opium is standardized to contain 10-percent morphine. In the United States, a small percentage of the morphine obtained from opium is used directly (about 15 tons): the remaining is converted to codeine and other derivatives (about 120 tons). Morphine is one of the most effective drugs known for the relief of severe pain and remains the standard against which new analgesics are measured. Morphine is marketed under generic and brand name products including "MS-Contin'," Oramorph SR'," MSIR'," Roxanol'," Kadian'," and RMS'." Morphine is marketed in a variety of forms, including oral solutions, immediate and sustained-release tablets or capsules, suppositories, and injectable preparations.
Morphine is highly addictive. Tolerance (the need for higher and higher doses to maintain the same effect), as well as physical and psychological dependence develop quickly. Morphine activates the brain's reward systems. The promise of reward is very intense, causing the individual to crave the drug and to focus his or her activities around taking it. The ability of morphine to strongly activate brain reward mechanisms and its ability to chemically alter the normal functioning of these systems can produce an addiction.
A Morphine overdose happens when you consume more Morphine than your body can safely handle. Morphine users are constantly flirting with Morphine overdose, and the difference between the high they're seeking and serious injury or death is often quite small. Many individuals have died due to an overdose of Morphine, such as celebrity Chris Farley who died of an overdose from Morphine and cocaine.

cold clammy skin
flaccid muscles
fluid in the lungs
lowered blood pressure

Drug Facts
By the early 19th century, morphine had been extracted in a pure form suitable for solution. With the introduction of the hypodermic needle in the mid-19th century, injection of the solution became the common method of administration.
Morphine acts to depress the function of all cells of the immune system.
Methadone is a man-made narcotic used to help people with addictions to opioid drugs (opium, codeine, heroin, morphine).
Individuals are as physically dependent on methadone as they were to heroin or other opiates; this is not recovery from drug addiction.
Methadone enters the illicit drug market primarily as a result of patients selling their prescriptions.
