With the use of recreational cannibis (marijuana) on the rise and legalization of marijuana, patients often wonder how it affects the oral cavity. A study has found that those who use marijuana on a regular basis tend to have more signs of periodontal disease (gum disease). This can include more bleeding and deeper pocket depths. More can be found at: Recreational Cannibis, used often, can increase risk of gum disease
This study was published by Columbia University Medical Center.

Oil Pulling: Yay or Nay?
Posted in Preventative Care, tagged ADA, american dental association, boston financial district, Boston's financial district dentist, Carol Aiken DDS, Carol L Aiken DDS, Carol L Aiken Facebook, carolaikendds.com, coconut oil pulling, downtown boston, downtown boston dentist, Downtown Boston Fiancial District Dentist, downtown crossing, Downtown Crossing Boston, Downtown crossing dentist, Financial distric Dentist, financial district boston dentist, financial district dentist, health, mouth healthy, mouthhealthy.org, oil pulling, Post Office Square, Post Office Square Boston Dentist, Post Office Square Dentist, post office square financial district dentist, research on June 26, 2017| Leave a Comment »
Previously we have written about oil pulling and the possible effects it may have. More recently, the American Dental Association has come out with a statement regarding oil pulling. While there may be benefits, the ADA does not recommended oil pulling as part of a patient daily home care routine. Currently there is not enough scientific research available to definitively determine that oil pulling reduces cavities, whitens teeth and improves oral health and well being (www.mouthhealthy.org).

Tackling the Beast…

Flossing has been in the news a lot as of recently. Several agencies have come out and stated that flossing is not important. The American Dental Association and several other US Agencies have said this not the case for great oral health. These organizations encourage flossing daily as inter-dental cleaners help address areas that cannot be reached with a regular toothbrush. Please read the following rebuttal from the ADA. Please do not hesitate to contact our office with any questions you may have.

Recently Harvard University and University of Nottingham have made the news about dental regeneration. What does this mean for you? It may mean you no longer need the root canal to save the tooth. Currently the two universities are researching the use of stem cells to “heal” the tooth. Read more at: Regenerative Dental Fillings
