Hello. Allow me to introduce myself. I‚Äôm the old lady I never thought I‚Äôd become. I have a jar of slightly unpleasant tasting candy on my counter at all times. Not as unpleasant as ‚ÄúHumbugs‚Äù, but unpleasant none-the-less.
And here‚Äôs the reason why:
4 years, 7 months, 6 days ago my boyfriend forced me to take a vacation. On a houseboat. Now as far as I‚Äôm concerned nothing that involves a house is a vacation. Because if there‚Äôs a house there‚Äôs also cooking, cleaning and tidying to be done. Only a man would think vacationing in a house is an actual vacation.
MY LATEST VIDEOS
Only a man would think vacationing in a house that bobs up and down while violently spinning in circles during the night is an especially fun vacation.
I‚Äôm not even going to talk about the fact that the sleeping quarters doubled as the kitchen table, the toilet was actually IN the shower stall or the fact that the houseboat was INFESTED with spiders. O.K. Scratch that ‚Ä¶ I am going to talk about he spiders for a second.
We had shoved off and were on the water for all of about 5 minutes before I noticed clearish, white spiders. Everywhere. Hanging, dangling from the ceiling. So invisible, you couldn‚Äôt see them until they were about 1/2 inch from your eyeball. Or mouth. Did I mention I‚Äôm phobic? That spiders (along with centipedes) make my airways constrict? Did I mention that?
So 5 minutes into it, my ‚Äúvacation‚Äù involved cooking dinner on a whirling, bobbing boat, with random, drop down stomach turning spiders. And there was literally no escape.
The first night I didn‚Äôt sleep at all because of the legitimate fear that as I slept, spiders were dropping down from the ceiling and crawling all over me. Plus there was that relentless whirling around in circles I mentioned earlier. 12 hours down, 3 more days to go. Oh my God.
That morning at our first port of call we went on a search for a) bug spray and b) Gravol. I got the Spider Blaster immediately. It was in every little shop we went into. Apparently ours wasn‚Äôt the only houseboat prone to spiders. The Gravol proved to be a little more challenging. No one had it.
Finally a little drugstore had a version of Gravol I‚Äôd never tried before. There on the shelf was all natural ‚ÄúGinger Gravol‚Äù. Obviously it was on the shelf because no one else wanted to buy it either. I almost cried. I needed drugs. Big, fat, just this side of legal drugs to deal with what seemed to be a band of drunk leprechauns putting on a circus show in my stomach. With no other choice, I bought the stupid hippy dippy Ginger Gravol. Against my better judgement.
It worked. It worked brilliantly. The Ginger Gravol worked every bit as well as regular Gravol as a matter of fact, without any of the dopey feeling Gravol can give you. Although if any vacation begged for a little passing out, this was the one. Luckily the full can of Spider Blaster I sprayed put a little slur in my step.
Over the past few years I‚Äôve continued to use Ginger Gravol, plus I‚Äôve done a bit of additional research. You see, I‚Äôm prone to nausea because of my migraine headaches. Plus I think I might have emetophobia, but that‚Äôs another story. Suffice it to say, I‚Äôve convinced myself I can catch the stomach flu by talking on the phone to someone who might have the stomach flu.
So what does all of this have to do with the jar of candy on my counter? It‚Äôs a jar of crystallized ginger.
Feeling nauseous? Eat some Ginger.
Crystalized Ginger Slices
Crystalized Ginger Cubes
Through my nausea research, I found the reason everyone tells you to drink Gingerale when you‚Äôre sick is because of the Ginger. Ginger is as powerful an anti-nauseant as any drug you can buy in the pharmacy. Honestly. The studies were all ‚ÄúHey! This is science! We‚Äôre not just making this up!‚Äù
Gravol also sells chewable ginger candies by the way, but buying crystallized ginger is cheaper. It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs cheaper than Gravol. To fill my 500 ml mason jar with crystallized ginger slices, it cost me $10.
Feeling gross? Just eat a piece of crystallized ginger. Just one piece. Even half a piece. Certainly not a handful. I must warn you. It‚Äôs got a bit of a bite to it. I actually quite like it now. It‚Äôs certainly more palatable than the uncooked slice of ginger a lot of websites recommended I try. Um. Ick. Also, crystallized ginger is considerably more portable than Ginger Tea. Vitamin B6 is also recommended for nausea, but you have to take it on a regular basis (as pregnant women do).
So there you have it. How a trip on a houseboat and an encounter with a bunch of paratrooping spiders cured my nausea.
The end.
Wait. It‚Äôs not the end. In the near future I hope to give you directions on how to make your own crystallized ginger. The Internet has several recipes for it. But as we know, the Internet lies. So I‚Äôm gonna give a few recipes a shot. If it works ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll let you know.
The end.

I eat crystallized ginger because I LIKE ginger. I like ginger beer, too. The kind that doesn‚Äôt taste ANYTHING like that sweet soda pop that mentions ginger in it‚Äôs name. I‚Äôm talking the kind that is so horrid tasting that it can cure people of their phobia about spiders, though sadly not emetophobia. I especially like the pickled ginger you get with sushi. And now you tell me that it‚Äôs good for me! Something I like is finally good for me! Now if you can just convince me that single malt scotch is also good for me, I will be ecstatic!

I‚Äôve been a big fan of ginger since I had some medical issues a few years ago that made me really, REALLY, naseous all the time. The prescription stuff made me feel funky, and never totally fixed the nasea, but sipping on ginger tea worked wonders. Now, I‚Äôm the woman who HOARDS all sorts of ginger teas in my cupboards (last count: 10 boxees of 6 different types).
Hey, if disaster strikes‚Ä¶.I will have a calm stomach!

I spent my childhood downing gravol as I always got sick on planes, boats, trains etc., though a part of me thinks this was due to the fact that everyone smoked. I got on to the Ginger for nausea because of my grandmother, who was a wealth of ‚Äúholistic‚Äù info.
I never met a Ginger I didn‚Äôt like ‚Äì even our guinea pig was named Ginger (after Ginger Baker).I try to sneak it into absoloutely everything. Dark chocolate covered Ginger is the best thing ever (found in Canadian chocolate shops, but I haven‚Äôt seen it in the States). I am so ready for you to dredge up the recipe and will be in line to be one of the first testers.

Cyd, in the States, try See‚Äôs Candies. They make the best dark chocolate covered ginger EVER; I could eat pounds of it. The ginger part is kind of moist and juicy rather than dry and crystallized. Wish I could figure out how to make ginger like that.

Candied citrus peel uses glycerin. This keeps it from becoming rock crystal candy. I suspect the same is true for ginger.
I too will be looking for your recipe, when it arrives. Thanks in advance.
(footnote, you can grow ginger as a houseplant by planting the root you buy at the grocery, but it won‚Äôt thrive much. My root shrunk almost entirely away.)

I have successfully made crystallized ginger several times. Sometimes I have cut the ginger into teeny dice and kept the little things in an elderly Altoids tin in my purse. Handy to have ‚Äì supposedly for stomach surprises but mostly for candy nibbling. I like the larger sugar grains on the purchased ginger though. I usually buy mine at store where it is sold in bulk or in Asian markets.

We have so much in common. I suffer from migraines as well as nausea. Lots of nausea. I probably go thru a package of gravol a month, however, i‚Äôve never tried the ginger. So funny you mentioned this today, I had a jar of crystallized ginger in my hand yesterday at Homesense!! I picked it up because the jar and the colour of the ginger was so attractive, I put it back thinking, ick, ginger candy, looks good but probably will taste horrible‚Ä¶.

My mom actually started a little tradition pursuant to this. She hates flying and gets incredibly nauseous when she does. Unfortunately for her, she and I ended up flying a lot throughout my childhood. To calm things down on the flights she would always order a ginger ale and I would copy her and get one too! I still fly quite often and order ginger ale every time, out of tradition! It‚Äôs pretty much the only time I have it. üôÇ

How interesting. I really really hate nausea. I don‚Äôt get migraines but I feel like I am prone to nausea anyway. A while back I was on a different brand of birth control pills that gave me frequent nausea and in desperation I bought this bottle of red goo that claimed to banish nausea. It always freaked me out that I had no idea what was in it. Crystalized ginger sounds much more natural.

I would eat doo-doo if it had ginger in it or on it, I love it so much and chocolate covered ginger is the absolute ultimate in good tasting anything. I used to make a cornflake marshmallow square as a snack and along with the nuts and seeds, I‚Äôd put chopped up candied ginger in it. I had to stop making it because I‚Äôd just sit and eat the whole thing. I keep a ginger root either fresh or in the freezer and peel about an inch, slice it and cover it with boiling water, steep, and you‚Äôve got better ginger tea than you‚Äôll ever buy. Stir frys take on a whole new taste when you slice a little ginger into them. Can you tell I like ginger?

They are probably my favourite cookie, they‚Äôre easy to make, and everyone loves them. Now that they cure nausea! Awesome! Not that nausea is a big problem for me since I appear to have an iron stomach unless I‚Äôve been drinking, or cleaning up kid-puke.

For those having trouble finding crystallized ginger in their groceries, try looking for it with the spices. Sometimes there is a bottle of it in with the other alphabetized spices and sometimes it‚Äôs in a little box on a lower shelf, but I‚Äôve been able to find it in just about every American market.
Find a food coop and you‚Äôll get it cheaper out of the bulk bin. And it‚Äôs always available at any Asian market, usually with candies instead of with spices.

We had some crystallized ginger in our cupboard wen I was pregnant. As ou son got older he insisted on trying it. We thought he would spit it immediatelybut he loved it. He would put it in his mouth and drool all over the place because of the spicy bite that it has, then immediately want another one. We had to limit it because of the sugar but thought it was hilarious.

I have medical issues that causes me to be nauseanted everyday, have been for about ten years. I have the phobia too but throwing up has become almost second nature for me. I have many friends that have these issues and the phobia too, many of them use ginger candies and such. I myself do not like them, althu I found some wonderful cookies at Christmas time at World Market, they also carry the candies and the crytalized ginger. I am wondering if I could do the homemade kind or as someone mentioned the smaller pieces. I have two kinds of Rx Meds and over the counter motion meds on hand at all times but even those won‚Äôt always fend off the sickness. This is a horrible way to live and I am so glad so many have found that the ginger works so very well for them. Thank you for posting and sharing so others may have relief

Hi Karen,
I just stumbled over your blog today and of coarse when i find a cool blog a read its post posts until i am delirious.
Anyways, I have Emetophobia, I have since I have had the capabilities of remembering.
I have done SOOOO much research over the years of how to avoid getting sickness that make you vomit or get nauseous and SOOOOO much research on natural things that prevent it.
Here are some helpful things to keep around incase of nausea for an Emetophobic. (And this stuff is NOT just for motion sickness at all)

and of I carry powdered ginger in my purse at all times, just incase, and Pepto is the last resort.
hope that could help in any future situation!

Notable people with emetophobia
Denise Richards
Charlie Brooker
Regina Hall
Frankie Sandford
Cameron Diaz
Matt Lauer
Howie Mandel
Joan Baez
James Dean
Karen Bartelsen
Jessica Craig
(Okay, okay, I added you onto the list, but I think you‚Äôre every bit as notable as the rest of this group.)

I discovered candied ginger a few months ago. Since then, I have lost many friends who were courageous enough to try it. Did that just read as though they may have died after eating it? Well, they almost did. That‚Äôs what their faces showed. That or they were ready to commit a murder.
I love the stuff, and knowing it‚Äôs good for nausea just made it better for me!

Hmmmm‚Ä¶ You know what‚Äôs even funnier? I have no idea how I got to this post. I JUST noticed it‚Äôs from a whole other YEAR!!!
Well, then. I think it was meant to be‚Ä¶ Cuz after waking up feeling a little under the weather, and reading this, I went down the road to get some. Been eating some all day, and feel better!
Wonder how many kg/lbs your 500ml jar takes! I‚Äôd be surprised to find out my 6.70‚Ç¨/kg is cheaper than Canada!!!
