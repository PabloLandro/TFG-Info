Baking Soda (sodium bicarbonate) for Cancer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I recently discovered (quite by accident) a therapy for cancer that I thought was so simple so appropriate and safe. Knowing that it was just one more suppressed cancer cure, I decided to spread the information as best as I could.
Cancer cannot survive in an oxygenated or alkaline environment and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) provides both oxygenation and alkalinity.
Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) commonly called baking soda is a natural substance used in the human body within the bloodstream to regulate pH as a counterbalance to acid build up, which is critical to life. It affects the pH of cells and tissues, balances cell voltage, and increases CO2 which helps with oxygenation.
Sodium Bicarbonate is a powerful medical tool that everyone would benefit by knowing more about.
Sodium Bicarbonate can be used as a first line of defense for a vast range of sickness including, cancer, flu, diabetes, kidney disease and even the common cold. Sodium Bicarbonate can be used in many forms whether transdermally in a bath, orally or nebulized for lung conditions. It is so powerful in its ability to detox that it can even be used against radiation exposure.
I suggest you do the research on this if you plan to use this method. That way you have ownership of your health care and can approach it with knowledge.
I will introduce you to two physicians who have worked with this protocol.
If you need to get started right away, here is a safe way to start:
Do this once a day for prevention or twice a day if you have been diagnosed with cancer.
Use no more than 2 level teaspoons of baking soda daily.
I like Bobs Red Mill simply because it tastes better.
Dr. Mark Sircus
Dr. Sircus’ theory is that baking soda alkalizes the body causing apoptosis (cancer cells commit suicide)
His protocol consist of drinking baking soda with molasses or organic maple syrup. The molasses acts like a Trojan horse. The cancer cell run on sugar and when then take it in they are alkalized and die.

Dr Tullio Simoncini
Dr. Tullio Simoncini, the Italian doctor observed that all cancer appeared as a white fungus. His research brought him to realize that the proliferation of these tumors was due to a fungi knows as candida albicans. Sodium Bicarbonate dissolves candida albicans and consequently the tumors.
Dr. Tullio Simoncini practices in Italy and uses backing soda therapy in conjunction with surgery.
