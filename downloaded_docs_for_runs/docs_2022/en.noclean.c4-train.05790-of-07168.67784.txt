In this era of technology, it is hard to find someone who does not have a mobile phone. Saying itgenerally, mobile phones have revolutionized our daily life. With the invention of mobile phones our life has become so sophisticated!!! Our lives have become so easy. Sitting in one corner of the world we are able to be connected to any place in the world.
We all know that the mobile phones use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range. These electromagnetic radiations from mobile phones have adverse effect on human health as there has been enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. One of the adverse effect is heating up of the living tissues. Several studies , in several countries have tried to find out what are the other radiation effects. But , it is recommended to restrict children’s use of mobile phones. Many researches have revealed that cellphone tower radiations can cause cancer and other health related problems.
It was reported earlier that there was a growing need for the government to tackle the mobile phone radiation problem on a war footing. Thus, as a result of this, from 1st September of this year , rigorous check are going to be implemented on the electromagnetic radiations that are emitted by the mobile phones.
The Minister of State for Communications and IT , Sachin Pilot mentioned in a newspaper that ” We cannot compromise with health issues… Companies found flouting new regulations will be severely penalised. All these regulations are important to streamline the telecom sector that is growing at a fast pace.”
The Telecom sector is growing at an exponential rate and these new rules will hopefully ensure that in all the progress that is taking place, health issues are being taken care. Mobile handsets emit radiations which is measured in terms of SAR(Specific Absorption Rate) that reflects the amount of radio waves absorped by the body tissues when a mobile phone is in use.
On Wednesday, the Government set September 1 as the deadline for the mobile handset makersto conform to new radiation emission norms which will limit specific absorption rate(SAR) levels for mobile phones to 1.6 watt/kg over six minutes of talking time.
The low-end handsets which were currently used in the country will have to be redesigned to meet the new norms, according to the new mobile phone norms. The telecom ministry had finalized new radiation guidelines for mobile phones for the first time in November last year. The new guidelines also make it mandatory for handsfree devices to be sold with the handsets. Thus, as per the new norms and guidelines mobile phone manufactures will have to display a radiationlevel tag on handsets in India. These norms will ensure to reduce the electromagnetic waves exposure risk.
So, friends, sooner or later this year we will see our handsets with a radiation level tag!!! Ofcourse, a good gesture by our Government….

The ultimatum from the teachers at Eldorado Park Senior Secondary School in Joburg was clear: either the planned cellphone mast went, or they did. For Lionel Billings, it wasn’t a hard decision to make.
“I thought that I could rather lose the mast but not the teachers,” says Billings, the chairman of the school’s governing body. “My kids also attend the same school.”
The school entered into a contract with Cell C more than two years ago and a mast would provide a guaranteed income. “The thought of radiation was in the back of my mind… but some of the schools in the area do have these towers and I thought it can’t be that bad.”
But when construction started towards the end of last year, everything changed. “The teachers told me if the mast went up, they would leave. They had done their research and were concerned about the dangers of cellphone masts.
“Some of the research was very inconclusive, but the bottom line was that the word radiation was mentioned in every article. That was enough for them to say we don’t need this at our school. I don’t want to put our school’s 1 600 learners and 50 teachers at any risk. We don’t even allow cellphones at the school.”
Tracey-Lee Dorny, the chairwoman of the Electromagnetic Radiation Research Foundation of SA, applauds the school’s move, noting that a village in Spain has just removed a cellphone mast after 50 villagers contracted cancer or suffered from headaches, insomnia and depression.
Too many schools in SA allow the erection of cellphone masts on their grounds, says Dorny, despite “burgeoning” scientific evidence about the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by cellular base stations.
“There are thousands of papers showing possible links to cancer, and now increasing incidents of attention-deficit disorder, Alzheimer’s and diabetes from cellphone radiation,” she says.
“When I give talks to schools, the first thing I ask is who is sleeping with their cellphones under their pillows. Almost all the hands go up. You find our children hiding their cellphones on their bodies so that they don’t miss an SMS while their poor little breasts are being fried.
“I teach the children how dangerous phones are and not to put them in their bras or panties, sleep with them under their pillows and walk with them in their pockets.”
Like most South Africans, Dorny, an events organiser, was using her cellphone regularly two years ago. But when she and her family, who live in the upmarket suburb of Craigavon, Joburg, started to fall ill, they looked at the iBurst mast just metres from their home.
“I was actually using iBurst,” recalls Dorny. “But I ended up starting to vomit until I brought up blood. I had a rash from head to toe. It felt like my eyes were melting in my head. My husband had bleeding headaches. My son would wake up screaming in the middle of the night holding his head, which he said felt like a rocket had gone off.”
Dorny says the effects were so severe that the family could not live in their home for 18 months. Eventually, iBurst dismantled the mast, which had been illegally erected, but its former chief executive maintained it had been switched off for weeks at a time and denied it could be the cause of similar illnesses affecting scores of residents in the suburb.
Dorny believes she has another battle on her hands. She says MTN’s testing of 4G LTE (long term evolution) is “scorching” trees in her garden and the surrounding area, and is the source of growing reports of illnesses, including tinnitus, headaches, shooting pains, nausea and dizziness, in the suburbs where it is being conducted.
4G is the fourth generation of wireless communication standard for an era of ultra-fast broadband internet access.
“People ask me if we’ve had a fire here,” says Dorny, pointing to a cluster of some of the 60 burnt and blistered pine trees in her garden – she has numbered each one.
She says 4G has higher penetration levels into buildings, and “therefore into our bodies”. “My big concern is that we’ve got so many service providers rolling out waves and levels of radiation… but they are actually clueless about the damage they are causing… The only reason we have 4G is purely to now flog a whole generation of gadgets to the public. What sort of powers and frequencies are being transmitted to do this and what is it doing to people?”
But Dr Walter Meyer, a senior lecturer in the physics department at the University of Pretoria, disagrees. “In principle, electromagnetic radiation can cause heating effects. The best example is the microwave oven, but the kind of effect to scorch a tree would imply a serious health hazard to people.
“You actually start heating people up, cooking them. It’s certainly possible… but the power output of such a transmitter would be much higher than that which is used for cellphone communication. I doubt whether this scorching is due to cellphone radiation. To have those kinds of thermal effects you should in principle feel the heat.”
Ivan Booth, a former Vodacom spokesman, lashed out at Dorny’s “pseudo-science”.
“I’m willing to put a R1 million bounty out there to anyone who can prove that cellular base stations scorch pine trees,” he wrote.
But Dorny says several studies point to the deterioration of trees around masts. “I’m not an alarmist. I wish I could shout louder. What’s happening now with the mass of towers and all the different layers of technology on top of each other is you’re being exposed to electromagnetic radiation 24/7. You’re not having a choice of ‘I don’t want this coming into my home, it’s making me ill’. You can’t switch it off like you can your cellphone.”
SA is guided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the exposure guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). SA authorities say that there is no risk to the health of the general public from exposure to the microwave emissions of cellular base stations, for example.
Barrie Trower, a military scientist from the UK, on a visit to King Kgafela II of the Bakgatla tribe in Botswana, notes how there are at least 11 international committees that “vehemently” oppose both the WHO’s and ICNIRP’s safety levels.
“This is mostly due to the former’s safety levels being based… on thermal levels, whereas other international studies recognise responses to electrochemical interactions between microwaves and cellular biochemistry and set safety levels according to lower rates.”
The king had invited Trower to speak because he blamed the death of his father from a brain tumour on a cellphone mast erected near the royal residence.
Last May, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the WHO reclassified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as a Class 2B carcinogen – possibly carcinogenic to humans – because of links to some types of brain cancer.
“But this has been ignored by the industry,” says Dorny. “They will keep quoting the ICNIRP. But those guidelines have been declared obsolete by several governments, because it’s only based on six minutes of thermal heating on an adult male… not one organisation has yet declared what they feel is a safe level for children… We’re sitting in 2012 with masses of new technology and huge cellphone use.”
Late last year, a Danish study, billed as the largest of its kind, found that there were no increased risks of brain cancer from cellphone use after tracking 350 000 users for 18 years.
SA, says Dorny, should err on the side of caution and follow the example of Sweden, Canada, France and Switzerland, which have adopted safer radiation limits for their citizens and even prevented wireless fidelity (wi-fi) in schools.
She accuses government departments of passing the buck and leaving SA’s cellphone industry “unregulated” and uncontrolled.
The departments of Health, Environmental Affairs and Communications and the Independent Communications Authority of SA failed to respond to the IOS’s queries.
Last year, Olle Johansson, an associate professor at the department of neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and a scientific adviser to Dorny’s foundation, wrote an impassioned plea to the SA government. He said several studies had demonstrated “cellular DNA damage, disruptions and alterations” because of exposure to electromagnetic fields.
The ICNIRP/WHO public safety limits were inadequate and obsolete with respect to prolonged, low-intensity exposures, he said, and the precautionary principle should be in force in the implementation of this new technology, especially when it came to the exposure of children.
Dorny says her exposure to the iBurst mast made her electrosensitive, which means she becomes ill when exposed to electromagnetic radiation. She wears specially made nets to shield her from radiation at home and when she travels. According to her foundation, 3 percent of the world’s citizens are electrosensitive, and the number is surging.
Dorny is not averse to the use of technology but says that a properly planned fibre-optic network, “from backbone to final source”, is safer if broadband is to be expanded.
She even owns a cellphone. “It’s an ancient thing but I only use it for emergencies. It’s never on. I used to use my phone quite avidly. But I don’t feel well when I do use one. If I have to pick up a smartphone, it actually burns my hand.”
She adds: “Anything… that is going to make you sick is of concern. If it’s going to give you rashes, make you vomit, give you blurry vision, memory loss… that either happens till the signal goes down or you take yourself away.” – Saturday Star

It truly is intriguing that we have observed a fantastic deal about the issues of Cell phones inside the press recently. I have mentioned articles or blog posts in the USA Currently, Ny Times, Wall Road Journal, Reuters, and on Television on CNN, CNBC, and MSNBC. What issues me is the fact that there were scientific studies in Switzerland in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 and yet it had been just as if there was a press blackout here inside the US. And comprehend this was back again when cellular phones were changing over in the 3 Watt telephones which is lots far more energy and thus, extra micro-wave intensity.
That’s to mention, they had been considerably even worse back then to the human bio technique, plus the antennas were extra strong too, and also the cell towers were further apart averaging 7-miles or extra, right now a lot more like 3-miles. This higher energy environment and larger antennas means much more mind cookage! Back then we were informed there was nothing to worry about; completely harmless, now we locate out, nicely, truly they weren’t.
There was an intriguing guide review post on Kurzweil’s Accelerating Intelligence on the web lately on May 24, 2011 titled “Disconnect: The reality About Mobile phone Radiation, What the Industry Has Done to Disguise It, and Ways to Guard Your Family” – Devra Davis, published by Dutton Adult, 2010. The e book review states;
“Much-anticipated, explosive expose of how cellular phone use damages mind cells, especially in children, by one of several world’s foremost scientific specialists within the area – an array of recent and extended suppressed investigation in this timely bombshell. Cell phone radiation is usually a national unexpected emergency. Stunningly, essentially the most common gadget of our age has now been proven to harm DNA, stop working the brain’s defenses, and decrease sperm count while escalating memory loss, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and also most cancers.”
You see, right here is often a gentleman who wrote a entire book on the subject, not only a cutesy write-up for mainstream media. It is bought all the scientific studies, investigation, which includes these most current research every person is reading about displaying how the cellular phone radiation is causing DNA to breakdown, and the cellular phones are carcinogenic.
That’s just scary things, and how about pregnant moms with their cell phones strapped to their hips using the blue-tooth on their ear. Their brains are secure in that situation, but how is their unborn infant undertaking there, I inquire? Still more concerns, but if you want some true solutions, I guess I would suggest this book to you as well. Remember to take into account all this.

Cell phones – an incredibly convenient device that make our lives infinitely easier. While these phones have created great steps forward in communication, talking on them comes at a price.
The massive increase in cellular phone use in our current society has resulted in a large degree of research examining the potential negative health effects they have on humans. Very recent research has shown that microwave radiation emitted by cellular devices negatively influences fetal brains.
The experiment took 32 pregnant rats and divided them into 4 different groups, with one of them receiving no exposure to microwave radiation. The other three groups were exposed to different intensities of microwave radiation from cellular phones, with each of them being subjected for different amounts of time.
Group 1 was radiated for 10 minutes each time, group 2 was radiated for 30 minutes, group 3 for 60 minutes, and group 4 not at all. Each of the groups receiving radiation were radiated 3 times a day from the first day of pregnancy, then for 20 days thereafter. On day 21, the rats’ brains were tested.
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate intensity of oxidative stress and the level of neurotransmitters in the brains of pregnant rats exposed to cell phones. The study concluded with:
Through this study, we concluded that receiving a certain period of microwave radiation from cellular phones during pregnancy has certain harm on fetal rat brains.
This research comes just before Greek scientists demonstrated how frequency electromagnetic fields, namely cell phones, portable phones, WiFi, and wireless computer equipment alter important protein changes in the brains of animals.

A part of me wishes we definitively understood the solution to this question just to acquire people to refrain from speaking on their cellular phones whilst driving. Nothing at all is a lot more irritating on the street than seeing bad driving procedures only to determine the driver blabbing on a phone. Additionally, we realize that driving even though speaking on the cell telephone is equivalent to driving with an illegal blood booze degree with regards to response time and focus around the street. Men and women have been killed in car accidents by a person speaking on the telephone. I used to be inside a vehicle accident about three years ago when I had been rear-ended by a woman speaking on her cell phone. It’s now illegal to speak on a mobile phone whilst driving in California and other states are catching on too. We also understand that a headset or speaker telephone will not minimize the threat of an collision. But I digress, we had been meant to become speaking about brain cancer.
According to the Mobile Telecommunications and Internet Association Americans spent two.2 trillion minutes on their cell phones in 2008 which was a a hundred billion moment boost in the previous year. Mobile phones are turning into far more and extra advanced in their capabilities and simultaneously, rising their radio frequency output. A handful of research have proven an raise in mind tumors on the same side with the head where the consumer holds the telephone, but other research have shown no affiliation.
A 2009 research looked at 23 research of 38,000 persons and found no link between mobile phone use and mind tumors. Nevertheless, there was a subset evaluation of 8 scientific studies which showed a 10-30% improve inside the risk of tumors from long-term use compared to men and women who seldom employed a cellular phone.
The European Environment Company has stepped up and warned in opposition to the usage of cell phones in children due to the fact they have their whole lives in advance of them with exposure to radio frequencies and radiation. John Bucher, the connect director from the National Toxicology Program, testified prior to the Senate’s Health and Human Companies Committee. He said that cellular phone radiation penetrates deeper into a child’s mind due to the configuration of the young, developing skull.
Professor Lennart Hardell is really a Swedish researcher who is at the leading edge of mobile phone radiation and mind cancer threat investigation. He has found an improved risk of brain tumors from 10 or much more years of mobile telephone use. Numerous research of his have been revealed using the following crucial findings:
For just about every one hundred hours of cellular phone use, the danger of mind cancer boosts by 5%. For each and every 12 months of use, the threat of mind cancer boosts by 8%.
Soon after 10 or a lot more many years of digital cellular phone use, there was a 280% elevated threat of brain cancer.
For digital cell phone customers who were youngsters or youthful when they very first started using cellphones, there was a 420% improved risk of brain cancer.
Why is there conflicting proof? Is there special interest concerned and who funded the scientific studies in query? Dr. Hardell’s study is really persuasive and I are likely to trust European studies more than American studies since there’s commonly much less of a money-trail in Europe. There’s quite a bit of funds to become made on cellular phone use and we reside inside a nation exactly where the bottom line means every little thing.
Furthermore, why is it plainly stated inside the fine print of cellular phone manuals to use caution with regards to radio frequencies and warnings about maintaining the phone as far away in the physique as achievable? Radiation decreases as the square of the distance in the phone. The farther the phone is from your physique, the less radiation exposure. A single example could be the Blackberry 8300 which obviously states: “When using any data function with the Blackberry gadget, with or without having a USB cable, keep the gadget a minimum of.98 inches from your physique and it shouldn’t be worn or carried around the physique.” This is apparent enough for me that the cellular phone manufacturers know the potential potential risks of radiation.
Dr. Devra Lee Davis would be the director of the Heart for Environmental Oncology in the College of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and writer from the e book Disconnect: The facts About Cellular phone Radiation, What the Business Has Completed to Hide it, and The way to Shield Your Loved ones. She has testified just before congress relating to this topic and has published a lot of content articles as well. She suggests the next to cut down your danger:
Place your telephone within the “flight” or “off-line” mode when carrying, storing, or charging it. This stops the electromagnetic emissions.
Stay clear of carrying your mobile phone in your body or storing it close to your body at evening.
Utilize a wired headset (not Bluetooth!) or even the speaker-phone mode to help keep the telephone as much out of your physique as feasible when speaking.
Change sides of the head on a regular basis even though talking.
Use text messaging as an alternative to speaking.
Choose a gadget using the lowest SAR doable. SAR stands for certain absorption price, a evaluate in the strength of electromagnetic fields.
Youngsters need to only use cellular phones close to their heads for emergencies. Texting away in the physique is less hazardous for kids than speaking on the cell phone.
Stay away from making use of the telephone though the signal is weak or when moving at large speeds as in a car or prepare. This raises the power towards the phone because it tries to remain connected.
Till far more research is done that is definitely not funded by the phone industry I will treat this just as if cellular phone radiation is in truth detrimental to my well being. It is superior to become secure than sorry along with the scientific studies that show an increased threat of brain tumors are merely also compelling to ignore. Make use of the uncomplicated steps outlined in this article and decide on a phone using a lower SAR to defend yourself from potential harm.

Technology will always be part of the human culture as it makes our life easier than the way it used to be. However, you might also need to notice that it also has its own risk as we speak about the life, especially the health risk like what the cell phone is shown for us. Cancer could be one of many effects that is given by the cell phone as well as the mobile telephone and it becomes main concern for many people. Radiofrequency is one important factor we should know as the reason why cell phone could be really dangerous for our health. Radiofrequency energy that it is emitted by these phones is kind of dangerous and it is important for you to concern much more about that. What do you know about the radiofrequency energy? Have you ever heard of it before?
Form of electromagnetic radiation could be the simplest definition of what radiofrequency is and it can be divided into two big forms, which are ionizing (e.g., x-rays, radon, and cosmic rays) and non-ionizing (e.g., radiofrequency and extremely low-frequency or power frequency). By the time you get so close with that kind of radiation, the chance you get the cancer becomes much bigger than the way it used to be. Non-ionizing might be not dangerous as you see that there are no significant effects that thing to the human health. The general consensus has been that there is no consistent evidence that non-ionizing radiation increases cancer risk.
Based on the research of WHO (World Health Organization, Radiation from cell phones can possibly cause cancer. Through that fact, this world agency started to make lists mobile phone use in the same “carcinogenic hazard” category as lead, engine exhaust and chloroform. There are number of scientists who conducted the research find out that there are enough evidences to categorize personal exposure as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” This study is conducted by 31 scientists from 14 countries, including the United States and they used the method of peer-reviewed studies in order to make the finding of cell phone safety.
Moreover, the research got the real data that cell phone could cause Glioma and acoustic neuroma brain cancer. Other types of cancer might not found yet as they are still looking for possibilities any kind of cancer that can caused by the cell phone. How such a thing could affect your whole body? Non-ionizing is kind of type the radiofrequency that comes from the cell phone and it’s kind of different from the X-ray, but closely same as a very low-powered microwave oven. You could imagine the effect of microwave as you put the food into it which is kind of amazing as it cooks the foods.
You might take the simple description for it as the waves that come from the cell phone are leading to a development of cancer and tumors. I might say that based on those researches; there could be a whole host of other effects like cognitive memory function, because the memory temporal lobes are where we hold our cell phones.

It is actually intriguing that we have observed a superb offer regarding the issues of Cell phones inside the press recently. I have mentioned content within the USA Currently, The big apple Occasions, Wall Road Journal, Reuters, and on Tv on CNN, CNBC, and MSNBC. What issues me is that there had been scientific studies in Switzerland in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 and yet it had been as though there was a press blackout right here inside the US. And understand this was back again when cell phones had been switching over from the 3 Watt phones that is a great deal extra energy and therefore, much more micro-wave intensity.
Which is to say, they were significantly worse back then for the human bio program, and also the antennas had been a lot more strong at the same time, and also the cell towers were additional apart averaging 7-miles or much more, at this time more like 3-miles. This higher energy setting and bigger antennas implies a lot more brain cookage! Again then we had been told there was absolutely nothing to be concerned about; perfectly harmless, now we uncover out, well, essentially they weren’t.
There was an interesting ebook critique post on Kurzweil’s Accelerating Intelligence on line recently on Could 24, 2011 titled “Disconnect: The facts About Mobile phone Radiation, What the Industry Has Done to Disguise It, and How to Safeguard Your Family” – Devra Davis, published by Dutton Grownup, 2010. The book evaluation states;
“Much-anticipated, explosive expose of how cellular phone use damages mind cells, primarily in young children, by among the world’s foremost scientific specialists within the field – an array of latest and extended suppressed research within this timely bombshell. Cellular phone radiation is really a nationwide crisis. Stunningly, the most well-known gadget of our age has now been proven to damage DNA, break down the brain’s defenses, and minimize sperm count though increasing memory reduction, the threat of Alzheimer’s disease, and even cancer.”
You see, here is usually a gentleman who wrote a whole book on the subject, not just a cutesy post for mainstream press. It is received all of the studies, investigation, which includes these latest research every person is studying about showing how the mobile phone radiation is leading to DNA to breakdown, and the cell phones are carcinogenic.
That is just frightening things, and what about pregnant moms with their cellular phones strapped to their hips applying the blue-tooth on their ear. Their brains are safe in that situation, but how is their unborn baby performing there, I ask? Nevertheless additional questions, but if you want some genuine answers, I guess I’d recommend this ebook to you also. Remember to take into account all this.

“”Radio is the transmission of signals through free space by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies significantly below those of visible light. Electromagnetic radiation travels by means of oscillating electromagnetic fields that pass through the air and the vacuum of space.””
Explaining cell phone radiation
Just in case the definition above doesn’t mean much to you, here’s our, easier to understand take on cell phone radiation: As you know, our phones maintain a constant connection with carriers’ networks. This is done because we want to be able to make calls, or to be called, at any time of the day (or night). For this communication to happen, however, our phones have to transmit and receive a special signal, which carries the information that’s to be communicated between the phone and the carrier’s network. This process of transmitting and receiving the said signal happens through radio waves, or radiation. However, it so happens that radio waves have both an electric and magnetic fields, and there you have it – electromagnetic radiation!
For many years, scientists have believed that the type of radiation emitted by cell phones and towers is harmless to health, because it is non-ionizing. Ionizing radiation, such as the one emitted by x-rays and nuclear energy, is the dangerous one. So what has changed that we now have never-ending disputes as to whether or not cell phones cause cancer? Quite simply, cell phones have become so popular and ever-present that if there’s even the slightest chance for them to be harmful, we better do some very serious research before we can decide that’s it’s completely safe to sleep with a phone right next to your head.
Unfortunately, as you may know, a final conclusion is yet to be reached. After numerous researches, some of which continuing for as long as 20 years, there is still no evidence that there’s a direct link between electromagnetic radiation emitted by cell phones and cancer. However, even such large studies are considered inconclusive by some institutions. What’s more, it is said that the effects of prolonged electromagnetic exposure can be observed at a much later period. In other words, we may or may not be doomed, it remains to be seen.
In general, one of the more serious effects that microwave electromagnetic radiation (such as the one emitted by cell phones) can have on us is the thermal effect. This type of radiation is generating a thing called dielectric heating (or RF heating), which is capable of penetrating living tissue. Why is this kind of heating bad? Because your body cannot cool down some of the parts that are typically exposed to phone radiation. Normally, when there are some overheated cells in your body, your brain simply orders more blood to go their way, which eventually disposes of the excess heat. However, as we said, there are some areas in your body that do not have such temperature regulation – like the cornea of the eye or the male testes. Because of that, it’s markedly dangerous to expose those areas to significant heat. Now, just how biologically significant the RF heat that’s coming from your phone is, is… you guessed it – not clear.
What was that SAR thing again?
But just because there’s no direct evidence linking cell phones with cancer found yet doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t take any precautions. Thankfully, governmental regulation agencies around the world have already set up specific standards with regards to the maximum power output a cell phone can have.
As it became clear, a part of the radiation that’s coming from our phones is inevitably absorbed by none other but us. This is where the popular SAR, or Specific Absorption Rate, comes into play. What SAR measures is the rate at which radiation is absorbed by the human body, when the latter is exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields. SAR is defined as the power that is absorbed per mass of tissue and is measured in watts per kilogram. In the U.S., the FCC has set a SAR limit of 1.6 W/kg, averaged over a volume of 1 gram of tissue, for the head. In Europe, the regulatory organs have set a SAR limit of 2 W/kg, but averaged over a volume of 10 grams of tissue. Because of this, when you’re comparing SAR values, you should only compare American ratings with American ratings, and European ratings with European ratings.
In short, the lower the SAR rating of your phone is, the better. But, a lower rating would not necessarily mean that this particular model will be healthier for you. As a whole, it is great to have those SAR limits and to know that phone manufacturers aren’t allowed to do whatever they want. However, it’s still early to say if these precautions have been strict enough to ensue that our wireless devices do not hold any health risks.
All of this is what makes us believe that there’s no reason to panic. At the same time, it also means that it’d be best if we start employing a number of tricks that can potentially lower the risk of any possible health hazards greatly. Dear readers, it’s time to counteract cell phone radiation!

For years we have been warned to limit our mobile phone use and to use hands-free sets in the wake of “”growing evidence that we should reduce exposure”” to cell phone radiation. But the verdict is in and a team of scientists said today the radio frequency levels in our wireless devices puts the five billion users at risk for brain cancer.
According to the World Health Organization for Research on Cancer, which convened today in Lyon, France, those electromagnetic fields that seep from our cell phones increase the risk for glioma, which is a malignant type of brain cancer.
Dr. Jonathan Samet from the University of Southern California was among those discussing the cell phone study.
He said the evidence, while still accumulating, is strong enough to support a conclusion that means that there could be some risk.
One of the biggest concerns about cell phones and cancer stems from the exposure to radio frequency waves. Some researchers suggest that these could have the effect of holding your head near a microwave oven.
Cell phone radiation falls into the same band of nonionizing radio frequency as microwaves used to heat or cook food.
The question about whether or not cell phone users are frying their brain or causing other tumors in the head and neck area has been a hot topic since the 1990s when wireless devices became more widespread.
“Over the last few years, there has been mounting concern about the possibility of adverse health effects resulting from exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, such as those emitted by wireless communication devices,” said Nicolas Gaudin, Ph.D., head of The World Health Organization’s IARC Communications International Agency for Research on Cancer.
The team of scientists within the World Health Organization said a study conducted on cell phone users revealed that spending an average of 30 minutes a day on the phone jumps the risk of brain cancer up to 40 percent.
Oncologists say the most common form of primary brain tumors, gliomas, start in the brain or spinal cord tissues and these lethal tumors often outsmart traditional cancer treatments such as surgery.
Although there are great strides in brain tumor research, this form of cancer can quickly invade healthy brain tissue.
Researchers at the World Health Organization now say “given the large number of mobile phone users, it is important to investigate, understand and monitor any potential public health impact.”
“”It is important that additional research be conducted into the long‐term, heavy use of mobile phones,” said the team director, Christopher Wild.
“Pending the availability of such information, it is important to take pragmatic measures to reduce exposure such as hands‐free devices or texting.”
Cell phones first became widely available in the United States in the 1990s, but their use has increased dramatically since then. According to the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association, there were an estimated 270 million cell phone subscribers in the United States as of December 2008, representing about 87 percent of the total population.
Scientists say that the number of cell phone users is large and growing, particularly among young adults and children.
Today, there are about five billion mobile phone users across the globe representing nearly three-quarters of the world’s population, according to the International Telecommunications Union.
Mobile or cellular phones are now an integral part of modern telecommunications. In many countries, over half the population uses mobile phones and the market is growing rapidly.
It is possible that if there are health effects due to mobile phone use, they might be more pronounced in children because their nervous systems are still developing and their lifetime exposure will be greater than adults, who started at a later age.
In some parts of the world, mobile phones are the most reliable or the only phones available.
Researchers say the number of people using cell phones has quickly increased because of lifestyle changes, advanced services, handsets and increased take-up of mobile health services and mobile banking.
“”Even during an economic crisis, we have seen no drop in the demand for communications services,”” said ITU secretary-general Dr. Hamadoun Touré.
Deeper studies are now underway and should give a clearer picture of the health effects of cell phone use in the near future.
But government officials are now calling for cell phone boxes to have labels much like cigarette packs, with what’s called the radiation “”absorption rate”” for phones when they’re sold. They say the information exists in the packaging material but, nobody really reads all the fine print.
Monday’s announcement by the World Health Organization follows a host of studies and critics that call the data inconclusive.
“”In general, rating agencies such as this tend to be conservative by nature. They have to be,”” said Dr. Henry Friedman, deputy director of the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.
“”The reality is that all of the epidemiological studies that have been done to date have basically been negative.””
The cell phone industry responded by stating that the World Health Organization based their findings on limited evidence. “”But to be clear, there are no studies that conclusively link cell phone use to adverse health effects,”” said Jack Rowley, GSMA Director for Research and Sustainability.
Even the FCC said all cell phones sold in this country are safe, and the American Cancer Society is also on record as saying cell phones are “”unlikely”” to cause cancer.
Many scientists say it could be years before long-term studies on cell phones and cancer are complete.
As the cell phone-cancer conundrum rolls on, the American Cancer Society published options on their website to avoid pressing the device directly next to your ear.
For instance, use a hands-free device such as a corded or cordless earpiece. Using an earpiece moves the antenna away from the user’s head, which decreases the amount of RF waves that reach the head. Corded earpieces emit virtually 0 RF waves (although the phone itself still emits small amounts of RF waves that can reach parts of the body if close enough, such as on the waist or in a pocket). Bluetooth earpieces have an SAR value of around 0.001 watts/kg (less than one thousandth the SAR limit for cell phones as set by the FDA and FCC).
Choose a phone with a low SAR value. Different models of phones can give off different levels of RF waves. One way to get information on the SAR level for a specific phone model is to find the FCC identification number for that model. The FCC ID number is usually somewhere on the phone, sometimes under the battery pack. Once you have the ID number, go to the following Web address: www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid. On this page, you will see instructions for entering the FCC ID number.
Limit you and your children’s cell phone use. One of the most obvious ways to limit exposure to RF waves from cell phones is to limit how much you use them. You may want to use your cell phone only for shorter conversations, or use it only when a conventional phone is not available. Parents who are concerned about their children’s exposure may limit how much time they spend on the phone.
For safety reasons, it is especially important to limit or avoid the use of cell phones while driving.

Do you remember your first day in school? Probably not! Nonetheless your child’s first school day can be a gruesome experience for both parent and child alike, as the mutual bonds of dependency are severed, and the first lesson in “Independence 101″ is imposed on your child. It is the pride and first priority of every parent to provide and protect their family and that’s why we find it hard sometimes to let go and entrust someone else.
Any parent will go out of their way to ensure that their children live a socially, emotionally and productively balanced life. However, the hard earned progress of a balanced healthy life for our children is being threatened by a ubiquitous lurking danger: Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs). How much do you know about the dangers of EMFs? A little? Or next to nothing?
Despite the widespread lack of knowledge about this issue, the dangers are real and potentially very harmful. These invisible elements can silently take away years of life from your children, way before they learn their lesson in independence.
EMFs are present wherever electricity flows. Because of the advent of wireless they can be found in classrooms, playgrounds, homes, and even streets. TVs, lights, computers, overhead electric cables, cellphone base stations, wireless and mobile phones, wireless networks, Bluetooth devices, vacuum cleaners, microwaves, etc are all sources of EMFs. They are everywhere. Isn’t it ironic that the 21st century’s technology revolution that promises lifesaving security and safety could be responsible for nibbling away years of your own, and your children’s, lives?
We provide our children with mobile connectivity to enhance communication and security and use Google extensively to read up on just about anything. This would be just about impossible to give up. But know this; we are increasingly exposing our children to EMFs and directly endangering their health and life, most of the time without realizing. Studies on EMF are quite categorical: They affect human health and could possibly cause cancer.
How do EMFs affect children?
In a new report published this week, John Wargo, Ph.D. professor of Environmental Risk and Policy at Yale University, lead author of the report said, “The scientific evidence is sufficiently robust showing that cellular devices pose significant health risks to children and pregnant women.”
Studies show that the developing organs of a child, lower bone density of the skull, lower body weight, and a less effective blood brain barrier make children particularly vulnerable to the effects of cell phone radiation (de Salles 2006; Gandhi 1996; Kang 2002; Wang 2003; Wiart 2008). Other studies show there is also the risk of a longer lifetime of exposure compounding the effects. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) came to the conclusion that EMF’s could be possibly carcinogenic, which was then adopted as a World Health Organization recommendation. There is also a risk of induction and progression of cancer in children who are exposed to carcinogenic agents. A 2008 study in Denmark revealed that 54% of children born of mothers who were cell phone users had behavioral issues. If the children grew up to be frequent cell phone users, that percentage rose to 80%.
