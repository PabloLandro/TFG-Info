Birth Control Pills
Getting pregnant on birth control is severely negated with the proper use of condoms and birth control pills. The efficacy of these forms of birth control is close to 90%. Women who secretly hope to get pregnant while they are on birth control can take solace from the following tips.
Ways to Get Pregnant on Birth Control
Birth Control Pills
These hormonal pills are to be taken every day from the 4th day of the cycle and continued until the start of the next menstrual period. Their effectiveness increases if you take the pill every day at the same time.
If you are planning to get pregnant, you need to curtail their use like gradually missing out on a few pills or not taking them at the same time every day. This increases your chances of getting pregnant manifold. Taking medication that is incompatible with the birth control also reduces its reliability.

The Condom
Condoms are by far the safest bet when it comes to preventing a pregnancy. If you are planning to get pregnant though, you need to altogether stop using them. On the funnier side, pricking holes in the condoms will also reduce their efficacy in preventing a pregnancy.
Some women tend to make their husbands wear condoms mid way through sexual intercourse. This is not very fool proof as the pre-ejaculatory fluid that men release may also contain stray sperm that can cause a pregnancy.
Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding
Breast-feeding is no longer an effective way of birth control. Many women have gotten pregnant during breastfeeding even though they do not have their period yet.
As the milk supply diminishes, the chances of you getting pregnant increase.
IUD’S

IUD’S
If you have an IUD inserted to prevent pregnancy and are planning to get pregnant, go see your doctor and get it removed as soon as possible.
This will automatically increase the chances of a pregnancy.
Depo Provera Shots
These are hormonal shots, which are administered periodically to prevent a pregnancy. By not sticking to your schedule or completely abstaining from the injections can increase your chances of a pregnancy.

Once you have gotten off birth control you need to increase the frequency of sexual intercourse especially around the ovulation date.
This will increase the chances of you getting pregnant.
Exercise Patience
Normally women who have been on birth control may have some difficulty in conceiving especially if they have been using hormonal methods.An average fertile couple may also take anywhere from 6-8 months to conceive. Therefore, you will need to exercise a lot of patience for it to happen.

Menstruation as a Form of Birth Control
Many women also mistakenly believe that having sex during their period minimizes the chance of a pregnancy.
While this is true in most cases, a large percentage of women have conceived during their period or just before the start of the period. It is pertinent to remember that ovulation can occur at any time during the menstrual cycle and sperm can live in the woman’s body for as long as 5 days.
