How to Eat to Fight off Colds and the Flu - Part I
December 23, 2016 / Lisa Podlecki
A well balanced diet is the key to staying healthy all year long. However, there are certain nutrients that may help prevent the cold/flu or decrease the symptoms we experience. Eating foods rich in these nutrients instead of taking a supplement will not only save you money but will provide you with other benefits such as meeting your fibre intake (i.e. from fruits, vegetables, whole grains) and other nutrients (i.e. calcium in yogurt, iron in pumpkin seeds).
Vitamin C
It may not help prevent a cold but can decrease the duration and severity of symptoms. Since this is a water-soluble vitamin, any amount in excess of what we need is lost in the urine!
RECOMMENDED INTAKE to fight colds:
Do not take more than 2000mg. This can lead to digestive problems and kidney stones.
FOOD SOURCES:
Found in many fruits and vegetables.
Vitamin D
Keeps the immune system healthy!
RECOMMENDED INTAKE:
Note: IU = international units (just how we measure vitamin D!)
FOOD SOURCES:
Not found naturally in most food. Some foods have vitamin D added to it (i.e. milk).
*Think of the size of a deck of cards for meat servings.
** Take a look on the nutrition label, this amount can vary for yogurt.
This is one vitamin I do recommend taking a supplement, especially for those living in Canada where we have minimal sun exposure.
Fluids
Staying hydrated helps moisten the lining the respiratory tract and prevents viruses from entering the body.
RECOMMENDED INTAKE:
Wishing you and your families all the best and health this holiday season.
