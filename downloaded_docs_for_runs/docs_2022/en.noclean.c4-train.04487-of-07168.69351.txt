DAY 2: Health Concerns with Eggs
There are many reasons to reduce or even eliminate eggs from your diet. Recent studies suggest that egg consumption can cause cardiovascular disease, diabetes , and colon cancer.
The research is startling:
If you consume seven or more eggs per week, you increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 19%; for diabetics that risk jumps to 83%.
Consume seven or more eggs per week and your risk of becoming a diabetic is increased by 68%!
People who consume even just 1.5 eggs per week have nearly five times the risk for developing colon cancer, compared with those who consume less than 11 eggs per year.
Even egg whites count. Since most Americans include far more protein than necessary in their diets, adding a highly concentrated source such as egg whites can increase your risk for kidney disease, kidney stones, and certain types of cancer.

21 days of BLOG Updates! Day 1

Happy New Year!
DAY 1: Red and Processed Meat Products: No Safe Amount
Americans love meat.
More than 50% the meat we consume is RED Meat, while 25% of the meat consumed is PROCESSED Meats. Processed meat (including bacon, deli, sausage and hot dogs) is meat that has been preserved with additives or manipulated to its alter color, taste, and durability.
There is strong evidence that consumption of both red meat and processed meat products can lead to increased risk for many diseases, including high blood pressure, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. For instance:
Processed meat products are high in sodium which can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a leading cause of kidney failure, heart failure, heart attacks, and strokes.
These meats are high in saturated fat, which can lead to obesity and cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer of Americans.
The high saturated fat in red and processed meat products causes fat buildup in cells which can lead to the development of diabetes.
Both red and processed meat products contain high levels of N-nitroso compounds which are associated with an increased risk of cancers of the pancreas, stomach, bladder and colon.
In order to PREVENT these diseases, AVOID red and processed meat!
Choosing to replace just one serving of red or processed meats a day with nuts or legumes can decrease your risk for developing these diseases by 10-19%!

For Preventive Care, Primary Care Physicians Are A Women’s Best Bet
Sep 30, 2014 by DrSarahGamble
A new study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA found that women who see a PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN (internist, general practitioner, family practitioner) for their yearly checkups receive a wider range of preventative health services than those who only see their OB/GYN.
To put it simply…
Women of reproductive age who see only an OB/GYN for care may not be receiving the full spectrum of recommended health screenings and preventative counseling. Don’t miss out on a yearly check-up for: hearing loss, vision changes, immunization boosters, colon and skin cancer, cholesterol elevations, thyroid dysfunction, pre-diabetes or even diabetes. Plus, OB/GYNs don’t usually spend up to 50% of your visit counseling for proper diet, increasing physical exercise, seatbelt and helmet use, tobacco and alcohol cessation, depression and anxiety screening as well as intensive obesity prevention.
So ladies, in addition to your yearly appointment with your OB/GYN, make an appointment with a PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN to get on track with lifelong illness prevention through yearly wellness examinations and education.

Hypothyroidism
Sep 25, 2014 by DrSarahGamble
What is Hypothyroidism?
Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too little of the thyroid hormone. As the purpose of the thyroid is to keep your body’s metabolism running, people with Hypothyroidism have a slower metabolism.
What are the symptoms of Hypothyroidism?
Symptoms may include any of the following: feeling run down, slow, depressed, sluggish, cold, tired, having dry skin and hair, constipation, muscle cramps, or weight gain.
What causes Hypothyroidism?
In the United States, most cases of hypothyroidism are caused by a condition called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, in which a patient’s immune system attacks and destroys the thyroid. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is lack of iodine in the diet. Hypothyroidism can also be caused by certain medications, be present from birth, occur during or after pregnancy or even from inflammation during a viral infection.
How is the diagnosis made?
A history of symptoms, a physical examination and laboratory tests that measure the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood are the first steps. Taking a measurement of thyroid hormone (thyroxine,or T4) and the detection of antithyroid antibodies that attack the thyroid may help in diagnosing the cause of Hypothyroidism.
How is Hypothyroidism treated?
Synthetic thyroxine: Thyroxine (T4) is the major hormone produced by the thyroid gland and pure synthetic T4, taken once daily by mouth, successfully treats the symptoms of hypothyroidism in most patients. For the few patients who do not feel completely normal taking T4 alone, the combination of synthetic T4 and T3 (Cytomel®) may be of benefit.
Desiccated (dried and powdered) animal thyroid: now mainly obtained from pigs,was the most common form of thyroid therapy 40 years ago before T4 was able to be synthesized in a pure form.
Followup?
Long-term follow-up and family members at risk. If you have Hypothyroidism, you need to see your doctor for follow-up at least once a year so that your hormone levels can be checked and your dose adjusted. Because hypothyroidism often runs in families, examinations of your family members may reveal other individuals with thyroid problems.

Acute Teen Migraine Attack
Sep 12, 2014 by DrSarahGamble
What to do:
During the attack, advise the teen to lie down in a cool, dark and quiet room. Encourage them to sleep with the affected side of their head down. Sleep it’s the most potent anti-migraine treatment, as activity can aggravate the pain.
Some patients find that ice or pressure on the affected artery can temporarily alleviate pain.
Digestion slows down in most migraine patients and causes delay in the absorption of any medications taken to help with pain. Take 200mg of Ibuprofen with a carbonated beverage to improve absorption.
Stronger analgesic medication, such as butalbital from your physician may be necessary if the above methods don’t work. Another prescription medication like Promethazine diminishes any nausea, causes beneficial drowsiness and seems to decrease pain; therefore, it frequently is used as a rescue medication.
