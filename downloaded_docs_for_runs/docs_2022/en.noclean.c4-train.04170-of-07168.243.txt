Drinking Your Own Pee Is Probably Not Helpful, Health-Wise
The science behind it is iffy at best.

A 33-year-old woman in the U.K. says drinking her own urine every morning has completely transformed her health. She also rubs it on her face as an exfoliant and moisturizer.
According to an interview with the Daily Mail, Kayleigh Oakley discovered urine therapy while researching alternative medicines to relieve symptoms of a lifelong auto-immune disease called Hashimoto's, as well as chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia.
“It was so draining. If I did any strenuous activity I would be in bed for week, and life became pretty miserable,” Oakley told the Daily Mail.
So for the past two years, she’s been peeing into a water glass in the morning, drinking it down, and dabbing a little on her face before getting in the shower.
“It doesn't taste of much,” she said. “It's a bit salty and you can taste some minerals, but because I have a vegan diet, it isn't strong.”
Oakley says she’s never been grossed out by the idea and said urine is “just a sterile filtration of the blood.” But the science on this is iffy at best, according to the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology in a discussion of “urine therapy” to treat acne.
Urea, which is a crystalline breakdown of protein metabolism excreted through urine, is used in many health and beauty products, but lab-manufactured urea works differently than the liquid straight from your body, the report says.
“Likewise, although initially sterile, urine left outside the body for an extended period of time becomes a growth medium for bacteria,” the authors of the report wrote.
Even fresh urine, according to reporting by Marie Claire U.K. writer Anita Bhagwandas, who tried out drinking her own urine for a week in the name of science, is mostly just water.
“Urine is approximately 95% water and 5% nutrients like calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc,” Shona Wilkinson, head nutritionist at NutriCentre, told Bhagwandas.
Dr. Zaki Almallah, consultant urologist at BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, was even more skeptical of the practice. “The kidneys filter the blood and any excess fluid, and salts and minerals are expelled,” he told Bhagwandas. “The point of urination is to rid the body of excess. Why would you want to re-absorb that? The only time it’s medically recommended to ingest urine is if you’re stranded without food or water for many days.”
