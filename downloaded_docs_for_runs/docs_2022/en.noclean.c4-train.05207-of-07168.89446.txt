While it is theoretically possible to water, or even alcohol, in a vape pen, it’s not recommended. Water quickly reaches its boiling point inside a powered up tank, and getting hit in the face by scalding hot droplets is incredibly dangerous. In addition to that, even the best vape pens can’t function properly when filled with water; their atomizers will quickly burn out, producing a sickening burnt taste, and will then need to be replaced.
Vape Cartridges which are spun and locked onto most vape pens, can even hold your favorite oil or wax. The heating mechanism on our pens are the absolute best in the industry. Several of our vape pens feature a button-less heating mechanism, you literally puff the pen at your own pace.

There’s no sense in insisting on the fact that vaping is healthy – inhaling anything other than pure air into the lungs definitely isn’t. However, research (Cochrane Review) has shown that vaping doesn’t seem to have any negative short-term health consequences.
Hi Amanda. I wouldn’t get the iStick 50W, as it had some autofiring issues. Any of the other three are solid choices. The Subox Mini has a larger tank than the Nano, but the Nano is slightly sleeker in terms of the design of the box itself. The Evic Mini looks great as well and you can’t go wrong with any of those three you mentioned.
The mod features a three piece design, with colorful acrylic panels. The mod goes up to 85 watts with full TC abilities and upgradeable firmware. If you love the Pico, but also want to use larger atomizers, now you can. Combined with the ELLO, this is an excellent and versatile starter kit.
If you are just starting out and want to see how easy it is to make the switch from tobacco to vape check out our starter kits such as the Smok Alien Baby or the Smok V8.

In the most recent data, British health officials have found that vaping is at least 95% safer than smoking. They say it is the nicotine addicts, but smoking kills. For that reason alone, many people are making the switch. Vaping is not 100% safe but the name of the game is harm reduction.
Every vape pen consists of two parts: a battery and a heating chamber (a tank or a bowl, depending on the material that you use). The battery supplies the power to the coil in the chamber, which, in turn, heats up the material, creating vapor which is then inhaled through the mouthpiece. Best-rated vape pens don’t burn the vaping material; instead, they slowly cook it until it reaches its evaporation point.
Vape pens function and also look nearly identical to an electronic cigarette. They really could pass as just an upscale ecig. Both contain a battery-powered atomizer that vaporizes material, but instead of nicotine, vape pens vaporize dry herbs, wax, and oils.
