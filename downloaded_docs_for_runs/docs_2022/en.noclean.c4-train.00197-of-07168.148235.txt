What is Oil Pulling (OP)?
Oil Pulling is a safe, simple, cheap and gentle ‘do it yourself home remedy’ that cures and prevents diseases and extends your healthy life.
It involves rinsing the mouth with 1 tablespoon (10ml) of oil for 15 to 20 minutes and spitting it out. You can use either sunflower oil or sesame oil, both of which are usually used for cooking and readily available in the home.
This simple therapy is completely harmless as you do not take any medicines - even the oil you use is spit out after OP. By helping the body get rid of toxins that have accumulated, Oil Pulling promotes self healing from within.
Oil Pulling has been mentioned in the ancient texts of Ayurveda. A similar process was also published at a conference of the “All Ukrainische Union, “of the oncologists (Specialists for tumor diseases) and bacteriologists, by Dr.med. Karach. Over the years, this simple therapy helped cure diseases of thousands of people around the world.

I have just begun oil pulling. I am using sesame oil. Have you heard of people having a gag reflex when they first start? I have not been able to do it for the recommended time but I want to continue. Some dental problems led me to look for answers and I found several websites on the subject. I would appreciate a reply to my email. Thanks for any help.

Sandy,
Please experiment with a different brand of oil or even a different type of oil such as sunflower oil. This might help you overcome the gag reflex.
You have not indicated the dental problem for which you are doing oil pulling.
Oil Pulling is known to
1, Fix the loose teeth
2. Remove the scales on the teeth and make them white.
3. Remove sensitivity and pain
4. It makes the gums healthy and removes any infection.

I too have just been doing oil pulling for a week. I have developed an extremely sensitive tooth, and lost my voice. Could these be related to a healing crisis? Overall, I began to feel very good after 3-4 days. I am still at it.

It may not be a reaction. Get your teeth checked by a dentist – they may be damaged or worn out. Continue to do OP for your throat – it will get cleared and voice will become better. Sensitiveness of teeth normally decreases and will go in course of time with OP.

This therapy will certainly help in all your three problems.
This therapy will certainly help you.You will start feeling active immediately after you start OP. Your tired feeling will also disappear. Dandruff will take time , may be a few weeks to cure.

More than brushing the teeth before OP , it is better you clean your tongue and wash your mouth before OP and then brush and clean your mouth after OP.

Use sunflower oil or sesame oil if possible. You will get better much faster. Olive oil is not recommended for OP.

I suggest you continue OP for one or two weeks.This will only help control infection if any and reducing pain.After this period you can decide to continue or not.

SallyAnn Goebel :Will oil pulling heal cavities and prevent the formation of cavities?
I have a cavity that has been forming for awhile it was turning dark in color i do not go to dentists been once to have a tooth pulled cause pain was unbearable. So anyway last week around thursday my tooth with the cavity started hurting very painful throbbing so i googled natural ways to heel tooth pain and oil pulling came up and the rest is history folks! Started pulling that sunday and by tuesday the pain was gone! The tooth was sore and tender but not throbbing pain, i kept pulling 2 times a day and wensday the soreness was gone! And it is now friday and i swear to you my tooth where it was turning dark in color is turning white again! All in less than a week! I been using cold pressed organic sesame oil from whole foods buy it for 5.99 a bottle what can you lose!

Dr. I was recently diagnosed with burning mouth syndrome. I’m wondering if OP will help this too. Do you know much about this and are they actually any cures. He just gave me some stuff that mixed with water will make the mouth/tongue area numb. I’ve read to take Vitamin B for it. Is this true? Thanks for your help.
[TK Rao]
Please try doing Oil Pulling with Ghee or Honey for this problem. If it doesn’t improve within a week or two, you may stop doing OP.
OP with oils is not advised in this case.

I have been oil pulling for three days. I had a deep cavity filled a month ago, which caused infection, took anti-biotics which got infection out of jaw, I think. So, tooth hurt before I started op. Now, tooth does not hurt, but gum around tooth is swollen and I believe infection is making its way up the gum. Is this correct? I plan to continue oil pulling because I believe the root of my tooth is alive and I can heal this infection. I really dont want a root canal. Im scared that because the tooth was filled and then infected, I may abcess where the gum is swollen and painful.
[TK Rao]
Oil Pulling should reduce the infection of the gums if you continue. In case it doesn’t reduce in 2 weeks, please visit your doctor.

I’ve been doing OP for 4 months now. But what happened is that I’ve gained too much weight. I don’t know why because lots of people claimed that it helps loosing weight. Does anybody have the same problem as me? I’ve been having a very healthy diet that I’ve been doing for years. I’m a lil bit overweight so this worries me a lot
[TK Rao]
Oil Pulling will not increase your weight. If at all it might reduce your weight marginally in the beginning. It will certainly improve your metabolism and circulation of blood in the body. You may be unconsciously be eating more.

I’m in Indonesia, where it is easy to get lightly filtered palm oil, which is related to coconut oil. I’m going to try it, since the sesame oil is expensive here. Any recommendations?
[TK Rao]
You could also try doing OP using sunflower oil and compare it with the results of palm oil. I would be thankful if you could keep me updated on the result

How would organic virgin coconut oil work for Oil Pulling? I know it to be wonderful stuff for eating and cooking, and it has it’s own anti-germicidal benefits. Have you had any experience with this oil, or comments from readers?
[TK Rao]
Using coconut oil for doing OP as a daily habit has not been found to be good.

Hi,
I have started oil pulling, I suffer from PCOS and read on earthclinic.com that it can be reduced. I have also started apple cider vinegar to help with PCOS… but I experience high sensitivity in my teeth after drinking ACV. I don’t want to give up oil pulling or ACV…what can I do to reduce the pain… thanks in advance
[TK Rao]
OP normally reduces sensitivity of the teeth. ACV might be the reason for higher sensitivity of teeth.

Will the detox that you go through during oil pulling have an affect on my bio identical hormone pellet implants? They are very expensive and I’d hate to think that this would deplete the pellets sooner than they are supposed to.
[TK Rao]
I suggest consulting your doctor.

I woke one morning about 2 years ago with a new mole (about the size of a sesame seed) on my jawline. I hadn’t noticed it before, but was hard to ignore for the extreme itching. I ran to the mirror to find an inflamed, brownish raised mole that was also flaking. My instincts told me that I was growing a skin cancer, though I did not visit a physician for diagnosis. I will also note that I had a root canal on the molar adjacent to the mole. I then remembered reading about oil pulling or oil swishing in a book. I immediately ran out for some organic sunflower oil and tried it. By the end of the day, the itching was gone. The mole was considerably smaller the next day and gone in 2 or 3 days. Amazing!

I have been oil pulling for about a week now, using extra virgin olive oil. I started this treatment so I can get a loose tooth ready for a root canal. The result? The loose tooth is now firm in place. I have had a slight swelling around the tooth area but I know that is the detox effect happening. I will continue with this protocol daily but, using sunflower or sesame oil (olive oil tastes yeeky!). I also have a feeling of general well being…..
I wish everyone great luck.

I just started oil pulling yesterday with sunflower oil. My teeth were a bit sensitive, but they began to feel better after doing oil pulling just once. Also, it’s made my skin a bit softer. I’m glad I found out about this. It’s surprising that something this simple can do so much good.
