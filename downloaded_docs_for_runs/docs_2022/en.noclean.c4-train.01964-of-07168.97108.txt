What is cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a lipid substance. Cholesterol is needed to build cell walls, formation of bile acids, hormones and vitamin D supplements.
Are there different kinds of cholesterol?
It is usually about two kinds of cholesterol: LDL, “bad” cholesterol, is transported to cells via the blood. Too much LDL can be stored in the vessel walls and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. HDL, the “good” cholesterol, carries away LDL cholesterol. HDL has a protective effect.
It shows that food is important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Dietary supplements of vitamin E and CoQ10 may increase the protective effect.
Reduce the saturated fat found in fatty dairy products. Eat more soluble fiber found in root vegetables, beans, lentils and chickpeas.
Exercise not only increases your metabolism, but also your good cholesterol. Exercise also helps you maintain a healthy weight, which is another key in how to lower cholesterol levels. Exercise or physical activity is an excellent way to lower LDL levels while helping to increase HDL levels.
Fiber is is essential for healthy diet that contain varying amounts of unsoluble and solvable fiber. Fiber lowers your cholesterol. It binds to the cholesterol in your body and pushes it out from your body. Fiber can be soluble and insoluble, and most plant foods contain a combination of both.
Fish, with a high content of antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids also helps to lower cholesterol levels. High quality, concentrated fish oil supplement is still the best and most effective way to get optimal amounts of omega 3 for the body.
1. Avoid stress. Eat at your leisure. Stress steals nutrients. Stress hormone cortisol increases blood fats.
2. Eat more chicken or other poultry and the fungus Quorn. Eat less red meat and fatty dairy products.
3. Avoid chocolate, cakes, tarts and other pastries.
4. Eat more healthy monounsaturated fat foods found in fish, olive and canola oil.
5. Eat more of water-soluble fibers found in root vegetables, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, fruit, beans, lentils and chickpeas.
6. Stop eating butter, fat cheese and caviar, sausages and liver pate. Switch to mashed avocado for example, or low-fat cream cheese with finely chopped red onion and a little lemon juice.
