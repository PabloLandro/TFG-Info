Spring: 3 foods you should be eating now!
Blog DietSensor Cardiovascular disease and nutrition Healthy Eating , 5 April 2018
Yay! Spring is finally here! Mother nature is slowly waking up from her long winter sleep and everything around blossoms into beauty. Spring is a particularly euphoric period as it brings a burst of colors, light and warmth after a seemingly endless winter. It’s the perfect time to start anew; improve our lifestyle and dietary habits (After all, isn’t it the season of transformation?). We have picked some foods for you… Here’s why you should include them in your diet…
1. Oily fish to mend your heart!
Despite their name, oily fish are one of the healthiest foods, a real treasure trove of nutrients! They have a complete amino acid profile and unlike other animal protein sources, they contain up to 40% of the total lipids in the form of highly unsaturated long-chain fatty acids (e.g. wild Atlantic salmon). In addition, oily fish are excellent sources of vitamin B, A and D as well as trace elements such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, copper, selenium and iodine.
The American Heart Association recommends consuming at least 2 servings (approx. 100 g per serving) of cooked fish per week, preferably oily fish (e.g. salmon, sardines, herring, albacore tuna, anchovies, etc.) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Eat a variety of fish (ideally eco-labelled fish to ensure quality products and to encourage sustainable fishing as well!).
And above all, avoid frying them as this may lead to a loss of omega-3 and an increase in other fatty acids (e.g. trans fat), depending on the type of fat used.
2. Eat your beets!
Sliced or diced, raw or cooked… Beetroots have conquered our plates and palates by its subtle sweet taste, crunchy texture, and great versatility. In addition to containing fiber, it is a healthy source of carbohydrates as it has a medium glycemic index and contains many vitamins (A, C, folate, niacin and biotin) and minerals (iron, magnesium, selenium, potassium, zinc, etc.). A distinctive quality of beetroots is their high betalains content, a class of pigments which not only confers to them vibrant red hues but also many surprising benefits.
3. Strawberry Merry
Who on earth doesn’t like these sweet and tangy fruits? Strawberries are particularly rich in vitamin C, an essential element for the maintenance of many vital functions – e.g. it plays an important role in the absorption of iron and the synthesis and repair of collagen, which is a component of blood vessels, muscles, skin, etc. Strawberries also contain trace elements (such as manganese and potassium) and antioxidants (flavonoids and ellagic acid) that, according to studies, help to slow down cellular aging and prevent many chronic diseases mentioned above. And the “strawberry” on top is that they are low in calories (only 30 kcal per 100g)!
Interview: Behind the scenes of DietSensor
Blog DietSensor Diabetes and Nutrition , 9 March 2018
Astrid Bonnasse, the co-founder of DietSensor, talks about the main features of this application that has revolutionized the management of macronutrients.
Tell us the story behind DietSensor. Was its creation serendipitous?
The creation of DietSensor is not at all serendipitous. In 2013, our nine-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Overnight, we had to learn how to calculate the number of carbohydrates so as to inject the right dose of insulin. However, the only information we had, was the nutrition facts labels. We were so struck that in the 21st century, there were no simple and efficient solution. We had to find a way to help our child and all diabetics facing the same issues. It was then that we stumbled on this famous miniaturized scanner “SCiO” and decided to use it to create the first food database worldwide together with the app that would give all the necessary information: DietSensor. With this scanner, there is a way to scan your food and know the amount of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, wherever you are. We immediately realized that this application would be of use not only for Type 1 diabetics like our daughter, but to help improve health conditions affected by dietary imbalance through healthy eating habits: type 2 diabetes, overweight, obesity, cholesterol and so on. We built a network of doctors and dieticians and injected into the application the advices of health authorities in terms of nutrition, taking into account all these pathologies.
When we won the Best of Innovation Award at the CES Las Vegas in 2016, it was for us the proof of all the good that emanates from this adventure.
What message does DietSensor convey?
We want people to be aware that DietSensor is a solution based on most renowned scientific studies. The app is not a scam and does not make illusory promises. The primary message is simply that it is important or even essential to get back to a healthy diet. A message that has not changed since the Hippocrates’ time. No current diet adopts this approach. It’s quite the opposite, they suggest rapid weight loss with the assured risk of the yo-yo effect, as found by many studies. Losing weight should be regular and stable, while eating healthily and without interrupting the intake of any essential macro nutrient.
What is the difference between DietSensor and the other applications?
Unlike other apps, DietSensor does not address calories directly. We firmly believe that dealing with calories through high or low caloric diets is a mistake. This approach is far from being enough. We need to balance our food and get back to our good old habits. We used to eat healthily earlier on but nowadays, what is sold to consumers may not necessarily be healthy. Our nutritional programs aim to help users according to their condition and we offer them specific help based on their health status. The objective is knowing how to prevent or mitigate diseases by eating healthily.
How does it work?
Like for all nutrition apps, you’ve got to have determination to record what you eat, and this can be done without the SCiO. The app is used by people fighting obesity, by those who want to learn about diet balancing and by fitness people. But unlike the other applications, DietSensor is not only about recording your meal but it advises (portions, food to balance,…) and educates on nutrition through training and real life experimentation.
For type 1 diabetics, DietSensor indicates the number of carbs they can have on their plates, making insulin dosing easier. It is also accompanied by a program to help these patients better understand functional insulin therapy. For people with type 2 diabetes, DietSensor helps them to rebalance macronutrients not only for losing weight healthily but also gives them the possibility of reversing their health condition, as proven by several studies and as experienced by some of our users.
Does DietSensor replace medical monitoring?
Of course not! We don’t want to replace doctors. Quite the contrary, we want DietSensor to be a tool for easily collecting data and feedback from patients, enabling better follow-up on a daily basis. DietSensor wants to become a companion of doctors, dieticians and patients. In fact, we observed that information sharing and follow-up are difficult. The patient has the possibility to share reports rich in information with health professionals, if he wants to.
What are your views on fad diets?
When you claim faster results, it’s expected that people want to follow them. However, these so-called miracle diets are extremely harmful because they don’t promote a balanced diet. You can very well reach the results promised, but as soon as you stop, weight regaining is inevitable. In addition, these plans are very restrictive and have a significant social impact. At DietSensor, we recommend healthy weight loss through portion management. It’s true that in some cases, certain foods must be reduced or restricted. It all depends on the condition.
Dietsensor has had a remarkable journey. To what do you dedicate this success?
Our journey was indeed remarkable in the sense that we had an international exposure from the very beginning with the CES award. DietSensor has been ranked among the top 10 most innovative and successful start-ups in the world! We announce this week the launching of DietSensor worldwide as we have been receiving requests around the globe and we can no more restrain to Europe and North America. Helping people who are struggling with their nutrition is at the same time a passionate and challenging adventure. Our mission remains the same, that of always helping others.
Any future projects?
Given that DietSensor is now available worldwide, we wish that more and more people around the discover and use DietSensor. We want everyone to know that health issues related to nutrition can be prevented by adopting healthy eating habits! We are currently working with several doctors who are convinced about DietSensor, with hospitals and also enterprises who want to propose this approach to their employees.
The Importance of Macronutrients in Weight Loss
Blog DietSensor Cardiovascular disease and nutrition Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating , 14 December 2017
Counting calories is an important part of making smarter nutritional choices. Dieticians, nutritionists, and fitness experts alike now recommend looking beyond the quantity of calories, and measuring the macronutrients of the food you eat in order to achieve weight loss goals. This is now being called macro dieting. Macro dieting aims to feed the body with ideal nutrients that can make it more efficient. Let’s be honest, dieting is not easy. But, good nutrition and an active lifestyle are essential components to being health. Creating new eating habits can start with understanding the breakdown of macronutrients and why they are so important.
What are macronutrients and what are the benefits of a macro diet?
Macro dieting balances the intake of three key macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Our body needs each of these for energy and to function properly. They are also needed for the development of new cells and the proper functioning of vital organs. Nutrition experts recommend macro dieting in order to make smarter choices about meals. As there are several health risks associated with an excessive intake of carbs and saturated fats, experts recommend a healthy balance of these macronutrients to meet health requirements.
Getting started with counting macronutrients
The amount of daily macronutrients intake and how they are distributed per day are influenced by many factors including morphology metabolism, level of physical activity, dietary habits, and any known chronic conditions.
Health experts advocate the following ratios: 45-55% of carbohydrates (45-55%), protein (15-25%), and fats (25-35%).
This equation and distribution become more complex for those with abdominal fat, diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, or kidney problems. The first step is to determine the appropriate ratios that are best for you. This can be done with help from a certified dietitian, or a digital food tracking tool like DietSensor. Understanding the perfect breakdown of macronutrients is a goal worth striving for. With proper guidance and digital tools now available, you can start to see the results with your weight loss goals.
Does Portion Size Really Matter for Healthy Eating?
Blog DietSensor Cardiovascular disease and nutrition Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating , 4 October 2017
There are different myths and misunderstood facts that circulate about weight-loss, health, fitness and food choice. Some of these are simply urban legends, while others may have been true at some point. Today, there is overwhelming scientific evidence that weight-loss has a direct connection to the quality and quantity of the food that we eat. While some may think or tell you that portion size doesn’t really matter if you’re eating healthily, we believe that portion control is important even though you are eating the healthiest of foods.
Let Portion Control Become Routine
Portion control can become a healthy routine to avoid diseases such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease. There are various techniques used to measure portion control. One is to compare food portion size to the size of object. One cup of yogurt is equal to the size of a baseball or 3 oz. of meat to a deck of cards.
A recent study has demonstrated that using smaller plates can help to reduce portions of foods. Researchers from the Cornell University found that people who ate from smaller plates believed that they were eating on average 18% more calories than they actually were. Thus, they recommended that instead of using restaurant-sized plates, a regular dinner plate should be no bigger than 10 inches.
Find the method of portion control that is best for you and let it become a good habit for nutritious eating!
Childhood obesity: an ever-greater social concern
Blog DietSensor Cardiovascular disease and nutrition Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating , 17 September 2017
If in ancient times, being fat was a symbol of wealth and abundance, nowadays, it is a common fact that overweight and obesity may increase the risk of many health problems. Moreover, the subject of childhood obesity is becoming an ever-greater social concern at present. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), childhood obesity is one of the biggest public health challenges in the 21st century. This is a phenomenon that particularly affects low- and middle-income countries.
According to WHO predictions, over the next decade, more than 42 million children would be overweight. More than 80% of them would live in urban areas. Childhood obesity is a topic of interest to many researchers. Recent studies have shown that obese children may remain obese even in adulthood. They are thus likely to develop an earlier age, non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, obesity and related illnesses are preventable. Remember, prevention is always better than cure.
How to diagnose childhood obesity?
The body mass index (BMI) is a very useful tool to detect obesity in adults. However, to facilitate diagnosis of obesity in children, WHO recommends the use of the BMI-for-age percentiles. In fact, children’s weight cannot be measured using solely BMI. According to WHO, the BMI calculations must be supported and complemented by the BMI-for-age percentile graph. For an efficient medical follow-up, the child’s health record should be kept up-to-date. If your child’s BMI keeps on rising, you should seek professional medical advice.
According to the National Institute of Health Education and Illness Prevention (Inpes), the Body Mass Index is a good way to define adiposity. It varies according to age. The BMI increases during the first year of life, decreases until 6 years and then increases again. The BMI-for-age percentile graph can be used to identify the child’s obesity risk. Overweight is defined as a BMI at or above the 85th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex. If the BMI is above 97th percentile, the child is obese.
Help your child develop healthy eating habits
Healthy eating habits should be developed at an early age. It is the parents’ responsibility to ensure that their children have balanced diets or eat healthy portions of food. If healthy eating habits are inculcated during childhood, healthy eating would be quite natural for the child.
Introduce healthy foods in your child’s diet from the age of 6 months. According to nutritionists, you can start with fresh vegetable purees such as carrot and zucchini. Fresh fruit juices can also be given to children at the age of 6 months. Remember, a good leader must be an example under all circumstances. If you want your child to develop good eating habits, you must be an example to be followed.
Be creative by exploring and experimenting with different flavors. You have to bear in mind that a child does not have the same needs as a teen or an adult. It is important to properly define the food portions. If you want to know more about healthy eating, seeing a specialist can often make the difference. Alternatively, some innovative tools can be used to define portions and carb count.
Crash diets – why starving yourself is bad for weight loss?
Blog DietSensor Cardiovascular disease and nutrition Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating , 14 September 2017
In the modern society, people keeps pushing the emphasis on being thin. In fact, for many people, being thin is vital to be considered beautiful. Obese or overweight people are socially ostracised. For many of them, the only way out of that vicious circle is to lose weight drastically. Dieting can be long and full of obstacles. To get quick and visible results, some individuals take up the challenge and follow crash diets or abusively restrictive weight loss programs. Enticed with weight lost ads, they fall into the traps of drastic diets. “Lose 15 pounds in just 7 days,” “Get rid of your fat in only 10 days,” are among their miraculous promises. However, they are being nothing but deleterious. In fact, those highly restrictive diets constitute a serious risk to health.
Drastic diets advocate calorie restrictive eating habits. Some foods are banned in order to achieve rapid weight loss. While following such a restrictive dietary habit, an individual can gradually lose control of his diet. This leads to food rages and the old eating habits end up resurfacing. As a result, weight gain is sometimes unavoidable. This is what specialists called the “yo-yo effect“. Frustrated by inevitable failures, some people switch to other diets hoping to get better results. However, these switches can have a great impact on their health.
Fast Weight Loss
Drastic diets involve several health risks, but they are effective in weight loss. So what is these drastic results attributable to? According to dietitians and nutritionists who have addressed this issue, the weight loss caused by drastic diets is explained by a loss of lean body mass or muscles rather than the loss of fat. Indeed, a diet of less than 1000 calories burns about 20% of muscle mass. It is a common fact that muscle loss alters the basic metabolism. Our body tends to store fat as calories when we resume our old eating habits. This may help explain why people nearly always regain weight after a fad diet.
Aim a gradual and healthy weight loss
This article does not aim at creating a disincentive for people from losing weight. On the contrary, DietSensor is aware of the risks of excessive weight gain. Our aim is to help people change routines and build new eating habits. It is a well-known fact that too much junk foods and lack of physical exercises lead to diabetes, high rate of cholesterol and cardiovascular disorders. However, the results of restrictive regimes are unfortunately ephemeral and the risks they entail are very real. It should be noted that our body needs energy and essential nutrients to properly operate. When it is deprived of nutrients, health problems are inevitable.
Some good practices
Losing unwanted pounds is always a challenge, but this is more evidence that a sensible, long-term approach makes the most sense. Follow your doctor’s recommendations carefully and gradually eliminate harmful and fattening foods from your diet. Make room for healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables or fish. Exercise regularly. No need to deprive yourself for weight loss. Eating the right portions of food is enough to achieve healthy weight loss. Do you need assistance? DietSensor is a tool that can help you manage your macronutrients. This state-of-the-art application supports your everyday diets. Do not forget, depriving yourself is not the only way out.
Global Obesity Epidemic – Time to Act Decisively
Blog DietSensor Cardiovascular disease and nutrition Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating , 7 August 2017
Obesity has reached the point of a global epidemic, according to a new report published by the World Health Organization (WHO). A person is considered obese when their body mass index exceeds 30. Today, obesity affects more than 2.8 million people each year and this number is increasing constantly. Excess weight kills approximately 3.4 billion people every year.
Whether they are described as rich, poor or developing, all countries in the world are affected by obesity. If, in the past, excessive weight gain was a challenge in high-income countries, nowadays the situation has changed and all countries are concerned.
And, obesity does not discriminate based on age. Today, more than 1.4 billion twenty year olds globally are considered obese. This number is expected to increase to 3.3 billion by 2030.
Relationship between obesity and economic status
The countries with the highest obesity rates are not necessarily the richest, nor the most developed.
In the CIA’s World Factbook list, the United States of America is ranked 12th and the United Kingdom 27th among the most obese countries in the world. This indicates that there is no direct relationship between obesity and economic status.
If we dig a bit deeper and analyze the CIA’s Word Factbook list, we will find out that smaller countries such as Naura, Marshall Islands, Kuwait and Samoa have the highest rate of obesity.
Food scarcity and decreasing purchasing power which characterizes poor and underdeveloped countries are the main reasons why these countries have the highest rate of obesity. People living in these countries have restricted access to balanced and healthy diet. In some cases, their only option is eating easily available junk and fried foods.
Gender and Age Disparity
Gender and age are also factors that differentiate the rate of obesity between countries.
In the UK, USA, Australia and Canada, nearly 25% of men who are 18 years older or above are overweight or obese. However, in South-East Asia, Africa and East Mediterranean, the rate of obesity among women outweighs the rate of obesity among men.
In some countries, women are often restricted to their homes thus having little scope to physical activities.
It has been reported to the WHO in 2013 that more than 42 million children not older than 5 years were suffering from obesity.
Obesity in the USA
Obesity is a major health problem in the US. The rate of obesity in North America has continually increased in the last few decades. Today, more than 78 million adults and 13 million children living in the US are considered obese, with 35% of the population with a body mass index that exceeds 30.
The American diet has historically contained a large amount of calorie rich, processed foods. The good news is that more and more Americans today are replacing process foods in their diets with more fruit, vegetables, fruits, and other healthy foods.
The world is now taking this phenomenon seriously. Health experts and organizations around the world have set up an agenda for control and prevention. The increasing rate of obesity globally may now look bleak, but there is hope on the horizon.

Diabetes: Everyone Is At Risk, Even Celebrities
Blog DietSensor Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating , 3 May 2017
As we all may know, money does not buy health. Diabetes, like other chronic diseases, does not discriminate based on gender, wealth or popularity. If you have recently been diagnosed with diabetes, wallowing in self-pity will not be of any help. Instead of being overwhelmed by negative thoughts, try to see things differently and establish a diabetes diet plan that can help you manage the disease’s conditions.
Several celebrities who suffer from Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes have used their popularity to educate and raise awareness of the disease. Others have tried their very best to hide their disease from the world. Knowing which celebrity suffers from diabetes may help to keep things in perspective, as you manage your own health conditions and complications.
Tom Hanks
In 2013, Tom Hank’s sudden drastic weight loss became apparent. The 59-year-old Oscar-winning actor announced to the world that he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. He had been dealing with high blood sugar since he was 36.
Tom only blamed himself. In an interview, he said that when he was younger, he had bad eating habits and did not pay attention to his health. “I am from the generation of Americans who have spent their younger years partying. I was overweight”. When he was diagnosed in 2013, he had been struggling with high blood sugar for many years. Today, even though the disease is not always manageable, he has said “It’s controllable”.
Halle Berry
Halle Berry went into a diabetic coma in 1989 while taping the television series ‘Living Dolls’. She was later diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. People with this type of diabetes are dependent on daily insulin injections. The actress has said that her health condition has never stopped her from living her dreams. Instead of being overwhelmed by negative thoughts, she has persevered with a positive attitude. Now, she uses her popularity to raise awareness about the importance of prevention.
Nick Jonas
This young singer, who is adored by teenagers around the world, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2007. He had symptoms that included sudden weight loss and excessive thirst. While normal blood sugar levels range from 70 to 120, Nick’s blood sugar was over 700 when he was first diagnosed. Since 2007, Nick has learned how to manage his condition and be a role model to his young fans.
Numbers and statistics do not lie. According to a recent study, more than 285 million people have diabetes around the world and the number of those diagnosed is constantly increasing. By 2030, it is expected 439 million will be diagnosed with diabetes. The World Health Organization has reported diabetes causes more than 3 million deaths annually.
Even with these sobering statistics, diabetes is still preventable. Controlling sugar intake and avoiding junk foods are two good ways to prevent the disease. Those suffering from borderline diabetes can improve their conditions with a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating habits.
Applications like DietSensor can be used for strict calorie control and to establish a diabetes diet plan.
Remember that sacrifices and hard work are worth the health benefits!

Impact of Fruit Consumption on Blood Sugar Level
Blog DietSensor Diabetes Diabetes and Nutrition Healthy Eating Weight Loss , 1 May 2017
“An apple a day keeps the doctor away!”
So goes one of the most popular English proverbs. For most, regular fruit consumption will have a positive impact on overall health. But those with diabetes are often told to avoid certain kinds of fruits, particularly those with a high level of fructose. Managing blood sugar is the most challenging part of managing diabetes.
Conflicting reports create confusion as to the consumption of fruit. On one hand, experts suggest that some fruits contain natural sugar, have a good mix of vitamins and minerals, and can lead to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, others have suggested that adding fruits to daily meals can lead to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
Let’s take a closer look at the impact of fruit consumption on diabetes.
Fruit Consumption and Diabetes
Should people with diabetes avoid fruits because of their sugar level? Fruits are rarely the main culprit for high blood glucose levels. You will not reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes by eliminating fruits from your diet. But, some fruits do contain higher levels of sugar. These include: pineapples (16 grams per slice), pears (17 grams per medium pear), watermelon (18 grams per wedge), and pomegranates (39 grams per fruit).
What about fruit juices? Unlike whole fruits, juices are rich in natural sugars and poor in fibre. Some juices also contain added sugar. Drinking large amounts of fruit juices can lead to higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Nutrition experts advise to eat the actual fruit rather than drinking juices.
Get Portion Sizes Right
For people suffering from chronic diseases, it is important to regulate fruit consumption by eating the correct portion size. To avoid glucose levels going-up, become more aware of your macro nutrient and caloric intake and determine the right portion size of fruit for your dietary needs.

Diabetes Can Kill If Unmanaged
Diabetes Diabetes and Nutrition Uncategorized , 18 April 2017
Diabetes is an endocrine disorder that affects 29 million people in the United States. A recent study in PLoS ONE reported that these individuals are as high as four times more at risk to die as a result of the disorder. And, eight out of the 29 million cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed (according to the American Diabetes Association). These startling statistics highlight the need for treatment and management options for individuals with diabetes.
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes
Diabetes is characterized by consistently elevated blood sugar levels caused by either an inability to produce insulin (type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes). Insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and thus allows the body to utilize the sugar it derives from carbohydrates. Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 5% of the population and is characterized by insulin production deficits that usually begin in childhood or early adulthood. The more common type 2 diabetes is progressive in nature and its development is associated with genetic factors, stress, pregnancy (resulting in gestational diabetes), race, and above all, weight. For this final reason, the American obesity epidemic is often associated with the increase in diabetes diagnoses.
Diabetes Management
Type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle changes that include a properly regulated diet, glucose monitoring, stress reduction, and daily exercise. Medical adjustments such as pills or injections that counteract insulin resistance can also be utilized to regulate blood sugar levels.
If you need support in counting carbohydrates for insulin, innovative applications like DietSensor can help you to manage your diabetes. DietSensor is an innovative nutritional tracking tool for chronic disease management, weight loss, and overall health and wellness. The solution comes with a mobile app and personalized coaching that helps individuals better manage their nutrition by providing accurate and easily accessible nutritional support.
