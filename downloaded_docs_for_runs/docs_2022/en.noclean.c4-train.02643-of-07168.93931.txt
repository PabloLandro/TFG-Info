Can phone radiation cause testicular cancer?

Testicular cancer is not a common cancer. There are about 2000 new cases of testicular cancer each year and excellent survival rates of around 98%. But any kind of cancer is a scary possibility. Working around male fertility, a question that comes up often at WaveWall is, as mobile phone radiation causes male infertility, what else can it do? Can phone radiation cause testicular cancer, for instance?
Can phone radiation cause testicular cancer and other cancers?
The World Health Organisation says mobile radiation is “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” Which means they believe there’s a chance it could cause cancer in people.
Cancer is caused by mutations in cells that then form tumours and can spread across the body. We know mobile phone radiation damages cells and DNA, which is how it affects fertility.
Sperm is particularly vulnerable to mobile phone radiation because it is constantly developing. It needs very specific conditions to do well. Mobile phones disrupt those conditions. But that doesn’t mean phone radiation causes testicular cancer. Sperm aren’t involved in testicular cancer. Most testicular cancer is “germ cell testicular cancer.” This is cancer of the cells involved in producing the sperm, not the sperm itself.
Cancer Research UK says that, “Testicular cancer is not clearly linked to any preventable risk factors.”
While we are making great strides in combating cancer there is still much we don’t understand about the disease. Opinion is divided on whether phone radiation can cause cancer. One of the major problems is that we don’t have enough long-term data yet.
Based on the potential risk, some men might want an anti-radiation mobile phone case to protect not only their sperm from radiation but potentially their testicles too. All men should check themselves regularly and see a GP if there is any swelling, a lump, or a change in shape or texture.
