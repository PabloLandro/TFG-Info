Vaccines do more than save lives: they can also reduce the use of antibiotics and slow the spread of resistance.

The MMR vaccine does not cause autism… The MMR and DTaP do not cause Type 1 diabetes. And the killed flu vaccine does not cause Bell’s palsy, and it does not trigger episodes of asthma.

If children in poor countries got the shots that rich countries take for granted, hundreds of thousands of young lives could be saved.

One of the best ways to protect your children is to make sure they have all of their vaccinations. Immunizations can save your child’s life and protects others you care about.

This year, 1.7 million children will die from diseases that have all but disappeared in the U.S. Why? Because one in five children around the world does not have access to the life-saving immunizations needed to survive.

The BMJ Weekly peer-reviewed medical journal
A now-retracted British study that linked autism to childhood vaccines was an elaborate fraud that has done long-lasting damage to public health. The study's author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study

CDC Global Health United States federal agency
We know that a disease that is apparently under control can suddenly return, because we have seen it happen, in countries like Japan, Australia, and Sweden. Here is an example from Japan. In 1974, about 80% of Japanese children were getting pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine. That year there were only 393 cases of whooping cough in the entire country, and not a single pertussis-related death. Then... See More

Amer Acad Pediatrics American professional association of pediatricians
Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease. Vaccines keep communities healthy, and protect some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the elderly, and children who are too young to be vaccinated or hav... See More

Seth Mnookin Director of MIT's Graduate Program in Science Writing
Robert Kennedy Jr made his name in the anti-vaccine movement in 2005, when he published a story alleging a massive conspiracy regarding thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that had been removed from all childhood vaccines except for some variations of the flu vaccine in 2001. In his piece, Kennedy completely ignored an Institute of Medicine immunization safety review on thimerosal published t... See More

I’m a vaccine scientist. I’m also the father of an adult daughter with autism. Not only is there an abundance of evidence showing that vaccines are safe, there’s not even any plausibility of an association [with autism]

That you are 100 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to have a serious allergic reaction to the vaccine that protects you against measles is not a matter of opinion. That is also a matter of fact.

NFID Non-profit focused on education about infectious diseases
Vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines are among the safest medical products available and can prevent the suffering and costs associated with infectious diseases. The potential risks associated with the diseases that vaccines prevent are much greater than the potential risks from the vaccines themselves.

Vaccines are the most cost-effective health care interventions there are. A dollar spent on a childhood vaccination not only helps save a life, but greatly reduces spending on future healthcare.

Perhaps no anti-scientific argument is more dangerous today than the claim put forward by radical environmentalists, most notably Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that childhood vaccinations can cause autism.

Jenny McCarthy American actress, model, television host, author, screenwriter, and anti-vaccine activist
The idea that vaccines are a primary cause of autism is not as crackpot as some might wish. Autism's 60-fold rise in 30 years matches a tripling of the U.S. vaccine schedule.

Vaccines don't cause autism. Vaccines, instead, prevent disease. Vaccines have wiped out a score of formerly deadly childhood diseases. Vaccine skepticism has helped to bring some of those diseases back from near extinction.

It doesn't seem to matter how often vaccines are proved safe or supplements are shown to offer nothing of value. When people don't like facts, they ignore them.

None of the vaccines have more than a few months of double-blind placebo testing, which will not allow you to spot illnesses like autism that aren’t diagnosed before five years. Second of all, in most vaccines, for example the Gardasil vaccine, they don’t use true placebos.

We have an autism epidemic [in the US]. But for some reasons they refuse to acknowledge it publicly. Dr Boyle [CDC’s spokesperson on autism and vaccines] admitted that the federal government has never done a very simple, fundamental, basic study comparing autism rates in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children. The CDC cannot be trusted regarding investigating vaccine safety. Huge conflict of interes... See More
