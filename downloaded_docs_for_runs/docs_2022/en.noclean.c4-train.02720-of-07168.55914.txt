UBCM Votes Yes to Having a Say in Microcell Placement »
UBCM : Small Cells
UBCM focus on Local Control over Pot but not Radiation?
Give me a Minute & I’ll Give you News
SALT SPRING, September 25 – The big story out of the UBCM so far this week is the BC government’s announcement that they are seeking public and municipal input on the legalization of marijuana. But there is another burning issue on the conference agenda that deserves your attention – Resolution B100 on the lack of public and local government input on the placement of microcells within 100 meters of homes, schools, and hospitals.
Please take a minute to watch this easy to digest animated short on the vote:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzUBK2AFyLI&feature=youtu.be
Follow the lead of California’s major media who recently made a similar statewide vote on small cell placement on their streets a major news story.
Grand Forks councillor Beverley Tripp will be giving a presentation on
Resolution B100 and microcells at 9:30am on Tuesday at the UBCM’s Small Talk Forum.
connectivity does not have to be primarily EMF-based and does not have to continue to escalate the amount of this scientifically deemed hazardous substance to which we are all exposed. (To see why over 180 European scientists and physicians have just announced they are opposed to mass microcell placement in preparation for 5G deployment click here: https://tinyurl.com/ycx5ngnx )
Direct fiber optic connections, G-Fast technology which connects fiber optic cables to existing copper wires, strategically placed low-EMF emitting public transmitters href=”http://www.lexnet.fr/fileadmin/user/communication/LEXNET-Press_Release_1.pdf” target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” shape=”rect”>like those piloted in Paris, France – why are we permitting telecoms to choose to put the well being of all of us, including wildlife and plants at risk, when safe options are available?

Getting Buzzed in the Bedroom?
Municipalities Vote on Small Cells & the Right to Choose
SALT SPRING, September 16 – At the September 25-29 Union of BC Municipalities Convention in Vancouver, local governments will be voting on a resolution aimed at giving them a say in microcell placement in their communities.
Despite a substantial body of evidence showing wireless technology is harmful to humans and the environment, Innovation Canada is allowing microcells to be placed on neighbourhood lampposts and utility poles, and yes – even by our bedrooms – without our consent or often knowledge.
Aesthetics, property value, industry control-for-profit over the public right of way, cyber-security, safety, health, and well-being – there are many reasons for local governments and all of us to be concerned about microcells.
The Resolution:
MOTION of Grand Forks City Council:
WHEREAS public consultation on the placement of cell towers is mandated; and
WHEREAS new technology is moving away from these large towers to microtransmitters which do not require local government or public consultation;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the AKBLG request the UBCM petition relevant provincial and federal governments to mandate consultation with the land use authorities and the public regarding microcell transmitter siting within 100 meters of residences, schools and hospitals.
What’s all the Fuss About? (And what’s a microcell?)
Microcells are small cellular transmitters that broadcast wireless radiation 24 -7. Anywhere from 3 to 10 of them are being placed on one residential street. Wireless radiation is linked to an increased risk of cancer, as well reproductive and neurological problems – like disturbed sleep. It is conservatively defined as a 2b carcinogen, which means it is in the same category as DDT.
Out of Sight, Out of Mind?
Industry is coming up with some sneaky ways of designing – or is that hiding – small cell transmitters. But that doesn’t mean their effects will not be felt.
The wireless industry would like us to believe the jury’s still out on whether wireless radiation has harmful health impacts. But thousands of peer-reviewed studies show evidence of harm. Over 180 scientists and physicians just sent out a plea for a halt to the rollout of 5G transmitters in Europe. To protect their health, California firefighters won an exemption from having small cells placed on their fire halls. It seems then, that the “smart” choice would be to adopt the precautionary principal for all, and not allow microcells to become permanent fixtures in our communities and our lives.
What’s the Game Plan?
The end game is no landlines and “smart” everything for all of us, and big bucks through data mining for the telecoms. Don’t be fooled into thinking these technologies are green. The “Cloud” is a huge energy guzzler, while tech production and waste is anything but eco-friendly.
There are safe ways of sharing high-speed data, like using wired fiber optic connections. New paradigms in non-harm inducing connectivity are waiting to be discovered, but industry must be urged by consumers and regulators to develop and promote them.
While concerns about the effects of wireless technologies and the need for more protective EMF exposure guidelines have made recent headlines in Brussels, Massachusetts, Paris, France , Romania and more, government and media here at home remain eerily silent on what may very well be the most pressing health issue of our time.
