Can type 2 herpes turn into type 1?
Dr. Thomas Alfreda jr Dr. Alfreda jr

Can type 2 diabetes turn into type 1 diabetes?
Dr. Linda DiMeglio Dr. DiMeglio

No: Type 2 diabetes is an Insulin resistant form of diabetes. Many but not all persons with type 2 end up on Insulin over time because their bodies lose the ability to make enough Insulin to meet their needs. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. It is therefore an Insulin deficient form and always requires Insulin therapy. ...Read more

Live well, live safely, and protect yourself. Good luck. ...Read more

Dr. Kathleen Mullane Dr. Mullane
Poly-antiviral tx?: Most cases of hsv will resolve on their own but will resolve more quickly w/antiviral therapy. Abreva otc may work altho we see frequent rapid relapse. Almost all hsv is susceptible to Acyclovir (& its family of agents). Using these 2 together is probably ok. Using 2 Acyclovir derivatives together will just cost you $$$. There currently no other oral agents/effective topical agents..Coming soon. ...Read more

She may also take Acyclovir which is a prescription anti-viral that reduces shedding. But also you may already have been exposed to the virus. At least 50% of people have by the time they are 20.

Herpetic lesions: Canker sores of herpetic origin can be treated palliatively to give relief from the soreness. Abreva is an over-the counter topical gel/medication that you can purchase at your pharmacy that will reduce the length of time that the lesion is active.

I have herpes simplex type 1 ( cold sores ) not responding to Acyclovir is there an alternative ?
Dr. J. Lawrence Dohan Dr. Dohan
See a dermatologist: Acyclovir is effective orally, not topically. Must be used at prodrome or daily to be effective. Your dose may be too small. Valacyclovir is much more effective, used at 2 gram dose at prodrome: as soon as you feel the first tingling. Repeat once in 12 hours. Chapstick with sunscreen helps reduce frequency. Lysine is useless. Topicals do very little. ...Read more
