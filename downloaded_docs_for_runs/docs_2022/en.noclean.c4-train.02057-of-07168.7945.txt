3 Simple Home Remedies For Mosquito Bite Pain and Irritation
Mosquito bites are not only annoying and painful, but they can also lead to pretty severe diseases if the same mosquito bit someone who was sick before biting you. Fortunately, the later danger is far more rare, but if you were bitten, you should act quickly to try and alleviate at least some of the pain and irritation.
Keep in mind, however, if you notice that your skin is reacting very poorly to the bite or feel much worse than you should, contact emergency health services right away.
Knowing how to reduce the pain, irritation, and stop the itching immediately following a mosquito bite is extremely helpful. Whether you’re tending to your own bite or dealing with a child who can’t stop itching his or her bites, these home tips should help.
Even if you can successfully alleviate any pain or irritation caused by mosquito bites, you still need to address the situation before your mosquito problem grows and the bites happen much more frequently. The best way to get rid of mosquitoes is to hire a professional insect control team. According to HomeAdvisor, the average cost to work with an insect control service varies between from $109 and $184 depending on the severity of the problem.
Here are a few home remedies for alleviating the itching, pain, and irritation following a mosquito bite:
Use an ice pack — A great way to quickly alleviate bite irritation is to press a cold pack of ice against the infected area. The feeling of cold can help reduce any histamine related itching and will reduce the chances of major swelling.
Use vinegar — One of the most common household items, vinegar, is actually a great way to lessen the damage of a bite. Because of its antibacterial properties, vinegar is great for bug bites and should be poured onto a cotton ball and gently pressed against any bites. If you or your child has bites all over, filling a bathtub with warm water and vinegar can also help.
Use honey — Honey is both healthy to eat and great for keeping bite wounds clean. Honey’s anti-inflammatory properties will reduce any swelling in the infected area and can help the skin feel much better.
Don’t let mosquitoes or any other kind of bug ruin your day, week, or year. If you want to get in touch with a professional insect control company, and rid your property of all mosquitoes and other insects, contact Dixon Pest Services right away.
