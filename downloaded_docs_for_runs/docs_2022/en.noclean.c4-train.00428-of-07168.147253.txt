Conclusion:
Hemorrhoids afflict millions every year. They are painful, uncomfortable, basically unbearable. The simple natural treatment for hemorrhoids above, can go along way to bring an end to your suffering.
- altering the diet to incorporate fiber-enriched foods that can loosen stools and prevent constipation. A change in the diet also includes avoidance from meaty and processed foods. It also entails the inclusion of water intake. At least eight glasses of water per day should be consumed in order to sustain the smooth flow of digestion and easy defecation.
Hemorrhoids are caused by increased hydrostatic pressure in the hemorrhoidal venous plexus that is around the anal canal. It is related to straining at stool, pregnancy, portal hypertension and other such conditions, and not due to any external or internal injury to the affected part.
- wearing of comfortable under wears. Avoid wearing tight-fitting under wears because this will give no room for your external hemorrhoids and might increase pressure towards it, causing more pain.
Home Treatment:-
Eat lot of fibrous food, and avoid processed food. As hemorrhoids is common in developed countries, because they consume lots of processed food.
What's the treatment? Hemorrhoids treatment varies depending on where they are, how serious they are and what problems they are causing. Following treatment measures can be followed if someone is suffering from hemorrhoids:-
Laser beam is also another treatment option for external hemorrhoids. Laser is also deemed by many as the fastest treatment among other treatments for hemorrhoids in terms of conducting the treatment procedure. Laser treatment is applicable to small and medium sizes of hemorrhoids.
Infrared light treatment:- An infrared high intensity light is an effective treatment method for hemorrhoids. As painful hemorrhoids can be treated in a much faster way.
The clot begins to bleed slowly, leaving traces on the underwear. These are the basic hemorrhoids symptoms. Yes that's true. And sometimes the symptoms of hemorrhoids may be completely absent as well. When symptoms do not surface and yet the rectal bleeding persists, it may become necessary to go for a detailed medical examination of the anal canal. This examination is carried out through Anoscopy, Colonoscopy and Sigmoidoscopy and it determines the exact nature and cause of the bleeding that could be due to a polyp, colorectal cancer and also internal hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids have two types: the internal and the external hemorrhoids. Unlike internal hemorrhoids that have grown inside the anal canal, external hemorrhoids occur outside of the anal verge. This sac-like protrusion found outside the anus is often characterized by itchiness (pruritus ani), pain, irritation and swelling.
Now, one question you may ask, is how much extra fiber is that over what I am getting already in my diet? The answer is, if you are eating white bread, you are likely on a diet that has a meagre 11 grams of fiber per today, but the good news is, that means you only need to add in an extra 20 grams! That's about 3 to 4 large apples / oranges.
Standing for too long can be another cause of hemorrhoids. As during standing position all the blood above the rectum exerts pressure on rectal area.
Hemorrhoids can be vastly classified as Internal Hemorrhoids and External Hemorrhoids. The first symptom of internal hemorrhoids is the appearance of occult blood (fresh and bright red blood) during bowel movement that may tinge the toilet bowl. Traces of it may even be present in the toilet tissue. The blood may come with itching, irritation and low dormant pain in the anal region that is similar to discomforts that are caused by other disorders. However internal hemorrhoids in some cases can even come without pain and when this happens, it may be difficult to identify the symptoms.
2.Drink water You may know the drill already, sixty-four ounces of water daily, about 8 glasses. This helps the fiber in your diet, as it allows the fiber to do it's job - the fiber soaks up the water, thereby bulking the stool. Without water, the fiber may cause even worse constipation. It is best to take the water straight, but not essential.
Laser treatment: - Laser treatment is another faster treating method. After laser treatment the patient needs less medication and results in faster healing.
Treating external hemorrhoids is not limited, however, to medical procedures alone. Natural means of healing and prevention can also be applied which includes:
Poor bowel movements can contribute to hemorrhoids too. Don't wait when there is a nature's call.
Constipation, pregnancy, obesity can be the other causes of hemorrhoids.
Normally, tissues that bulge and protrude outside the anus is considered as external hemorrhoids; however, there are some instances wherein internal hemorrhoids, due to its worst state, have grown terribly to the point that it protrudes until outside the anal canal (this is also known as prolapsed internal hemorrhoids).
- take lukewarm baths everyday. Sitting on a tub half-filled with warm water will help reduces swelling and gives relief from pain and itchiness.
4. Bowel training Essentially go to the toilet at the same convenient time every day. Sit for about five minutes in the toileting posture ( feet raised on ball of feet, elbows resting on knees). Let your body become accustomed to this timing and hopefully, you will start doing your business on a regular daily basis, at about the same time every day.
Sclerotherapy is also another possible treatment for external hemorrhoids. A certain chemical solution is being injected to the affected area which help in the shrinking of the hemorrhoids.
Keep the anal area clean, dry and use a mild soap.
Don't wait when there is a nature's call.
Daily two to three time's bath in warm water will provide relief from pain and promotes healing.
Another procedure is the rubber hand ligation. This is the most famous non-surgical external hemorrhoids treatment since this can be applicable to both small and medium sizes of hemorrhoids. In rubber band ligation procedure, a rubber band is being wrapped around the sac-like protrusion. The rubber band will serve as an instrument that will restrict the flow of blood circulation in the affected area. Lack of blood flow in the hemorrhoids will help in its shrinking, and then, to its eventual healing.
What actually happens at that stage is something like this: A blood clot forms in the external hemorrhoids, creating a thrombosed hemorrhoid. The skin around the anus gets inflamed and becomes painful.

People Said About Calmovil Hemorrhoids Relief
"a week ago i was in agonizing pain. i was exausted and desparate for help. i though i would need a surgery, but i just couldn't imagine any sharp object anywhere near my butt. so i got calmovil. after 4 days my hemorrhoid got smaller and THE PAIN WAS GONE!" Denise, New Jersey
Symptoms of small external hemorrhoids are harder to determine as well. There can be just the occasional blood smear on the toilet tissue. However when the person has larger external hemorrhoids, it becomes easier as it is accompanied by a dull pain, itchiness and irritation in the anal region. And when someone experiences such symptoms, hemorrhoids can be a prime suspect.
In a very high fiber diet for hemorrhoids you may be asked by your doctor to consume as much as 3.5 ounces or 96 grams of fiber a day, to keep your body healthy and balanced. A high fiber diet, that is normally sufficient for a hemorrhoid suffer is about one third that dose - 31 grams or one ounce.
Severe pain: - Hemorrhoids located internally or externally can cause severe pain.
Itching and irritating: - External or internal hemorrhoids leads to itching and irritation and causes embarrassment.
Complications:-
Bleeding: - Hemorrhoids can bleed in critical conditions whether located internally or externally. In these condition hemorrhoids needs immediate medication.
Using a food table to work out the fiber in the foods you like, you can also see if there are any foods that stand out as worthwhile. Still can't adjust your diet to get enough fiber, then try fiber supplements. They work out to be about $20 to $40 a month, but compare that to the cost and inconvenience of a hemorrhoid operation that may run thousands of dollars and leave you in pain and discomfort for weeks. Powdered psyllium husks are a good option.
People usually confuse hemorrhoids symptoms with many other similar anorectal problems that may be caused by fissure, fistulae, pruritus ani or abscesses. These conditions are formed in the rectal region due to various reasons and are not directly related to hemorrhoids. The confusion mostly arises from lack of medical knowledge of most people about the human anatomy. Hearsay also often plays a negative role and prevents the sufferer from going the right path.
Fiber preferably is to be taken via fresh fruits, whole grain foods, and beans. If you notice that your body is letting off too much gas, this may be the result of increasing the fiber in your diet too quickly. Just cut back on the amount of fiber and gradually increase it over time.
Hemorrhoids are enlarged veins around anus or the rectal area. Hemorrhoids can be of three types:-
External Hemorrhoids:- They are the fleshy growth or the enlarged veins outside the anus or the rectal area

Few measures to prevent hemorrhoids:-
One of the best treatment for external hemorrhoids is surgery or what is known as hemorrhoidectomy. In this surgical procedure, the swollen tissue is being scraped off using a scalpel. Patient who undergo this kind of treatment is being given an anesthesia (local or general - depending on the state of the victim). Based on testimonies of people who have undergone this kind of treatment, hemorrhoidectomy has a longer-effect despite the intense pain that was felt after the operation. Surgery is always being recommended to large-sized hemorrhoids that have already complicated to the point that it already causes so much discomfort and pain to the patient.
1. Introduce more fiber into your diet. Fiber is extremely good at relieving constipation - the main cause of hemorrhoids - and fiber is well renown for preventing them and alleviating their symptoms. Fiber does this by bulking the stool and making it soft, so that the body can eliminate it without much straining.
Hemorrhoids interestingly, can even be found in people who are otherwise healthy individuals. The symptoms of hemorrhoids are actually caused by certain vascular cushions, and when it happens, most people and medical practitioners refer to them as hemorrhoids. The symptoms of hemorrhoids become most noticeable when they grow to become thrombosed, inflamed, prolapsed and enlarged.
