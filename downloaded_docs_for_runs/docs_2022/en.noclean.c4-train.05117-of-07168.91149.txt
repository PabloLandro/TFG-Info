Village Fights To Repel Church’s ‘Unspiritual’ Mobile Phone Mast

PLANS to erect a mobile phone mast on an ancient parish church are being resisted in a village made famous by an 18th century naturalist.
Objectors in Selborne, Hampshire, condemn the scheme as “sacrilege” and “smacking of corruption” and have handed out protest leaflets; a petition is also being launched. The plan to place the mast on the tower of the 12th century church is also criticised by the Council for the Protection of Rural England.
The mobile telephone company One-2-One is offering to pay the Church £5,500 a year for five years for the right to erect the 16ft mast on St Mary’s church. In addition, it would build a new boiler room and a lavatory for parishioners which would also house mobile phone equipment.
The mast will improve coverage in the area for mobile phone users. The village was put on the map by the publication in 1789 of Gilbert White’s best-selling The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, which has become a classic. The village green beside the church was once described by the naturalist as “the delight of old and young and a place of much resort in summer evenings”.
The Gilbert White museum remained above the fray yesterday. Other residents were not so reticent. Lady Caulson, the widow of a diplomat, condemned the idea of a radio mast as “deeply unspiritual”. She said: “It is gimmicky and it smacks very strongly of corruption. I feel that Mammon is taking up the church in a humbuggy way. I don’t want to be a spoilsport. I am a very broad-thinking Christian. But this is our spiritual heritage. We are very proud of our church.”
The vicar of St Mary’s, the Rev John Preston has the backing of the parish church council for the mast deal. Alan Rushton, a church warden, said the mast would not be unsightly because it would not be much more prominent than a flagpole already on the church.
He said the objections to the scheme were “misconceptions and rank nonsense. The Church has always been involved in commercial pressures. What’s new? Churches are meant to have toilets and this gives us the opportunity to do that. If One-2-One didn’t go ahead, we would have to do that anyway. This gives us breathing space financially.”
Before the mast can be erected, the diocese and planners must be consulted. Planning permission is not, however, guaranteed: Selborne is in an area of outstanding natural beauty, and East Hampshire district council turned down plans earlier this year for an Orange mobile telephone mast to be erected on farmland.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England has voiced strong criticism of the proliferation of mobile phone masts in the countryside and has been pressing the Government to change its guidelines on the masts because too many were going up on churches and even cathedrals. A spokesman said: “We are concerned that the environment has been suffering unnecessarily.” There are an estimated 12,000 mobile telephone masts throughout Britain, many of them on churches and schools.

How can we use cell phones for social change? With Ushahidi, we can help regnant and laboring women around the world.
As mobile and web technologies become increasingly accessible to those living in remote poverty around the world, the potential to expand access to health care to underserved populations becomes ever more real.
It’s exciting to see the many ways that innovative people and organizations are able to take advantage of the spread of technology to make positive social change. Ushahidi, an open-source platform that can be used by anyone to collect and visualize user-generated information, is an excellent example. They’re using mobile and web technology – including social media platforms like Twitter – to capture critical up-to-date reports from individuals in crisis areas through crowd-sourcing and filtering.
Ushahidi creates a hub for user-generated crisis information that comes in through text messages, tweets, and emails around a given crisis in a specific geographic area. Their team then uses the “Swift River” filtering system to determine which reports are legitimate and group them thematically. The reports are placed on an interactive map so that users can see exactly where emergencies are being reported. Right now, for example, this tool is making a difference in Haiti by helping aid workers and first responders identify where and for what the needs are greatest.
What if this tool was used for women going through labor or labor-related complications?
There are already some open-source map-based initiatives being built for the maternal health field. The Maternal Health Task Force has designed three interactive, user-generated maps that depict maternal health knowledge hubs, MPH programs offering a maternal health concentration, and organizations working in maternal health. Another key contributor is Maternova, one of the Changemakers early entry prize winners for the Healthy Mothers, Strong World competition, which is building an open-source map of maternal health care facilities around the world.
By combining these maps, which outline the maternal health “supply” worldwide, with information and interactive maps that visually depict demand, perhaps we could create a clearer, more visual picture of the true gaps in health access.
Pregnant women in need of care – or their friends and family – could text an emergency alert to a number assigned by Ushahidi. This would then be transmitted to health professionals in the region, and made widely available on the internet. Though ensuring an immediate response to the requests will take time and a larger overarching strategy, the reporting of this information alone can help direct health care facilitators to the areas most in need.
Let me know what you think about the potential to use mobile and web technologies to crowd source information for maternal health by responding to this post.

The Food and Drug Administration says the research “does not allow us to conclude that mobile phones are absolutely safe, or that they are unsafe.”
Those who cannot avoid using cell phones may consider the advice offered by the Environmental Working Group to minimize their exposure to radiation:
Use a low-level radiation cell phone. Check out www.ewg.org for the best 10 cell phones that emit low-level radiation.
Use a headset or speaker.
Listen more and talk less. Cell phones emit radiation when you talk or text, but not when you are receiving signals or messages.
Hold your cell phone away from your body.
Text more and talk less.
Stop trying to communicate when the signal is poor. Poor signals mean your cell phone needs to send stronger signals (higher level radiation) to the tower.
Don’t allow your children to use or play with your cell phones. Children’s brains absorb twice as much radiation as adults.
Don’t use the “radiation shield.” Radiation shields such as antenna caps or keypad covers reduce the connection quality and force the machine to emit higher radiation to deliver a stronger signal.
ANA is a 501(c)(3) organization serving a membership of close to 5,000 acoustic neuroma patients, family members and health care professionals providing information regarding all treatment options. An acoustic neuroma, sometimes termed a vestibular schwannoma, is a slow-growing benign brain tumor on the eighth cranial nerve, which leads from the brain to the inner ear. The most common forms of treatment are microsurgery, radiosurgery or “watch and wait.” Typical symptoms include hearing loss, balance issues, tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in the ear.

This is the fourteenth (14th) article that I have written in this column on health tips on the use of cell phones… as a public service to remind cell phone users of the harmful effects of the excessive use of cell phone because of the radiation exposure. And that we should practice prudent precaution on the use of cell phones at all times.
Here are additional health tips on the use of cell phones that I got from the internet. Should you wish to confirm the information I am sharing with the readers of this column; or should you need further information to convince you of the health risks of cell phone radiation, please check the internet:
• Do you know that a recent issue of the Journal of American Medical Association reports that psychiatrist Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse led a team of researchers found that just 50 minutes of cell phone radiation significantly affected brain function and metabolism of glucose – the brain’s main fuel – in those parts of the brain that received the most cell phone radiation;
• Do you know that as recently as June, 2010, a US based research reported that by spending half an hour on your mobile phone each day could increase the possibility of getting brain cancer by 40%;
• Do you know that since the younger children’s skulls are thinner, the penetration of electromagnetic radiation in children is deeper than in adults;
• Do you know that as per studies in US and India, there is the possibility that the heavy use of mobile phone by men could caused reduced sperm counts;
• Do you know that there is a need to lessen the direct exposure to the brain from cell phone radiation due to the possible increase of brain tumors;
• Do you know that a certain Dr. Lonn early this year found an increase risk of acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor – after 10 years or more years of cell phone use? However, Dr. Lonn also published research results that cell phones did not increase the risk of other types of brain tumor (gliomas or meningiomas).
Further, do you know that there are over 120 different types of brain tumor?
• Do you know that it is better to make cell phone calls when you are stationary because when you are moving rapidly, say in a car or train, there is more exposure to cell phone radiation;
• Do you know that it is not advisable to put your cell phone in your breast or pants pockets because putting the cell phone right up against your body exposes you to more radiation? Better to carry your cell phone in a purse or briefcase or get a non-metallic belt clip that distance the cell phone away from the body;
• Do you know that texting, instead of talking is better for the health of cell phone users;
• Do you know that it is better to make calls outside buildings and elevators – less exposure to radiation, that is;
• Do you know that it is better to tile the cell phone away from your ear when you are talking with somebody and bring it closer to your ear when you are listening;
• Do you know that a cell phone radiation shield (a small device that is attached to the earpiece of a cell phone) can reduce the radiation that causes cancer by directing the radiation waves away from the ear? Hopefully, a cell phone radiation shield would soon be fitted to every cell phone sold, to reduce, if not totally eliminate cell phone radiation;
• Do you know that it is already reported in the internet that an Inter-Ministerial Committee formed by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of India that radiation from mobile towers pose grave health risks including memory loss, lack of concentration and digestive disturbances. The report further says that the radiation is also bad for birds and insects. The Committee attributed the radiation effects to the disappearance of butterflies, bees, insects, and sparrows;
• Do you know that one research study reports that people who have used mobile phones for 10 years or more were 40% more likely to get a brain tumor on the same side of their head where they held the handset.
Finally… no doubt about it – the cell phone is a fabulous invention. In today’s lifestyle, we can no longer do without cell phones. But knowing that excessive use of the cell phones is dangerous and in fact could kill far more people than smoking or asbestos because of radiation, we should limit our use of them wherever possible.
We should take prudent and simple precautionary measures in the use of cell phones in a way that is most compatible with our health.

The Imperial team aims to recruit 100,000 mobile phone users to the COSMOS study.
A new decades-long study launches today to investigate whether there is a link between the use of mobile phones and long-term health problems such as cancer.
The cohort study on mobile communications (COSMOS) forms part of the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) Programme. The international study will run for 20-30 years and will follow the health of at least 250,000 participants aged 18-69 in five European countries. The UK arm of COSMOS is being led by a research team from Imperial College London.
There are currently over six billion mobile phone devices in use worldwide, with over 70 million in use in the UK, which has a population of 61 million people.
Studies of short term use of mobile phones and health have been reassuring, other than well known associations with risk of motor accidents. However, there are still some uncertainties about the health effects of mobile phone use, since some diseases take many years to develop and so far few people have been using mobile phones for that period of time.
Dr Mireille Toledano, co-Principal Investigator of the study from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said: “For the benefit of current users and for future generations, it is important for us to carry out long-term health monitoring of a large group of mobile phone users so that we can identify if there are any possible health effects from this new and widespread technology that has become so central to our everyday lives.”
Professor Paul Elliott, Principal Investigator of the study from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said: “Scientists have been looking at the effects of mobile phones on health for several years and so far, reviews of the research have been reassuring with respect to mobile phone use and health problems in the short term. However, as mobile phones have only been in widespread use for a relatively short time, we haven’t been able to carry out long-term studies until now.
“COSMOS aims to fill in important gaps in our knowledge of mobile phones and health. By looking at large numbers of people across Europe over a long period of time, we should be able to build up a valuable picture of whether or not there is any link between mobile phone use and health problems over the long term,” added Professor Elliott.
Through four major mobile phone operators, the COSMOS project team from Imperial College London is inviting 2.4 million mobile phone users in the UK to take part in the study.
“We can only do this study and find out whether mobile phones are affecting our health in the long term with the help of the public willing to take part. Through contributing a small amount of time to this study, participants will make a big difference to our understanding of mobile phones and health. Anyone who wants to find out more and get in touch with us can visit our website at said Dr Toledano.
Participants who agree to take part in the study will complete an on-line questionnaire about their mobile phone use, health and lifestyle. The researchers will monitor participants’ mobile phone use and any health problems they might develop, e.g., cancers and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, for at least the next 20 years. They will also analyse whether any changes in the frequency of symptoms, such as headaches and sleep disorders, are related to mobile phone usage.
“Over the past decade, mobile phones have become a normal part of everyday life for the majority of people in Britain. The COSMOS study is the largest research study worldwide investigating mobile phone use and health and is a very important step towards finding out whether there are health implications of using a mobile phone over a long period of time,” said Dr Toledano.
Professor Lawrie Challis from the MTHR Programme Management Committee said “We still cannot rule out the possibility that mobile phone use causes cancer. The balance of present evidence does not suggest it does but we need to be sure. The best way of doing this is through a large cohort study such as COSMOS and I am very pleased that the UK is to play an important part in this international endeavour.”
The study follows on from successful pilot studies carried out between 2004-2008 during the first phase of the MTHR Programme.

Mobile Caused Brain Damage, Claims Man

A BT engineer is planning to sue his former employers, claiming protracted use of mobile phones has caused him brain damage.
Thirty-nine-year-old Stephen Corney says he suffers from severe short-term memory loss as a result of using mobile phones for long periods.
He left BT last year, after going on sick leave in 1996. He worked for the company for 10 years.
Mr Corney’s lawyers have issued a protective writ which means they have three months to compile scientific and medical evidence to back their case.
If they decide to go forward with the case – which would be the first of its kind in the UK – BT will be issued with a writ and could face a compensation claim of over £100,000.
Digital phones
Mr Corney, whose job involved installing telecom equipment and testing mobile phone coverage, claims his problems began after BT switched from analogue to digital phones.
He told a press conference at TUC headquarters on Sunday that using digital phones made him feel as if a “steel band” was tightening around his head.
He said his head would become hot and that he would often feel “punch drunk” after he finished using the mobile.
He often spent up to 90 minutes on a mobile at a time.
Mr Corney, who lives in Bedfordshire, explained how losing his short-term memory had affected his life.
“When I was first off work, I would go shopping and I would have to have everything on a list.
“I would then put the shopping in the boot of the car, get into the car and see the list and not realise I had already done it and so I would go back and do the shopping again,” he said.
His partner, Lisa Hutchings, said his condition had improved since he stopped work, but he still found it difficult to perform the simplest of tasks.
‘No convincing evidence’
Tom Jones, Mr Corney’s lawyer, said he was confident that the medical and scientific evidence would be found to back the claim.
“I have every belief that Stephen has gone through something which has been caused by mobile phones,” he said.
But a BT spokesman said there was “no convincing scientific evidence that mobile phones pose any health threat”.
However, he added that BT would continue to support research into mobile phones and their effect on health.
A spokesman for the National Radiological Protection Board, an independent body which advises on issues such as mobile phone use, said: “There is no firm evidence of any serious health effects from mobile phones.”
But he added: “We do support the need for research in this area.”
In recent years, there have been various health scares linked to mobile phones, including concerns that exposure to radiation caused cancer.
The spokesman said the NRPB was “as certain as we can be” that there is no evidence of mobiles causing cancer.
“But the brain is a very complex organ and it could be that prolonged use of mobiles could have an effect on brain function,” he said.
The NRPB is publishing a report on research on animals exposed to mobile phones later this year and the European Commission has just secured industry funding for a major research project into the area.

New Evidence On The Dangers Of Mobile Phones

Could mobile phones be giving us brain cancer? And has the ¬mobile phone industry spent years trying to bury the ¬scientific evidence that it does in order to protect its ¬$3 trillion, 4.6billion-¬customer, global business?
According to Devra Davis, an eminent ¬American scientist and one of the country’s leading epidemiologists, the answer to both these questions is a resounding ‘yes’.
With mobile phone use soaring, especially among the young, Dr Davis says we could face a ‘global public health catastrophe’ in as little as three years if the problem is ignored.
Mobile phones are low-powered radio ¬frequency transmitters which produce ¬microwave radiation.
The debate over the cancer risks from this radiation has been going on for years. Yet the lack of any conclusive evidence has allowed the industry to claim phones are safe and led to sceptics being dismissed as scaremongers.
But now the alarm has been raised by an award-winning academic and toxicologist who was in the group that won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.
So should we think twice before clamping a mobile phone to our ears?
In a new book provocatively titled ¬Disconnect: The Truth About Cell Phone Radiation, What The Industry Has Done To Hide It And How To Protect Your Family, Dr Davis says we have underplayed the threat from mobile phone radiation for too long.
She says: ‘Is it possible that the pervasive use of mobile phones is causing a host of ¬subtle, chronic health problems, damaging our ability to have healthy children and creating long-term risks to our brains and bodies?
‘The fact we do not have clear answers to this question at this point in the history of electronic technology is not an accident.’
Dr Davis says crucial scientific evidence, some of which has existed for decades, has been ignored – particularly that involving experimental research on animals and human cells.
Her work includes supporting research from studies in the U.S., Sweden, Greece, France and Russia. For example, a team at the ¬University Of Washington found that just two hours of mobile phone-level radiation splintered the DNA of brain cells in rats, making them ¬similar to cells found in malignant tumours.
In humans, the evidence is less dramatic, but equally worrying.
In Moscow, a study has found that while the brains of children who regularly use mobile phones look the same as the brains of those who do not, users have poorer memories and other learning problems.
Dr Davis, who is a grandmother, is worried about the effect on ¬children, arguing that their thin, pliant skulls make them more vulnerable.
Last year, the Finnish ¬Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority warned that regular use of mobiles could damage children’s brains, ¬confirming previous warnings in the UK, France and Israel.
Dr Davis believes children are ‘growing up in an unprecedented flood of radio frequency signals’. She says they should only use mobile phones in emergencies. ‘The dangers for children are not definitively proven but do we really want to risk it?’
The most troubling research, she says, threatens male fertility. Research in seven ¬countries, including the U.S., China and Australia, suggests that keeping a switched-on mobile in a trouser pocket can have a ¬drastic effect on sperm count.
‘All the research shows the same thing – if you take young men who are trying to become fathers, those who use mobile phones at least four hours a day have about half the sperm count of others,’ says Dr Davis. ‘Sperm exposed to mobile phone radiation in the lab is sicker, thinner and less capable of swimming.’
Using a mobile for four hours a day sounds a lot, but Dr Davis says 20 per cent of the young males in a 2008 study, by America’s Cleveland Clinic, used their mobiles for this long. However, her most compelling evidence about the health ¬dangers, and that mobile phone manufacturers are probably aware of the risks, is buried in the small print of the ¬instructions that ¬accompany every new phone.
Those for the latest BlackBerry (the Torch), warn users to ‘use hands-free ¬operation if available and keep the device at least 0.98 inches from your body (including the abdomen of ¬pregnant women and the lower abdomen of ¬teenagers)’ when it is switched on.
Apple tells iPhone users to keep them 0.625 inches away from their body and to point the dock connection towards their ¬shoulders ‘to increase ¬separation from the antenna’.
Dr Davis says at least two ¬senior scientists who work for mobile phone companies told her they were ‘deeply ¬concerned’ about the health risks. Insiders say phone manufacturers are now developing safer models.
Many studies looking into the cancer risks of mobiles have been inconclusive.
In May, the hotly-anticipated Interphone report for the World Health Organisation drew no conclusions, but suggested that heavy phone users could be at risk.
The research team was divided about their findings, but that didn’t stop the UK-based GSM Association, which represents the global mobile industry, from deciding the report supported a consensus that there was ‘no established health risk’.
Dr Davis specialises in how the environment affects our health and wrote a book about how the tobacco ¬industry was not ¬initially ¬honest about the links between cigarettes and ¬cancer. Similarly, she says, the debate in Britain over the ¬dangers of asbestos lasted a century.
She insists the mobile phone industry has behaved the same way, working, often with ¬government help, to ¬discredit independent scientists while ensuring that others toe the line for fear of losing their funding.
‘Those studies that have been paid for by the industry tend to find that there’s not a problem,’ said Dr Davis. ‘Studies that are ¬independent – while there are fewer – tend to show there is a problem. I don’t think that’s an ¬accident. This has had a chilling effect on the ability of policy-makers to form policy.’
She said the debate has been distorted by a ‘show me the bodies’ approach to evidence.
But it is too early to expect ¬mobile phone users to develop brain tumours, she said.
The same slow development of problems occurred when the Hiroshima bomb survivors were tested: after ten years ¬researchers found no evidence of brain cancer, but 30 years later many cases were found.
While defenders of the safety of mobile phones point out that official statistics show the ¬incidence of brain cancer is ¬falling in countries like the U.S., Dr Davis says people ¬typically don’t develop it until they are over 65 and, at present, people in that age group have not been big mobile phone users.
‘The absence of an epidemic right now is hardly cause for great relief,’ she says.
In most countries, heavy mobile phone use is recent. Even in Scandinavia, home of many of the world’s biggest mobile phone makers, only half the population owned one in 2000.
Dr Davis finds it ¬frustrating that there are ¬simple ¬precautions that users could be ¬taking. She says ¬fashion will have to adapt, with people keeping phones in bags and the ¬knee-level pockets of cargo trousers, well away from their ovaries or testicles.
Her book, ¬published in Britain next month, has already been ¬challenged in America over its science. But Dr Davis doesn’t ¬dispute that mobile phone radiation is weak – she stresses the cumulative effect on people using phones for several hours.
Her solution is for a ‘major, independent research ¬programme, not a fake one like those we’ve had for decades’.
As for her own habits, she has cut down her dependence on her mobile but still uses one.
‘We’re as dependent on mobile phones as we are on our cars,’ she says. ‘They do a lot of good – they save lives in emergencies – but we have to be smarter about how we use them.’

Dr. Devra Davis spoke at Georgetown University Thursday about the disconnect between the data about the harmfulness of cell phone radiation and public opinion about its safety. Hence the name of her new book, Disconnect. Dr. Davis was the Founding Director of Center for Environmental Oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and has been an advocate of public health for several decades.
In her talk and her book Dr. Davis asserts that:
• Cell phone radiation damages DNA
• Long term use increases brain tumor risk, and the appearance of tumors is slow, so is as yet underestimated
• Users who start as teens have a 4 to 5 fold increase in malignant brain tumor development than those who don’t start so early
• Men who use cell phones 4 or more hours per day have half the sperm counts of men who do not
• And that health policy and regulatory standards are written by the trillion-dollar cell phone industry
While some studies identifying cell phone radiation as entirely safe have been talked about in the media recently, Dr. Davis asserts that these studies have mobile industry funding and study nonsensically limited usage. The famous Interphone Study, which she cites as an example, had an average cell phone use rate 2 hours per month — compared to an average of over 2 hours per week for U.S. users. More questionable still is their “exclusion of data from children and young adults, the exclusion of people who died from brain tumors as well as a limit to the type of tumors studied” said Lloyd Morgan a Senior Research Fellow at the Environment Health Trust at the Bioelectromagnetics Society’s 2010 annual meeting.
But Dr. Davis’ biggest concern is about children. With half of the world’s 4 billion cell phones used by people under 20, and the increased penetration of microwaves into children’s smaller, still-developing brains, she’s concerned we’re headed for an epidemic.
Microwaves? you say. Yes, cell phones operate in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, close to the range used by microwave ovens. (Cell phones currently operate between 300 MHz and 2 GHz at a power of about 1-3 W, and microwaves typically operate at about 2.45 GHz at about 1kW power.) So a cell phone is a small, low-powered microwave transmitter that most users hold against their heads or at their hips (near the genitals). Considering that alone could give one pause.
So, considering that it’s likely cell phone radiation is harmful, what can you do to protect yourself and your children. You can check our The Environmental Health Trust, and you can also follow these safety suggestions:
• Don’t use a phone or text while driving or doing something that requires your attention!
• Use a landline when possible
• Text for short messages instead of calling — less exposure and less signal use
• Use a headset (but not a wireless one, because those use similar radiation)
• Don’t carry your phone on your body — leave it in your bag or at the far end of your desk when working
• Only use where the signal is strong — the cell phone will up its power to compensate for weak signal
• Leave it far from you when you’re sleeping, or better still, turn it off at night
• Don’t let your children use the cell phone, and keep it away from them — they are by far the most vulnerable

Cellphones-a basic necessity to us like water, food-emit radiation that is harmful for us, a new book has suggested.
In her new book, ”Disconnect: The Truth About Cell Phone Radiation, What the Industry Has Done to Hide It, and How to Protect Your Family,” Devra Davis, an environmental health has probed why cell phone radiation is now a “national emergency.”
“Among the most stunning new findings is evidence that you can cause birth defects in mice embryos from cell phone radiation. Researchers at the University of Athens looked at fatal development and studied pregnant mice exposed to smart phones. And they looked at the offspring of the mice and they found basic defects in their brain structure and skeleton,” ABC News quoted Davis as saying.
“In one study, they showed significant damage in the exposed mice embryos. And they showed, for example, mice normally have 13 pairs of ribs and the exposed mice sometimes had less or their cartilage was ossified, meaning it was kind of fused. And they showed other defects in the skeleton and head bone that were associated with the radiation from the smartphone – to 3G smartphones.
“Other work that’s been done has to do with damage to the ovaries and testes of the fruit fly. The fruit fly, as you may know, has been very well studied by science and they have shown that the ovaries and testes of a fruitful can be shrivelled up by radiation,” she said.
Meanwhile, the wireless industry says that the amount of radiation emitted by cell phones is very low.
“It’s not the amount of radiation, it’s the nature of the signal, because, in fact, these phones are very, very weak. They’re very low-power but it’s the pulsed, digital nature of the signal that I’m more concerned about,” she said.
In her book, Davis said the nature of the signal is especially harmful because it is constantly searching for a connection with a cell tower. Exposure is increased in areas of weak reception because the radio signal has to increase as the phone seeks a connection.
“I think the impact on fertility and sterility should be way up. Sperm naturally will die but the sperm exposed to cell phone radiation dies faster and don”t swim as well,” added Davis.
Davis also said that in addition to brain illness, memory loss is a serious issue.

There are plenty of us right here in Atlanta metro who rely heavily on cell phones even to the point of forfeiting land lines.
Researchers are now warning against the electromagnetic radiation from cell phones and in particular cell phone wires worn on the body!
There is apparently enough data now that talking on cell phones hampers fertility. A phone on standby harms your reproductive organs as you are exposing yourself to radiation.
And for men the electromagnetic radiation means one third less sperm count! For those who are trying hard to conceive, especially later in life, these figures could be devastating!
There are also severe warnings for pregnant women who must speak on cell phones and drape wires near the womb – researchers warn that you stop that immediately!
So not only are cell phones now directly related to brain cancer but their electromagnetic frequencies are related to infertility!
Look into all the intricacies of this cell phone warning – if they are known to cause cancer and harm reproductive organs, what else can they do?
Cell phones have also been blamed for bee population reductions – the cell technology pervading the atmosphere with intense electromagnetic radiation – what is that doing to human behavior and health?
There’s also a special reason why people are asked to shut off their cell phones on airplane because it interferes with the electrical equipment. Cell phone technology is that powerful.
For those of you who cannot be separated by your cell phones and think they’re sexy and powerful — you’re right they’re very powerful! Sexy, I don’t know…
Take special care with cell phone usage.
