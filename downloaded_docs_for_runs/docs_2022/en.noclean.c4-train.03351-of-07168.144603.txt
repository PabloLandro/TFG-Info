Concerned over the health hazards, National Green Tribunal restrains telecom firms from settting up towers
Concerned over the health hazards likely to be caused by cell phone towers, the National Green Tribunal has restrained several telecom firms from setting them up without following mandatory provisions of law and taking permission from the competent authority.
“”Considering gravity of allegations levelled and health hazard likely to be caused, we direct that no construction of cell phone communication towers shall be made without following mandatory provisions of law and necessary permission from competent authority,”” a NGT bench of Acting Chairperson Justice A S Naidu and expert member P C Mishra has said.
Issuing notice to the Ministry of Communications and IT, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Ministry of Health, Securities and Exchange Board of India and telecom firms — Bharti Infratel Ltd, Airtel, Idea, Vodaphone, Tata, Reliance and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, the NGT has sought their response by the next date of hearing on December 20.
The tribunal’s order came on the plea of Delhi resident Arvind Gupta, who has sought directions to the Centre and the telecom firms for implementing guidelines and regulations issued by MoEF regarding installation of cell phone towers nationwide.
In his application, filed through advocate B P Tripathy, Gupta has alleged that MoEF guidelines have not been followed and implemented by Department of Telecommunications while allowing installation of towers throughout the country.
He has also alleged that “”norms are flouted brazenly by all companies involved with installation of mobile towers , having complete disregard and concern for environmental protection“”.
Gupta has alleged that radiations emitted by towers not only adversely affect flora and fauna, but can also cause cancer in human beings.
He has further alleged that the Centre and telecom firms have not devised rules and guidelines for implementing existing regulations pertaining to installation of telecom towers so that environmental exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by them will be minimised.
In his application, he has sought constituting of a high powered committee of experts to lay guidelines for limiting cell phone tower radiation before installing any new towers.
He has further sought directions to market regulator SEBI to restrain it from granting permission to any company to invite investments from general public for installing cell phone towers for private profits, saying it will lead to “”irreparable environmental damage and health hazards to human lives…””.
The applicant has also sought transfer of all the cases related to mobile tower radiation from the high courts to NGT.

Is EMF really harmful to your health? Are you safe from EMF? Do you even know what EMF is? Then this post is very important for you to read and understand. EMF as some are not fully aware of it is short for Electromagnetic fields. EMF is invisible electrical magnetic fields which are a weak type of radiation.
EMF is commonly found everywhere. The earth release natural EMF that is weak and extremely low. According to scientist this low EMF are safe and helps regulate important functions on the human body. However, there are other kinds of EMF which are artificial and can cause harm to the body. This is our focus and our main concern.
Artificial EMF is usually found everywhere. There are usually emitted by most electronic gadgets you have at home and offices such as computers, laptops, cellphones, WiFi modems, hair dryers and other gadgets that uses high voltage wires.
EMF can cause a lot of health problems such as brain tumors, leukemia, birth defects, miscarriages, chronic fatigue, headaches, cataracts, heart problems, stress, nausea, chest pain, forgetfulness, cancer and other health problems. But according to some studies, cannot cause such health problems. However, more and more experts are stating with shown evidence that are real health concerning issues.
Now, do you think EMF is health concerning? Have you experienced extreme migraine when you use your computer all day long? Then, there are some problems with EMF.
And because our homes and offices are filled with gadgets and appliances that emits EMF everyday then the chances you get more serious problem is pretty high. So how can you protect yourself from EMF? EMF detectors are what you need.
There is EMF detector that specializes on EMF measuring on the environment to prevent any serious harmful effect or help you find a way to lessen your exposure. EMF measures the level of on the environment and alerts you if the surrounding area is high of.
A perfect example of an EMF device is the Electromagnetic Field EMF Detector Impulse. It is designed specially to detect measure and alert you of low and high radiation. Just point it in the place you want to measure it will the job. It usually makes the ticking sound when measuring. But you can also set it to tick when you are in a high EMF environment.
So what now? It only detects but does not control the EMF. Detection is a good sign. It means you are now aware of the EMF around you. You can now try unplugging some devices at your home and stay away from places with high.

Scientists Warn that Cell Phone Radiation Excites the Brains of Healthy Adults

Children and pregnant women should avoid using cell phones, cordless phones and other wireless devices.
This is according to a panel of influential scientists, which believes that much stricter safety measures are needed to protect people from being harmed by electromagnetic radiation from devices including cellphones, cellphone towers, powerlines and wireless internet.
The scientists met to consider all the evidence linking wireless devices to cancer, neurological diseases and infertility, and concluded that there was evidence of “serious disruptions to biological systems”.
The panel’s findings and recommendations have recently been published in the scientific journal, “Reviews on Environmental Health”.
But Vodacom spokesperson Richard Boorman says there is no cause for alarm:
“There have been thousands of scientific studies into the effects of radio frequency on health. There is no evidence to convince experts that exposure below the guidelines set by International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) carries any health risks, for adults or children.”
But according to the Swedish Karolinska Institute, which took part in the panel: “Many researchers now believe the existing safety limits are inadequate to protect public health because they do not consider prolonged exposure to lower emission levels that are now widespread”.
Panellist Professor Elihu Richter from the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine in Israel said there was already “an increase in cancer and neuro-behavioural impairments, even though these wireless technologies are fairly new. This finding suggests that the exposures are already too high to protect people from health harm”.
Professor Yuri Grigoriev, Chair of the Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, said simply: “”Pregnant women and children of all ages should avoid using cell and cordless phones given the health effects we are seeing already.””
The panel recommends that government should greatly reduce the exposure limits for electromagnetic radiation. It also called for the establishment of an international registry to track the incidence and mortality rates for cancers and neurological and immune diseases over time.
It also proposes that the producers of new wireless technologies needed to prove that these are safe and that there should be compulsory testing of electromagnetic emissions levels before these were introduced.
Boorman agreed that there were “still some gaps in scientific knowledge, and more research is being carried out to fill these” and that the World Health Organisation set the priorities for global research
“However,” added Boorman, “people who personally want to can take simple steps to reduce their exposure as a precaution by keeping the mobile device away from the head and body during use, by using an earpiece, using the loudspeaker function, placing the device on a surface when sending data files and texting instead of calling”.

Growing Concern of the WiFi Radiation Impact on Children

Dr. David O. Carpenter, M.D Worries About the Biological Effects of Wireless Technology in Schools
Dr. David O. Carpenter, M.D is a subject matter expert and contributing author to Safe Schools 2012 on the subject of Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs). He shares his understanding about the health impacts of WiFi (a Radio Frequency (RF) exposure) as well as Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) emissions on children through this and many other publications. In December 2011, Dr. Carpenter authored a declaration, richly filled with information on the biological effects of wireless technologies and his concerns about the safety of wireless devices in schools. He recommends wired solutions, as opposed to WiFi, as a way to safeguard children and maximized learning.
Dr. Carpenter’s Background
Dr. Carpenter authored an Amended Declaration, dated December 20, 2011 as a court filing about Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) documenting his view on the impact WiFi will have on children attending school.
In Amended Declaration declaration, we find that Dr. Carpenter is a public health physician, educated at Harvard Medical School and currently, Director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany and Professor of Environmental Health Sciences within the School of Public Health. Previously, he was the Dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Albany and the Director of the Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research of the New York State Department of Health. Throughout his career, Dr, Carpenter concentrated his studies on electrophysiology, Electromagnetic Field bioeffects from Radio Frequency (RF) and Microwave (MW) radiation.
Some Views and Findings From Dr. Carpenter
Dr. Carpenter says, “In the context of school development, WI-FI exposes building occupants including children and adults constantly from both computers and infrastructure antennas. Duration may be an even more potent contributing factor to RF/MW radiation bioeffects than exposure levels. Chronic, such as all-day, school exposure, is more likely than short and intermittent exposure, such as cell phone use, to produce harmful health effects, and is likely to do so at lower exposure levels.”
He says solid scientific evidence is clear about the links between Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) exposure levels and possible changes in cell membrane function, cell communication, metabolism, activation of proto-oncogenes, and the triggering of the production of stress proteins. He observes that these health risks come from exposures below FCC guidelines and the same or less than those levels from school WiFi. He says, it has been shown that these radiations can cause cell deaths, DNA breaks, chromosome aberrations, cell stress, killed brain neurons, and even premature cell aging.
Human studies on the health impacts of Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation have found “changes in brain function including memory loss, retarded learning, performance impairment in children, headaches and neurodegenerative conditions, melatonin suppression and sleep disorders, fatigue, hormonal imbalances, immune dysregulation such as allergic and inflammatory responses, cardiac and blood pressure problems, genotoxic effects like miscarriage, cancers such as childhood leukemia, childhood and adult brain tumors, and more.”
He observes, public health science generally accepts the fact that some human groups are more vulnerable than others. Those more vulnerable include children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with preexisting illnesses and/or impairments. Children especially are vulnerable to exposed, because of the susceptibility of their developing nervous systems. Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation, he points out, more easily penetrates children’s heads. Children absorb more of the Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) energy in their tissues than adults at WiFi frequencies. Children’s skulls are thinner, their brains are smaller, and their brain tissue is more conductive.
Dr. Carpenter notes that the FCC public Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation exposure guidelines are based on the height, weight, and stature of a 6-foot tall man, not children with unique susceptibility. At early ages, children have a high rate of cellular activity and are at more at risk for DNA damage and subsequent cancers. He also notes, “Growth and development of the central nervous system is still occurring well into the teenage years, such that the neurological impairments predictable by the extent science may have great impact upon development, cognition, learning, and behavior.”
Studies have shown that when fetuses are exposed to Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation there is an increased risk factor for childhood leukemia and a higher incidence of miscarriages.
Dr. Carpenter understands from years of study and solid scientific evidence that Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation and Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) fields present health dangers. He also believes that there is active suppression of literature on these dangers. He goes on to say that the large body of scientific literature makes it clear that radiation exposure of chronic duration is quite harmful to humans, particularly children, as well as to animals and plants.
Declaration Summaries
Dr. David O. Carpenter, M.D believes Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation is a serious concern and a risk to human health. He observes that exposures like those from FM, TV and cell phones have been demonstrated to be harmful even though they are low intensity and only sometimes a long duration. Introduce varying age groups and those with preexisting sicknesses, there is higher risks, particularly for children. To make a bad exposure worse, increasing the constancy and length of exposure toward the maximum, up to a 24/7 durations such as from WiFi, will put human health at an even greater health risk.
Computer radiation microenvironments, where there are many sources of Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW), as is the case with WiFi-equipped schools, are more harmful than a single, isolated Radio Frequency (RF)/Microwave (MW) radiation exposure at the same power density and duration. Children are known to be more susceptible to these radiations than adults and now these radiations are in a school-confined radiation-filled environment. He believes internet access should be through wired access, not WiFi.

Hazard Thoughts for Tower Professionals
Posted on November 22, 2012 by liza sabado	— No Comments ↓
http://www.emfnews.org/headset.html
Radiation Detection Meters
Cell Phone Radiation Protection
For tower professionals and those that work in the broadcast and wireless industries, safety is paramount. While RF safety awareness is an important aspect of any hazard assessment, all professionals need to be mindful of all the other possible risks attached to the job. Working on towers is often regarded as the most dangerous job in America, and the statistics for fatal accidents don’t make pleasant reading. Therefore, safe working practice to eliminate the risk of injury or death has to be at the forefront of everybody’s mind in an industry fraught with danger. However, when it comes to analyzing potential hazards, there is no single one-size-fits-all assessment plan.
While certain risks may exist on one job, another site may pose completely different hazards, so for any professional working on towers, masts and antennas, assessing hazards has to be done on a site-by-site basis. That being said, certain risks tend to exist at nearly every site, and because workers in the profession face them on a daily basis, it can be all too easy to forget just how potent these hazards are. The result is that even the most experienced professional takes unnecessary risks every now and again, which can lead to avoidable accidents, so it always worth reassessing the common problems faced by tower and antenna engineers.
Working at height
The most obvious risk people working in the tower and antenna world face are the daily climbs. Whether its 50 feet or 500 feet the consequences of a fall can be the same, and every height has to be respected equally. Quite a few tower professionals will admit to having taken a chance while working at height during some point in their career, but in doing so they are risking their lives.
When a climb looks easy, or it is getting late in the day, it can be tempting to take short cuts. However, the job is dangerous enough without adding unnecessary risks into the equation, so properly assessing each tower before you climb and following OSHA or local safety procedures is vital to prevent becoming an unfortunate addition to the statistics.
Rooftop hazards
Many antennas, especially those in the cell phone industry, are these days located on top of roofs and other structures, and these can pose less obvious hazards for anybody tasked with repair or maintenance. Apart from the various trip hazards caused by rooftop furniture, such as air vents, a less visible and more sinister threat can be present, especially on older buildings.
Despite the Environment Protection Agency’s 1989 Asbestos Ban and Phase Out Rule, asbestos could still be present on some older buildings. This is because, before the health risks and the associations with lung cancer was realized in the early 1980s, asbestos was used as insulation and fireproofing almost everywhere. While EPA rules mean than all roofing material should now be asbestos free, you cannot take for granted that the building you are working on has no asbestos. If there is a suspicion that asbestos could be present, and you are planning to disturb roofing material, extreme caution needs to be taken. Be sure that the EPA or a certified industrial asbestos removal company has done an appropriate survey. For modern buildings, constructed since 1989, there shouldn’t be a problem, but when in doubt, seek guidance.
Weather
The weather is one the most challenging aspects for working on towers and antennas. Not only is it unpleasant working in the bitter cold, pouring rain, or baking sunshine, but also the weather can lead to accidents and injury. The most obvious threat posed by weather systems to anybody working at height is of course lightning. Nobody wants to be up an antenna or tower when a thunderstorm hits. While the tower may be protected by a lightning dissipation system, somebody working on the tower won’t be protected from stray, potentially lethal, discharges. Being on a tall object means the risk of a lightning strike is high. However, in some locations, the speed at which storm clouds can gather is easy to underestimate. A good rule of thumb is that if it looks like thunder, stay down. Be sure that your safety plan addresses this up front.
Torrential rain, extreme cold and even high levels of heat also pose risks. Rain can obviously make climbing surfaces slippery, while metal antennas in sub zero temperatures pose skin contact risk. In hot weather, burns are possible too, so when it is very cold or hot, check the temperature of the antenna or tower before ascension and always wear protection.
Heat and cold also pose life-threatening stress risks. It is important to know the symptoms of these conditions, and appropriate first aid for them.
Tiredness
Driving long distance is as much a part of the job as climbing. Several hours behind the wheel will often result in feelings of tiredness, so time should be taken when arriving on site to shrug off feelings of fatigue. Don’t risk climbing or working when feeling sleepy. Feeling tired can lead to mistakes, so if a journey has drained you, take time to have a coffee, stretch your legs, or even take a short nap if necessary. Furthermore, for anybody in such a physical job, it also helps to keep yourself in shape and take care of your overall health and fitness, which can reduce the risk of something untoward happening when up a tower, mast or antenna.
Training
In addition to the RF Awareness training mentioned earlier, LBA now offers comprehensive Outdoor Worker Awareness training with certificate, on-line. This training encompasses heat and cold stress; venomous snakes, plants, and spiders; U/V dangers; and other OSHA hazards tower specialists are likely to encounter outdoors.

B.C. School Districts Divided on Future of Wi-Fi
Posted on November 15, 2012 by liza sabado	— No Comments ↓

Cell Phone Radiation Protection
A B.C. school district concerned about the dangers of wireless signals is reviewing a CTV investigation revealing that radiation levels in classrooms equipped with Wi-Fi aren’t any higher than in those without.
The Greater Victoria School Board has placed a moratorium on the installation of wireless systems until it hears from a committee studying the potential for health impacts. But after hearing about a CTV News investigation on wireless signal exposure, school board chair Peg Ocherton said she wants to know more.
“I’d be interested in actually seeing the report. If CTV’s willing to share that fully with us, that would be great. I’d give it to the committee for their referral,” she told CTV News.
After her request, CTV forwarded information to Orcherton, who will ask her committee to review it before making recommendations to the board.
She admitted the board is taking a prudent approach.
“The question for us is student safety,” Orcherton said, adding that there are at least two students who have health problems their parents believe are connected to electromagnetic emissions.
In tests conducted at four Vancouver schools, children in schools with Wi-Fi installed were found to have about the same exposure to electromagnetic emissions produced by the devices as schools without Wi-Fi. The levels inside schools were about 10 times lower than a student would feel outside in the playground or walking to school.
Vancouver School Board chair Patti Bacchus said she wasn’t surprised by the results.
“We overall feel that we have been assured that it is a safe technology, that is appropriate for use in schools,” she said.
The B.C. Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils voted in May to ask each school district in the province to set aside at least one school at each education level without Wi-Fi, cordless phones or cell phones, in response to some parents’ beliefs that the waves can cause everything from headaches to cancer.
After being shown the results of CTV’s investigation, confederation chair John Puddifoot said he would speak with his board.
“I’d love to have had this data before the resolution was passed,” he said.
Dave Michelson, a researcher at the University of B.C. Radio Science lab, studies radio waves, and says the emissions from wireless devices carry millions of times less energy than cancer-causing rays like UV from the sun.
“The miracle of wireless communications is we can detect signals that weak and get information out of them. As far as any physical effects, they’re too weak to have almost any physical effect,” he said.
Karl Reardon, the Planetworks engineer who performed the tests for CTV News, said that the signals coming from the Wi-Fi units were too low to measure on most equipment.
“It’s so far below any of the standards; it’s literally thousand of times below the Health Canada limits. It’s comparable and lower than the environment we’re exposed to every day when we’re outdoors,” he said.
The province’s two largest school districts, Vancouver and Surrey, are hoping to have Wi-Fi installed in all of their schools by the end of next year.

WiFi Radiation in Classrooms May Be as Dangerous as Microwave Weapons

British Physicist and Microwave Weapons Expert Barrie Trower Warns Our Children are at Great Risk from WiFi Radiation
There continues to be controversy about the use of WiFi in the classroom. To add to the confusion, over the past year or so, we are learning that WiFi transmitters emit Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) similar to the microwave radiations used in the design of microwave weaponry. Barrie Trower, a British physicist and microwave weapons expert has been sharing his experiences on the subject to audiences considering WiFi in the classroom.
When connected to these potential dangers, keep your distance from the source, such as your WiFi router. When using your laptop computer, iPad, tablet or other handheld device in your lap, be sure to use a laptop radiation shield. Protecting yourself using an Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) shield from devices at zero distance from the body will eliminate the worst dangers the WiFi transmitter can deliver.
Background on Barrie Trower and WiFi
With most of the career with the Royal British Navy and military intelligence, Barrie Trower dedicated much of his career in the study of the effect of microwave energy on the human body. He recently came out of retirement to share his experiences about WiFi in part, because he strongly understands that microwave radiation and WiFi radiation are very similar. Both are health risks to humans and not harmless as others may claim.
In various interviews and presentations to, for example, to Health Canada, Mr. Trower delivers a common theme – WiFi is dangerous. He says that WiFi signals are equal to those used in microwave weapons and that they are threats to humans, particularly the elderly and children. When it comes to children and WiFi, Mr. Trower says, “children are physiologically and neurologically immature. It takes years for the blood-brain barrier to form, leaving children more prone to cell-leakage from microwave radiation.” When visiting children in schools, he notes that WiFi exposure is causing health problems that include, nausea, headaches and vision problems. He further says, “Children have less dense bones, immature immune systems and, by virtue of their size, they can act as aerials. Females have more complex hormone based systems to be disrupted than males.”
In another example, Trower says, “I was previously aware of reports concerning dead birds in and around communication bases. On examination these birds were found to be cooked.” He was referring to powerful microwave communications having the capacity to oscillate cells sufficiently as to cook the birds alive. Additionally, he points out that Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) can give us headaches, disrupt our sleep, open us up to infection and create fatigue. He goes on to say that, in high concentrations and over large durations of time, it has been documented that these radiations can cause cancers, like leukemia.
What Does All This Mean?
Laptops, tablets, and other handheld devices connected to the internet via WiFi, can either rest on a desktop or a child’s lap emitting Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). Elsewhere within a building, there are access points and routers, also transmitting Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). When directly near the router transmitters, children are exposed to the strongest signal the equipment can emit. Even moving only a few feet away, exposure dangers quickly diminish. As a good rule of thumb, at four foot away, exposure levels and associated health dangers are greatly reduced.
Mr. Trower believes all exposure is dangerous, but sometimes you may find it important to be connected to the internet via a WiFi connection. Maybe you are traveling, or maybe your university offers WiFi, or maybe you just have a WiFi router you use at home. In many ways, WiFi is impossible to avoid. The most intense exposure is when you electronic device is on your lap at zero distance away from the body. For these conditions, find laptop radiation protection. Putting an Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) shield between you and the device removes the worst of the exposure danger.
Conclusion
WiFi in our classrooms, by some, is considered as dangerous as military microwave weaponry. At the very least, we should be aware of the potential dangers and find ways to avoid them. Keep your distance from radiating sources or use laptop radiation protection when using laptop computers, tablets and other handheld devices that contain WiFi transmitters that emit Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR).

Cell Phone Safety: Radiation from Cell phones and Telephone Towers can Cause Health Problems

Radiation from cell phones and telephone towers can cause health problems such as brain tumors, cancer, infertility, memory loss, depression, sleep and behavior problems.
A recent AOL-Pew Research Center Mobile Lifestyle Survey revealed that 52 percent of American adults surveyed keep their cell phone turned on all the time while 40 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 are saying that they are increasingly likely to drop their land line once and for all.
With an estimated three billion cell phone users worldwide and most adults and teenagers owning a cell phone or smart phone, it seems a bit late to be asking the question: are cell phones safe?
Nevertheless, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) has reported that many research groups around the world are working hard to find out if cell phones are actually safe to use. Some (not all) studies of frequent cell-phone users suggest cell phone radiation may increase risks for cancer and children’s behavior problems.
Why Cell Phones Can Be Dangerous
All cell phones and mobile devices emit radiation in order to send all those voice calls and text messages which so many people depend on each day.
Cell phone radiation exposure is long-term, and its effects on the body, particularly the electrical organ, the brain, are compounded by numerous other simultaneous long-term exposures including continuous waves from radio and TV transmitter towers, cordless phone base stations, power lines, and wireless computing devices.
Can Cell Phones Cause Brain Cancer?
World renowned neurosurgeon, Dr. Vini Khurana has deemed cell phone use “”worse than smoking”” for cancer risk. Dr. Khurana has published a study in which he links cell phone usage to an increased risk of brain cancer. He also suggests that mobile phones could one day be responsible for more cancer deaths than either cigarette smoking or asbestos exposure.
A malignant brain tumor represents a life-ending diagnosis in the vast majority of those diagnosed. Since many cancers take more than a decade to develop and be detected, often well after it is too late, Dr. Khurana fears the potential lethal prognosis which may be waiting for those who constantly have a mobile phone held (or strapped) to their heads.
The “”incubation time”” or “”latency”” (the time from commencement of regular mobile phone usage to the diagnosis of a malignant solid brain tumor in a susceptible individual) may be in the order of 10 to 20 years, he writes.
Despite the dismissal of the physicians concerns by industry groups and millions of cell phone users, Dr. Khurana insists it’s only logical to conclude that radiation emanating from the phones isn’t good for the brain; he’s worried that we may soon start seeing a virtual cancer epidemic as the exposure takes its toll.
Can Cell Phones Cause Infertility?
If brain cancer wasn’t bad enough, it seems that cell phone use may also contribute to an increase in male infertility, which could be a huge problem if you’re trying to conceive. According to a 2008 observational study by the Reproductive Research Center, use of cell phones has been shown to decrease the semen quality in men by decreasing the sperm count, motility, viability, and normal morphology. The decrease in sperm parameters was dependent on the duration of daily exposure to cell phones and independent of the initial semen quality.
Cell Phone Exposure Poses Great Risk to Children
Already pregnant? You should seriously consider tossing your cell phone’s handset. A massive study by the universities of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Aarhus, Denmark of over 13,000 children from birth up to age seven has shown that pregnant women using cell phone handsets just two or three times a day was enough to raise the risk of their babies developing hyperactivity and difficulties with behavior, emotions and relationships by the time they reached school age. The research also indicates that the risk is even greater if the children themselves used the cell phones before age seven.
According to the Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, child cell phone users are likely to face health hazards such as disruption of memory, decline of attention, diminishing learning and cognitive abilities, increased irritability, sleep problems, increased sensitivity to stress, and increased epileptic readiness in the near future.
Expected (possible) long term health risks of cell phone use by children include brain tumors, tumors of acoustical and vestibular nerves by the age of 25 to 30 years, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, depressive syndrome, and other types of degeneration of the nervous structures of the brain by the age of 50 to 60.
The Committee emphasizes the ultimate urgency to defend children’s health from the influence of the electromagnetic fields (EMF) of mobile communication devices in order to prevent negative consequences to the future generation’s health.

Explosive Use of WiFi Creates Massive Increase in RF Radiation Exposure

How to Protect Yourself from Wireless Radiation
Enter a home with WiFi, and you are immediately exposed to an invisible, odorless and untouchable Radio Frequency (RF) Electromagnetic Field (EMF). Go into a school, office building or a coffee shop and you are exposed to even more radiation from multiple WiFi routers and repeater antenna sources. Some say the ambient exposure in these rooms can be as high as 800 millivolts/meter (mV/m), 6000 mV/m at the router antenna and close to 3000 mV/m at the laptop computer. To put this in perspective, if you were to go into the country where no radiating sources exist, the ambient reading would be approximately 11 mV/m. That’s right, it is that low because in nature, there is no natural source of Radio Frequency (RF) radiation.
Recently, the American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) released an article entitled Electromagnetic and Radio Frequency Field Effect on Human Health which says, “In the last five years with the advent of wireless devices, there has been a massive increase in Radio Frequency (RF) exposure from wireless devices as well as reports of hypersensitivity and diseases related to electromagnetic field and RF exposure.” In short, radiation from modern wireless devices is increasing at an exponential rate, and lets face it, not going away anytime soon. With that said, we need to consider actions to reduce radiation exposure, including the use of a laptop radiation shield.
What is WiFi?
WiFi is an electronic communication which enables wireless connection between a computer to the internet. Many WiFi connections are at RF fields the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz bandwidths which can travel up to several 100 feet or more. Microwave ovens use the identical 2.4 GHz frequency to cook food by penetrating the food and oscillating (heating up) the cells until the food is fully prepared. The WiFi 2.4 GHz may be less intense, but can be considered a thermal and non-thermal exposure which can heat up cells and generate reasonably high current flow in the body and create potential health dangers. Ironically, the FCC only considers thermal effects of exposure, not the non-thermal impacts which have proven to have many health impacts.
WiFi Radiation Effect on Human Health
The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) reports there needs to be more scientific studies that better document evidence of thermal bioeffects and non-thermal negative health effects of RF exposure. It continues, “However, many in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies demonstrate that significant harmful biological effects occur from non-thermal RF exposure and satisfy Hill’s criteria of causality. Genetic damage, reproductive defects, cancer, neurological degeneration and nervous system dysfunction, immune system dysfunction, cognitive effects, protein and peptide damage, kidney damage, and developmental effects have all been reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.” They also say, “Genotoxic effects from RF exposure, including studies of non-thermal levels of exposure, consistently and specifically show chromosomal instability, altered gene expression, gene mutations, DNA fragmentation and DNA structural breaks.” Genotoxic is defined as the damaging of DNA causing mutation or cancer. These damages have been reported to neurons, red blood cells, cells and tissue.
This report goes on to say that WiFi will degenerate the kidney, can cause neurological damage and has proven to be the source of Electromagnetic Field Hypersensitivity (EFH). It concludes, “Because of the well documented studies showing adverse effects on health and the not fully understood quantum field effect, AAEM calls for exercising precaution with regard to EMF, RF and general frequency exposure. It is clear that the human body uses electricity from the chemical bond to the nerve impulse and obviously this orderly sequence can be disturbed by an individual-specific electromagnetic frequency environment.”
What Can We Do to Protect Ourselves from Wireless Radiation?
Martin Blank, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons; Researcher in Bioelectromagnetics; Author of the BioInitiative Report’s section on Stress Proteins, sums it up well, “The scientific evidence tells us that our safety standards are inadequate, and that we must protect ourselves from exposure to EMF due to power lines, cell phones and the like, or risk the known consequences. The science is very strong and we should sit up and pay attention.”
Because of its convenience, it’s a good bet that WiFi technology will all around us for the foreseeable future. We need to minimize health dangers from constant exposure until technology inherently becomes safer. We should actively consider actions for dealing with WiFi in our environment.
Steps to shield from WiFi Radiation:
In general, try to avoid EMF-transmitting sources like a WiFi routers. The farther away you get, the less intense the signal and potential health dangers. A few feet distance away can reduce transmitting intensity levels by as much as 80%.
Use Ethernet wiring to connect to the internet to avoid WiFi signals in your surroundings.
Place your laptop, tablet or other electronic device on a desk instead of your lap.
When using your WiFi-enabled electronic device in your lap, at zero distance from the body, try to keep the use time to a minimum.
If possible, after using the WiFi network, turn off the router. This will eliminate a constant radiation field from permeating your environment.
If you chose to use your WiFi device in your lap for a long period of time, place a laptop shield between your body and your device to prevent EMR from penetrating your body. This action removes one of the most intense sources of exposure to your body that is found in your environment.

Do Cell Phone EMF Protectors Work?

Cell phone risks are known and noted in the scientific community, but whether or not devices designed to limit their hazards really work is still up for debate.
Mobile phones have been associated with brain and jaw cancer for many years. But despite the known health risks of microwaves, electromagnetic frequencies and other radiation put out by cell phones, very few people make use of the devices that are designed to protect from radiation dangers. There’s little scientific evidence that they work, yet many people report improvements in their health and productivity when using a cell phone protector.
Cell Phone Hazards
The dangers of cell phones are two-fold, since cell phones emit electromagnetic frequencies (“”EMF””) as well as microwaves.
The effects of cell phone exposure can be easily observed on EEG scans.
Many people report disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, irritation, loss of focus, headaches, migraines, and insomnia when exposed to EMF without protection.
Microwaves are known for their cancer risk; the brain, ears and eyes are especially vulnerable to microwave frequencies.
Mobile phones have been linked with fertility problems for those who wear cell phones in their pants pockets.
Cell Phone Radiation Protection
Several products exist that can protect people from the hazards of cell phone use.
Cell phone protectors usually come in the form of a chip or small decal that can be installed in a phone or attached to the back of your cell. They are usually programmed with frequencies that counter the effects of EMF pollution emitted by phones.
Although there is some variation in such products, EEG reports show that some are genuinely effective in blocking or limiting the effect that cell phone use has on the brain and body.
People who are sensitive to electromagnetic frequencies generally report less headaches, more mental clarity, and better ability to focus productively when they use a cell phone protector on their phone, Blackberry, portable home phone or other mobile device.
Do Cell Phone Protectors Really Work?
There is significant debate over whether cell phone protectors work or are just an elaborate hoax. Although little third-party, peer-reviewed research exists that could verify that they have passed scientific muster, they do help some people with intense EMF reactions, and that alone is evidence that there is truth to the claims about cell phone protectors.
The research just doesn’t exist that could establish how much cell phone radiation is necessary for serious health problems to occur. But with the known risks, it makes sense to do everything possible to protect yourself – especially for those who use mobile phones or PDAs frequently.
