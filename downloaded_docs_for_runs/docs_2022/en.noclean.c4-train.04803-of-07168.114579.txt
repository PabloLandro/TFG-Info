What You Should Know About Himalayan Salt Lamps
Do Salt Lamps Emit Negative Ions?
Yes. There are both negative and positive ions in the environment (nature, air, and so on). Positive ions have a negative effect on energy levels, mood, and overall health, while negative ions can produce biochemical reactions that combat the effects of positive ions, boosting energy, lifting mood, and improving health. Because Himalayan pink salt million-year-old pink salt has been untouched by pollutants while containing more than 84 minerals, the pure salt does emit negative ions that can improve air quality, reduce allergens, enhance energy, and so much more.
Is It Safe To Leave Salt Lamps On All the Time?
Yes, absolutely! Salt lamps are not only safe to leave on regularly and for long periods of time – it’s recommended. For one, the more you have your salt lamp on, the better chance you have of reaping the benefits these unique lamps provide. As the bulb heats up the salt rock that makes up the lamp, the ionizing action is kicked into gear, which creates the air purifying effect. Secondly, Himalayan salt lamps only require the use of low wattage bulbs and do not consume a great amount of electricity for use. Plus, LED bulbs are ideal for salt lamps, providing an even more cost-effective and energy efficient light source for your salt lamp. Overall, it is safe to leave your salt lamp on all the time, but, as with any electrical appliance, it’s always good to give it a rest from time-to-time.
Are Himalayan Salt Lamps Really Hygroscopic?
Yes, studies show that Himalayan salt lamps are hygroscopic, meaning they attract water molecules in the air, moisture, and humidity. Because airborne water can also hold and transmit pollutants, bacteria, and allergens that can affect air quality, Himalayan salt lamps can purify the air by attracting water molecules in the air where they can stick to the salt rock. Therefore, it is important to regularly wipe down your salt lamp with a cloth every so often.
