Baking soda has always been a popular traditional homeopathic remedy because of its effectiveness. Traditionally, it was used to cure colds, and today it is even being used to cure cancer!
When the body is acidic it leads to the breakdown of cell regeneration which leads to chronic health conditions as the cells no longer reproduce healthily. And in these modern times, the American diet is highly conducive to bringing about an acidic environment.
The pharmacy industry doesn’t want you to know the healing capabilities of baking soda. There have even been reported cases of cancer being cured by baking soda.
Asthma
There are aggressive forms of asthma that are resistant to bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids that affect children. A study showing that administering baking soda intravenously improves PCO2 (Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide) and the PH (acidic or basic state) balance in children.
Chemotherapy
Sodium bicarbonate is a naturally occurring substance and especially good at neutralizing toxic substances. In a time when our bodies are constantly being attacked by toxic substances, baking soda is a true ally. Bicarbonate is currently used in conjunction with chemotherapy to prevent kidney damage.
Cancer
Sodium Bicarbonate supplementation results in the alkalization of the area around tumors, which makes the environment uninhabitable for tumor growth, as tumors feed on an acidic environment and die in an alkaline one. It is also found to enhance anti-tumor activity in other anti-cancer drugs. It is also found to prevent cancer recurrence.
Baking soda is full of practical homeopathic applications and is an amazing supplement to balancing PH levels in the human body. Just assure that the baking soda that you use is aluminum free.
