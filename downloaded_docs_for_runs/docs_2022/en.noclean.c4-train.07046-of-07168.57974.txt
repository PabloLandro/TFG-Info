The Ranker is the latest advancement from Smoant since the well-received Cylon mod. It utilizes their most recent chipset which fires with virtually no delay using dual 18650s. This super responsive mod is firmware upgradable. It also has a colorful 1.3-inch OLED screen with 2 user interface options.
Be sure to measure how often you think you will use a vape pen. Its usage depends entirely on the user and if you are stuck somewhere, unable to charge it, then you may want to decide on a vape pen with a large battery capacity. Cheaper vape pens need to be charged throughout the day after continuous use, but larger ones might only need to be charged once a day. Some vape pens can be used while charging as well.
Joyetech is known for making some of the original classic vape pens. Now they’re back with a new one that incorporates the latest technology. The eGo AIO ECO is a mouth-to-lung vape pen. It uses 650 mAh battery with a special feature that extends its lifespan by almost double.
Vape pens offer a discreet vaping experience. Ever feel uncomfortable vaping in public? Vaporizer pens ease that pain point by allowing you to vape without drawing attention to your habit. The vape pen is shaped like an office pen, slender and sleek. In fact, vape pens look more like ecigarettes than portable vapes, giving them an incognito quality. Unlike portable vapes, which aren’t pen-shaped, the vapor pen won’t burden your pocket, and can be concealed almost completely in your hand.
Let me start off with saying “Thank you”. Thanks to everyone who was part of the making of the “K Vape” vaporizer. In all my experiences with various Portable Vapes, this is by far the best vaporizer on the market today. I have never experienced such an awesome experience in my entire years of vaping, to add I was vaping on the first level with no issues, that’s right NO ISSUES whatsoever. Regard
Should concentrates and e-juice both be outside of your interests, there are still more options for these types of units! A small number of these devices are configured to perfectly vaporize dry herbs for a discreet, on-the-go experience. One of the most well-known vape pen configured for dry herb use is, of course, the Atmos Jump. While the Jump has all the style that you could ask for in a slim-style herbal unit, there are options that provide thicker vapor on a longer battery life. A front-runner among these options is the Quickdraw 300 DLX. It’s a very unique unit because of it’s ability to properly vaporizer herbs in addition concentrates and e-liquid, making it one of the best multi-function pen-style vapes you can buy.
Finding your first vape can be difficult at first, but it just got easier thanks to Halo. This kit will give you everything you need to start including juice, a tank and mod. All of the features you would find on mods such as the Eleaf iStick, but from Halo. A company that is trusted by vapers.
Concentrate vape pens allow the user to vape certain types of oils that offer a discreet style of vaping your concentrates while the user is out and about. Most of these concentrate vape pens are pen-shaped, but some are more flat and narrow allowing for even more portability. Other types are a mod-style which are more powerful, giving the user plenty of clouds and a pleasant flavor experience. Concentrate vape pens pride themselves on their sleek designs with the power of a rig in your pocket.
As Alex mentioned, we had a massive site re-design recently which took two months to complete, so things were quite quiet during that time. We are tying to get more reviewers in place to make sure we cover more products, but unfortunately due to the market moving so quickly it is very hard to cover even a fraction of the new products coming out and some things just get missed. We are doing our best, so bare with us! Over the last month we have published around 20 reviews, which I don’t think is too shabby. We have to make sure we appeal to all types of vapers with our reviews, so that means providing a mix of products and not just box mods.
Get full control of your dabs. Titanium coils and quartz wicking provided a big and powerful hit on the highest setting, and a smoother, more flavorful draw on the lower settings. A hard hitting pen with awesome flavor. What separates this one from the similar-looking clones out there?
Manufacturers didn’t want users questioning how to turn on a vape pen, so they have kept it simple. Most pens are switched on by pressing the fire button (three or five consecutive clicks will do the trick). However, some are draw-activated, which means they don’t have a fire button and light up on inhale.

One important thing that many vapers, and especially beginners, don’t pay attention to is the airflow. The amount of airflow has a significant impact on the overall vaping experience of any pen. For a mouth-to-lung pen, you’ll want a pen that has a tight draw; and for more vapor but slightly less flavor, a pen with a lot of airflow is better.
If you get an authentic vapor pen, rest assured that you will get decent performance. But some vaporizer pens are very cheap, and you get what you pay for.

That’s why we recommend investing in a decent vaporizer, made by a reputable manufacturer. The best vaporizer pens will give you great flavor and nice throat hits.

Series 3X dry herb kit comes with an included cartridge for loose leaf, so it does not have to be ordered separately. Of course, vape juice cartridges are included with it. The entire device is beautifully designed, with magnetic clasps holding the cartridge in place and ensuring easy swapping. The chamber uses conduction heating, but it is designed in such a way that it almost guarantees that the material is not burned but vaporized instead. It also holds around 0.1 – 0.2 grams of material – easy to vape in around four minutes and requiring only one reactivation of the heating function.
Changes to pulse mode when you turn up the mod sometimes over 150 watts (though I never need that kind of burn anyway even on my dripper) Depending on what your build is also. I’d have to be insane to try it out of a subtank with that kind of wattage
