Cipro for UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) Treatment
Urinary tract infections cause unpleasant problems with urinary and reproductive organs. Urinary tract infections are especially dangerous because they go undetected without any symptoms. It can last for a while but sooner or later it turns into an urgent health problem.
Unfortunately, there is a rapid increase of urogenital infections among young people in recent years.

What is upsetting is that about 60% percent of infected people do not even realize that they have urinary tract infection that can or cannot be sexually transmitted disease (STD) at the same time. Different parasites, fungi, viruses and bacteria can cause genitourinary infections and diseases. Some of them are highly contagious and sexually transmitted.
Urinary tract infections have different symptoms for women and men. In men, urinary tract infections cause painful urination, difficulty with urination, and burning sensation. Men often suffer from such urinary tract infections as urethritis (inflammation of the urinary canal) and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate system). Because women have different physiology, they have higher risk of urinary tract infections. Often, pathogens for urinary tract infections or STDs are passed from unsuspecting male to female and vice versa.
In case when a patient is diagnosed with urinary infection or STD, all sexual partners have to be tested and treated for inflammatory infections and/or sexually transmitted diseases. If you suspect you have urinary tract disease or STD, immediately visit your doctor to get help.
Modern medicine offers a wide range of medicine to deal with urinary tract infections and STDs, so it is important to choose wisely depending on the cause and symptoms. Some pathogens can be resistant to antibacterial drugs so it’s necessary to find the right one. Many antibiotics prove to be effective for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
Cipro (Ciprofloxacin) is one of the most effective drugs to treat unitary tract infections. Ciprofloxacin is the second generation of fluoroquinolones. It suppresses the DNA-hyrax in bacteria but it does not interfere the human cells. It has highly selective for infection. Cipro is safe and side affects are rare. The antibactericidal effect starts working in a few hours and builds up in 1 or 2 days.
Fluoroquinolones and Ciprofloxacin are highly effective in treating most pathogens causing urinary tract infections in dosage that are average therapeutic concentrations.

Several years ago I was diagnosed with gynecological inflammation. A doctor prescribed me antibiotic medicine Cipro 500 ml in tablets. When I read an instruction about the drug, there were some warnings about allergy and side affects. Actually, it helped me just fine. Cipro (Ciprofloxacin) is a wide spectrum antibacterial action. It gets rid of infection and inflammation. I took one tablet for ten days and I recovered. The medicine cost about $5 which I find a small price for really working drug.
