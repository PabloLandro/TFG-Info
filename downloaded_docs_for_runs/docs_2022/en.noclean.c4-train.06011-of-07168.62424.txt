Alleviate Nausea

Nausea is an ill feeling accompanied by an involuntary urge to vomit. Ginger has been used for many years to remedy seasickness, and evidence supports its use as a suitable remedy for nausea due to many causes. It can also alleviate nausea after surgery and in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Certain medications are also known to trigger vomiting. Nausea is caused by an increase in serotonin in the vagus nerve pathway. Based on tissue and cellular research, ginger blocks excess serotonin and thus preventing the vagus nerve activation in the stomach and gut. In a study that monitored a total of 1,278 pregnant women, results showed 1.1-1.5 grams of ginger greatly alleviates nausea. If used for at least four days in a row the effects may increase by up to five times. One gram taken before medication is enough to mitigate both mild and severe nausea after two weeks.
