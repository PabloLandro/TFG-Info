Cyprus - 'Technology harming our children' MPs say
Lawmakers yesterday discussed what Greens leader Giorgos Perdikis called damning evidence of psychological and physical effects on children from using mobile phones, tablets, laptops and Wi-Fi.
Perdikis said that based on the evidence, children and teenagers should be banned from using such technology, and went as far as to say that it was criminal to allow children to access electronic devices.

Naperville smart meter opponent gets $117,500 settlement from city
Naperville City Council members this week settled a federal lawsuit filed last winter by a staunch opponent of the city's smart meter installation program.
The 12-page agreement calls for paying $117,500 to Naperville resident Malia "Kim" Bendis, whose Jan. 23 lawsuit accused the city and four of its police officers of violating her constitutional rights

DTE shuts off power to 92-year-old woman's home because of battle over smart meter
The utility company shut off Olga Puste's power the day after her 92nd birthday, because she installed a lock on her meter. DTE wants to install a smart meter, which Puste says is against her beliefs.
Puste is a long time naturopath and avoids things like conventional medicine and vaccines.

DTE shows just how low a utility company can go!
Blackmailing and holding to ransom a handicapped 92 year old lady - just so they can install a known dangerous device.
This is a discusting action which should be investigated as a criminal offence.

Victorian smart meters not worth the growing $2.24b cost: Auditor-General
Australia - Victorians will have forked out $2.24 billion by the year's end on new electricity smart meters, which were supposed to provide future cost savings, but a new report has found the costs will likely outweigh the benefits.

Mobile phones' impact on lessons coming under scrutiny
A third of schools across England already ban mobiles, claiming they distract and lead to low-level disruption in the classroom, with a further fifth limiting their use in classrooms.
"Teachers, however, have reported that the growing number of children bringing personal devices into class is hindering teaching and leading to disruption," a spokesperson said.

The Terror of Wi-Fi Sickness
So, yes. If Wi-fi was indeed dangerous to one's health, it wouldn't have been approved. Worst case scenario, if it could be proven, it would be up there with smoking cigarettes.

Kazakh Factory Produces School Uniforms that Protect from Cell Phone Radiation
"A compound of X-shield fabric that is sewn into inner pockets uses copper that provides protection against mobile phone radiation. We were holding tests with special appliances in a laboratory and found that when a phone is in that pocket, radiation is 80 to 90 percent less harmful," administrator of chain stores in Astana, Dilyaram Tursinova told Khabar news agency.

California Assembly Bill 57
Watch the Testimony on Biological Health Effects Now on Public Record
California Assembly Bill 57 would give wireless communications companies near carte blanche authority to install new cell phone antennas  without public notice or chance for appeal  passed the CA Senate Aug. 31 and is currently awaiting Gov. Jerry Brown's signature. The Telecom industry heavily lobbied state legislators to vote for this bill which was heavily opposed by several cities. It removes much of a city or local government's regulatory authority over such installations.

New Research Shows That WiFi Causes Heart Problems
Saili, Hanini, Smirani, et al.
Effects of acute exposure to WIFI signals (2.45 GHz) on heart variability and blood pressure in Albinos rabbit. Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology. 40(2):600-605. September 2015. doi:10.1016/j.etap.2015.08.01)http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668915300594.
"These results suggest that exposure to WIFI affect heart rhythm, blood pressure, and catecholamines efficacy on cardiovascular system; indicating that radiofrequency can act directly and/or indirectly on cardiovascular system."
Abstract
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668915300594
Electrocardiogram and arterial pressure measurements were studied under acute exposures to WIFI (2.45 GHz) during one hour in adult male rabbits. Antennas of WIFI were placed at 25 cm at the right side near the heart. Acute exposure of rabbits to WIFI increased heart frequency (+22%) and arterial blood pressure (+14%). Moreover, analysis of ECG revealed that WIFI induced a combined increase of PR and QT intervals. By contrast, the same exposure failed to alter maximum amplitude and P waves. After intravenously injection of dopamine (0.50 ml/kg) and epinephrine (0.50 ml/kg) under acute exposure to RF we found that, WIFI alter catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine) action on heart variability and blood pressure compared to control. These results suggest for the first time, as far as we know, that exposure to WIFI affect heart rhythm, blood pressure, and catecholamines efficacy on cardiovascular system; indicating that radiofrequency can act directly and/or indirectly on cardiovascular system.

It is sad and wrong that innocent animals have to suffer for this type of study. I wish that this research could be carried out on the people who are profiting from wireless technology, or those who should be safeguarding the public and are failing their duties!

Government committee warns of health impacts of wireless technology
Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Radiation and the Health of Canadians, a report of the all-party House of Commons Standing Committee on Health, was released in June following public hearings into Health Canada's Safety Code 6 guideline on human exposure to electromagnetic energy.
The Committee heard from witnesses who raised concerns about possible links between radiofrequency radiation exposure and cancer, reproductive issues, autism and electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

Health concerns in the digital age
The research of neurologist Martha Herbert from Harvard Medical School indicates that radiation from cell phones penetrates deep into children's heads and can damage cells. Her research has also indicated a likely link between autism and RF field exposure.
