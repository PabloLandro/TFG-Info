Wi-Fi, Radio frequency Radiation and your Health
2015/04/09 Ted	Leave a comment
Jerry Flynn has made many presentations that show that Radio Frequency Radiation is extremely harmful to YOUR HEALTH.
Here is a short version of his major presentations.
This slide show presentation requires a program on your computer that will display a slide show using file type PPTX.
Jerry Flynn is a retired Canadian Military Captain who spent 22 of 26 years in Canada’s military in Electronic Warfare and Signals Intelligence. His experience included two years in National Defense Headquarters, Ottawa, in the Directorate of Electronic Warfare (EW), during which he worked closely with army EW units of Canada’s U.S. and NATO allies.
Previously he was the Executive Officer (2-i/c) and Operations Officer at one of Canada’s largest and most sensitive Intelligence-gathering stations. Earlier still Jerry conducted naval radio warfare operations at sea with U.S., Australian naval forces, having served aboard two Canadian warships.
He currently is a guest on talk shows throughout North America and in the UK and as well has toured throughout BC presenting to audiences on this subject.

The Electromagentic Age – A sleeping Giant by Dr Mac Paterson
2015/02/24 Ted	Leave a comment
Dr Mac Paterson gave a presentation in Kaleden BC on Saturday Feb 21, 2015. The presentation was attended by about 250 people.
The presentation is not available yet on video but hopefully it soon will be.
Dr Paterson is scheduled to give the presentation in Kelowna and Salmon Arm next month, so watch for the dates and locations.
Here are some of the parts of his presentation that I found interesting.
Dr Paterson has been involved in research all of his career and has many professional publications to his credit. He specialized in Molecular Oncology.
The Canadian Safety Code 6 is only concerned with the heating effects of radiation and nothing to do with the electrical effects on the human body. The human body is chemical and electrical in nature and even very low levels of microwave radiation impacts the body. Safety Code 6 allows 600 µW/cm² (microwatts per square cm) whereas it has been shown that the human body is sensitive to 0.1 µW/cm² , a factor of 6,000 times.
The experts that decided on the level of the Safety Code 6 were experts in the physics of electrical RF radiation and there were no experts who knew anything about the effect on the human body’s electrical functioning. This resulted in this huge discrepancy.
Some people that suffer from EHS (Electro Hyper Sensitivity) feel RF radiation at levels that are 0.5% of the levels allowed by Safety Code 6.
Dr Paterson estimates that about 25,000 people in BC suffer from some level of EHS; mild to severe. Also, other researchers estimate that 4% to 10% of all people in the world are EHS. There are estimates that 50% of all people will be EHS soon. One researcher says by 2017.
There are many studies (42 to date) that confirm the fact that the magnetic field created by high voltage (high tension) power lines does cause a significant increase in childhood leukemia.
Concerning the opt-out of Smart meters, Dr Paterson says that communities, and not individuals, should OPT-OUT.
Pulsed RF radiation has been shown to be 2.5 times more damaging to human health than clean sinusoidal 60 Hz power.
Computers that use the SMPS (switch mode power supply) create significant amounts of DE (dirty electricity) which is pulsed and may (does) cause health effects especially in EHS people.
Tobacco has been shown to have a 20 year lag time between smoking and the average time of the diagnosis of cancer. RF Radiation is thought to be similar and if so then the numbers of cancers due to RF Radiation will soon increase dramatically. This will crush the medial systems and the economy.

Hamburg Stops WiFi in Schools
2014/11/29 Ted	2 Comments
{Translated from German by translate.google.de}
from the 29th November 2014 the editors of Flensburg Tageblatt
At six schools in Hamburg the digital age should find their way. City and school board now back row: The wireless network WLAN was too dangerous for the health of students.
Learning with Tablet: It will not give in Hamburg so soon. Too big are the concerns about the health of students.

HAMBURG
The Authority announced by the school after the summer holidays measures to equip the students three Hamburg district schools and three high schools each with tablet and notebook, are for the time being on ice. Reason is that the wireless Internet access terminals to be enabled by the wireless network WLAN. Both potential health consequences are unclear, and legal frameworks.
“Six schools replace board, textbooks, notebooks and pencils Laptop and Tablet in class,” it said in May in a statement presented by Senator school Ties Rabe. During the two-year project should thus up to 1,300 students, which is about 30 percent of children and adolescents participate in these schools.
Now the school board backtracked. “We are currently investigating whether there are data protection or other legal problems,” admitted a spokesman Peter Albrecht.
High waves had the project mainly beaten because of the non-party MPs citizenship Walter Scheuerl with two kids trying to torpedo the project requests in the citizenry and various reports. So would transmit data over the wireless local radio networks by means of radiating and receiving extremely high microwave frequencies.
In fact, some doctors criticized recently, the introduction of tablets, smartphones, and wireless media as teaching in schools as “an uncritical acceptance of progress hype”. In an open letter complain about 20 doctors from “Doctors Working Group Digital Media in Stuttgart”, that the comments made in science and medicine concerns the use of digital media in schools were not being met.
“The correlation of the increase of overwork, headaches, ADHD and mental illness with the growing use of digital media is worrying,” said Ulmer psychiatrist and brain researcher Prof. Manfred Spitzer. According to the state of science whose harmfulness was clear that stress could also lead to impaired concentration, in addition to sperm damage to DNA strand breaks and thus cancer. The manufacturer, as well as the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, would already warning of a body-hugging use the equipment and require minimum distances, so the doctors. Neither school board nor health authority of the Hanseatic city could respond to such warnings.
Dirk Petersen, environmental expert at Consumer Hamburg , relativized: “There is in our view no reliable information, that it is harmful.” For the radiation was simply too small, so the expert. Ellen Kruse, a spokeswoman for the AG electrosmog the BUND Hamburg, however, criticized: “There are a lot of neutral studies showing that Wi-Fi is very harmful.” She called independent experts who educate in schools. Especially the combined use of up to 30 students comprehensive classes is questionable, so Kruse. The World Health Organization warn that mobile phone could possibly be carcinogenic. “We are the precautionary principle,” she said. However, the Bund was not hostile to progress and plead for a wired internet access in schools.
In its requests to the Senate it was Scheuerl also the subject of privacy statements and whether the legal guardian, adult students as well as teachers they would be and what would happen if they would not sign. The school board admitted now, just to check this straight. Scheuerl said: “The Authority had previously not carefully prepared.” However, the use of WLAN is from his point of view in order if they would agree. “The school used for the Internet research is important, but it is also about information literacy,” said Scheuerl. A general education he also called on the educational and learning psychological consequences, liability risks, technical issues, and copyright issues and risks.

Smart Meter Status in California – Good and Bad
2014/11/23 Ted	Leave a comment
The Smart Meter Fight in California is not going well but there are some very credible people continuing to push the issues and I believe they will make gains in the near future. I hope.
We, in BC Canada must pay attention to what is going on in California. They are fighting the same battles as we are and we may learn something from their wins and losses.
See comments by JEROMY JOHNSON on his web site http://www.emfanalysis.com
Also, see the actions of the president of the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission and a judge that have upheld the rights of the utility companies over the public.

An excellent article that all of you should read. It is only 15 pages with some interesting diagrams. As Jeromy stated, it seems that the commissioner and law judge are living in an alternate universe.
Example of content of this article. New info for me at least. Something to follow up on.

WEMO is a system that allows users to control home electronics from anywhere.
2014/11/11 Ted	Leave a comment
WEMO is a series of products from Belkin International, Inc. that allows users to control home electronics from anywhere. This appears to be a subset of home automation.
WEMO is just an example of the whole new world of devices, with IP addresses that can communicate on the internet and that includes the home WiFi.
Benefits?
To most people this sounds like a great advance with many benefits. Think of the time they could save by having control over home devices from your office, on the road, out of town.
Imagine turning the coffee maker in the kitchen on when you wake up and are still in bed. Wow. And turning the lights on the driveway off at 10 pm, automatically. Or giving you an SMS message at sunset with the current temperature? The geeks will really love this stuff.
See this site that proposes that you might use a motion detector to turn the fan or aircon on when the cat uses the cat toilet. No kidding. see this article from Australia
Down Side?
There is a growing segment of the population that believes that RFR (radio frequency radiation or microwave radiation) causes health problems. (RFR has not been proven to be Safe) Some of these people are quite sensitive to RFR and must avoid areas with RFR from WiFi routers, Cell towers, cell phones and wireless smart meters otherwise they have health problems.
So, this addition of more devices talking to each other and a controller using WiFi RFR will simply increase the level of impact on the health of all people in the area.
The WiFi RFR has a limited range of 50-100 feet which you can check out with your smart phone connection to WiFi. This means people living in a condominium or an apartment with neighbours on 2 or 3 or 4 sides and upstairs and downstairs, each with several WiMo gadgets will be exposed to lots of RFR.
If you believe that living in an environment with high RFR is not good for your health and should be regarded as toxic, THEN you must try to avoid these new WiFi gadgets like the WiMo. Also, you should read all there is about the health effects and what you must do because the health you save may be your own or that of your family or friends.
The companies that are developing these toxic items have spent a lot of money on the R and D and they expect to make lots of money from the people who buy into this wireless home automation world. So expect to see an increasing flood of these devices, lots of advertising and lots of claims that RFR poses no health impacts.

“Microwaves, Science and Lies” Documentary Reveals a Product Defense Strategy
2014/11/08 Ted	Leave a comment
Introduction to the Documentary Film
“When business leads research, can we still trust science?”
For the past ten years worldwide, questioning on the safety of mobile phone antennas has been increasing. Numerous scientific studies have revealed the adverse effects of electro- magnetic waves on health. Yet, most health agencies, industry representatives, and a portion the scientific community claim that current health standards adequately protect the public.

WiFi – A Thalidomide in the Making by Barrie Trower – September 2013 – http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/emf_117.pdf
Remember Thalidomide?
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#Birth_defects_crisis
Now the problem is WiFi and related radio frequency radiation
“Schoolgirls exposed to low-level microwave radiation (Wi-fi) are at risk of suffering stillbirth, foetal abnormalities or genetically damaged children, when they give birth.”
“Any genetic damage may pass to successive generations.”
Wi-Fi – A Thalidomide in the Making. Who Cares? by Barrie Trower Report – September 2013:
– http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/emf_117.pdf
OMG, If this is true then the next several generations are going to be damaged beyond repair.
Olle Johansson, in an video interview several months ago, said that our civilization has at most 2 generations to survive.
