6 Exercises for Women With High Cholesterol
By Beth W. Orenstein

How to Lower Your Numbers

If you're working to lower your cholesterol and be heart-healthy, be sure to make exercise part of the equation, along with diet and possibly medication. Physical activity is an incredibly important component of good heart health, says Amit Khera, MD, director of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's Preventive Cardiology Program.
The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise three to four times a week to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Resistance training two to three times a week should also be part of your cholesterol-lowering exercise routine, says Cori McCorkle, MS, a research specialist at Indiana University.
Why Exercise Helps Women’s Heart Health

Exercise burns triglycerides (fats) in the blood while improving glucose (blood sugar) intolerance, says McCorkle, an American College of Sports Medicine certified personal trainer. “Too much glucose in the blood can damage vessels,” she says. “Damaged vessels become a magnet for fatty deposits. The less fat and glucose in your bloodstream, the less likely plaque (cholesterol) is to build up in your arteries.” Exercise also improves the health of the lining of your arteries, “so they can be more protective,” Dr. Khera adds. Here are six heart-healthy exercises for women who have high cholesterol.
Walking

Brisk walking is a great exercise for heart health and lowering cholesterol. And anyone can do it anywhere, says McCorkle. This aerobic exercise revs up your heart and lungs, which helps you use oxygen more efficiently. When you use oxygen more efficiently, blood pumps through your body more easily and keeps your arteries clear of plaque. One study, published in the Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation in April 2016, found that obese women improved their cholesterol when they participated in a 24-week walking program.
Running

Running gets your heart rate up for an extended period of time, McCorkle says, and raising your heart rate challenges the muscle, which then signals the body to make improvements. “This results in improved endurance of the heart muscle," she explains. "It can pump more blood per beat and requires less beats per minute. So essentially, your heart becomes more efficient.” A study published in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology in May 2013 found that running and brisk walking resulted in similar reductions in cholesterol.
Swimming

Like walking and running, swimming is a great aerobic exercise that can help lower cholesterol. Another advantage: Swimming is easier on your joints than walking or running. Whatever aerobic exercise you choose, be sure it’s one you enjoy so you can sustain it, McCorkle says. And consider mixing it up: Swim laps and walk and run so you’re never bored, she suggests.
Yoga

Overweight and obese adults who participated in a yoga-based lifestyle intervention saw their total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein level drop significantly after just 10 days, according to a study published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in June 2016. Another study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology in February 2016 found that yoga reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including high cholesterol. You may see heart-health benefits from yoga right away, the AHA says, and the longer you practice yoga, the greater the benefits, including lower cholesterol.
Strength Training
Thinkstock
Strength training helps maintain and offset the effects of aging, like sarcopenia, or loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, McCorkle says. “It increases the muscles’ ability to perform work, so you can do more for longer periods of time,” she says. “Building muscles can also increase your lean body mass, which can result in loss of body fat. Having lower body fat can decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and improve cholesterol levels. Muscular fitness also aids in improved quality of life.” A combination of machines and free weights are ideal for strength training, according to the American Council on Exercise (ACE).
Stretching

Stretching exercises are important to help you stay flexible. Stretching won’t have a direct impact on lowering your bad cholesterol, but it will help your overall fitness, which is an important component of staying healthy and reducing your risks for heart disease, including high cholesterol, according to the National Center of Health, Physical Activity and Disability. According to the ACE, it’s best to do dynamic stretches before your workout and static stretches during your cool-down. Dynamic stretches involve movements; think arm swings, side bends, and leg swings. For static stretches, you stretch and hold the position.
Word of Warning: Start Slow

Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program, advises Khera. If you haven’t exercised much and start with an intense program, you put yourself at risk for injury, says Harmony Reynolds, MD, an associate professor of medicine in the cardiology division at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. “If you’re starting an exercise program for health benefits, it should be gradual,” she says. “If you get injured, you might not even be able to walk, and the goal is to be active for the long haul.”
