Cannabis & Addiction
Is cannabis addictive?
Cannabis is addictive, though not everyone who uses it will develop an addiction.
If you use cannabis regularly (daily or almost daily) and over a long time (several months or years), you may find that you want to use it all the time and become unable to stop on your own.
Stopping cannabis use after you’ve been using for a long time can bring on feelings of withdrawal.
When you are a teen or young adult and your brain is still developing, you are more likely to become addicted to cannabis.
Cannabis addiction can have negative effects on how you study, work and hang out with your friends.
If you are concerned about your cannabis use, talk to a trusted adult and learn ways that can help you avoid becoming addicted.
Know that there are ways to change this and people who can help you. Further information is available at Manitoba.ca/health/cannabis.
Withdrawal Symptoms
Physical withdrawal symptoms can include trouble sleeping, poor temper, loss of appetite, restlessness, anxiety, sweating, chills and mild nausea.
Most withdrawal symptoms end after two weeks, though bad temper and physical tension can last much longer.
Overdosing on cannabis is unlikely as long as it has not been mixed with other drugs or alcohol
