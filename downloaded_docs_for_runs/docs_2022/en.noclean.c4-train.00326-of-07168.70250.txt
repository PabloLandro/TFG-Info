New research finds that some fruits reduce diabetes risk, while other fruits have no impact on diabetes risk (and fruit juice increases diabetes risk).
FRUIT AND DIABETES RISK
Diabetes has become a significant public health problem in the United States, and around the world, in recent years as obesity rates have continued to climb. According to the American Diabetes Association, nearly 26 million Americans (8 percent of the population) have diabetes. Diabetes is a prolific cause of serious illnesses, including heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, and limb loss. Diabetes causes, or contributes to, more than 230,000 deaths in the United States each year.
We all know that fresh fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, and have consistently been linked with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (for more details on the links between diet and cancer, see my book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race). But new research suggests that not all forms of fruit are created equal when it comes to maintaining an optimal level of health, including the prevention of diabetes. This new research study appears in the current issue of the British Medical Journal.
The ongoing Nurses’ Health Study and the Nurses’ Health Study II are huge prospective public health studies that, together, involve more than 150,000 female nurse volunteers, while the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study includes more than 36,000 male physicians. The primary outcome evaluated by this particular public health study was the risk of diabetes associated with fruit intake.
During the long course of this enormous public health study, 12,198 study participants went on to develop diabetes. After adjusting for other known diabetes risk factors among these more than 185,000 research volunteers, the regular consumption of blueberries, grapes, raisins, apples, and pears was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing diabetes. On the other hand, the consumption of bananas, grapefruit, peaches, plums, apricots, oranges, strawberries, and cantaloupe did not reduce diabetes risk. At the same time, the consumption of fruit juices, which often contain significant added sugar, was associated with a small but significant increase in diabetes risk.
In summary, the findings of this important public health study indicate that the risk of diabetes appears to be reduced with the consumption of at least 3 servings per week of blueberries, grapes, raisins, apples, and/or pears, while the regular consumption of other common fruits had no apparent impact on diabetes risk. However, fruit juice consumption was associated with an increase in diabetes risk.
For a groundbreaking overview of cancer risks, and evidence-based strategies to reduce your risk of developing cancer, order your copy of my bestselling book, “A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race,” from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, Vroman’s Bookstore, and other fine bookstores!
Within one week of publication, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race was ranked #6 among all cancer-related books on the Amazon.com “Top 100 Bestseller’s List” for Kindle e-books. Within three months of publication, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race was the #1 book on the Amazon.com “Top 100 New Book Releases in Cancer” list.

According to recent Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for veterans who served on active duty between September 2001 and December 2011 is more than 12 percent. A new website, Veterans in Healthcare, seeks to connect veterans with potential employers. If you are a veteran who works in the healthcare field, or if you are an employer who is looking for physicians, advanced practice professionals, nurses, corpsmen/medics, or other healthcare professionals, then please take a look at Veterans in Healthcare. As a retired veteran of the U.S. Army, I would also like to personally urge you to hire a veteran whenever possible.

Welcome to Weekly Health Update
“A critical weekly review of important new research findings for health-conscious readers”
BLUBERRIES, OBESITY, DIABETES AND METABOLIC SYNDROME
Metabolic syndrome includes a constellation of health disorders that are associated with a high risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Specific disorders that are associated with metabolic syndrome include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood, obesity, and diabetes (or “pre-diabetes”). In the United States, where obesity has become an epidemic, public health experts estimate that as much as 25 percent of the population currently meets the criteria for metabolic syndrome.
Excessive calorie intake, a sedentary lifestyle, obesity in the abdominal and waist areas (central, or visceral, obesity), genetic factors, and other adverse health risks are known to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, both the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome are based upon exercise, a healthy low-fat and low-sugar/low-carb diet, and weight loss. A new prospective, randomized clinical research study suggests that consuming blueberries may also help to reduce some of the adverse health risks associated with metabolic syndrome.
In this study, which appears in the current issue of The Journal of Nutrition, 48 adults (44 females and 4 males) with metabolic syndrome were divided into two groups. One group, the “experimental group,” consumed 50 grams of freeze-dried blueberries per day (equivalent to 350 grams of fresh blueberries per day), in the form of a beverage, for a period of 8 weeks. The other group, the “control group,” consumed a “placebo” beverage that did not contain any blueberries (also for 8 weeks). Blood pressure checks and multiple blood tests were performed at both 4 weeks and 8 weeks into the study.
When comparing the two groups of patient volunteers, the patients in the “blueberry group” were found to have significantly greater decreases in their high blood pressure when compared to the control group. The level of oxidized LDL cholesterol in the blood, which is a form of the “bad” LDL cholesterol that can directly damage the lining of arteries throughout the body (atherosclerosis), was also significantly decreased in the “blueberry group” of patient volunteers. At the same time, there were no significant differences between the two groups of patient volunteers with respect to blood glucose (sugar) levels, triglyceride levels, or the levels of HDL (the “good” cholesterol) or LDL (the “bad” cholesterol) in the blood .
Therefore, while a brief period of a diet supplemented with blueberries did not reverse all of the abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome, the consumption of the equivalent of about 350 grams of blueberries each day did appear to significantly improve at least two of the adverse health factors associated with this syndrome (i.e., high blood pressure and blood levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol). Based upon the intriguing findings of this small and short-duration study, patients with one or more health factors associated with metabolic syndrome might consider adding some blueberries to their daily diet, in addition to the standard treatment for this life-threatening disorder!
For more information on blueberries, and other sources of dietary polyphenols, as part of a cancer prevention lifestyle, watch for the publication of my new landmark evidence-based book, “A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race,” in September of this year.
