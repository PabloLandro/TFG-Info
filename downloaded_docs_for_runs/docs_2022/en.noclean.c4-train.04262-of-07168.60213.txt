Vitamin IV and the Flu
January 2, 2017
Cold and Flu season is here. Many people get the flu vaccination which can certainly help prevent some strains of the flu. According to the CDC, the 2015-2016 flu vaccination was about 63% effective. Unfortunately, some people are not able to get a flu vaccination due to illness or allergies or maybe they just waited too long and supply has run out. Then, there are those who may come down with a strain of the flu that isn’t covered by the vaccination. And of course, there are still plenty of colds and viruses passing from person to person that threaten our health. If you have managed to fall ill this winter, or you are worried about getting sick (nobody has time for that!), then you should probably consider helping your immune system with a vitamin IV. Nothing helps fight off viruses and infections like adequate rest and nutrition and a vitamin IV may be exactly the extra weapon that your body needs to stay healthy this year!
So, you may be wondering – what is a Vitamin IV? A Vitamin IV is a “cocktail” of various vitamins and minerals that is administered by a medical professional intravenously. A session takes about 45 minutes and the “blend” is determined for each individual patient after an in-depth consultation. An IV typically includes a variety of B vitamins as well as vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, and zinc (among other minerals). There are actually eight B vitamins and they all play a very important role in keeping our bodies healthy. They are essential for energy and producing red blood cells. Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is especially important in boosting the immune system. Vitamin B6 is also an immune function booster. Vitamin C, of course, has been touted by many as a great way to prevent colds. According to the Mayo Clinic, Vitamin C can’t prevent colds, but it can shorten their duration and severity. The Mayo Clinic also found that if you are in an environment where you are frequently exposed to cold germs (childcare, schools, a doctor’s office), then Vitamin C can help your body fight off the virus.
Minerals like magnesium and zinc are also important in fighting off the flu and other illnesses. Many Americans’ don’t get enough magnesium and this can lead to fatigue. And being fatigued makes it much harder for your immune system to fight off all the germs in your environment. Zinc is another mineral that can assist your immunity in shortening the duration of a cold as it has been found to help prevent the rhinovirus (the virus that causes colds) from multiplying. According to the Mayo Clinic, Zinc can shorten a cold by a day.
So, while a Vitamin IV is not a replacement for a flu shot, it can certainly help in strengthening your immune system. Whether you are trying to avoid the flu or you may have already caught something and want to get back on your feet more quickly, a Vitamin IV could be just the prescription you need! Or, maybe you are just feeling run down from the holiday season and you’d like to boost your energy for the New Year so that you can hit the ground running. If so, consider a Vitamin IV. The knowledgeable medical professionals at DreamBody will work with you to determine exactly the right blend of vitamins and minerals for you and your needs.
