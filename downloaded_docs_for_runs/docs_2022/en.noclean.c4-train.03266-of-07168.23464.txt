Treating Skin Growths at The Dermatology Group in New Haven County
Skin growths include moles, warts, skin tags or other irregularities that can develop throughout life or be present since birth. The majority of skin growths are usually benign (non-cancerous) but some can become malignant (cancerous). It is important to address any skin growth especially if it changes in color, shape, diameter or in other ways as this could be a sign of a more serious issue. If your mole or growth suddenly looks different, seek help at The Dermatology Group – it may save your life. The Dermatology Group offers total body screening and can identify your skin growth. If it poses any dangers, or if you simply want it removed, treatment options will be discussed.
Frequently Asked Questions About Treatment Skin Growths in New Haven County:
What causes skin growths?
Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Skin tags are caused by the bunching of collagen and blood vessels. Viruses can also cause warts or other abnormalities.
Are skin growths contagious?
Warts can be contagious but most other skin growths are not.
Will my skin growth grow back?
Once your skin growth has been removed it most likely will not occur in the same place but depending on what caused it, another growth may appear elsewhere.
