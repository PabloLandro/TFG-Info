Vape pens are incredibly easy to use. Most vape pens use a single button control or simply drawing from the mouthpiece will begin the conduction process to form vapor from the atomizer. Single-button controlled vape pens utilize a five-click on-off feature to allow you to save battery and lock the device from others. You can also adjust the temperature or wattage with three clicks or other buttons on the device.

Vape pens are the ultimate vaporizing option for portability, discretion, and convenience. As the name suggests, pen-style vaporizers are similar in size and shape to a pen or marker. These personal vaporizers fit comfortably in your pocket so you can take them virtually anywhere with you for vapor at a moment’s notice. Depending on the model, vaporizer pens can be used with e-liquid, essential oils or dry herbs. Multi use vapor pens can be used with or more of these materials. Below you will find the best pen vapes currently available at EZVapes.
Wick – This is the material found in a coil that absorbs e-liquid and wax thus optimizing vaporization. For e-liquid, this material is usually silica or cotton and for wax, quartz and ceramic it is quite common.
SUB-OHM: Some devices might come with sub-ohm resistance coils. Extra safety precautions should be practiced when using a sub ohm device. Sub-ohm coils will only work on a device capable of firing sub ohm atomizers and coils. You must also ensure that your batteries can handle sub ohm atomizers and coils. Improper use can lead to damage or injury. MistHub is not responsible for any damage caused by the misuse and/or mishandling of sub-ohm devices. Check out our Tutorial Section where you can learn more about the different kinds of devices and tips on how to use them safely.

Some vape pens have temperature controls that can be adjusted with ease and others come with a preset temperature for vaping that cannot be adjusted. If you like a varying degree of temperatures, search for a vape pen with variable temperature control. Also, the lithium-ion battery can be charged via micro-USB on the vape pen, providing hours of use with a short charging duration.
Vaping involves inhaling water vapor through a personal vaporizer or electronic cigarette. E-cigarettes are generally seen to be a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes, which are known for their harmful carcinogenic chemicals.
Box Mods can use any of various regulating chips/boards that vary from providing simple safety protections to more sophisticated functions, such as variable wattage output and temperature control. The second type usually has a display screen that shows information about the settings and functions. Some box mods are designed and made with no chips at all, and occasionally even no soldered wiring, in which case they’re called “mechanical mods.”
The Vaporesso Revenger 220W TC is one of the first mods to utilize IML injection coating which fuses style with durability. The mod utilizes Vaporesso’s OMNI 2.0 chipset which allows full user customization of wattage and temperature curves to satisfy even the most technical vapers.

Battery Life: How much time will you spend vaping away from your home? If you will only be enjoying occasional short sessions, battery life may not be as important as it would be to someone vaping outside of their home more often than not.

In terms of vapor quality and flavor, the Herb-E holds its own, even when compared to much more expensive devices. The devices features a two-mode operation: the Yellow Mode and the Red Mode. In the Yellow Mode, users will get the good flavor but almost no visible vapor, which is great when it comes to stealth vaping. Those who want to go all out simply need to turn on the Red Mode (by clicking the fire button five times) and then they will get dense, flavorful vapor.
“I have the same conversation with every student we catch vaping,” said Scott Carpenter, the dean for discipline at Cumberland High School in Rhode Island. “I say, ‘If I handed you a cigarette would you smoke it?’ And 100 percent of them look at you like you’re absolutely crazy for even suggesting that they’d do that.”
The main downside comes from the fact that the tank is built into the vape, so you cannot experiment with other vape tanks. But in our opinion, this isn’t a dealbreaker and can XEO Void is still a fantastic vape pen! No leaks, easy to use, and super smooth vapor.
Vape pens come in all shapes, designs, and colors, from simple pens to extremely stylish ones like the Series 3X.

Although you play a large role in figuring out your ideal temperature, your type of dry herb and concentrate also matters. The chemicals inside these products vaporize at different temperatures and could possibly burn or ruin your product if your settings are too high. Burning your product completely negates the use of these non-combustible devices.
Most temp control vape mods currently require atomizers to be outfitted with coils using one of three specific wire types — nickel, titanium, or stainless steel. As the technology is improved and refined, other wire types such as kanthal, nichrome, or even tungsten, may be usable with TC some day.

While it is theoretically possible to water, or even alcohol, in a vape pen, it’s not recommended. Water quickly reaches its boiling point inside a powered up tank, and getting hit in the face by scalding hot droplets is incredibly dangerous. In addition to that, even the best vape pens can’t function properly when filled with water; their atomizers will quickly burn out, producing a sickening burnt taste, and will then need to be replaced.
