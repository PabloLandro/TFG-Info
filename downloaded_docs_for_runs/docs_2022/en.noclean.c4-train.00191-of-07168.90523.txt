5 Reasons Why Everyone Should Squat
Posted on: August 18th, 2015	by Kayla Clarke	No Comments
“But isn’t squatting bad for me knees?! Don’t they damage the joint?!”
… Nope.
Surprise! In fact … squatting is a fundamental exercise that no matter what age, gender, or even fitness level – EVERYBODY should be doing.
1. Squats do NOT do damage to the structures in your knees
When a squat is performed with proper technique * (see bottom of article), it does not “wear away” the cartilage or meniscus. In fact, performing squats helps to encourage natural movement, and has even been shown to INCREASE the integrity of the ligaments and joint lining. Think of it as keeping the tires on your bike oiled. You wouldn’t hop on a bike that has been locked away all winter and zoom right off
2. They help strengthen MULTIPLE muscles
Your glutes, quads, hamstrings, abdominals and low back muscles will thank you for doing squats. You want to get stronger? Do a squat. You want fantastic trunk control? Do a squat. You want awesome quads? Do a squat.
The beauty of this, is that a squat is an amazing bang-for-your-buck exercise that can be performed virtually EVERYwhere – from the gym using barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells; or at home with your body weight, bands, even bottles of water!
3. They actually DECREASE knee pain
Recent research shows that incorporating squats into a regular exercise regime helped to decrease chronic inflammation that occurs with osetoarthritic knees. Not only that, but the participants in the study reported less perceived pain, and were even able to walk faster
4. They enhance movement AND athletic performance
Multiple research studies have shown that when athletes of a wide range of sports incorporated squats into their training programs, they improved upon their sprint time, strength / weight lifted, and their vertical jump. This is mainly due to the nature of the exercise targeting multiple muscle groups, and the ability to constantly progress and vary the exercise
5. We were BORN to squat!
Every time you sit down on a chair, or the toilet, or bend down to get something off the floor – guess what you’re doing? A squat! There is a reason why our hips, knees, and ankles are all joints that have a large range of motion
Now … Go Squat!
*If you want to make sure you are using good technique, or if you DO have any knee pain or complications – make sure to get it checked out by a physiotherapist
