WiFi Health Risks?
Technorati tags: health, wifi, study, wifi study, wireless networks health risks, wifi health risks, wifi radiation
The opinions on whether WiFi poses a health risk or not are split. Some studies suggest that it’s potentially harmful while others conclude WiFi being complete harmless.
Now the U.K. government’s Health Protection Agency (HPA) is taking an in depth look at this issue by conducting a new study on wireless networks and impacts on our health.
It’s looking good already for the wireless culture:
In its statement outlining its intentions, Professor Pat Troop, chief executive of the agency, said there was “no scientific evidence to date” that wi-fi or wireless local networks could have an adverse effect on the health of the general population.
And not so long ago, the BBC reported no evidence whatsoever for any health damage related to WiFi use.
