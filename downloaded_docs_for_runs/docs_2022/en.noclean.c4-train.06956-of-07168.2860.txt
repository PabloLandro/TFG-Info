EVIDENCE | NEEDS MORE TESTING
EFFECTIVENESS | EFFECTIVE
SAFETY | SAFE
Recommendations
Use this treatment under extreme exercise:
It prevents 53% of the Common Cold cases for adults under extreme physical exercise periods. The treatment is also pretty safe.
Doctors Say That
The level of Vitamin C (and other anti-oxidants in the body) decreases during periods of physical stress (for example, during training of athletes and soldiers). Therefore, supplementation (to balance this decrease) makes sense.
Any excess of Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) is evacuated from our body through the urine. This makes vitamin C pretty safe even in high dosages.

Vitamin C
Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and L-ascorbic acid, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement. As a supplement it is used to treat and prevent scurvy. Evidence does not support use in the general population for the prevention of the common cold. It may be taken by mouth or by injection. It is generally well tolerated. Vitamin C was discovered in 1912, isolated in 1928, and first made in 1933. (source)
