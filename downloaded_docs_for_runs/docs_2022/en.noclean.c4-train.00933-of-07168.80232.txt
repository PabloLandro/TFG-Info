What causes diabetic eye disease?
0 September 18, 2016
Diabetic eye disease is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It’s caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.
What causes diabetic eye disease?
Chronically high blood sugar from diabetes is associated with damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina, leading to diabetic eye disease. The retina detects light and converts it to signals sent through the optic nerve to the brain. Diabetic eye disease can cause blood vessels in the retina to leak fluid or hemorrhage (bleed), distorting vision. In its most advanced stage, new abnormal blood vessels proliferate (increase in number) on the surface of the retina, which can lead to scarring and cell loss in the retina.
Diabetic Eye Disease Treatment:
Diabetic eye disease Treatment is to prevent it. Strict control of your blood sugar will significantly reduce the long-term risk of vision loss. Treatment usually won’t cure diabetic eye disease nor does it usually restore normal vision, but it may slow the progression of vision loss. Without treatment, diabetic eye disease progresses steadily from minimal to severe stages. The laser is a very bright, finely f

5 Foods for healthy eyes

You may have heard the story about how carrots became associated with super enhanced eyesight. Well that’s a myth. However, carrots actually do, in fact help maintain healthier eyes although it does not improve your vision acuity. Carrots are one of the richest sources of beta-carotene, which is a molecule that the body uses to make vitamin A. Vitamin A helps the eye convert light into a signal that can be transmitted to the brain, allowing people to see under conditions of low light. Moreover, lack of vitamin A to your body can actually cause damage to the cornea (the clear front of the eye).

Diabetic disease and your eyes

Untreated diabetes (Diabetic Eye disease) can lead to complete vision loss.
Dubai, United Arab Emirates- September 29, 2015 – Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use blood sugar for energy. It is characterized by high levels of blood sugar, which can cause changes in the blood vessels of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is necessary for good vision. “DIABETIC EYE DISEASE is the leading cause of new blindness cases among adults aged 20-74” states Prof. Dr. Ayman Shouman, Cataract and Vitreoretinal surgery consultant at Spanish Center Dubai, highlights the danger of Diabetes in harming your vision. In the early stages of diabetic eye disease, small blood vessels in the eye swell. As the disease progresses, some vessels that nourish the retina become blocked. Abnormal new blood vessels may begin to grow on the surface of the retina to replace the blocked vessels. The new vessels, however, have thin, fragile walls. If they leak blood, severe vision loss and even blindness can result. The only way that diabetic eye disease can be diagnosed is through a comprehensive eye exam. Diabetics are sometimes first diagnosed in an optometrist’s clinic when diabet
