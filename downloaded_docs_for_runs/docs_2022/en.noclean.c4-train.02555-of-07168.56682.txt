Drug Addiction
What is Morphine?
Morphine is an analgesic opiate drug. It’s given by prescription to treat severe pain. Unfortunately, it also has the potential to be highly addictive in some patients. While it is a fantastic option for treating chronic pain, this drug can also be used recreationally. When considering what is morphine, you may wonder if someone you care about is using this drug improperly. If this is the case, knowing how to get them help is vital.
Perhaps you want to know more because you suspect you may have a problem with morphine. Crest View Recovery Centers wants to help and our hand is extended to you. We’ve provided some information below to inform you about morphine and signs of its use.
What Is Morphine Exactly?
Morphine is a drug that comes from the poppy plant. It’s only available by prescription, and its main use is in pain management. Post-surgical use is common, as is prescription for traumatic injury. People living with Cancer are often given morphine as a means of managing their pain associated with the disease.
Morphine is a narcotic that’s classified as a Schedule I drug in the United States. Morphine is usually given by injection, but it can also come in an extended-release tablet or in syrup form. It provides an immediate rush of euphoria, which usually fades into a drowsy feeling.
Signs of Morphine Use
Tolerance builds quickly in those who take morphine, meaning it soon takes more of the medicine to achieve the initial effects. Taking higher and more frequent doses can be signs of developing tolerance. When considering what is morphine, it’s important to understand the role of tolerance on the development of dependence. Tolerance breeds dependence which in turn festers into addiction.
There are also some signs to look for that can let you know if someone is taking morphine or going through morphine withdrawal. Look for slow breathing, extreme drowsiness or dizziness. There may also be vomiting, dilated pupils, itching, slurred speech or shallow breathing.
For example, symptoms of morphine withdrawal include:
Chills
Sweating
Runny nose, watery eyes
Muscle aches
Sleep issues
Irritability and anxiety
It is important to watch for these signs, as morphine is so highly addictive. If you notice these signs in yourself or your loved ones then it’s time to get professional help. CVRC can offer addiction treatment that makes a true difference in your health.
