Addiction Treatment
Call Our Hotline Today
With approximately 52 million people in the U.S. having used prescription drugs nonmedically in their lifetime, widespread addiction to drugs like morphine is increasingly becoming a problem. When someone begins to engage in abuse morphine, it's critical to get that person help as soon as possible. A prescription drug addiction can be just as dangerous as an addiction to street drugs and can control the life of the user. The right treatment, however, can help you or your loved one break free from addiction and find health and happiness.
Morphine Help question 1
Help for Addicts
If you, a friend, or family member is addicted to morphine, seek treatment right away. Prescription opioid abuse has its own inherent dangers and, alarmingly, can often progresses to heroin use. The Centers for Disease Control Director, Tom Friedan, M.D., M.P.H. indicated in a 2015 press release that most current heroin users in the U.S. progressed to the drug from prescription opioid use.
Help for opiate addiction typically comes in the form of one of two types of treatment:
Inpatient rehab centers.
Outpatient treatment centers.
It's important to consider that withdrawal from morphine and other opiates can be intense and impose stress on both the body and the psyche, so detoxing in a safe clinical environment, such as a residential treatment facility, can be extremely beneficial to the user.

Who Answers?
Thinking About Getting Rehab?
Is Morphine Addictive?
Yes, morphine can be very addictive. The risk of addiction is extremely high when it is not taken as prescribed or abused on a recreational basis.
The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) lists the drug as a Schedule II narcotic, indicating it has a "high potential for abuse" that can result in severe dependency or tolerance to the drug.
Many people believe that if they are prescribed a drug for medical use, they can't get addicted to it. This is not the case at all. Prescription drugs can be abused like any other drug. Users can quickly develop a tolerance to the point where they require ever-increasing amounts to achieve the same results or sensations they got in the beginning. This is how prescription use can quickly take a turn into dangerous or detrimental abuse.
Opiates like morphine lend themselves to compulsive use or abuse because of the feelings they can provide, which include:
Decreased pain.
Euphoric feelings.
Sense of intense relaxation.
Morphine Help question 3
What are the Signs of Addiction?
Abusers of morphine experience a common set of symptoms, both mental and physical. When seen repeatedly, these could signal that the user is already in the grips of an addiction to morphine.
Side effects that may indicate a problem include:
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Gastrointestinal distress
Lethargy / sleepiness
Alternating short periods of loss of consciousness / sudden alertness. .
Confusion.
"Pinprick" or tiny pupils.
Rapidly changing moods.
Sweating.
Incessant scratching of skin.
Cyanosis, or bluish tint to the skin.
Difficulty breathing.
Due to the serious nature of some of these symptoms, it is critical to seek medical attention as soon as possible when one feels they are addicted to morphine. Do not hesitate to get the help needed if the addiction becomes a problem.
Another serious sign of addiction is the onset of withdrawal symptoms when the drug is not used for a certain period of time. Withdrawal symptoms can include any or all of the following:
Diarrhea.
Runny nose.
Nausea.
Sweating.
Increased anxiety.
Insomnia.
Stomach cramps.
Pupil dilation.
Restless legs / muscle twitches.
If you think that you, a friend, or family member might be addicted to morphine, now is the time to seek help that can get you started down the road to recovery and normal living.
Morphine Help question 4
Am I Addicted to Morphine?
Addiction can rapidly change your life and habits. If you find that you're experience some or all of the following changes in your personal life, you might have a problem with morphine use:
You put morphine use above your other priorities, including friends and family.
You are having financial problems from spending money on obtaining the drug.
You have multiple doctors to get prescriptions for it on a regular basis.
You steal from friends or family to support your habit.
You've lost interest in your hobbies, school, or work.
You are compelled to continue using, even after numerous negative health and social effects.
Morphine Help question 5
Addiction Treatment
Due to the serious symptoms that come with morphine addiction and withdrawal, and the fact that opiate addiction is very hard for many people to overcome on their own, some form of treatment--either inpatient or outpatient care--is often needed to become clean. It tends to be easier and more comfortable for users to overcome the difficult withdrawal symptoms and to get off morphine for good with the help of medical professionals in a formal treatment setting.
Inpatient rehab facilities, in particular, take the user away from his environment so that he can:
Avoid the temptation to use by being in a drug-free environment.
Avoid trigger situations that may be associated with previous drug use.
Focus solely on getting sober through counseling and learning coping skills to live a drug-free life.
Treatment of any type can be helpful for most, but finding the right program or treatment provider can do a lot to bolster the recovery process. It's important to find a treatment plan that works for the individual needs of the addict.
