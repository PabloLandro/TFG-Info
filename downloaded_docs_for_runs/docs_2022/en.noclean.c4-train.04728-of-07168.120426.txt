As we approach summer and the sun is nearly right overhead here in Jupiter we really do all need to wear sunglasses whenever we are outside.Sunglasses are, undoubtedly, a great fashion accessory. However, when it comes to eye health, sunglasses play a very important role. For starters, sunglasses are created with the intention of protecting your eyes from UV rays. UV radiation has been linked with the development of various eye problems such as age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. Wearing sunglasses regularly can also prevent the likelihood of developing wrinkles around the eyes and premature aging. Investing in a pair of good quality sunglasses can help shield your eyes from 100% of harmful UV rays from the sun.
Glare is a common cause of distraction and eye problems when exposed to over a long period of time. Sunglasses are essential when performing outdoor activities such as skiing, driving, biking and boating where you are most likely to come across glare. Sunglasses with mirror coatings or polarized filters can reduce glare and ensure comfort. Aside from light, sunglasses can also protect your eyes from debris, dust and wind that may cause injuries and irritation to the eyes.
In situations where there is too much light, a person may squint to reduce the amount of light entering the eyes. This can result in muscle fatigue and constant pupil constriction that can eventually lead to eye strain and even headaches. Wearing sunglasses can help by eliminating the need to constrict your pupils too much and squinting. If you are going to be exposed to bright lights on a regular basis, be sure to choose good sunglasses to enhance the level of protection.
Sunglasses should always be worn when you are outdoors. They are especially important if you are performing activities at a beach or near water. Sunglasses are a must during the summer when the UV radiation from the sun is at its strongest. If you have taken any drugs that induce photo sensitivity or have had eye surgery, you may need to wear sunglasses (even indoors in some cases) until your doctor says it is safe.
