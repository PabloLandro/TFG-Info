In alternative medicine, urine therapy or urotherapy, (also urinotherapy, Orin Therapy, Shivambu, uropathy, or auto-urine therapy) is the application of human urine for medicinal or cosmetic purposes, including drinking of one's own urine and massaging one's skin, or gums, with one's own urine. There is no scientific evidence to support its use.

History
Though urine has been believed useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several traditional systems,[1][a] and mentioned in some medical texts,[b] auto-urine therapy as a system of alternative medicine was popularized by British naturopath John W. Armstrong in the early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family's practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical reading of the Biblical Proverb 5:15 "Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well", and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast "on nothing but urine and tap water". Starting in 1918, Armstrong prescribed urine-therapy regimens that he devised to many thousands of patients, and in 1944 he published The Water of Life: A treatise on urine therapy, which became a founding document of the field.[6][8]
Armstrong's book sold widely, and in India inspired the writing of Manav mootra (Gujarati: Urine therapy; 1959) by Gandhian social reformer Raojibhai Manibhai Patel, and many later works. These works often reference Shivambu Kalpa, a treatise on the pharmaceutical value of urine, as a source of the practice in the East.[c] They also cite passing references to properties and uses of urine in Yogic-texts such as Vayavaharasutra by Bhadrabahu and Hatha Yoga Pradapika by Svatmarama; and Ayurvedic texts such as Sushruta Samhita, Bhava Prakasha and Harit. However, according to medical anthropologist Joseph Atler, the practices of sivambu (drinking one's own urine) and amaroli recommended by modern Indian practitioners of urine therapy are closer to the ones propounded by Armstrong than traditional ayurveda or yoga, or even the practices described in Shivambu Kalpa.[6]
Urine-therapy has also been combined with other forms of alternative medicine. For example, in her book Your Own Perfect Medicine: The Incredible Proven Natural Miracle Cure that Medical Science Has Never Revealed!, Martha M. Christy describes homeopathic preparations of urine and their uses, and says that they are "extremely potent".[4]
Modern claims and findings
An exhaustive description of the composition of human urine was prepared for NASA in 1971. Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water. The remaining constituents are, in order of decreasing concentration: urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds.[9][10]
It has been claimed that Thai people have been practicing urophagia for a long time,[11] although the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine say there is no record of the practice.[11]
There is no scientific evidence of a therapeutic use for untreated urine.[4][12][13][14][15]
Urinating on jellyfish, wasp, bee stings, sunburn, cuts and blood vessel bursts is a common “folk remedy”,[16] however Scientific American reports that it may be counterproductive, as it can activate nematocysts remaining at the site of the sting, making the pain worse.[17]
Urine and urea have been claimed by some practitioners to have an anti-cancer effect, and urotherapy has been offered along with other forms of alternative therapy in some cancer clinics in Mexico.[18] According to the American Cancer Society, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that urine or urea given in any form is helpful for cancer patients".[18]
Zhang et al report that urine may be a useful source of stem cells.[19]

Morarji Desai, Fourth prime minister of India, and an advocate of urine therapy
In 1978, the Prime Minister of India, Morarji Desai, a longtime practitioner of urine therapy, spoke to Dan Rather on 60 Minutes about urine therapy. Desai stated that urine therapy was the perfect medical solution for the millions of Indians who cannot afford medical treatment.[20]
Cameroon's Health Minister Urbain Olanguena Awono warned people against drinking their own urine, believed in some circles to be a tonic and cure for a number of ailments. "Given the risks of toxicity associated with ingesting urine", he wrote, "the health ministry advises against the consumption of urine and invites those who promote the practice to cease doing so or risk prosecution."[21]
British actress Sarah Miles drank her own urine for over thirty years, in claiming the belief that it immunizes against allergies, amongst other health benefits.[22]
Former Major League Baseball player Moisés Alou urinates on his hands to alleviate calluses, which he claims allows him to bat without using batting gloves.[23]
Madonna explained to talk show host David Letterman that she urinates on her own feet in the shower, perhaps to help cure her athlete's foot problem.[24]

^ Urine was recommended for whitening teeth in ancient Rome.[2] Islamic legist Abu Yusuf allowed for use of camel urine for medicinal purposes.[3] It has also been used in some traditional remedies in Mexico[4] and in Nigeria.[5]

^ Shivambu Kalpa (Śivambu: Sanskrit for "Water of Shiva") is said to be a section of the larger work Ḍamara Tantra, which is described by practitioners of urine therapy as "belong to the Puranic age". According to Joseph Atler the 107-shloka Kalpa is not well attested or in wide circulation, and is most easily accessible through modern Indian books on urine therapy, where it is often attached as an appendix.
