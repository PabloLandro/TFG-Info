The Health Benefits of Sunglasses
Sunglasses have a slew of benefits for a wearer besides helping you see in sunny weather. In addition to wearing them for fashion and to help with your poker bluffing, sunglasses have a tremendous amount of health benefits you may or may not be aware of.
Did you know that around 10% of all skin cancers are found on the eyelid? By wearing a pair of shades outdoors can help keep those eyelids safe and sound!
Cataracts are another, extremely common eye problem that affects many people around the world. Cataracts are caused by UV exposure from the sun. Sunglasses that protect against UV exposure can help prevent cataracts and potentially even blindness.
Photokeratitis, also known as sunburn of the eye can be extremely painful and have a lot of side effects including blurred visions, light sensitivity as well as other eye issues. By wearing a pair of shades is like wearing suntan lotion. It will prevent your eyes from getting burnt!
