Did McCain’s brain tumor have a link to cell phones?
Posted on August 28, 2018 | Leave a comment
This came in from my network. We are sorry about the passing of McCain but he died from the same tumor Kennedy had so pay attention…. you don’t want to be next!
Condolences Senator McCain’s Family-Cell Phones Can Cause Glioblastoma Brain Tumors-Time To Warn & Prevent. Our Deepest Condolences To Senator McCain’s Family. Recent Study From England Shows More Than A Doubling of Glioblastomas In The Areas Of The Brain That Receive The Most Cell Phone Radiation. The Italian Supreme Court Has Already Ruled That Cell Phone Radiation Can Cause Brain Tumors. In the US, Brain Tumors are the #1 Cancer for Children 15-19yrs.
The World Leading Researcher In Brain Cancer and Cell Phone Radiation Professor and Oncologist Lennart Hardell MD PhD Can Prove that Cell Phone Radiation Can Cause Brain Tumors and He Insists People Must Be Warned and Protected (LennartHardell). Lennart Hardell MD PHD and Leading Cancer Epidemiologist Anthony Miller MD, FRCP, FRCP(C), FFPH Along with 207 Medical Doctors and Scientists Expert in Wireless Radiation Health Effects Insist We Reduce Our Overall Exposure to Wireless RF Radiation by Stopping The Roll Out of 5G Wireless Technology Which Will Very Significantly Increase Our Exposure By Forcing A Cell Tower Transmitter Every 2-10 homes (www.5Gappeal.eu).
Unfortunately, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of brain tumors in the 3 areas of the brain which receive the most cell phone radiation: Temporal Lobe, Cerebellum, and Frontal Lobe. Most people do not know that Senator McCain was reported to have 2 cell towers on his property adding to his exposure from his cell phone. The recent $25 million US NTP Study showed an increase in brain tumors and DNA Damage from whole body cell phone radiation exposure non-thermally below current FCC safety guidelines.
Long time advisor to World Health Organization, Anthony Miller MD, FRCP, FRCP(C), FFPH, explains “Cell phone radiation can clearly cause brain tumors. With the epidemiological studies of humans and the recent findings of the US National Toxicology Program study and Ramazzini Institute Study, we have enough evidence to classify wireless Radiofrequency radiation as a Class 1 Human Carcinogen like cigarette smoke and Asbestos. Therefore, we really need to warn our citizens and reduce overall exposure, especially for children who absorb twice the amount of cell phone radiation. I am joined by my colleagues in demanding a moratorium on the roll out of new 5G wireless technology which will very significantly increase everyone’s exposure to this radiation until adequate safety testing is done and exposure safety standards are established.”

How does fiber help prevent cancer?
Posted on November 17, 2017 | 2 comments
Fiber is the super sponge in the body. When the liver processes carcinogenic toxins out of the blood they end up in the gut. In order to completely eliminate them from the body, something in the gut must absorb them. Enter: fiber!
If you eat sugar, white rice and starchy carbs you will not be able to facilitate this absorption. No sponges will be available to bind up the toxins which will then be reabsorbed. This means they will end up in circulation all over again doubling your carcinogenic exposure. Increased fiber can intercede and help remove them properly.
Fruit is a great fiber food with raspberries and pears being at the top of the list. Or you can add whole wheat pasta, barley, bran flakes and oats to your diet. Split peas, lentils and black beans are chock full of fiber as are artichokes and broccoli. Almonds are a high fiber nut and Two tablespoons of flaxseed provide about six grams of fiber and opposed to 1/4 cup of black beans to get the same amount. Women should try to eat at least 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day, while men should aim for 30 to 38 grams a day.
To facilitate a better working liver to help process those carcinogens out, you can take a potent curcumin supplement and also use milk thistle which also helps suppress the growth of blood vessels that feed cancer tumors.

What Turns Cancer Cells On?
Posted on February 3, 2017 | Leave a comment
According to the American Cancer Society 18% of cancers are caused by infection, 23% caused by obesity, 41% environmental and only 5% because of genetics. So if our lifestyles can create the environment inside our bodies to make a happy home for cancer what can we do about it?
We have delved into this a little more on our video blog ” Click Here ” but we’ll give you a few tips here. You must detox your body, especially the colon. Certain herbs can help clean you out such as psyllium, buckthorne, slippery elm, humid acid and casgara. You can also do an olive oil lemon juice cleanse and you can search the Internet to find one of these treatment that works for you. You also must make sure you have a good supply of friendly bacteria in the colon and if you eat poorly or have had chemotherapy, many of those will have been destroyed. You need to repopulate them through a good probiotic supply that contains an assortment of the friendly critters. Our suggestion to check out is: PlusBiotic which can be found by clicking here and then click learn more and select from the product drop down menu to read about it.
Keeping the lymph clean also is a must as it is the main filter for abnormal cells. Herbs that are found in the Essiac tincture available at health food stores are a good way to do this. There are more tips for urinary cleanse and parasite cleanse on the video so check it out. www.AntiAgingLadyNews.com

Tips for cancer prevention
Posted on January 27, 2017 | Leave a comment
We are doing a video blog series on www.AntiAgingLadyNews.com about cancer prevention. This is an excerpt from the first session. There is no charge… Please visit our video blog site to access the information.
Everyone has cancer floating in their body. It’s the function of our toxic world and our lifestyles. Our body has cool cells called T-cells that take out cells that don’t look normal to them. Unfortunately sometimes they get confused by the cloaking put on by the cancer cell and don’t do their job. Cancer has main stem cells and daughter cells. If our immune system is strong we can handle the normal amount of cancer cells, but if we don’t do the right things our immune system will go on vacation and cancer will have a field day reproducing. Chemo kills the daughter cancer cells but the cancer stem cell sits there fat and healthy impervious to the drug. So – if you want to prevent the proliferation of your resident cancer cells and prevent tumors so and don’t want to get to the stage where you have to resort to chemo, you can try adding polyphenols to your diet. This interacts with the genes and works on the cancer stem cells weakening them so your immune system can find them and the T-cells can zap them. – more about what polyphenols are on our video blog.
The polyphenols are concentrated in nutritional liquid formula (Daily Metrix) that a friend introduced me to, because I don’t have to take a bazillion vitamin pills anymore… just this one ounce a day liquid gives me everything I need… enzymes, minerals, polyphenols, essential fatty acids, protein, bioflavonoids, joint helpers, heart helpers, fruit, veggies – and its non GMO! check it out: www.longlifenews.com

Vitamin D Increases Cancer Survival Length
Posted on April 15, 2015 | Leave a comment
A new study reported a the 2015 American Society of Cancer Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium shows that metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had high levels of vitamin D in their bloodstream prior to chemo survived longer on an average than those who did not. On the average the groups with the highest levels of vitamin D survived 33% longer and also were associated with longer time to disease progression. Previous studies already showed that vitamin D may play a role in cancer inhibition.

Which kind of soy is good for you?
Posted on March 13, 2014 | Leave a comment
Soybeans were originally grown as a cover crop to be turned into the soil as fertilizer. Somewhere along the line someone got the idea to make it into feed for animals and than somewhere further down the line someone decided it was good for people. But soybeans have an enzyme inhibitor that prevents them from being digested properly. Babies fed soy formula cry because of the gas it creates in their tummies. This soy, because it is unable to be broken down in the body, can affect the hormone regulation and many physicians warn that it can contribute to breast cancer. The soy protein isolates in foods such as tofu, soymilk and edamame have potentially anti-nutritive value due to their high phyate and oxalic acid levels.
But, there is a good side of soy too. When the soybean is fermented or sprouted this enzyme inhibitor disappears and thus the soy can be digested allowing nutritive bioavailability without the possible ill effects of the uncultured soybean. It displays characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM) rather than an estrogen (Pike et al. 1999). What this means is that the beneficial isoflavone precursors (know to be used in cancer treatment) can be converted to their active forms, genestein and diadzein. However, genistein, with few exceptions, is not a major isoflavone of most soy foods and products consumed in Western countries, unless these have undergone fermentation, as in traditional foods such as tempeh, natto, and to some extent miso (Coward et al. 1993).
Soybeans are rich in nitrogen, polysaccharides, selenium, zinc, vitamin Bs, D2, E and K1, but this are less available unless the bean is sprouted or fermented. In addition to the nutritive value, fermented soy is a great source of protein that is lactose-free and vegan. With bodybuilders, dieters and health conscious individuals looking for a good meal replacement, a fermented soy product with added curcumin as an anti-inflammatory should be considered. Not only will you be getting a nutritious meal substitute, but you will be ingesting the disease fighting benefits of the isoflavones. So next time you go looking for a soy product make sure it is fermented or sprouted.
PS. Ck out this product on Amazon…. we find it to meet our criteria. http://amzn.to/1gtx5cN

Cancer free without chemo
Posted on April 5, 2013 | Leave a comment
One of our authors developed breast cancer a year ago and while in her 80s decided not to go traditional. She took an estrogen blocker drug and fermented soy with curcumin plus other supplements, gave up sugar, wine and ate organic. She got a clean bill of health after a year. Watch her story… and check out the product at the end…

8 ways sugar is killing you.
Posted on March 29, 2013 | 1 comment
Dr. Nancy Appleton, author of Suicide by Sugar, actually lists 146 reasons why sugar is ruining your health. We’ll look at eight for now.
(1) Sugar is a cancer cell’s favorite food. Even without having cancer, we all have a few cancer cells floating around.
When an acidic internal environment discourages normal cellular glucose metabolism with oxygen, those oxygen starved cells begin thriving by fermenting glucose and demanding more that our culture readily provides. Why encourage them?
(2) Candida yeast cells also exist in small amounts with everyone. When they overwhelm our friendly probiotic bacteria, we have Candida yeast overgrowth, which enables this fungus to infiltrate the body with all sorts of health problems.
Diets for discouraging and helping eliminate Candida promote complete abstinence from all forms of sugar until the overgrowth recedes. High sugar intake encourages Candida, which many say is cancer’s favorite habitat.
(3) Processed sugar and fructose are stripped of all mineral content and wind up leeching minerals from our bodies, including our teeth. They also inhibit mineral absorption, including magnesium. Magnesium is a commonly deficient and vitally important for over 300 metabolic processes.
(4) GMO corn is used to manufacture High Fructose Corn Syrup, and this process creates a mercury byproduct. GMO beets are used more now for creating sucrose (table sugar). Pure unprocessed sugar cane does contain nutrients, while processing involves nasty chemicals that can come along.
(5) Sugar is addictive. It stimulates central nervous system neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, giving you a pleasant buzz to crave more and promote overeating dead processed foods.
(6) Sugar creates glucose spikes that force the pancreas to produce insulin more often and beyond it’s normal capacity. This wears the pancreas down, limiting insulin production that leads to diabetes. Type II diabetes is insulin resistance, which is preceded by metabolic syndrome at least partly attributable to high sugar intake.
(7) A depleted pancreas can’t provide sufficient proteolytic enzymes to bust open cancer cell walls and render them defenseless from the immune system’s killer cells.
(8) Many nutritional experts attribute the rise of obesity and cardiac problems to higher refined carbohydrate and sugar consumption. And the condensed fructose in HFCS is absorbed first by the liver, which cannot metabolize it all and has to store accumulated fructose as fat creating fatty liver.

The healthy kind of soy. Fermented (good) vs. unfermented (bad)!
Posted on June 19, 2012 | Leave a comment
Reprinted from the blog: Jivahealthnews.wordpress.com
Soy contains 42 percent protein, more than any other plant.36 It’s high in fiber. It’s a natural source of good-for-you omega-3 fatty acids. It’s a powerhouse of protective antioxidants and phyto-nutrients (beneficial compounds found in plants). It provides a wealth of vitamins, including vitamins A (as beta-17 carotene), B1, B2, B12, C, D, E, and K – and several essential minerals, such as selenium and zinc.
Cultured (fermented) Soy vs. Uncultured Soy In order to reap the nutritional benefits of soy, it must be cultured. Culturing simply means adding beneficial microbial cultures to a food and letting them transform it into something more nutritious and digestible. Yogurt, sour cream, kefir, and pickles are all examples of cultured foods.
The Importance of Culturing If you take a trip to China, Japan, Indonesia, or Singapore, you’ll find that the traditional Asian diet does not include large quantities of super-processed, genetically modified soy products like we have in Western countries today (such as isolated soy protein, a common ingredient found in nutrition bars). It incorporates small amounts of natural, cultured whole soy foods, such as natto (cultured soybeans), miso (a condiment made from cultured soybean paste), shoyu (soy sauce or tamari), and tempeh (a compact cultured soybean cake).
Bad Soy & Anti-Nutrients Soy wasn’t even considered edible until fermentation techniques were developed during the Chou Dynasty. What the producers of modern, uncultured soy foods won’t tell you is that in addition to all the nutrients it contains, soy also contains anti-nutrients. These anti-nutrients prevent your body from absorbing essential minerals and trace elements. Unfortunately, cooking will not destroy these anti-nutrients. Only the culturing process will. Another benefit of culturing is that it makes it easier for your body to digest and absorb the goodness of soy. When you culture a food, you’re basically using beneficial microbial cultures to pre-digest it. Those cultures transform large, hard-to-digest molecules into small, easy-to-digest ones. Not only that, culturing soy also reduces its allergic qualities. (Soy is one of the most common food allergens.)
According to two newly published research papers, tests in samples of human blood showed that when soy is cultured, its potential to produce an allergic reaction is reduced by as much as 99 percent. The most important benefit of culturing, though, is that the process is thought to convert certain phyto-nutrients, called genistein and daidzein, into their active forms, genistein and daidzein. Both genistein and daidzein are powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents that have been shown in voluminous laboratory studies to work in multiple ways to support optimal health.

How cancer works.
Posted on December 9, 2011 | 1 comment
How cancer works
Most people think cancer is evil. Basically it’s a dysfunctional cell that has been misguided into not dying. The T cells in our body control these cancer cells. T cells convert nitrogen into nitric acid, which dissolves cancer cells, but normal cells don’t get affected because they are protected by SOD superoxide dismutase. SOD is produced in the body from electrolyte minerals, primarily manganese and selenium.
Cancer cells seek out nitrogen in our body’s protein, trying to starve the T cells. The nitrogen comes from protein stored in the muscle tissue and cancer eats away at this muscle to get at the nitrogen to deprive the T cells of food. Cancer cells get food from an in-growth of blood capillaries and grow a tough protein coating that is 13 times thicker than a regular cell. Cancer cells talk to healthy cells and send this erroneous DNA message (not to die) throughout our body. This is why even though we remove the cancerous body part, cancer recurs somewhere else years later. The message has been sent and festers in these healthy cells until they too become cancerous. We need to remove cancer’s ability to send these messages in order to control it.
We think of cancer as cells with attention deficit disorder. They are not bad. Just strayed off the path. If we think of cancer in this way we can see that we can affect its pathway through thought, diet and supplements. Fearing cancer and hating it sends a negative vibration throughout the body, which does not help the healing process. We must think of the cancer cells as kids with a problem. You don’t hit the kid with bigger and bigger weapons to make them shape up. You try to change their behavior.
In numerous studies over the last decade it has shown that if we foil cancer’s ability to sustain its irrational behavior, the cancer will become weakened enough for our T-cells to get the upper hand. Fermented soy foils the cancers plan and supports the protein in the muscle to reduce the protein wasting effect of chemotherapy. The fermented soy ingested must be reduced to a small cellular amino acid state so it can break through the protein barrier of the cancer cell. Once the cancer cell eats this, the beneficial soy isoflavones, protease inhibitors, and phytosterols undo the cancer reprogramming it to die again, and imparting that DNA into daughter cells. The soy isoflavones Genistein and Diadzein cause the cancer cell to differentiate and change back to normal cells. It also inhibits the cancer cells ability to get food from the blood thus starving and weakening existing cancer cells. Single soybean extractions like soy isoflavonoids alone cannot do this as they are too large to get absorbed.
We have also discovered that cancer loves an inflammatory condition in the body. This is where it thrives. Chronic inflammation may not be visible but if you have ever taken antibiotics, vaccinations, fought infections or been under stress then you may have a chronic inflammatory condition. It is imperative that you not only treat the cancer but remove its happy home.
The protocol we use includes a femented soy drink, and curcumin anti-inflammatory supplement, an essential fatty acid supplement (parent omega 6 4:1 to omega 3). Liquid 12-trace mineral electrolytes, digestive enzyme supplements with every meal, water that is 7.4 pH or higher and filtered (not distilled), a mostly vegetarian diet with no sugar or high-glycemic carbs. We have seen positive results in most cases. One client was facing a breast removal and with our protocol, a macrobiotic diet and chemotherapy she not only totally rid herself of the cancer in six months, but her hair grew back (she shaved her head) half way through the chemo treatment to the amazement of the oncologist. We also use this treatment to eliminate melanoma in two weeks and reduce tongue cancer two stages prior to surgery.
But, don’t just depend on putting things into your mouth and expecting these miracles. You must also change your attitude about cancer, reduce the fear as much as possible and use visualization, meditation and positive thinking to keep your vibrations harmonious with the healing process.
