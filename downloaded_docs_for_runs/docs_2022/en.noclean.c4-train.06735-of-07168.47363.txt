While it is theoretically possible to water, or even alcohol, in a vape pen, it’s not recommended. Water quickly reaches its boiling point inside a powered up tank, and getting hit in the face by scalding hot droplets is incredibly dangerous. In addition to that, even the best vape pens can’t function properly when filled with water; their atomizers will quickly burn out, producing a sickening burnt taste, and will then need to be replaced.
First, decide what type of product you will be using and fill it inside the atomizer. Regardless whether it is e-liquid or concentrates, they can be filled easily in the atomizer. Some atomizers can be filled from the top and others can be filled from unscrewing the atomizer and inserting your choice product from the bottom. Each type of liquid uses a specific type of cartridge and wicking element that comes with the vape pen. Find out what works best for your needs!
Dry herb vape pens are for conducting the herb of your choice and providing a pure flavor as opposed to traditional combustion procedures.

Many of these dry herb vape pens are small and compact, allowing for discreet vaping anywhere and providing a stealthy session while the user is on-the-go.
