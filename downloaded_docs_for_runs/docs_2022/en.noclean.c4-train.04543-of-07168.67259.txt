To understand why this salt type has gained a lot of popularity all around the world and why it is said to be the world’s purest salt, we have to look into its history, the health benefits that it offers, and its uses as well.
About 250 million years ago, there was a primal sea that dried up under the energy of the sun. This salt is absolutely the same in composition to that ancient primal sea. But due to the movement of the earth plates, the gigantic, beautiful, and one of the highest mountains of the world (Himalayan Mountains) covered that primal ocean. Researchers believe that under the immense pressure and the heat of the sun, the water of the primal ocean evaporated and as a result, the Himalayan crystal salt was formed that is also known as the Himalayan salt or Himalayan pink salt.
The researchers have discovered that this salt is naturally packed with mineral-dense properties and because of its minerals and the bio-compounds, it has the strength to offer a number of health benefits and it can be used as a natural remedy for many health problems. This salt is good because this is not cut into pieces by using lesser compounds and it never goes through any kind of chemical process. Keeping the entire mineral and bio-compounds intact, this salt has the power to get you a healthy life and environment.
Health, Medical, and Environmental Benefits:
There are various health benefits of using the Himalayan salt. This salt can control the level of the water within the human body and can regulate them for the proper functioning.

The Himalayan salt is also great for the environment as it has the capabilities to emit negative ions in the air that can purify the air from the impurities and the other pollutants that cause the health issues and environmental pollution.

When salt is heated in certain environments under certain conditions, then can produce the negative ions in the air. When companies carve Himalayan salt into the unique and attractive salt lamps, then they place a light source (a bulb) in inside space of the carved lamp. That light lamp produces light through the electricity when we plug it into the electric switch. When you place your salt lamp in your bedroom (these salt lamps are intended to use only in indoor environments), then they will purify the indoor air with the help of the negative ions.
