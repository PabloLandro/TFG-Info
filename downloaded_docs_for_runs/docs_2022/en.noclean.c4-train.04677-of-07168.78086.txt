The jury's still out on whether wifi routers emit harmful radiation, but according to a Treehugger report, some teachers and parents in Ontario, Canada are blaming wifi as the cause of illness and seeking to ban it from schools.
From Treehugger:
Daniel Krewski, director of the McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment at the University of Ottawa, would probably disagree with the teachers. He is quoted in the Globe and Mail: "Based on literally thousands of papers that have been written on health of radio-frequency fields, we have no clear evidence the fields cause adverse human health effects."
Schools are considering the ban because of complaints from students of "memory loss, skin rashes, hyperactivity, night sweats and insomnia" since the schools began using wifi, according to the local newspaper The Star.
Treehugger punctuated its report with illustrations from cartoonist Wellington Grey. We agree with his sentiments.
