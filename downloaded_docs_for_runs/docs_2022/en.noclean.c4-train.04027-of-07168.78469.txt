TC lets the vaper specify the maximum temperature allowed before temp protection (i.e., instant voltage limitation) activates. The range is typically from 100-300° Celsius, or 300-600° Fahrenheit. As much power is applied as necessary to maintain the set temperature, but no more.

“If I had a pack of cigarettes in my room as a kid, that would have been discovered, here we’re dealing with, first of all, what’s a Juul?” said Michael McAlister, the principal at Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, Calif. The school has about 1,600 students, but parent education nights on the issue have turned out only about 70 people. Yet, out of 53 suspensions last year, 40 were for vaping devices.

“I’m afraid that we’re going to be hooking a new generation of kids on nicotine, with potentially unknown risks,” said Dr. Mark L. Rubinstein, the lead author of the study and a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. “With cigarettes, we’ve been studying them for many years, we have a pretty good idea of what the risks are. We just don’t know what the risks of inhaling all these flavorings and dyes are, and what we do know is already pretty scary.”

Concentrate vape pens allow the user to vape certain types of oils that offer a discreet style of vaping your concentrates while the user is out and about. Most of these concentrate vape pens are pen-shaped, but some are more flat and narrow allowing for even more portability. Other types are a mod-style which are more powerful, giving the user plenty of clouds and a pleasant flavor experience. Concentrate vape pens pride themselves on their sleek designs with the power of a rig in your pocket.

“We saw the same thing from Philip Morris with the We Card program, and the evaluation was that those things don’t work,” Jennifer Kovarik, who runs tobacco prevention programs for Boulder County, Colo., said of the company’s efforts to keep their products away from teenagers. “If they didn’t want youth to use it, it would be sold in 18-and-over-only establishments. It’s available at Circle K’s across the country.”
You also get a free 30ml high-VG e-liquid bottle to make your experience even better. Replaceable coils are top-quality and offered at a low price. Fantastic long-term value. The device isn’t as compact as V2’s Series 3x but is still an excellent choice for people looking for a sturdy sub-ohm e-liquid vape pen.
While convection vaporizers heat materials with hot air that’s blown through the heating chamber, conduction vape pens directly heat the material on the surface of the heating element. Users who value vapor purity over all else should find a portable vaporizer with convection heating, or a desktop vaporizer. Vaporizer pens are better suited for decent hits on-the-fly. That said, vape pen vapor is much purer than the smoke produced by water pipes, joints, and pipes.
If by kbox mini you are referring to the Kanger Subox, then yes I would say it is a decent little box mod that will fire up to 50W! Also check out the Innokin Disrupter as that is also a good 50W box. Need to add that one to this list!

Vape pens offer a discreet vaping experience. Ever feel uncomfortable vaping in public? Vaporizer pens ease that pain point by allowing you to vape without drawing attention to your habit. The vape pen is shaped like an office pen, slender and sleek. In fact, vape pens look more like ecigarettes than portable vapes, giving them an incognito quality. Unlike portable vapes, which aren’t pen-shaped, the vapor pen won’t burden your pocket, and can be concealed almost completely in your hand.

Eliquid Vape Pen – E-liquid vape pens vaporize a liquid solution containing concentrates from dry herb. Eliquid can contain nicotine, cannabis, or neither–and at varying potency. This is why e-liquid vaporizer pens are helpful in quitting smoking. Smokers may use an ejuice vape pen to wean themselves off nicotine addiction by gradually reducing the nicotine potency of their eliquid cartridges. Major eliquid vape pen brands include Atmos and Vaporite. A vapor pen for eliquid is easier to operate than other ejuice vapes like mods.
Triple-coil atomizers are for cloud chasing e-liquid typically, but are also used for concentrate vape pens. They are rare as their low resistance typically yields a further reduction in battery life before a vape pen needs to be charged again.

One important thing that many vapers, and especially beginners, don’t pay attention to is the airflow. The amount of airflow has a significant impact on the overall vaping experience of any pen. For a mouth-to-lung pen, you’ll want a pen that has a tight draw; and for more vapor but slightly less flavor, a pen with a lot of airflow is better.

While it is theoretically possible to water, or even alcohol, in a vape pen, it’s not recommended. Water quickly reaches its boiling point inside a powered up tank, and getting hit in the face by scalding hot droplets is incredibly dangerous. In addition to that, even the best vape pens can’t function properly when filled with water; their atomizers will quickly burn out, producing a sickening burnt taste, and will then need to be replaced.
SUB-OHM: Some devices might come with sub-ohm resistance coils. Extra safety precautions should be practiced when using a sub ohm device.
