Methanol
Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol among others, is a chemical with the formula CH3OH (a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, often abbreviated MeOH). Methanol acquired the name wood alcohol because it was once produced chiefly by the destructive distillation of wood. Today, methanol is mainly produced industrially by hydrogenation of carbon monoxide.Methanol is the simplest alcohol, consisting of a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group. It is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor similar to that of ethanol (drinking alcohol). Wikipedia

This entry is signed with plus (+). The plus (+) sign fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and packing group for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the definition of that class, packing group or any other hazard class definition. When the plus sign is assigned, it means that the material is known to pose a risk to humans. When a plus sign is assigned to mixtures or solutions containing a material where the hazard to humans is significantly different from that of the pure material or where no hazard to humans is posed, the material may be described using an alternative shipping name that represents the hazards posed by the material. An appropriate alternate proper shipping name and hazard class may be authorized by the Associate Administrator.
This entry is signed with "I". The letter "I" identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for describing materials in international transportation. An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when only domestic transportation is involved.
(7) Special Provisions (§172.102)
×Note:
Special provisions may be very complex. The extracts are taken from 49 CFR §172.102. Please be careful with the information, as necessary, additional conditions may be applied that are not written here. Please check the original source and report bugs.
IB2
Authorized IBCs: Metal (31A, 31B and 31N); Rigid plastics (31H1 and 31H2); Composite (31HZ1).
Additional Requirement: Only liquids with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 110 kPa at 50 [deg]C (1.1 bar at 122 [deg]F), or 130 kPa at 55 [deg]C (1.3 bar at 131 [deg]F) are authorized.

a. The maximum degree of filling must not exceed the degree of filling determined by the following:
Where:
tr is the maximum mean bulk temperature during transport,
tf is the temperature in degrees celsius of the liquid during filling, and α is the mean coefficient of cubical expansion of the liquid between the mean temperature of the liquid during filling (tf) and the maximum mean bulk temperature during transportation (tr) both in degrees celsius.
b. For liquids transported under ambient conditions α may be calculated using the formula:
Where:
d15 and d50 are the densities (in units of mass per unit volume) of the liquid at 15 °C (59 °F) and 50 °C (122 °F), respectively.

This entry is signed with "D". The letter "D" identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for describing materials for domestic transportation but may be inappropriate for international transportation under the provisions of international regulations (e.g., IMO, ICAO). An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when either domestic or international transportation is involved.
