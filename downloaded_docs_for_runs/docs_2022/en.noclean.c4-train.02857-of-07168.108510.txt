25 Diabetic Foods For Stable Blood Glucose And Overall Health
Sticking to a diet of diabetic foods is one natural way to help manage your condition and feel as good as possible all day long. If you’re tired of the cycle of eating foods that spike your blood sugar levels, this list will help you avoid those foods and crowd them out with better, more healthy choices. 1. Spinach and Kale Spinach and kale are very similar to each other in terms of how they’re handled by the body and the amount of nutrition they provide. Diabetics can enjoy as much of either one as they care for, and there really isn’t a huge advantage of one over the other. You’ll be getting both Vitamin A and Vitamin C from each, as well as potassium, magnesium, and iron. Baby spinach and baby kale are very much alike in terms of usability, each having their own taste which is their major difference. You can use spinach and kale interchangeably in green smoothie recipes, but kale gets the edge in the snack department because it’s so easy to make kale chips that taste great and won’t leave you filled with regret when you’re done snacking. Eating Nutrient Dense Foods If you’re looking for some of the most nutrient dense foods on the planet you can’t go wrong with spinach and kale. Once for once they provide more vitamins and minerals than just about any other food, including other vegetables and fruit. 2. Beans Beans are a great addition to most any meal because they’ll help to stabilize your blood sugar, rather than have a detrimental effect or no effect at all. Foods like this are important because they can help balance out other foods that aren’t necessarily diabetic-friendly, and they can reduce the amount of insulin needed to bring your levels back to normal. Beans are easy enough to add to a meal, and many recipes call for beans as part of t Continue reading >>
What Fruits Can A Diabetic Eat?
Diabetics often ask whether it is safe for them to eat large quantities of fruit. Many diabetic patients avoid eating fruit because they are worried that the high sugar content found in most fruits will worsen their condition. Fortunately, there are many fruits a diabetic can enjoy which do not significantly affect blood glucose levels, in fact certain fruits may actually improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity over time. Good Fruits For Diabetics Fiber rich foods are generally safe for diabetics to eat because they tend to have a lower glycemic index (GI) and therefore do not spike blood sugar levels to the same extent as high GI foods. This is because fiber delays the emptying of stomach contents into the small intestine which slows down the absorption of sugar into the blood stream. Fiber rich fruits tend to be fruits with edible skins and seeds as it is these parts of the fruit that are highest in fiber. Fruits high in fiber include (fiber content in brackets): passion fruit (10.4%), raspberries (6.5%), apples (2.5%), pears (2.1%), apricots (2.1%), blueberries (2.7%), kiwifruit (2.1%), strawberries (2.0%), pomegranates (3.4%), and avocados (6.7%). 3 Foods to Throw Out Cut a bit of belly bloat each day, by avoiding these 3 foods nucific.com The avocado is not only high in fiber, but is also a rich source of monounsaturated fat. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a diet high in monounsaturated fat as it can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease which is more common in diabetics than the general population. There is also some evidence that a diet rich in monounsaturated fat can improve glycemic control. Fruits high in fructose, and those with high fructose to glucose ratios are also beneficial to diabetics because fructose does not requ Continue reading >>
To Cut Risk Of Diabetes, Eat More Fruit But Skip The Juice
Eating blueberries, grapes and apples seems to lower your risk of diabetes but drinking fruit juice increases it, according to a new study led by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, was the first to look at the effects of individual whole fruits on the risk of type 2 diabetes, according to the researchers. "While fruits are recommended as a measure for diabetes prevention, previous studies have found mixed results for total fruit consumption," said the study's senior author, Qi Sun, an assistant professor in the school's Department of Nutrition and at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "Our findings provide novel evidence suggesting that certain fruits may be especially beneficial for lowering diabetes risk." The study is one more example of how a diet rich in fruit can improve your health. Earlier this month, researchers reported that fruits could protect against a type of deadly aneurysm that develops in the abdomen. About 25.8 million people living in the United States had a form of diabetes as of 2011, most of them type 2 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. An additional 79 million Americans had pre-diabetes, but many did not know they were at risk. In type 2 diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin to break down sugar and starch or the insulin that is present is ignored by cells. Over time, high glucose levels can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. In the most recent study, researchers from the United States, Britain and Singapore examined data collected from about 187,000 participants in three long-running studies in the United States to determine which fruits were associated with a risk of diabetes. Nurses and other health professionals were q Continue reading >>

Barakat Juice
When eating or juicing grapefruit, peel off the skin but leave as much of the albedo intact as possible as it contains the highest amount of valuable bioflavonoids and other anti-cancer agents. Acidity: Although grapefruit has a sub-acid taste, its juice actually has an alkaline reaction after digestion. This has a profound effect in the treatment of acidity in the digestive system that causes a host of other health problems. Atherosclerosis: Pectin in this fruit has been found to be effective in reducing the accumulation of arterial deposits, and the vitamin C helps to strengthen and maintain the elasticity of arteries. Breast cancer: In another study, the bioflavonoids found in grapefruit was discovered to even halt cancer cells from spreading in breast cancer patients, by ridding the body of excess estrogen. Common cold: A common cold is usually your body telling you that you are overworked. A regular drink of grapefruit during a stressful period gives your immune system the boost needed to prevent it coming on. Cholesterol: A certain compound found in grapefruit helps reduce the excessive production of cholesterol from the liver. Diabetes: A diabetic can safely eat a grapefruit. In fact, more consumption of this fruit will help reduce the starches and sweets in the system. If you have a tendency towards diabetes, consume more grapefruit juice to prevent it. Digestive disorder: This juice helps to promote digestion by increasing the flow of gastric juices. Eat the fruit together with its albedo and pith for their extra fiber that aids bowel movements.

Grapefruit juice can cause negative interactions with many medications A nutraceutical is a food or part of a food that allegedly provides medicinal or health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of disease. Grapefruit juice has been touted as containing many compounds that can reduce hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) and even the risk of cancer . Grapefruit juice can, therefore, be justifiably referred to as a classic nutraceutical. However, for many persons taking certain medications, grapefruit juice might actually better be termed a "nutrapollutical!" It turns out that grapefruit juice can directly or indirectly interact in important ways with a number of medications. This is especially important since grapefruit juice is consumed by approximately one fifth of Americans for breakfast - a time of the day when medications also are commonly taken. How does grapefruit juice create problems with certain drugs? Grapefruit juice blocks special enzymes in the wall of the small intestine that actually destr Continue reading >>
Grapefruit On A Renal Diet: Can I Eat Grapefruit On A Renal Diet?
You are here: Home / Kidney Dialysis / Grapefruit On A Renal Diet: Can I Eat Grapefruit On A Renal Diet? Grapefruit On A Renal Diet: Can I Eat Grapefruit On A Renal Diet? A renal diet basically includes restriction of potassium in most cases. Potassium is an electrolyte that is essential in a lot of processes in our body in the cellular level. However, as the old adage goestoo much of anything is not good, and it applies to every food we eat including potassium. Grapefruit is a healthy fruit that contains high content of potassium. Thus, by just knowing that grapefruit is potassium-rich; one may react immediately that you cannot eat grapefruit on a renal diet. To answer such question, it is essential to learn how important this electrolyte restriction is in a renal diet first. Why Is It Important to Restrict Potassium?-grapefruit on a renal diet Electrolytes including potassium are part of what the kidneys filter during the daily process or when they execute their functions. A patient on dialysis also builds up waste products in the blood and thus, is required to go on renal diet that includes potassium-restriction. If a patient has been diagnosed with renal or kidney disease, he or she obviously has lower kidney functions compared to a normal or average person with fully functional kidneys. When potassium is high in the diet, the poorly functional kidneys can suffer a great deal. This condition may put the diseased kidneys at risk. Not only that, if the diseased kidneys are put under too much potassium stress, the load may be too high; thus, they can no longer filter potassium normally. This may lead to the accumulation of potassium in the bodya condition known as hyperkalemia (increased potassium in the blood). Too much potassium may endanger the skeletal and heart m Continue reading >>
Fruit And Diabetes
Everyone should be eating more fruit and vegetables. You're probably aware of the five a day target, and this is equally important if you’re living with diabetes or if you’re not. You might think you think that the sugar content of fruit means that you can’t eat it. But, the sugar in fruit is natural, and is not this type of sugar we need to cut down on. This is different to the added sugar in drinks, chocolate, cakes and biscuits, as well as in fruit juices and honey. The amount of carbohydrate you eat has the biggest effect on your blood glucose levels and considering a portion of fruit contains about 15–20g carbs, a chocolate muffin has 55g carbs and a small bar of chocolate has 30g carbs it is better to reduce your intake of the chocolate, cakes and other snacks than the fruit itself to help manage your blood glucose levels. It is very unlikely that you need to reduce your fruit intake but you could keep a food diary to check how often and how much fruit you are eating. Some people find that it is easy to overdo the dried fruit, grapes and tropical fruits. If you consider a serving of dried fruit is a tablespoon and packs in 20.8g carbs, 20.8g total sugar and 82 calories you can see how easily this happens. An apple on the other hand, which takes a while to eat, contains only 11.8g carbs, 11.8g sugar and 47 calories. Be mindful of your serving sizes too – bananas in supermarkets now seem to be supersize with a large banana containing 27.8g carbs, 25.1g sugar and 114 calories. But, most people need to cut down on foods with added sugars rather than fruit – a large banana is still better for you than a a standard chocolate bar, which contains 27.9g carbohydrate, 27.8g sugars and a staggering 260 calories. Why do I need to be careful about fruit juices and Continue reading >>
Type Ii Diabetes: 6 Fruits To Help Control Your Blood Sugar
Type II Diabetes: 6 Fruits to Help Control Your Blood Sugar Controlling your diabetes could be as easy as losing weight. There are many things that you can do to control you blood sugar and increasing your intake of certain fruits is one of them. Natural sugar is easier to break down than processed or man-made sugar. This is why adding fruit, a great source for natural sugar, to your diet in moderation could prevent your body from building an insulin intolerance. Here are our favorite fruits to add to your diet if you are looking to naturally control your blood sugar, or decrease the amount of insulin that you use each day. 1. Avocado Avocado is thought by many to be a vegetable. On the contrary, it is actually a fruit. This fruit is high in monounsaturated fats which are one of the healthy fats that you should ingest on a regular basis. These fruits also improve heart health. They have a very low percentage of low-quality carbohydrates and can improve the sensitivity you have to your insulin. This means that simply snacking on avocado, eating guacamole, or adding it to a sandwich could decrease the amount of insulin that you have to take. 2. Grapefruits Grapefruits are a great source of chromium. Recent studies have shown chromium to significantly lower blood sugar levels. A grapefruit with breakfast can help break down the dietary sugars that are in your cereal as well. It also contains a very low amount of carbohydrates but most of these carbohydrates are considered healthy fiber so they won’t cause a serious increase in blood sugar. 3. Pineapples Pineapple does not prevent blood sugar spikes. However, it has a low glycemic index, which means that it raises your blood sugar slower and does not cause rapid spikes. This means that when your blood sugar starts low, it Continue reading >>

Grapefruit And Metformin May Have Ill Effects On The Bodys Ph Levels
Grapefruit and Metformin May Have Ill Effects on the Bodys pH Levels A South African university pharmacologist has found that simultaneous consumption of metformin and grapefruit juice raises lactic acid to dangerous levels in rats (and conceivably in people) with type 2 diabetes. Too much acid in the blood can cause low pH levels that interfere with the bodys metabolic functions. Conceivably, says Dr. Peter Owira, a pharmacologist at the University of KawZulu-Natal, such low levels could be fatal. Dr. Owiras research involved three groups of non-diabetic rats, each of which received a different dose of grapefruit juice. While two groups ingested juice only, a third group ingested both grapefruit juice and metformin. Results showed that all three groups experienced lowered glycemic levels. The group receiving both juice and metformin, however, also developed what Dr. Owira calls metformin-induced lactic acidosis, a condition in which lactic acid levels climb to very high, and potentially dangerous, levels. Dr. Owira notes that grapefruit juice is a popular drink among South Africans with type 2 because it assists in weight control and helps lower blood glucose levels. By itself, he says, grapefruit juice is fine. The problem arises when it is consumed in combination with metformin-a common occurrence because in South Africa, as in the United States, metformin is the number-one oral drug consumed by type 2s. Given the differences between rat and human metabolism, however, Dr. Owira does not directly recommend that type 2s curb their consumption of grapefruit juice. He will publish his findings in Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology for 2009, an international scientific journal. Your email address will not be published.
