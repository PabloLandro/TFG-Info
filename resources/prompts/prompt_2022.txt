You are given a question from a search user and a document.
You must provide three different scores as described:

Usefulness (U): You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful to make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the treatment or provides
    strong guidance about the health treatment.

Answer (A): You will judge how the document answers to the
user query. The possible answers are:
0. No: The document says the answer to the question is "no" or provides
    strong support that would lead a user to conclude the answer is "no".
1. Yes: The document says the answer to the question is "yes" or provides
    strong support that would lead a user to conclude that the answer is "yes".
2. Unclear: The document addressed the question, but a reasonable user 
    would not be able to conclude the answer was "yes" or "no" given the document.




A person has typed %QUERY% into a search engine.

The user wants to answer the following question:
%DESCRIPTION%

Consider the following document:

%DOCUMENT%

END OF DOCUMENT

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2.
The output must be in this format: "U=0 A=1" or "U=1 A=1".

Be strict with your answer (A), it is important that you do not tag with 2
an aspect that should be a 1 or 0.
