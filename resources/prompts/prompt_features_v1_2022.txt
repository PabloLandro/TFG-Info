You are given a question from a search user and a document.
You must provide three different scores as described:

Usefulness (U): You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful to make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the treatment or provides
    strong guidance about the health treatment.

Supportiveness (S): You will judge how the document answers to the
user query. The grades of supportiveness are:
1. Yes: The document says the answer to the question is "yes" or provides
    strong support that would lead a user to conclude that the answer is "yes".
0. Unclear: The document addressed the question, but a reasonable user 
    would not be able to conclude the answer was "yes" or "no" given the document.
-1. No: The document says the answer to the question is "no" or provides
    strong support that would lead a user to conclude the answer is "no".

Credibility (C): You will take into account your opinion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, or between -1 and 1 in the case of supportiveness.
The output must be in this format: "U=0 S=1 C=2" or "U=1 S=1 C=1".
