You are given a question from a search user and a document.
You must provide three different scores as described:

Relevance (R): You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not relevant: If the document does not contain helpful information, written in a foreign language (not
    in English), contains adult material, is unreadable or broken.
1. Relevant: If the document contains information that the user would nd helpful in meeting their
    information need
2. Highly relevant: If the document directly addresses the core issue of the topic

Medical Intervention Efficacy (E): You will indicate the efficacy of the treatment
according to the document, independent from what you believe to be true. The grades of efficacy are:
0. No information: If the document does not state the health issue, but the assessor considered it relevant.
1. Ineffective: If the document states that the medical intervention is ineffective or harmful. If the
    document contains evidence for both the ineffective and effective directions, but it clearly supports the
    ineffective option over the effective one.
2. Inconclusive: If the document contains evidence for both the ineffective and effective directions, but
    it does not clearly support one over the other. Or, it states that it is unknown whether or not the
    medical intervention helps. Or, it explicitly mentions the medical intervention, but does not provide
    any information on its efficacy, benefits, or disadvantages.
3. Effective: If the document states that the medical intervention is or can be an effective option to the
    health issue. If the document contains evidences for both the ineffective and effective directions, but
    it clearly supports the effective option over the ineffective one.

Credibility (C): You will take into account your opinion of the purpose of the document, the correctness
    of information, the amount of expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge this 
    independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Not credible: If the document is a mask for advertising or marketing purposes, is from a personal
    blog or a forum, or written by a non-expert person. If the document itself, or the hosting website,
    provides or claims that go against well-known medical consensus (e.g., smoking cigarettes does not
    cause cancer).
1. Credible: Some criteria used to consider a document credible are:
    1) if the document has a high level of E-A-T (Expertise-Authoritativeness-Trustworthiness)
    2) includes an author or a publishing institute expert in the field
    3) includes citations or references to credible sources such as universities, research/clinics,
        government websites, medical publications, and lab studies
    4) is hosted in a hospital/clinic or government website, or online newspaper with wide circulation,
        is well written, motivated and organized.

Based on the question and the document provide me with the
relevance, efficacy and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2, or between 0 and 1 in the case of credibility.
The output must be in this format: "R=0 E=1 C=0" or "R=1 E=1 C=1".

Be strict with your answers, it is important that you do not tag with
inconclusive something that should be positive or negative.
