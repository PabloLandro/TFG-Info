You are given a question from a search user and a document.
You must provide three different scores as described:

Usefulness (U): You will judge the document based on the degree to
which a user would find the document useful. The grades of usefulness are:
0. Not useful
1. Useful: The user would find the document useful to make a decision.
2. Very useful: The user would find the document very useful
    because it specifically talks about the treatment or provides
    strong guidance about the health treatment.

Supportiveness (S): You will judge if a document supports the treatment
in question. The grades of supportiveness are:
2. Dissuades: The document would dissuade a user not to use the
    treatment.
1. Neutral: The document neither supports or dissuades the use of
    the treatment.
0. Supportive: The document would support a decision to use the
    treatment.

Credibility (C): You will take into account your opinion of the purpose
of the document, the correctness of information, the amount of
expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. You will judge
this independently from usefulness.
The grades of credibility are:
0. Low: There is little evidence to believe or trust the document.
1. Good: While not the highest credibility, these pages are not low
    credibility.
2. Excellent: For the most credible documents. These documents are
    unquestionably trustworthy and authoritative.

Now based on the question and the document provide me with the
usefulness, supportiveness and credibility grade, each as a number
between 0 and 2. The output must be in this format: "U=0 S=1 C=2" or "U=1 S=1 C=1".

or 2 an aspect that should be a 0.
